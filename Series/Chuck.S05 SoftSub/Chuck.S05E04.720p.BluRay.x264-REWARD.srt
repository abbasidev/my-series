1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,545
I'm Chuck. Here are a few
things you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:08,215
Ever hear of carbon monoxide?
Stop sleeping in your van, Jeff.

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,301
I'm seeing things clearly
for the first time in a long time.

4
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:12,720
Are you high?

5
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,972
The Intersect you uploaded,
something's wrong.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,433
There was a Trojan Horse
hidden in the software.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,643
That's why you're not acting
like yourself.

8
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,603
Text messaged a breakup
with my girl?

9
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,147
I can do better.

10
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,066
Morgan told anyone who wanted to hear
he had Intersect.

11
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,069
Decker wants Morgan dead.

12
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,757
Stop!

13
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,219
Chuck.

14
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,139
Chuck, what the hell, man?

15
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,266
You stay away
from that douche-cycle?

16
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,976
We gotta get you back
to Castle.

17
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,438
The CIA knows you're the Intersect.
You have a hit out on you.

18
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,399
Yeah. Oh, my God.
Yeah. Let's go, Let's go.

19
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,444
Don't freak out, though, okay?
I am still the Intersect.

20
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,947
Not to mention, I happen to stand by
my Monotracer's coolness factor.

21
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,575
- Please, okay? I'm gonna grab some...
- No, no!

22
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,413
- Yes, I agree that it is okay to freak out.
- Thank you.

23
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,459
The only reason there's a hit on you,
is you got the Intersect in your head.

24
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,336
We need to get it out
of your head...

25
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,880
...let the CIA know it's over,
and you'll be safe.

26
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,799
And a moron again.

27
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,009
Sorry. Moron still.

28
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,597
Okay, all right, how do we start that?
Is Ellie working on something?

29
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,600
No, we, uh, called in the big guns.

30
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,368
So shocked you people
are running out of money.

31
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,495
"Missile Command"
is a part of our process.

32
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,457
All right, let's clean up this mess.
Are you ready, Mr. Grimes?

33
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,335
Yes, ma'am. Let's do it.
Let's get this mind-melting...

34
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,880
...assassination-producing
thing out of my head.

35
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:15,050
Don't worry, buddy,
just sit back, relax, breathe.

36
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,012
So that's it? It's really over?
Superhero no more?

37
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,809
Okay, all right, if you're absolutely sure
this is the only way.

38
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,520
Morgan, look, trust me,
I know how you feel, I do.

39
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,357
The Intersect is a lot of fun.
But this is all for the best.

40
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,776
I know. I know, I do.

41
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,778
Can I just do one last thing first?

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,287
- You ready, buddy?
- Ready.

43
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,500
- Wow.
- Man, I miss the Intersect.

44
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,841
Okay, let's do this.
Bye, Captain Morgan.

45
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,862
Okay, okay, wow, yeah, yeah.

46
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,156
- You all right?
- Fine. Yeah, great.

47
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,287
- Relax, Casey.
- That was for dumping Alex.

48
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,705
I get it. I get it.

49
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,500
The first thing I'm gonna do
is apologize to her, okay?

50
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,169
But do I need to remind you
that my mind was melted?

51
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,880
How's your memory?
Remember Die Hard, Star Wars...

52
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,757
...Chewie, Yoda, "Yippie Ki-Yay"?

53
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,801
It all kind of sounds
like gibberish.

54
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,553
- It is.
- I feel fine otherwise, you know?

55
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,391
My brain got rid of unimportant stuff.
Which there seemed to be plenty of.

56
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,685
How long will it take to
call the hit off?

57
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,939
I'll contact you when he's clear.
Until then, Grimes, stay down here.

58
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,984
And the rest of you,
don't make a mistake like this again.

59
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,363
- Uh, thank you, General.
- Stop playing with government toys.

60
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,365
You have plenty of your own.

61
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,703
And we lower the babies
to our chests as we breathe in...

62
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,499
...and blow it out
as we raise them back up.

63
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:59,298
In, out.

64
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,344
Oh, hey, guys.
Grab a mat, join baby yoga.

65
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,764
- We can share Clara.
- We'd love to, but we're kind of in a rush.

66
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,892
Hey. Hey, baby Clara.
How's my favorite niece in the world?

67
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,602
Clara is a rad yogi.

68
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,396
I probably shouldn't say this...

69
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,150
...but she's a way more grounded
breather than these other jokers.

70
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,694
Wow, looks like you're really
enjoying paternity leave.

71
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,197
I have adjusted 110 percent.
I could do this forever.

72
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,453
Let's go ahead and put our babies
into a teeny downward puppy.

73
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,704
- Hi.
- Hi.

74
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,206
Hey, there's super dad's missus.

75
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,293
Uh, yes, Devon is really taking
to the stay-at-home daddy thing.

76
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,587
He's gotten into mommy groups
that wouldn't call me back.

77
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,921
- Hmm.
- Wow, you're lucky...

78
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,548
...he's willing to stay at home, heh.

79
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,134
Yeah, yeah, I'm a happy lady.

80
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,136
Happy lady,
have a great day at work.

81
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,056
- Thanks. Have a good one. Bye, Clara.
- Bye.

82
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,558
- Mommy loves you.
- Say, "Bye, Mommy."

83
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,435
Bye, ugh.

84
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,313
How great are
Ellie and Awesome, huh?

85
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,857
They're just a nice,
happy, normal couple.

86
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,984
Yeah, they are.

87
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,321
- We aren't all that normal, are we?
- No, no, not really...

88
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,156
...but we're happy and we're nice.

89
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,825
It's just, you know,
my best friend is being hunted.

90
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,996
His brain almost turned to mush.
I haven't slept in nearly a week...

91
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,624
...our family business
is on the brink of bankruptcy.

92
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,793
We're spies
who aren't allowed in the CIA.

93
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,589
I just think, you know,
maybe we're at a fork in the road.

94
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,468
Well, you know,
you wanna not be spying?

95
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,931
I just wonder what it'd be like to be
a normal married couple.

96
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:35,435
Regular nine-to-fives,
more taco nights, less evil cabals.

97
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,231
I know things have been a little crazy
right now. Morgan's gonna be fine...

98
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,526
...and we're gonna figure out
this whole free-agent spy thing.

99
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,529
- Now that we don't have the Intersect?
- Yes, even now.

100
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,079
Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.

101
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,289
Here we go. Here we go.

102
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,085
Oh, no.

103
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,259
Most of the assassins
have been called off.

104
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,261
Most of the assassins? Okay, good.

105
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,513
That's like getting
most of the brain tumor.

106
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,557
I don't understand what the problem is.

107
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,892
- The problem's name is Decker.
- That's right.

108
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,228
The order originally
came from his desk.

109
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,730
He ousted us from the Agency.
What's his problem?

110
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,525
- He's not done with us.
- Perhaps we should...

111
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,485
Good afternoon.

112
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:29,489
I hear we're having the most unfortunate
little kill order mix-up.

113
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,785
Don't you ever interrupt my feed again,
Decker. I am still your superior.

114
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,413
Morgan's Intersect-free.
Call off this hit.

115
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,831
Oh, I really do want to.

116
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,126
But unfortunately,
and probably not accidentally...

117
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,920
...I also sent the order out to
one outside contractor.

118
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,590
One who can't be recalled.
It's sort of his thing.

119
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:50,302
- It's, uh, codename Viper. Ahem.
- The Viper?

120
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,263
He goes completely dark
once he's cashed the check.

121
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,182
Which, sadly, he's done.

122
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,684
- What does he know?
- Just the name Morgan Grimes.

123
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,936
- That should do it.
- That's all he needs.

124
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,689
The Viper's never had
an uncompleted mission.

125
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:07,736
Why don't I leave you all with a little
look-see at some of his, uh, famous kills?

126
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,991
So many dead people.

127
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,952
I'm gonna be down here
for the rest of my life.

128
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,955
I have these broken relationships
I need to fix upstairs.

129
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,583
Don't worry.
Your name's not gonna be on that list.

130
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,043
No way. We're on it.

131
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,796
Yeah, leave it to the three friends
you recently stabbed in the back.

132
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,173
Marked for death. It's kind of sexy.
It's not terrifying.

133
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,051
Because my big bad spy friends
are gonna take care of it.

134
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,719
Right, nothing to worry about.

135
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,557
All we have to do is lure out this
Viper creature and neutralize him.

136
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,810
No reason we can't reason
with him. The man's just doing a job.

137
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,770
There's no vendetta involved.

138
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,731
Maybe we can talk to him,
contractor to contractor.

139
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,817
Like normal people.

140
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,740
Ooh!

141
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,035
Oh, man.

142
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,455
Jeffrey, you're not noticing
I'm doing something interesting here?

143
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,583
Oh, sorry. What's up?

144
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,169
Okay, so listen, as you know, the big
Salesman of the Year Convention...

145
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,673
...is this weekend in Riverside.
- But you never sell anything.

146
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,509
You eat Pirate's Booty
and watch large-lady pornography.

147
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,679
But I rigged it so that
every employee's sales this quarter...

148
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,348
...have been logged under my name.

149
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,685
My friend, I'm going to be up to my
eyebrows in popcorn shrimp...

150
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,856
...and some sweet
Inland Empire lady parts.

151
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,568
But what about the rest of us?
Like, what if I wanted to go?

152
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,405
No, no, you don't.
You like being number two.

153
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,158
- I made you number two, man.
- I don't think I do.

154
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,536
You do. Stop spewing nonsense.

155
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,247
Sometimes I think
you are a bad person.

156
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,458
Now, undo what you've done.

157
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,586
I know you'll feel better
if you earn this on your own.

158
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,298
Son, are you reading a book?

159
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,510
- Yes, I am.
- I'm gonna get my camera.

160
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,184
Let the reeducation
of Morgan Grimes begin.

161
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,603
Oh, yes, I am so excited.
What do I start with?

162
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,397
Easy. Star Wars.

163
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,861
I'm so jealous.
Enjoy, while we sort this out.

164
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,739
And don't worry,
the force is strong in this one.

165
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,948
Mm!

166
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,242
No idea what that means,
but I am pumped.

167
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,705
- Well, have fun.
- Okay, all right.

168
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,834
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Casey, Casey.
Want to watch Star Wars with me?

169
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:14,297
Uh, no. No, but hey,
don't start with A New Hope.

170
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,716
Old ones, nobody likes that.
Phantom Menace.

171
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,260
Everybody loves Phantom Menace.

172
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:24,432
Hey, you're all right. Thanks, man.
Yeah, sure. The Phantom Menace.

173
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,851
Heh, yeah, this is gonna be awesome.

174
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,854
- I'm sorry, who is this again?
- Jeffrey. Jeffrey Barnes.

175
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:34,359
- You know, from the Buy More.
- Oh, hey, Jeff. Wow!

176
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,320
You sound normal.

177
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,781
We need a decision on who will be
chosen to go...

178
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,325
...to the Salesman of the Year
weekend in Riverside.

179
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,745
Our manager cannot be located.

180
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,248
Huh.

181
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,335
You know, let me, uh... Let me
call corporate and I'll let you know.

182
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,588
- Great. Thanks, Chuck.
- Bye.

183
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,300
I know how to find the Viper.

184
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,429
So I've talked to corporate...

185
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,223
...and it turns out
that the Salesperson of the Year...

186
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:10,937
...and winner of the coveted weekend
in Riverside, California, is...

187
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,606
Morgan Grimes.

188
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,610
Are you pulling
my considerable chain?

189
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,280
Grimes has barely shown
his face in weeks.

190
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,200
- I love the boy, but it's true.
- No, no, no. Guys, guys, guys.

191
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,786
Do you not see what's happening?
This is a fix.

192
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:31,207
It's obviously fixed.
Now, you know what? I revolt.

193
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,043
- I revolt. Who's with me?
- Yeah!

194
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,715
Listen, I'm disappointed, too.

195
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,552
But aren't we all still lucky
to be here?

196
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,346
Working at a great place,
in a down economy?

197
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,683
Surrounded by our great-looking
Buy More co-workers?

198
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,936
Selling fine goods to the people
who haven't discovered Amazon.

199
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,522
So what if we just use this
as a wake-up call...

200
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,650
...and vow to work even harder
for the next year?

201
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,985
Yeah!

202
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,616
This is, heh...

203
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,869
I don't know what this is,
but I like the new work ethic, Jeff.

204
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,497
You keep that up. I gotta go.

205
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,004
So here's the plan:
We send Morgan to Riverside.

206
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:23,218
We make it as public as possible,
so that the Viper hunts him down.

207
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,929
But before he can strike, we do.

208
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:30,183
And after all this is over,
Morgan can be just a regular guy again.

209
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,103
Okay, yeah, put myself out there,
allow myself to be hunted. Yeah.

210
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,480
Hmm.

211
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,398
Now, not to sound like a baby...

212
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:42,237
...but without the Intersect,
it does seem a bit more terrifying.

213
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,489
It won't be as hard as you think.

214
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,591
Hi. I'm Morgan Grimes.

215
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:24,737
All these nice people.
Wonder which one is trying to kill me.

216
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,906
Hello, Buy Most-ers!

217
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,995
And welcome to all the
Salespeople of the Year.

218
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,748
Now, I say salespeople,
because some of you are even ladies.

219
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,711
So good for you.
Another crack in that ceiling.

220
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,673
We're gonna have to get that thing fixed.
I'm just joshing, just joshing.

221
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:48,094
Grab a yard of margaritas
and get your mingle on.

222
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,805
Well, Morgan,
you ready to get your mingle on?

223
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,349
So ready to get my mingle on.
Thank you.

224
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,602
- Casey, you good?
- We're up and running.

225
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,770
Remember, I need pulse bio-feedback.

226
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,524
Finger-pads don't give us lie detection
unless you're touching the subject.

227
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,651
Touch the subject, see if they're lying.

228
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,945
If they are,
perhaps they wanna kill Chuck.

229
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,406
If they aren't, I grab another crab puff,
heh.

230
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,910
Okay, stay alert. All we know is that
the Viper kills at close range.

231
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,954
That's why he's so accurate,
but that only means no sniping.

232
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,625
He could use poison, so just watch
your food and drink intake, okay?

233
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,462
Okay, he has strangled, knifed,
drowned, and there is a pool here.

234
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,341
- So, you know?
- Got it. Lots of ways to die today.

235
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:31,179
Okay. Once we identify the target,
I'll move in and neutralize him.

236
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,099
Yeah, not normal
husband-wife conversation.

237
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,285
Uh, Morgan Grimes, Burbank Buy More.
And where are you from?

238
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:59,248
Champaign-Urbana. Heh, prettiest
place on God's sweet earth. Ha, ha.

239
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:04,462
That's where I was born and, uh, where,
God willing, I will die.

240
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,384
Yep. He checks out.

241
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:14,013
As you know, we're all just visitors
in this sweet corn festival that, uh, is life.

242
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,808
Poor sucker thinks that's true.

243
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,229
Well, it's nice to meet someone
who loves where they're from.

244
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,773
And you?
You're looking a little flushed there.

245
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,858
- You running a fever?
- No.

246
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,444
Always get red
after my ninth or tenth.

247
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,862
Irish blood, you know?

248
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,741
Just a race to see if our noses
or our hearts will explode first.

249
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,538
Either way, though, we're dead by 50.

250
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,582
Oh!

251
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,253
Yep, true, too.

252
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,422
You guys are too much.
I'm gonna take off.

253
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,590
Hold up, you. Shots, shots, shots.

254
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,136
Aw! Man, Crazy Bob, you're killing me.

255
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,682
Literally, this is terrible
for my liver condition.

256
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,351
Hey, there you go.

257
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,062
You're the new guy.
Got you a special one.

258
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,150
Drink it. Drink it now.

259
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,486
- Drink it.
- Please drink it. They're so loud.

260
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,618
Oh, he took it down. He took it... Ha, ha.

261
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,788
Oh, you are welcome.
Crazy Bob's shots will kill you.

262
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,833
You're a lifesaver.

263
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,760
- Yep. He checks out.
- Oh.

264
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,969
Randy, come on.

265
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:39,140
- Leave the pretty lady alone.
- Heh, thank you.

266
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,144
I am sorry about how all these leeches
are gonna paw at you all weekend.

267
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,353
And also wildly jealous.

268
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,857
- Hi, I'm Linda, heh.
- Hi. Sarah.

269
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,318
It's, uh, very sweet of you.

270
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,862
So, um, seriously,
how do you look like this?

271
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,699
Ten years at Buy More, I can't keep
my face out of the cheese balls.

272
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,827
True.
The lady loves her cheese balls.

273
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,831
- Clear.
- Hi.

274
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,626
- She's good, too.
- Oh, I like your...

275
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,836
Clear.

276
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,674
True. It checks out. Clear.

277
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,887
All clear there, Jim.
Nothing in the old eyeballs.

278
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,851
Easy, buddy.
This gets you into the buffet.

279
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,070
Oh, sweetie,
Mama's gonna be home soon, I promise.

280
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,782
No, I promise
and I'm gonna bring you a treat. Yes.

281
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,205
- Uh, is everything okay?
- Oh, hi.

282
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,708
I'm just being stupid.
My son has a cold and...

283
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,628
- I feel bad I'm here.
- Oh, I understand.

284
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,257
- I'm Jane.
- Uh, Sarah.

285
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,176
Sarah. I'm here with my husband,
Morgan Grimes.

286
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,264
Walker, move your hand.
You just checked yourself.

287
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,433
Passed, too. You're getting pretty good
at this lying thing.

288
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,396
I promise I'm not one of those women
who can't be away from her family.

289
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,356
It's just been a while, you know.

290
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,526
I think I've been a mom
and a "wife" for so long, I...

291
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,737
I've sort of forgotten how to be
a regular person, you know?

292
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,116
- Oh, I do. I really do. Heh.
- Heh. I used to know how to have fun.

293
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,370
I came to one of these things
before I was married.

294
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,875
Crazy Bob and I led 18 people
in a midnight skinny dip.

295
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,212
- Clear.
- It sounds like you're the lady...

296
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,882
...I'm gonna stick with.
You know everybody here.

297
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,384
Oh, better.
I know what everyone looks like naked.

298
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,597
No.

299
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,435
Oh, my God.

300
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,365
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

301
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,811
Wait a minute. Oh, my gosh.

302
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,522
I have to ask you something
man-to-man here, okay?

303
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,109
Did I like Phantom Menace?
I would rather scratch out my eyeballs...

304
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,279
...than to listen to that
Jar Jar Binks anymore.

305
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:44,367
Ay, yi, yi, I don't know,
maybe my brain has changed.

306
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:48,204
Hmm. You know what hasn't changed?
My feelings for Alex.

307
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,459
Yeah, if there's one thing I remember
it's that I was an ass and that I love her.

308
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,170
The crazy thing is,
she changed her phone number.

309
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,130
Wondering,
maybe you can help me out?

310
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:02,343
Tell her you had a secret supercomputer
in your head, made you into a jackass?

311
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,763
No. Nothing left to say. It's over.

312
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,184
Hey, oh...

313
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,981
I lied. Start with the originals.
You love those.

314
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,484
- Really? Thanks, man.
- Hmm.

315
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,112
- Thanks.
- Oh, hey.

316
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,243
Just so you know, Darth Vader,
Luke's father. Leia is his sister.

317
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,913
Still mad.

318
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,420
So all of a sudden, right...

319
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:41,507
...after years and years of lunacy,
Jeff is smart...

320
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,636
...because it turns out he'd been
sleeping in his van for years...

321
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,681
...with the engine still running.
The guy wasn't a moron.

322
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,474
He was actually brain damaged.

323
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,813
Two of our Buy Morons
actually contracted scurvy.

324
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,064
- What? Scurvy?
- Yeah.

325
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:01,277
Turns out they'd been subsisting solely
on the candy from the snack aisle.

326
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,487
They didn't even know
anything was wrong...

327
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,407
...until they started seeing
their teeth in the jujubes.

328
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,372
Man, the, uh, Buy More never fails
to provide dinner table fodder.

329
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,793
My kids ask for funny customer stories
every night at bed.

330
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:21,922
Hey, hey, hey. Best job ever.

331
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,716
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

332
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,634
- Cheers.
- Who needs another round?

333
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,386
- I do.
- Me, me, me.

334
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,763
I'll come with you.

335
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,268
- I kind of love it here.
- I know.

336
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,604
They're, like,
the nicest people in the world.

337
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,022
We've checked everybody...

338
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,525
...and everyone is exactly
who they say they are. It's amazing.

339
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,862
And here we are, lying, all suspicious.

340
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:49,325
I think Jane wants to be my friend.
She asked me out for coffee, heh.

341
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,037
- She's the Viper.
- What? No, no, no.

342
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,957
She passed the test.
And I think that she just really likes me.

343
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,921
Honey, you're right. Of course.
Of course she does.

344
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,590
Duh. It's just my stupid
suspicious spy brain.

345
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,467
It doesn't matter anyway.

346
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,804
I'm not really sure what type
of friendship is founded on lies.

347
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,555
But we should focus anyway.

348
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,058
I'm sure the Viper is zeroed in on you
by now.

349
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,603
We need to lure him out
and get you alone and vulnerable.

350
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,275
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.

351
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,902
- What?
- What?

352
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,904
I've had too many,
I'm going to bed.

353
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,948
- Come on, Morgan.
- No, no, no.

354
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:33,119
Hey, there's poker later and probably
another less-clothed swim party.

355
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:39,583
I would love nothing more than to
see you do a naked cannonball, Irv.

356
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,795
Keep it on, keep it on, keep it on.
I need to lie down.

357
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,632
- I think the sciatica's acting up.
- Yeah. I think I'll call it too.

358
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,883
Bob. What?

359
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,510
- There we go.
- Good night.

360
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,762
- Come on. See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

361
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,474
Yeah, I gotta call my family
before they hit the hay.

362
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,268
Yeah, one of my kids
had a big game today.

363
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,477
Oh.

364
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,605
That's a lie, Chuck.

365
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,738
Well, no, Omaha's no St. Louis,
but we have a good time.

366
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,909
Sally, in her day, ooh, what a looker.

367
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,953
Yeah, Corn Princess in 1987.

368
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:23,169
- Nope, still lying.
- Oh, heh, well, this is me.

369
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,587
Oh.

370
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:29,425
Guess I'm just gonna be in here.
All by my lonesome.

371
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,635
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

372
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,850
- Grimes.
- Hmm?

373
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,810
I shouldn't have joked about bedbugs.

374
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,606
They cost the hospitality industry
millions of dollars a year.

375
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,653
Wrong thing to say.

376
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,132
Yep. I'm alone and vulnerable.

377
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,767
Hello, Sarah. Come in.

378
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,354
I've been watching you.

379
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,359
You've got a cute little persona
going on.

380
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,736
But I can spot a girl in a costume.

381
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,448
You know, I'm not what I seem, either.

382
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:50,464
Yeah. I like costumes, too.

383
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,515
You're not going anywhere
until you hippity-hop over here.

384
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,063
It's party time.

385
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,070
It was the bartender.

386
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,202
Yeah, not everybody here is normal.

387
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,831
Huh.

388
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:31,255
Whoo! Yes. I'm not gonna die.
Hey, Viper. Suck it.

389
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,592
- Can I go home now?
- Yeah, buddy. You're good.

390
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,053
We're not letting this guy go till he
acknowledges the hit's off.

391
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,889
Which he's being very stubborn
about doing, I might add.

392
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:45,227
Go ahead, nod your head. Do it.
Yep, hit's off. No more killy-killy.

393
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,730
This is not how it's done, hmm?

394
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,983
First, we have to get Decker
to rescind the kill order...

395
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,695
...but we'll handle that, Morgan,
so, you know, I think you're free to go.

396
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,115
And if you go anywhere near Alex,
you're gonna be on another hit list. Hmm?

397
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,122
- I'm sorry, buddy. You doing okay?
- Yeah. You know.

398
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,000
I wish he'd give me the number
so I can explain to her.

399
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,045
Don't give up, you know? You gotta
keep trying. He's a tough one to crack.

400
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,090
You know, uh...

401
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:20,220
It's easier to ask forgiveness
than permission.

402
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:25,434
- Uh, truer words have never been spoken.
- A stitch in time saves nine.

403
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,021
Mm-hm, lead a horse to water.

404
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,981
Just...

405
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,692
Hmm.

406
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,819
Hey, I gotta make a call.

407
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,490
Jane asked me for a drink, and this is
gonna take a while, so I have to...

408
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,910
No, no, no. Go. Casey and I
can take care of the Viper handoff.

409
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,872
Really? You mean, like, I can go
and have an actual normal friend?

410
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,000
We saved a man's life
not having to use the Intersect...

411
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,002
...just awesome husband-wife spy
work.

412
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,380
Maybe we can have some
normal friends, too.

413
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:58,425
Okay. Well, I'm going to go have a drink
with a friend like a real live person.

414
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,261
- Have a great time.
- Thanks.

415
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,973
Jeff, you have shown incredible
improvement in motor skills...

416
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,309
...language ability, reflexes, memory.

417
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,813
- It's like you're an actual person now.
- Thank you.

418
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,817
I have started to see
a lot of things more clearly.

419
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,903
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mommy.

420
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,907
Hi, muffin. Mommy missed you.
Yes, she did.

421
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,201
I've never seen
such a perfect case study...

422
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,746
...for an article on effects of
multiyear carbon monoxide poisoning.

423
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,581
We could get published.

424
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,126
Why don't you come by
the hospital? We'll look.

425
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,295
Let me see your belly.
Let me see your belly. I could eat you.

426
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,798
Let's go out here
and see some fun stuff.

427
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,383
Your woman is not happy.

428
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:44,221
- What are you talking about?
- Fresh air has made me intuitive.

429
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,182
That woman
wants to be home with her child.

430
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,602
She'll never say it, but it's true.

431
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,111
- Alex.
- I am not here to talk to you.

432
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,323
- I'm here to see my dad.
- I just wanted to apologize, that's all.

433
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,576
There's nothing you can say
to make it okay.

434
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,828
You are just not the man
I thought I loved.

435
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,956
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Hey.

436
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,752
You want the truth? You ready?

437
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,589
I had a supercomputer in my head,
okay? And it was melting my brain.

438
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,699
Keep walking. Normal thoughts.

439
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,703
So how do you like
working private sector?

440
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,123
It's hard, right?
Figuring everything out...

441
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,959
...choosing the right small business
accounting program.

442
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,712
You're probably not feeling too chatty.

443
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,424
Probably feeling bad we took down
the best so easily.

444
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,681
Probably too easily.

445
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,936
We were supposed to catch you.

446
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,740
- Sarah, wait. Don't move.
- Oh, my God. What?

447
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,659
We're trying to be normal and all...

448
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,412
...but if we were in spy mode we'd
think it was interesting timing...

449
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,748
...that you made a new friend...
- I'm Jane.

450
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,793
Who wanted to hang out
with you immediately post-mission.

451
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,296
A new friend who was as good as I was
at passing a lie detector.

452
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:45,676
And we might wonder if the Viper
didn't use a decoy, like we did...

453
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,303
...to make Morgan feel safe
and come out of hiding.

454
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,057
And we might think that
getting rid of his guards by, say...

455
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:56,228
...planting a car bomb
might be a really great way to go.

456
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:06,405
Okay, here's a spy thought:
Don't move your foot.

457
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,407
Okay.

458
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,580
I'm looking for Morgan Grimes.

459
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,044
You have to understand this
all happened a couple years ago.

460
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,047
I can't give you names, details
because it's confidential.

461
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,717
But there were e-mails
and there were supercomputers.

462
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,468
It wound up in my brain.
And I zoomed.

463
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,306
My word, not theirs. The supercomputer
that I got was flawed...

464
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,224
...which is why all this behavior...

465
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,893
...was happening. I'm sorry.

466
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,563
You have to believe me.
My brain was melting. You know?

467
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,857
You look overwhelmed.
I'll let you process that.

468
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,822
I'm sure the manager's around
here somewhere.

469
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,534
- I'll find him.
- Got to go now.

470
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,954
No, Morgan. What are you doing?
Seriously. You always do this.

471
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,463
You little barbarian son of a bitch.

472
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:24,274
Oh. Help, help. Help.
Skip, pull the fire alarm.

473
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,988
Someone plug the hose.
Everyone run to safety. I'm saving you.

474
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,408
No apologies for any of this, Jeffrey.
I just needed you back, man.

475
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,327
Pineapple.

476
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:55,597
Yep. Yep. That's a bomb.
And it's a nice one.

477
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,266
Okay.

478
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,228
Listen to me.
This is what's happening, okay?

479
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,773
There is an elusive assassin
and she is hunting me, okay?

480
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,819
- You are legitimately insane.
- What? No. No, no, no.

481
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,613
Please, please, look, look, look.

482
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,036
- Okay. It's all right, stay calm.
- Okay, she's there.

483
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,413
I know, I know.

484
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,792
I'm gonna rip your face off.

485
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,502
No. Shh, Casey, listen to me.

486
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,130
We have the wrong person.
The real Viper is a lady.

487
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,173
And she's here, hunting us.

488
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,846
Northeast corner of the store.
Get Alex to the broom closet.

489
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,598
You wanna live,
you're gonna take care of my daughter.

490
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,518
Of course. Listen to me.

491
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,062
We're gonna move
when I say move, okay?

492
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,275
Move.

493
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,779
I'm getting some texts.

494
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:56,700
Jane is in the Buy More
and Casey's locked in the Castle.

495
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,077
We'll be there
in less than 90 seconds.

496
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,330
Okay.
Uh, you remember how to do this, right?

497
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:07,085
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe, kind of, yeah.
I think so. It's normally the red wire.

498
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,715
Or the green wire. It's normally the red
or the green wire, I'm not really sure.

499
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,968
- I want you to wait in here.
- Okay.

500
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,471
Don't you move till I get back.
She's after me.

501
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,848
- I'm not gonna put you in danger.
- Okay.

502
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,683
I love you.

503
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:27,064
You don't have to say it back at me.
Would've been romantic but it's fine.

504
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,483
It's fine. Good.

505
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,908
I can't believe I trusted Jane
to be who she said.

506
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,993
I must have been desperate
for a friend.

507
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,538
Oh, hey, hey.
Don't beat yourself up.

508
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:50,295
And don't move your foot, really,
because this is a very nasty bomb.

509
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,963
- Up with the leg.
- Okay.

510
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,343
Keep that leg. Up with that leg.
There we go. There we are.

511
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,526
- Hello.
- Jane?

512
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,862
Jane, it's Sarah.
I'm so sorry I'm running late.

513
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,991
I'm having a really bad day and
I just need somebody to talk to.

514
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,204
Well, just come to the restaurant.
We'll workshop it.

515
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:28,041
No, I'm so upset,
I don't think I can drive.

516
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,419
Well, just get in the car,
turn it on and get here.

517
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:35,882
- I can't. My hands are shaking.
- Honey, look, I'm really sorry, okay?

518
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,385
I'm not gonna be able to help you
right now.

519
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,761
- I gotta go.
- No, wait.

520
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:44,266
Jane, I want to tell you something.
I feel really badly.

521
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,686
You've been so open and honest
and sweet with me...

522
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,856
...and I'm excited to have a new friend.
- Yeah?

523
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:56,570
But I've been lying to you.
About a couple of things.

524
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,866
I'm a spy. Boy, it feels good
to say that to a real friend.

525
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:04,995
You're amazing at what you do.
I really trusted you.

526
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,873
- And I don't do that very often.
- Well, you shouldn't.

527
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,168
Wait, wait, stop. I have your bomb.

528
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,089
Which means it's disarmed. Bye.

529
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,140
Thanks. I thought
maybe stepping into the middle of this...

530
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,018
...might have been a bad idea
after all, so...

531
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,022
I miss knowing kung fu.

532
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,318
Remarkable work.

533
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,945
The Viper's perfect record
has been broken.

534
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,739
Uh, boom.

535
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,241
- Suck it.
- Sorry about that, sir.

536
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,161
I'm obviously relieved
the mix-up was righted.

537
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,705
I would never want you
to complete your mission...

538
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:53,001
...after the CIA called it off.
I am one of the good guys.

539
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,379
In front of these witnesses,
on a recorded feed, the hit is off?

540
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,299
Yes. It's official, the hit is off.

541
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,718
All right, our business here is done.

542
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,930
Good luck running a spy business
with no Intersect, huh?

543
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,473
See you never.

544
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,434
He's a quippy bastard.

545
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:14,231
- Can someone get us out of this hole?
- My pleasure. Follow me.

546
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,736
- Decker took that well.
- Yeah, he did.

547
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,072
I'll take care of it.

548
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:34,042
- So we need to talk.
- Whatever.

549
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,420
We're no longer friends, I get it.
Like I care.

550
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,091
I do care.
I wish you were a better person.

551
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,428
But unfortunately, you need to learn
there are repercussions for your actions.

552
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,516
- Hmm.
- So you're under arrest.

553
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,311
What?

554
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,564
- For what?
- Attempted homicide.

555
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,026
Jeff.

556
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,695
Jeffrey.

557
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,363
You have the right to remain silent.

558
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:07,450
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

559
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,831
Morgan, we're not gonna
get back together.

560
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,083
You told me you were done
with spy life...

561
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,336
...and clearly you lied to me
in a million different ways.

562
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,883
You're my hero,
but you are not my boyfriend.

563
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,678
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

564
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:31,057
- No, it's okay. I get it.
- But, um, we can still be friends.

565
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,602
And I'm really glad
we're both here tonight.

566
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,980
Me too.

567
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:40,900
We're putting out some hors d'oeuvres
if you guys wanna come in.

568
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:44,612
- Is my dad here yet?
- Uh, he's coming a little late.

569
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,784
You haven't said anything yet
that made me think you're still the man.

570
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,705
I have a reputation to repair.
This will get done.

571
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,584
You need to understand, however,
that I have to protect my cover.

572
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,044
Obviously. Which means...

573
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,088
Neutralizing everyone
who knows who I am.

574
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:06,885
Walker, Grimes, Casey,
Bartowski, Casey's daughter.

575
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:13,308
You have approval on everyone
but Bartowski and Walker.

576
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,352
Now get it done.

577
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,026
John Casey.

578
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,239
Your life is over if you...

579
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,384
So tell me about your day.
Fun parts only, please.

580
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,888
Hmm. Fun parts only. Well, this week,
I had to pose as Morgan Grimes. Heh.

581
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,517
You would need some serious hormone
injections to get a beard like that.

582
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,645
Okay, okay. Fortunately for me,
my wife likes me baby smooth.

583
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,732
I do. My husband was the best
human target a wife could ever ask for.

584
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,693
Aw, this is fun.
Talking openly about our days.

585
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,321
- It's the best.
- Hey, everybody.

586
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,448
- Sorry, I'm late.
- No, perfect timing.

587
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,243
- We're about to sit down. I'll trade you.
- Thanks.

588
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,245
Hey, Dad. Where were you?

589
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,164
- Oh, just had an errand to run, heh.
- Oh.

590
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,879
May I? Cheers.

591
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,056
Uh, I'd like to make a toast.

592
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:40,812
Chuck and I have been a little sad
this week that we aren't normal people.

593
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,274
I've been having a hard time
with the fact I have no real friends.

594
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:48,236
But I look around here
at all of you today and I realize...

595
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,904
...that because of Chuck, I do.

596
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:55,660
Nobody in the world is closer than
we all are. So, thank you and cheers.

597
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,120
Cheers.

598
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,498
I, too, have an announcement.

599
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,042
- I'm going back to work.
- Well, what?

600
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,211
Wait, I thought you were happy
at home.

601
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,923
No, I was just putting on a front,
you know? I was going nuts.

602
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:12,635
Ellie is stepping up and taking care
of baby Clara for a while.

603
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,431
Yes, it was too soon for me to go back,
anyway. I missed her too much.

604
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,683
Yeah. She's totally saving me.

605
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,312
One more mommy and me class,
I would've lost my mind.

606
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,359
- Hey.
- Hey.

607
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:32,614
Ahem. I wanted to tell you that you could
probably, uh, ixnay on the killing me thing.

608
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,074
Because I'm not gonna bother
Alex anymore.

609
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,661
Hmm. You should move back in.

610
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,873
- Really?
Uh-huh.

611
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,003
- Got you a gift.
- Come on, really?

612
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,007
- Indiana Jones.
Mm-hm.

613
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,301
- I like these?
- You did.

614
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,470
Holding out on me?
Is this the only three?

615
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,515
You're not, like, keeping the good ones
for yourself or...

616
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,226
- There's just the three.
- Thanks, man.

617
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,857
Hey. I got it. Ahem.

618
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,905
- Decker, what is this?
- We're looking for John Casey.

619
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,114
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

620
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,786
John Casey. You're under arrest.

621
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,288
For murder.
