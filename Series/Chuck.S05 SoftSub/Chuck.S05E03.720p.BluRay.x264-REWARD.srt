1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:05,254
Hi, I'm Chuck and here's
what's been going on in my life lately.

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:08,632
- This is not a real attack, is it?
- No, this is our competition.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,301
- Verbanski Corp. Took all of our clients.
- Told you.

4
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,721
You put me out there,
you don't have to worry.

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,306
- Morgan needs a handler.
- What? Who? Me?

6
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,475
You be my handler. Yeah.

7
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:22,229
Just because you have the Intersect
doesn't mean you don't have to learn.

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,773
I have something I can offer you
no one else can.

9
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:41,165
Okay, target acquired.
Distance to intercept, 100 meters.

10
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,585
This is it. You ready, Casey?

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:49,006
Readiness, like life, begins at the point
of conception. Where am I headed?

12
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,508
Other side.
You should be hitting a one-way.

13
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,887
- Head south to initiate intercept.
- Roger that.

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,640
You okay? Your blood pressure
just went through the roof.

15
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,267
I'm fine.

16
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,563
How much time till intercept?
- Steady. In five, four...

17
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,691
...three, two, one.

18
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,152
John.

19
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,822
- Gertrude, hey.
- What are the chances?

20
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,158
Okay, her favorite restaurant
is a block away.

21
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,619
A raw bar called Cerulean.

22
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,165
I was just, uh, going around the corner
to that little oyster bar.

23
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,543
Cerulean. That...
That is my favorite restaurant, heh.

24
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,836
What are the chances?

25
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,297
Wow.

26
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,759
You know, I could really go
for some Blue Points right about now.

27
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,970
Hear that? The target is yours.
Ask her out.

28
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,390
- She practically just asked you out.
- Blue Points are delicious.

29
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,726
Especially with mignonette sauce.

30
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:46,855
Boy, that's, heh, the best thing
the damn French ever gave us.

31
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,234
- Come on, Casey.
- Ahem.

32
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,489
Well, it was, uh, great talking to you.

33
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,284
Just give her a kiss on the cheek.
Just let her know you're interested.

34
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,498
Guess I'll, uh, see you around?

35
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,166
Come on.

36
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,584
Yes.

37
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,720
- You froze. It happens to the best of us.
- No, I didn't freeze.

38
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,765
- Then what do you call that?
- Reconnaissance.

39
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,059
Wait. You planted a bug
on Verbanski?

40
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,227
Mm-hm.

41
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,521
Piggybacks off her cell phone's Wi-Fi.

42
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,189
That's a weird move, Casey.

43
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:33,026
This way I can find out
everything I need to before I ask her out.

44
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,988
That's why people go on dates.
To get to know one another.

45
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,448
Just do me a favor.
Don't tell Chuck and Morgan, hmm?

46
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,284
Lips are sealed.

47
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,332
How many triple words
are you gonna leave open, Jeff?

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,502
- My God, he's dumb.
- Morgan.

49
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,338
Boom, 87 points, huh?
It's good to be the Intersect.

50
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,674
- Please, buddy, we're on a mission.
- Oh.

51
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,636
Right, sorry. I thought we were just
sitting in some Burbank parking garage.

52
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,680
Sorry,
you got somewhere you need to be?

53
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,390
I had a hot date. No biggie.

54
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,685
This is how you choose to use
the world's greatest supercomputer.

55
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,647
Okay, okay, this is actually
what I needed to talk to you about.

56
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,608
Um...

57
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,859
The attitude.

58
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,904
- Am I not...?
- Being the Intersect doesn't mean...

59
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,908
...you talk about being the Intersect.
- You did it your way, I'll do it my way.

60
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,493
- Morgan.
- Chuck.

61
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,497
I hate to say it, but you're starting
to remind me of seventh-grade Morgan...

62
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,042
...and I think we both know
what happened to him.

63
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,505
Stay here.

64
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,342
Got it, boss.

65
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,891
It's good to see you again.

66
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,770
- I trust you and your team are well.
- Hanging in there, yeah.

67
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,272
Turns out working
in the private sector is...

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,817
Look, I think it's better
if we keep this brief. No offense.

69
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,196
You've heard of Mats Zorn?

70
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:03,867
- Guy with the whistleblower website.
- Makes WikiLeaks look like child's play.

71
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,746
A number of classified CIA memos
have fallen into Zorn's hands.

72
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,415
- So you want us to grab Zorn.
- And the documents.

73
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,251
The drive contains his itinerary.

74
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,379
Zorn doesn't stay in one place any longer
than it takes to refuel...

75
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,590
...but we have him passing through L.A.
- This a paying gig?

76
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,801
There's a sizeable bounty on Zorn.

77
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,928
I'm outsourcing
to circumvent the leak.

78
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,431
My only condition is no one breathes
my name in relation to the mission.

79
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,976
Yo, Becky!

80
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,354
What up, baby girl?

81
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,855
I told you to come alone.

82
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,525
You're doing Pilates, huh?
Don't say you're not. You are.

83
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,402
What the hell is wrong with him?

84
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,364
- So many things.
- Becky, your core is really tight.

85
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,626
- Alex?
- Oh, hey. I thought you were Morgan.

86
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,587
- I just dropped him off at the Buy More.
- What?

87
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,465
- I guess he forgot about our plans.
- I wouldn't say that.

88
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,845
- He did mention having a hot date, so...
- Well, clearly it's with someone else.

89
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,891
Is there something going on
between you two?

90
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:14,062
You would tell me
if Morgan is seeing someone else, right?

91
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,731
Yes.

92
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,816
And no, he is not.

93
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,902
He's had a lot on his mind lately,
that's all.

94
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,155
Let me track him down,
talk sense into him.

95
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,948
Okay.

96
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,492
- Chin up.
- Thanks.

97
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,793
- Oh, hey. How did it go with the general?
- Piece of cake.

98
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,504
Data drive with the mission
is locked up in Castle.

99
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,506
- So, what's the problem?
- Morgan.

100
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,468
Tried to have a heart-to-heart
about his...

101
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,303
Overblown ego.

102
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,763
Anyway, he went AWOL.

103
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,349
Casey, can you help
with a surveillance detail?

104
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,561
- Casey, what you looking at?
- Nothing.

105
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,897
Ooh, you got a wire up on someone, huh?
Who is it?

106
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,192
- Verbanski.
- Corporate espionage.

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,695
- He's just sizing up the competition.
- Perving out on Gertrude.

108
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,281
- Weird move, Casey.
- I told you.

109
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,576
So have you considered my offer?

110
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,204
Gertrude, do me a favor.

111
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,332
- What is he doing in her office?
- That's a good question.

112
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,043
Next time you make me an offer like that
to me...

113
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,545
...why don't you go
and spit in my face instead?

114
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,714
- Thank you, Morgan.
- Heh.

115
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:28,220
Bubeleh, I offer you the services
of the world's greatest spy...

116
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,224
...and you don't have the decency,
the common courtesy...

117
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,478
...to offer me
my own personal assistant?

118
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,400
- Bush league.
- You drive a hard bargain, Mr. Grimes.

119
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,068
Eh, I try. I try.

120
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,698
Welcome to Verbanski Corp.

121
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,496
- You little...
- Traitor.

122
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,790
I'm gonna like it here.

123
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,172
Hey, what are you doing?
It's so early.

124
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,967
I couldn't really sleep,
so I figured I'd head into the office early.

125
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,889
Well, why didn't you wake me?
I mean, ugh, we could've talked about it.

126
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,725
I know what Morgan did hurt you.

127
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,688
I'm not, uh, hurt. I'm just angry.

128
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,357
The Intersect is an integral part
of our business...

129
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:08,320
...and Morgan just sold it
to our number one rival.

130
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,656
Morgan is also your best friend.

131
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,243
I'm trying not to think about that
right now.

132
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,997
Okay, her bottle is on the counter.

133
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,208
There's two more
that need to be warmed up.

134
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,836
Clara eats every two hours, and lets
you know she's full by spitting up.

135
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,172
- Oh, that's my girl.
- Are you ready for this?

136
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,299
It's great you took paternity leave...

137
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:33,011
It's just feeding, burping and wiping.
I think I got it, babe.

138
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,638
Your daddy climbed Matterhorn.

139
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,516
- Was the only one who didn't lose a toe.
- You're tough.

140
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,935
Being with a baby
is a different kind of tough.

141
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,937
- So you pace yourself.
- Heh, yeah.

142
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,147
You're on Clara time now.

143
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,440
Bye, sweetie.

144
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,527
Say bye to Mommy. Say, "You got it."

145
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,238
Okay, it's 9 a.m.
What do you wanna do first?

146
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:11,424
Well, we should probably clean up
before Mommy gets home, huh?

147
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,347
Nine forty-five?

148
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,392
In the a. M?
It's only been 45 minutes?

149
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,019
What are we gonna do
with the rest of the day?

150
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,918
Oh.

151
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,005
Don't scuff it, all right,
Cabbage Patch?

152
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,509
What's up, bro?
You wanna talk to me?

153
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,636
- Morgan, did you dye your hair?
- No.

154
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,139
I frosted my tips.
I think it makes my eyes pop.

155
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,602
Are you wearing lifts?

156
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,771
Boy, they're orthotics, okay?
They're for my posture.

157
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,481
It's cool. Cruise wears them.

158
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,485
What is...? What is going on with you?
You smell like the Glendale Galleria.

159
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,238
It's Ed Hardy. I'll send you a bottle.

160
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,075
- What is this?
- My three-week notice.

161
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:24,080
- What? You backdated it three weeks.
- Oh, yeah? Well, I've been busy, Chuck.

162
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,042
- Working for Verbanski Corp?
- Ah, you heard.

163
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,877
Monster deal. I was gonna tell...

164
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,839
- No, no, no, I get it. You're busy.
- God. I knew you were gonna do this.

165
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,883
- Do what?
- Just take this whole thing...

166
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,843
...and make it all personal.

167
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,928
Personal? How is this personal?

168
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,847
Do you understand?

169
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,182
Our business needs you.

170
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,683
We need the Intersect.

171
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:48,521
Carmichael Industries is just starting
to get off the ground right now.

172
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,066
Yeah. Yeah.

173
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,527
I came for stuff out of my office.
I would've sent my decorator...

174
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,906
...but she's all busy
with Mark Wahlberg's place. Hollywood.

175
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,366
Think it through, moron.

176
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,619
You walk out on us,
you never walk back.

177
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,412
Save it, all right, everybody.

178
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,832
You had the greatest weapon
on the planet and chose not to use me.

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,167
That's on you.

180
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,503
So you told Verbanski
about the Intersect?

181
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,963
We were trying to protect you.
Don't do this.

182
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,341
It's already done, okay, Chuck?

183
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,927
It's too late.
I don't need any of this crap.

184
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,679
Eh, eh, eh, eh!

185
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,306
You sure you wanna do that, Johnny?

186
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,309
Fine. Leave.

187
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,646
But there's no way I'm letting a traitor
date my daughter.

188
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,773
Right, right, right.
Your daughter, sure.

189
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,777
Excuse me. I'll take care
of that right now. Sweet little Allie.

190
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,655
- Alex.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, whatever.

191
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,783
There you go. All right?

192
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,785
You text-message break up
with my girl?

193
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,954
Yeah, well, ahem...

194
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,455
...I can do better.

195
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,917
- You...
- Just let him go.

196
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,671
What do you want? Want me to kill him?
Because I'll kill him.

197
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,633
Better yet, let's keep him alive.
You can work him over for a while.

198
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,177
No, Dad, I don't want you to hurt Morgan.

199
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,179
I love him. I just...

200
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:07,350
I just don't understand
how he could be so awful, you know?

201
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,687
- Just tell me what to do.
- I just...

202
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,148
I just don't understand.

203
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,234
I just want the old Morgan back,
you know?

204
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,654
I know it hurts, honey.

205
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,489
We Caseys don't like to open up...

206
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,658
...make ourselves vulnerable.

207
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,537
When someone does rip our heart out
and stomp on it in front of our eyes...

208
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,914
...it could be like the worst torture
of all.

209
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,170
I just want you to know
that I'm always here for you.

210
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,964
Always will be.

211
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,802
Charity Hospital will return
after these messages.

212
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,846
Hello. Sorry if I'm interrupting...

213
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,182
...but we have something important
to discuss.

214
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,225
Who's that handsome devil? Heh.

215
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,394
If you're in a pickle,
come to Buy More...

216
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,063
...where a green shirt can help you
find your way.

217
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,066
You know, he's right.
We should head to the Buy More.

218
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,237
That backup juicer
is probably on its last leg.

219
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,240
Yeah. Should kill a couple hours.

220
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,701
We just gotta make it to dinner, right?

221
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,456
- Something is wrong. This isn't like him.
- Oh, sure it is.

222
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,375
His new powers,
they've pushed him to the dark side.

223
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,211
He doesn't have a dark side.

224
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,964
It's like middle school all over again.

225
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,134
Like when Morgan grew
his first mustache.

226
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,180
Full, thick, manly.
Like a miniature Tom Selleck.

227
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,724
Thought he was cock of the walk.

228
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,768
All cool, sarcastic, mean.

229
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,354
Made our lives a living hell
for a few weeks.

230
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,314
Till Meredith Lester showed up.

231
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,651
And she grew a mustache too?

232
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,695
No, she did not, no.

233
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,448
One day,
Meredith snuck up behind Morgan...

234
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,285
...and pantsed him in front of everyone.
Exposed him for who he really was.

235
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,496
He went back to being uncool...

236
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,041
...and we went back to being friends
by the end of the day.

237
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,670
- That's it.
- You're gonna drop Morgan's pants.

238
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,463
Metaphorically, yes.

239
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,423
We finish Beckman's mission.

240
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,468
We show Verbanski Morgan is not
as cool as he thinks he is...

241
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,930
- You'll be friends by the end of the day?
- Exactly.

242
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,604
- No. No, no, no.
- What? What is it?

243
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,691
Oh, my God, what is that smell?

244
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,526
Ed Hardy cologne.

245
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,530
It's gone. The zip drive is gone.

246
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,157
Little bearded bastard stole it.
Stole our mission.

247
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,327
He probably took it with him
to Verbanski Corp.

248
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,079
I can't beli...

249
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,707
Morgan just pantsed us!

250
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,878
What are you two doing?

251
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,463
We're taking down our competition.

252
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,483
Anybody work here anymore?

253
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,496
Clara, I'm gonna find someone
to look after you.

254
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,207
Lester, come here.

255
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,669
- Guard this child with your life.
- Oh.

256
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,296
The Chosen One.

257
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,632
Hey, there, miss.

258
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,013
- Come on, I got you, man.
- Hey.

259
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,600
Get up, Jeff.

260
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,686
- Use your legs.
- I am gonna take a knife and fork...

261
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,314
...and just eat
those chubby little cheeks.

262
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,524
- Yes, Uncle Lester is.
- What are you doing?

263
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,485
- You're scaring her.
- No.

264
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,820
What are you doing?
Trying to kill yourself?

265
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:52,200
I'm just taking off the exhaust pipe,
trying to squeeze a few more horses...

266
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,203
...out of the beast.
- Hear of carbon monoxide, hmm, guys?

267
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,998
- Can't leave your engine running.
- He has to or he can't start it up again.

268
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,918
And the engine noise helps me sleep.

269
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:06,255
Hold up. Are you telling me you sleep
in your van with the engine running?

270
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,675
I'm sorry. What was the question?

271
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,219
Jeff, you need to see a doctor, man.

272
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,137
You might have damaged your brain.

273
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,807
Aw, Jeffrey doesn't have a brain,
silly pants.

274
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,685
- Give me a call. I'll give a quick consult.
- Really?

275
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,688
Caught me on a slow week.

276
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,564
Okay, Clara, let's go, honey.

277
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,650
- Yeah. Come on. Thanks, though.
- No.

278
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,195
- Five more minutes.
- Come on, yeah. Thank you.

279
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,740
My biological clock is tick-tocking.

280
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,475
This is breaking and entering.
Verbanski can shoot us with impunity.

281
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,061
Well, her little goon Grimes
stole our mission.

282
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:06,232
- We're gonna steal it back.
- So this has nothing to do with revenge?

283
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,194
If we don't get that bounty on Zorn,
Carmichael Industries goes belly up.

284
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,365
If we don't stop Zorn, no telling
how many agents are gonna get burned.

285
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,867
Fine. Where are we going?

286
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,163
Zip drive is in your girlfriend's office.
The only problem is the door.

287
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,250
Roger that. I can infiltrate,
you two take down security.

288
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,133
- You sure that's a good idea?
- Huh?

289
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,718
Ah!

290
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,346
- I mean, you know, you and Verbanski.
- There is no me and Verbanski.

291
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,640
Coming from the guy
who put a bug on her.

292
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:43,728
That was before she poached one
of my team. That woman is dead to me.

293
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,229
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

294
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,234
Come on, let's grab their uniforms.

295
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,369
Casey,
Verbanski's office is on your right.

296
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,538
Don't touch the handle.

297
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,666
- Two guards coming.
- What's the holdup?

298
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,085
Just accessing the system.

299
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,921
Okay, go.

300
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,147
Ah.

301
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,905
- What is he doing?
- I have no idea.

302
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,243
Casey,
we are on a bit of a schedule here.

303
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,869
Hm.

304
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,250
Casey, is everything okay in there?

305
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,002
Yeah, a-okay.

306
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,064
Casey, you've got incoming.

307
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,859
Bingo!

308
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,779
Let's start
with the Zorn mission briefing.

309
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,993
- What is this?
- A soy latte with two Splendas.

310
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,495
No. Soy? Who said soy?
What do you want me to do?

311
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,957
- Start lactating for you?
- I'm not sure what you mean.

312
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,085
I asked for almond milk.
Almond milk.

313
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,255
- Okay, say it with me.
- You megalomaniacal little bastard.

314
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,924
- Okay? Please fix it.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,635
This is the best
that Harvard has to offer?

316
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,307
Casey, watch out, it's Verbanski.

317
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,895
Got it. Let's move.

318
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,693
What's the matter?

319
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,571
Nothing.

320
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,991
Blue team,
please report to the east training field.

321
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,661
- Blue team to the east training field.
- I got to boogie. That's my class.

322
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,039
Okay, I suppose our mission briefing
can wait.

323
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,624
Okay.

324
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,765
Hey, what are you doing here?

325
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,686
They just called us. Hurry up.
Blue team, right?

326
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,314
Go. I hear the new instructor
is a real monster.

327
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,316
Right, yeah, ahem.

328
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,921
Is that a zip drive in your pocket
or are you just excited to see me?

329
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,466
I'm here
because you stole our mission...

330
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,176
...and our moron.

331
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,054
Oh, so you weren't following me
downtown...

332
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,098
...working up the nerve
to ask me out?

333
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,391
I don't date thieves.

334
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,528
Sarah, what is the holdup?

335
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,830
Well, well, well.

336
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,456
Look at this sorry bunch.

337
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,209
Verbanski wants me to whip you
into shape.

338
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,545
Ah, tell you what.
We're gonna play a little game.

339
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,715
I'm gonna point to one of you
and you're gonna step up...

340
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,467
...using whatever technique
to try and take me down.

341
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,720
You all seem so excited.

342
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,556
Ah, na-na-na-na-na-na.

343
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,224
You, come here.

344
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:04,322
Too slow. It was just too slow.
My software is just way too fast for you.

345
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,240
You, you, you.

346
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,591
Okay.

347
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,844
I'll take that. Thank you.

348
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,229
Yeah.

349
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,454
Enough foreplay?

350
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,543
Get over yourself, Gertrude.

351
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,932
I like you here, you,
this guy over here, the big guy.

352
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,642
See if you can hold me... Oh.

353
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,828
What are you waiting for, princess?

354
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,247
Come on. Come on.

355
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,541
I'll be gentle.

356
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,175
Master has taught you well.

357
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,845
I am the master.

358
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,639
Chuck. What are you doing here?

359
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,183
I'm here to take back
what you stole from us.

360
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,018
No, no. The Intersect is mine.

361
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,480
I want the zip drive, okay?
You can keep the Intersect, Gollum.

362
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,443
Since you started zooming,
you're acting a bit big for your britches.

363
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,821
No, my britches fit just fine, thank you.
You're just jealous.

364
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,323
- Jealous?
- That's right.

365
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:15,703
I was a better spy than you ever were.
I take the Intersect to a whole new level.

366
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,205
We're friends,
so I'm gonna give you a chance.

367
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,291
No. That's the thing, Chuck.

368
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,709
We are not friends.

369
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,345
I can't believe you just said that.

370
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,266
Yeah. Well, things come out sometimes
in the heat of the...

371
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,895
No. No, forget that. I stand by it.

372
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,147
We are not friends.

373
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,859
We got the drive.
Come on, let's get out of here.

374
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,652
Grimes, there's been a breach.

375
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,446
We need you to secure the zip drive.

376
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,782
You heard my boss. Hand it over.

377
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,744
No.

378
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,997
Do not make me do this, John.
You know what I'm capable of.

379
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,416
Just hand it over
before someone gets hurt.

380
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,646
God, I love the Intersect.

381
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,402
Oh, really?
That's what we're gonna do here?

382
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,820
I mean, you're gonna... Unh.

383
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,500
Zorn arrives in L.A. Tonight.
Business meeting downtown.

384
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:48,212
Just enough time for him
to switch planes and disappear.

385
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,090
Oh. Let me see that last tail number.

386
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,341
Helicopter.

387
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,094
We can pull up satellite
on the address.

388
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,222
Looks like a helipad.
That's where we'll grab.

389
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,891
Carmichael Industries
will be seven figures.

390
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,643
Won't be long till we're next.

391
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,312
I think we should talk
about Morgan and Gertrude.

392
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,314
I told you, Walker, she's dead to me.

393
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:11,402
Well, then how do you explain
whatever that was in her office?

394
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,529
Clearly you still have feelings for her.

395
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,241
You. I know what Morgan did hurt you,
but you saw the way he was behaving.

396
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,452
It's time to admit
this is more than just an ego problem.

397
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,580
- Seventh-grade Morgan.
- What if it's not?

398
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,041
- What if Morgan needs help?
- He said we're not friends anymore...

399
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,794
...so how am I supposed to help him
now?

400
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,465
So, Jeff, when's the last time
you saw a doctor?

401
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,509
Um...

402
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,804
When was the last time
I got something stuck up in me?

403
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,100
Okay,
I'm just gonna ask you a few questions.

404
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,145
All right, Jeff.
Have any trouble focusing?

405
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,064
Whoa! Yeah.

406
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,191
Ow. Okay.

407
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,360
- That's a yes.
- Heh.

408
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,488
Any problems
with your short-term memory, Jeff?

409
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,115
Hey, doc.

410
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,701
Do you know I'm cha-cha
under here?

411
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,578
All right, keep the gown down.

412
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,164
Do you have any trouble performing
at work?

413
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,459
Got that one.
We're gonna mark that as a yes as well.

414
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,962
All right, I'm just gonna write you
a script here, buddy.

415
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,049
Get you on your way.
Should take care of all your problems.

416
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,135
Goody. Pills.

417
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,680
Stop sleeping in your van, Jeff. Okay?

418
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,307
Doctor's orders.

419
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,393
What are you saying?
Is there something wrong with Morgan?

420
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,021
I just... I feel like he's losing himself.

421
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,191
Why would the Intersect act so
differently in Morgan's head...

422
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,735
...versus Chuck's?
- It's a different program.

423
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,529
Somebody modified Dad's original.

424
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,115
If there's something wrong,
have CIA remove it.

425
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:44,912
I don't think he's gonna go for that.
Morgan is not acting like Morgan at all.

426
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,290
- You need to try to get through to him.
- How?

427
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,793
Well, you could try to appeal
to his memory.

428
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,962
I've had temporal lobe patients
who've responded to stories...

429
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,841
...about who they were before the injury.
It doesn't return them to normal...

430
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,428
...but it helps them cut through the fog.
In this case, the Intersect.

431
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,515
Gives them a glimpse
of who they used to be.

432
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,975
Agent Walker,
is the target in custody?

433
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,270
No. It's about the Intersect.
It's malfunctioning in Morgan.

434
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,773
Morgan Grimes has the Intersect?

435
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,859
It was a mistake. Remember the glasses
that you sent to us...

436
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,238
...after we took down Volkoff?
- Listen to me, Walker.

437
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,657
I never sent you Intersect glasses.

438
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,119
Well, then, who did?

439
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,662
Ready, Casey? Let's go.

440
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,914
Where you been?
Zorn is not gonna wait.

441
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,751
Talked to Beckman about Morgan. The
Intersect he uploaded wasn't from her.

442
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,796
- What? Then who?
- Decker or somebody else in the CIA.

443
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,674
- She doesn't know.
- Why would anyone wanna hurt Morgan?

444
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,551
You. It was meant for you.

445
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,554
I spoke to your sister.
Morgan's behavior is not his fault.

446
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,222
It's the Intersect.

447
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,225
Whatever was added to the program
is destroying him.

448
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,685
He's forgetting who he is.

449
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,770
Little Allie. I can do better.

450
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,148
- Wow, good job, Indy.
- Who?

451
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,483
He didn't remember Indiana Jones.

452
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,110
So Star Wars or Die Hard?

453
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,029
Ah, you pick, man.
That's more your thing.

454
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,906
Or Trilogy Night.

455
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,492
Oh, my God.
This isn't just seventh-grade Morgan.

456
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,537
I can't believe I didn't see earlier.
He was my best friend.

457
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,540
Is my best friend.
Sarah, we gotta find him.

458
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,876
He's on his way downtown
to the Marriott.

459
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:17,296
- Tracking Zorn?
- Must've copied that drive, little snake.

460
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,840
Right, it's not his fault.

461
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,469
Guys, let's save Morgan.

462
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,556
If we must.

463
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,446
No sign of Zorn.
Must be holed up in one of the rooms.

464
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,448
His helicopter should be landing soon.

465
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,825
We won't have any trouble
subduing his crew.

466
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,120
Or security detail. Usually
travels with four former operatives.

467
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,833
Guys, Morgan should be here by now.
His team had a head start on us.

468
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:59,046
Well, maybe something came up.
Maybe he betrayed them too.

469
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,756
He left Alex.

470
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,134
Maybe his brain is breaking down
so fast...

471
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,969
...that the Morgan we knew
is already gone.

472
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,640
Down, down, down!

473
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,790
- What the...?
- Morgan and Verbanski stole our plan.

474
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,166
They're gonna grab Zorn.

475
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,877
- Zorn is traveling with four guards.
- That's it, huh?

476
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:43,423
After neutralizing them, load Zorn
into the aircraft, return to headquarters.

477
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,425
Hey, listen.

478
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,636
I'm not paying you to play games.

479
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,681
If we land Zorn, there's no telling
what kind of business...

480
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,142
...Beckman is gonna send us.
- Okay.

481
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,896
Gertrude's gonna put us
out of business.

482
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,773
This isn't about business.

483
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,987
Chuck, what are you doing?

484
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,990
I'm going to talk to my friend.

485
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,953
Morgan. Don't shoot.

486
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,917
- Take him before he spooks the target.
- I wouldn't if I were you.

487
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:23,088
What did you think? You were gonna
swoop in here and snatch up Zorn?

488
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,425
- Not happening.
- This isn't about Zorn. I'm here to help.

489
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,176
Oh, right, right.

490
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,430
Like before when you pulled
my pants down and you tranq'd me?

491
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,689
Stop shooting! What do you want?

492
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,613
- Mats Zorn, you're under arrest.
- Mats Zorn, you're under arrest.

493
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,373
I knew it. You came here
to make me look like a loser.

494
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,460
The Intersect you uploaded,
there's something wrong with it.

495
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,545
I bet there is. It's not in your head.

496
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,347
There was some kind
of Trojan horse hidden.

497
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,266
Come on, please. Please, come on.
Just admit it.

498
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:20,938
Just admit that you cannot handle
the fact that I'm the badass operative...

499
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,650
...with the badass tips
and you're the dorky sidekick.

500
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,112
Ladies, please stop fighting!

501
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,614
Shut up!

502
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,329
Can't you feel
the Intersect changing you?

503
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,539
That's why you're not acting
like yourself.

504
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,084
Why would I wanna act like myself,
huh?

505
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:46,713
- Do you remember who I was before?
- Yes, Morgan! Do you?

506
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,558
Holy hell. Is that real?

507
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,019
Turn off the engine, Zorn.

508
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,071
Stop the engine
or I will blow us all to hell.

509
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,495
- Morgan, you're not a killer.
- Shut up, Chuck.

510
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,788
How would you know?

511
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,500
Because you got pantsed
by Meredith Lester in seventh grade.

512
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,460
- Gotta unlock his memory.
- What is...?

513
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,379
I don't even remember seventh grade.

514
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,550
Sure you do. Put the gun down, Morgan.
Try to remember what she did to you.

515
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,510
Even if I did remember, Chuck, why?

516
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,805
Why would I wanna remember
being humiliated by some stupid girl?

517
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,017
- You'd remember we got back at her.
- What do you mean we?

518
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,811
Yeah, we. I'm your best friend.
Always have been.

519
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,606
Who else would've helped you stand up
to the queen of eighth grade?

520
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,485
What did we do exactly?

521
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,572
We stole Meredith's ham sandwich
during homeroom, and then...

522
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,865
We did something to it.

523
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,158
We, uh...

524
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,953
- We spiced it up somehow.
- Yes. Yes. You're right, Morgan.

525
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,455
But what did we put in it?

526
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,498
It was something really, really awful.

527
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,917
I can see it in my head, I can, I just...

528
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,296
It's like a, hm, gnarly, curly...
Like a cockroach leg or...

529
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,506
- My mustache.
- Yes.

530
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,801
We shaved off my first mustache
and sprinkled it on her sandwich.

531
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:18,513
I remember now. Chuck, I remember.

532
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,182
That's who you are, buddy.

533
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,100
That's who I am.

534
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,521
Please, take me to jail.

535
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,274
You're all a bunch of maniacs.

536
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,531
- You cuff him, I'll grab the case.
- Does that mean we split the bounty?

537
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,203
I'm sure we can work something out.

538
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,665
Gertrude.

539
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,375
Can I have a minute?

540
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:48,960
Oh.

541
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,381
I just wanted to say thank you
for the opportunity.

542
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,343
But I don't think it's gonna work out.

543
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,012
Ah, poor kid, man. That's tough.

544
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,812
Morgan!

545
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,660
The auxiliary tank
is gonna blow the whole roof.

546
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,914
Wait, Chuck!

547
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:05,287
- I knew you were into me, John.
- Shut up, Gertrude.

548
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,458
Thank God you're okay.

549
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,633
Still friends?

550
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,762
- No, heh.
- Heh.

551
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,181
Of course.

552
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,390
Hey.

553
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,144
Thanks for pantsing me.

554
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,396
Anytime, buddy.

555
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,273
Anytime.

556
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,997
- You're gonna be late.
- If I take the Smith & Wesson...

557
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,958
...show her that I'm rugged
and dependable. Maybe the Sig.

558
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,127
She'll think I'm cool
and sophisticated.

559
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,006
I'll just take them both.

560
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,885
So you're taking Verbanski
to the gun range on your first date?

561
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,055
- Weird move?
- No, I think she's gonna love it.

562
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,098
Well, good luck.

563
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,727
Sure you don't wanna tag along,
follow in the van? I am wired for sound.

564
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,146
I think this is a solo mission.

565
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,899
Yeah. Thanks, Walker.

566
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:24,449
- Is Casey wearing Morgan's cologne?
- Unfortunately. What's this?

567
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,952
Courtesy of General Beckman
and the government.

568
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,829
- Our bounty money for Zorn.
- Wow, that's a lot of zeroes.

569
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,250
Just the beginning. Carmichael
Industries has a new lease on life.

570
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,002
- Wonderful.
- Mwah.

571
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,823
Dude, quick, give me 5 bucks.

572
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,074
Why do you need $5?

573
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,076
Fernando says if we give him 20...

574
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,995
...he's gonna let me Taser his nads.

575
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,580
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

576
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,291
Is that a good idea?

577
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,459
What do you care?
Could I have the money?

578
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,546
It just sounds really dangerous.

579
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,507
Yeah, what if we kill him?
That's totally worth 20 bucks.

580
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,386
I will not be party to the reckless
endangerment of a coworker.

581
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,806
And, if I might add, a friend.

582
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,393
What is going on with you?
Dude, are you high?

583
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,645
- What did you take?
- Far from it, Lester.

584
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,441
In fact, I'm seeing things clearly
for the first time in a long time.

585
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:44,404
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go
put my quinoa salad in the fridge.

586
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,408
Quin...?

587
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,785
Good news. Your vitals look fine.

588
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:55,540
Good. I don't feel fine though.
I certainly haven't been acting fine.

589
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,376
Don't worry, Morgan.
I know a very good brain doctor, heh.

590
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,964
Almost lost myself to this thing
in my head, so I want it out, you know?

591
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:07,635
But, uh, to be honest, I don't know.
Part of me thinks I'll kind of miss it.

592
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:12,515
The Intersect made me this,
like, super cool superspy, you know?

593
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,518
Now I go back to being some schmuck
who works at Buy More.

594
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,270
I know how you feel.

595
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,147
- You do?
- Yeah.

596
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:25,945
You know, when I first became
a stay-at-home dad, I lost my identity.

597
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,575
- Mind if I give you a word of advice?
- Of course, yeah. Please, fire away.

598
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,869
Don't confuse a job with your life.

599
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,955
Thanks.

600
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,714
- How did that date with my ex-boss go?
- What do you want?

601
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,551
Uh, to apologize.

602
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,013
The Intersect made me a jerk.
Not that it was the Intersect's fault.

603
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,849
It just kind of brought out my inner jerk.
Who knew? Heh.

604
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:58,395
Anyway, my point is I'm sorry,
you know?

605
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,439
I'm sorry I ever left the team,
that I took the zip drive...

606
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:07,153
...but most importantly,
I am really sorry for what I did to Alex.

607
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,072
I was just a bozo.

608
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,285
So, what do you say, roomie, huh?
Another chance?

609
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,165
You know, I'll just, uh...

610
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,583
All right.

611
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,129
On the couch maybe or...?

612
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,715
- Morgan.
- Hi. Sorry, uh, Casey kicked me out.

613
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,218
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
Let me talk to him.

614
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,181
No, no, no.
I kind of had it coming, heh, so...

615
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,559
Okay, where are you gonna live?

616
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:42,564
I don't know, but that's cool.
Jeff said that I could, uh, crash in his van.

617
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,191
You know, that he's not using it now,
so...

618
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,110
Yeah, I'll be all right.

619
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,362
You know, just till I get on my feet.

620
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:54,576
Absolutely not, Morgan.
You're gonna stay with us.

621
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,288
Guys, I mean, after everything that's...
I don't know what to say.

622
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,499
- Say you're gonna lose the frosted tips.
- Okay, fine.

623
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,336
Oh.

624
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,674
Look who's back.
Beckman must've been so impressed...

625
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,470
...with how we handled Zorn, she's got
a nice, big contract waiting for us.

626
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,888
Fantastic, man. Great.

627
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,015
- Can I take Scotty back on?
- Mm-mm.

628
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,433
I'm kidding.

629
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,644
He's... I don't even... But he's kind of...
Did you meet him?

630
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,314
He was kind of a... He's a good kid.

631
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,908
We have another problem, Chuck.

632
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,577
There's something
I thought you should see.

633
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,915
This is a kill order.
It's gotta be a mistake.

634
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,709
Morgan told anyone who wanted to hear
he had Intersect.

635
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:48,546
- The CIA does not like that.
- It was a mistake. Can't you call it off?

636
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,715
This goes way above my head.

637
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,592
Decker.

638
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,219
He wants Morgan dead.

639
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,514
Get Morgan off the street.

640
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,142
Now. Protect him.
Protect your friend, Chuck.

641
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,984
Come on, Morgan, pick up.
