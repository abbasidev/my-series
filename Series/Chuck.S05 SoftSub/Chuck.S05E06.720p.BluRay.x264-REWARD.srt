1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,295
Here's a couple things you might
need to know or maybe just forgot.

2
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:08,257
- Why'd you bring us here?
- I need you to do a job for me.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:11,176
We've been tracking a computer
super-virus named the Omen.

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,137
Bring it back to me, Casey goes free.

5
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:17,433
The virus is too dangerous to be released
to the world. It could wipe out everything.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,811
- What do you plan to do with it?
- What do you plan to do with it, John?

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,605
You're gonna break me
out of here alone?

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,608
Prisoner transfer, Section 38.

9
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:31,113
- Give me one reason not to kill you.
- It'll only further prove your guilt.

10
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,033
- Let's go right now.
- Hey, Decker, you forgetting something?

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,459
So, Verbanski blew up Decker.
That was pretty messed up.

12
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,795
Now the CIA wants to frame me
for something awful. That's bad too.

13
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,465
But there is something else
going on here.

14
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:53,010
Something personal.
Who's after us, Sarah?

15
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,221
I don't know. We'll get the team together
and figure this out.

16
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,683
They were supposed to be here
an hour ago. Did they get caught?

17
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:04,646
You wanna explain to me
what I'm doing in the ducts of Castle?

18
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,732
This is our Castle, our secret base.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,068
Maybe my plan was
a bit overly cautious, okay?

20
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,153
But Verbanski
was very complimentary of it.

21
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,990
- Egh. Should have gone in the front door.
- Whoa, you're a fugitive, okay?

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,494
There's a mysterious CIA plot to destroy
you, Chuck and Sarah. Perhaps even me.

23
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,246
Agh, keep your ego in check,
will you, Grimes?

24
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,874
Okay. What if, though?

25
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,211
- What if Castle's been compromised?
- That's...

26
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,505
Actually a very fine point.

27
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,717
Good job on the breakout.
That was actually...

28
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,677
I'm proud of you, moron.

29
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,847
Did you just compliment me
and insult me?

30
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,017
We're here.

31
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,312
Chuck, hey. Stand back.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,693
Sorry we're late.

33
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,072
Someone needed a sandwich.
Then someone needed a fruit cup, so...

34
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,742
Well, we're just happy
that you're back.

35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,995
- Where's Verbanski?
- Well, since she disposed of Decker...

36
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,873
...she felt it best to stay out
of the country till things die down.

37
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,543
Just when things were getting going
between you two.

38
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,045
So painful. I mean, that hurts.
Man, it's tough.

39
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,549
- I just said what I was thinking out loud.
- I'm sorry, Casey.

40
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,884
Yeah, she was a hell of a woman.

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,973
Still is. She's not dead and neither am I.
Let's get on with it.

42
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,893
Right. Well, before Decker blew up,
he was after this, the Omen...

43
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,231
...a computer virus that can erase
100 zettabytes of data per second.

44
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,818
Whoa, 100 zettabytes?
Is that a real thing?

45
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,279
It could take down the Internet,
crash planes...

46
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,948
...and erase every database in the world.
Yeah, it's real.

47
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:42,161
If the people trying to frame Chuck are
inside the CIA, we need to find Beckman.

48
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,330
Or she can find you.

49
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,293
This is an official communiqué.
I requested to tell you myself.

50
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,086
For the murder of Agent Decker...

51
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,464
...as well as the crime of treason
against the United States...

52
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,426
...the CIA is placing all of you
under arrest.

53
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,513
- What? General, how can you do this?
- I'd ask your team the same.

54
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,976
If you know what's good for you,
you'll stay put. Agents are on the way.

55
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:10,480
I put my trust in you for years
and look what you've become: Traitors.

56
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,774
Gen... How could she...?

57
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,402
Even Beckman's against us?
How did this happen?

58
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,614
You clever dame.

59
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,409
- What are you doing?
- She's amazing.

60
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,203
What are you talking about?

61
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,956
Look, Morse code. She was giving us
a warning, telling us to run.

62
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,834
We have exactly five minutes
before the CIA charges in.

63
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,670
- What? She said all that?
- We need to get out of here.

64
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:38,133
Let's get to my father's cabin and access
the CIA database using his Orion system.

65
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,469
- Find out who's after us.
- I'll find Beckman.

66
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,554
Let you know
when I found something.

67
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,308
Look, I know we've been chased before,
but I got a bad feeling about this.

68
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,851
It's like we're being hunted.

69
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,354
- Chuck, it's okay. We can handle it.
- Damn right.

70
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,649
But if we are, I need to get
to the apartment, wipe my computer.

71
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:57,319
Too dangerous. The complex
is probably surrounded by agents.

72
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,529
Then I go.

73
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:03,575
Makes sense. I'm not a fugitive.
They're not hunting me. I can do this.

74
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,828
Okay, I'll show you what to do.

75
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,164
You all right?

76
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,000
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

77
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,548
Babe, you ready to go?

78
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,343
Don't come in here.
I'm still getting ready.

79
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,185
Babe?

80
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,115
Okay, ready.

81
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,618
Wow.

82
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,538
Heh, it is so awesome
that you're my wife.

83
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,959
Thank you. Honey, are you sure
Clara's gonna be okay?

84
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,878
Babe, Clara's fine.
She's with my parents.

85
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,716
This is what we wanted, remember?
Fancy dinner, nice hotel.

86
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,884
Mini vacay.

87
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,222
Right. Been way too long since
we've had time just the two of us.

88
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,725
It's gonna be a great night, I promise.

89
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,311
And I have a little surprise for you.

90
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,854
Mm.

91
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,316
I might have a little surprise
for you too.

92
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,761
One more move and I will end you.

93
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,180
Damn it.
And I was trying to be discreet.

94
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,431
- Man.
- Morgan?

95
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,808
- Yeah, yeah, it's me.
- Morgan.

96
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,936
What are you doing
breaking into your own apartment?

97
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,481
Doing a favor for your dad.

98
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,525
And not trying to be seen, but, heh...

99
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,487
We broke him out of jail.
The CIA's sort of hunting him.

100
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,616
I know. The authorities contacted me.
I just thought maybe he would be here.

101
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,285
No, the whole team's on the lam.

102
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,373
He's not coming back here.
Not for a while, anyway. But, uh, okay.

103
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,127
How have you been?
Are you all right?

104
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,506
Go, I got it.

105
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,513
Okay.

106
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,557
Please. Whoa, yeah, sure.

107
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,978
I mean, you could at least wipe your feet
before you come traipsing through here.

108
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,490
Robyn Cunnings. Special agent, CIA.

109
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,493
I'm looking for John Casey
and the rest of your team.

110
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,161
Where are they?

111
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,830
I don't know.

112
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,208
Technically I'm not part
of the spy team anymore, so I...

113
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,337
What are you two doing here, anyway?

114
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,508
He's my boyfriend. You know,
we're just hanging out at the apartment.

115
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,177
The apartment that I live in.
Yeah, with her father.

116
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,766
- You live with your girlfriend's father?
- Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

117
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:20,188
Seems a little awkward, sure,
but it works, you know, for us.

118
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,359
- It's clear. He's not here.
- See? We told you.

119
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,069
We don't know where my dad is.

120
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,573
But I want him safe. He's a good man.

121
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,704
Good men don't go on the run.

122
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:40,876
If you see him or help him,
you'll be aiding and abetting a fugitive.

123
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,296
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
We'll be right outside.

124
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,597
Nice. That was good. You all right?

125
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,892
- Yeah.
- You did great. It was perfect.

126
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,728
- I'm your boyfriend, huh?
- Ugh, that was a lie, Morgan.

127
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,730
Don't get so excited.

128
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,900
Not that excited.

129
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:10,071
I know we'll fix this, but do you think
they'll bring Ellie in for questioning?

130
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,073
- Man, I wish I could call her.
- I know.

131
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,660
But they could've tapped her phone
and we don't want her implicated.

132
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,746
Right, right, right.

133
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,417
We're not staying at this cabin, right?
This thing's gonna blow over.

134
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,129
- I'm not disappearing on my sister, am I?
- No, why would you say that?

135
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,007
Us wanted by the CIA, my family history.
I'm just saying.

136
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,092
We won't disappear like your parents.

137
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,638
We're just hiding out for a little while.
Everyone's gonna be fine.

138
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,647
Reservation for two under Woodcomb.

139
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,858
I'm sorry, I don't have
a reservation under that name.

140
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,611
Oh, you know what?
Check "Bartowski."

141
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:57,327
Boss, we've got a lock
on the Bartowskis.

142
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:01,248
Excellent. Let's get on it, then.

143
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,044
I used Chuck's Open Table account.
He loves the points.

144
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,382
Here we are. Table for two.
Mr. And Mrs. Bartowski, right this way.

145
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,304
- To a very special night.
- And a few little surprises.

146
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,348
Babe, you look beautiful.

147
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,766
Thank you.

148
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,854
I, uh, wanted something a little different,
so I borrowed a dress from Sarah.

149
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,898
She wore it on a mission
in Bulgaria once. How wild is that?

150
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:14,029
Ever wonder what it would be like if we
lived a life of mystery and adventure?

151
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,823
- Like Chuck and Sarah?
- Like spies.

152
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,955
Well, you know,
spy work does run in our family.

153
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:29,252
There's no reason why you and I
can't pretend to be spies for tonight.

154
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,968
Man, I'm glad we're not on the lam
forever, because I gotta tell you...

155
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,889
...standing here, I'm feeling a little bit
like I'm becoming my father.

156
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,226
I imagine this is what he felt like
the first day he had to leave us.

157
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,228
- All alone in exile.
- That won't happen.

158
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:53,068
- Not if I've got anything to do with it.
- It's like my family's thing or something.

159
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,445
- The Bartowski Curse.
- The what?

160
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,657
Every Bartowski
has put their family in danger...

161
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,285
...then had to leave them
in order to protect them, and I'm next.

162
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,121
Look, there is no such thing
as the Bartowski Curse.

163
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,791
You're not gonna be like
your father. You know why?

164
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,461
Because you've got me.
You're not alone.

165
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,173
Access granted.

166
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,970
Okay, okay. It worked.
We're in the CIA's mainframe.

167
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,933
Okay, let's figure out
who Decker was working for.

168
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,768
Who's behind this.

169
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,605
There's an active case file,
but no lead agent listed.

170
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,651
Not even the CIA knows who's in charge.
It's a dead end.

171
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,320
So we're gonna be spies?

172
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,490
What do you say, Six Pack,
are you in?

173
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,200
Well, all right, Hot Mama.

174
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,162
Maybe we should come up with
a code word in case things get too hot.

175
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,957
How about "martini"?

176
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,210
And we can communicate
with hand gestures.

177
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,629
When we need to send a signal
to one another...

178
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,133
...we can just tug on our ear like so.

179
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,176
Babe, you look so cool
when you do that.

180
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,971
May I take these plates?

181
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,016
Well, if you'll excuse me,
it's time to bring out your surprise.

182
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,485
Copy that.

183
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,529
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

184
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,909
- They have an ID on the target.
- It says they found us.

185
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,830
They're closing in. Gotta get out of here.
We have to run, for real this time.

186
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,708
Sarah, this is exactly what
I was afraid of.

187
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,127
I'm sorry.
I know that you're not ready for this.

188
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,504
Nobody's ever ready
for something like this. We gotta go.

189
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,174
- Well, how long are we talking here?
- I don't know.

190
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,677
But this has nothing to do
with your parents. It has to do with us.

191
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,013
Trust me.
I've been on the run my entire life.

192
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,850
And the only way this is gonna work
is if we stick together, okay?

193
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,228
Okay, okay, fine, but there's one thing
I can't leave without.

194
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,522
- What?
- My P.A.N.T.S.

195
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,524
Your pants?

196
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,611
You got it.
I will get you your P.A.N.T.S.

197
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,531
It would be an honor.
Hey, listen. I love you, man.

198
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,742
Chuck's going on the run
and needs pants?

199
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,411
Well, they're his secret P.A.N.T.S.

200
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,747
You know what?
It's best I just show you mine.

201
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:15,043
Watch your hand. Ready?
Okay, here you go.

202
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,004
What's so special about them?

203
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,049
Oh, not so fast. Not so fast.

204
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,219
Since we were kids,
Chuck and I each had a box of P.A.N.T.S.

205
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,054
Private Artifacts Never to Share.

206
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,307
We kind of went through
an acronym phase. You know. Anyways.

207
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,976
This is where we kept
our most sacred possessions.

208
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,480
- In case of a fire, this is what we save.
- And you both have these?

209
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,732
Well, you know,
Chuck's generally neurotic.

210
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,401
And I was just terrified
of my house burning down...

211
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,529
...since, you know,
my house burned down.

212
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,117
Here we go, 2000 Sangiovese.

213
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,121
Little surprise for the wife.
Same bottle we had at our wedding.

214
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,917
- She is gonna love it.
- I'm thrilled for you, really.

215
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,338
Perfect.

216
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,634
You okay, bro?

217
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:09,264
Project Eagle is in effect. I'm here to take
you and your wife to a secret location.

218
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,765
We should leave quickly.

219
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,607
Project Eagle?

220
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,695
Your limo's just outside.
I'll be waiting there for you and your wife.

221
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,325
My wife. Project Eagle, mm? Right. Heh.

222
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,619
Be right there.

223
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,220
Are we surrounded?
Are there too many guys?

224
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,056
No, that's just it.
There's nobody out there.

225
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,642
- Could they have made a mistake?
- They must have.

226
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,525
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Just kind of weird.

227
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:07,572
It's a reminder from Open Table to review
my dining experience from tonight.

228
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,367
- Ellie must have used your account.
- She always does. I love the points!

229
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,203
That means the operatives think
that Ellie and Devon...

230
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,997
Are us.

231
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,505
- Oh.
- Aw, come on, babe...

232
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,007
...you're harshing on my spy vibe.

233
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,344
I'm sorry, I thought it was off.
There. Done.

234
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,348
- Straight to voice mail again.
- No answer from Devon either.

235
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,518
Oh, God. Sarah,
I think Ellie and Awesome were taken.

236
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,608
- Honey, this is...
- Exactly what we needed.

237
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,151
Yes.

238
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:09,759
All my ex's live in Texas

239
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:16,557
And Texas is the place
I'd dearly love to be

240
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,937
Took you long enough to find me.

241
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,481
This is where we come
in our darkest hours.

242
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:28,486
Iran-Contra, Nicaragua.
The Clinton years.

243
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,198
A group inside the CIA
is conspiring to destroy Chuck.

244
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,661
- Who's behind it?
- I don't know.

245
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,288
I need one of the conspirators.
In the meantime...

246
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,583
...I'm doing everything I can
to help Chuck and Sarah from here.

247
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,585
But they're being hunted as we speak.

248
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,256
And so is their family.

249
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,967
- Ha!
- This is totally great.

250
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,929
God, this car is so rad, babe. Ha, ha.

251
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:59,267
- Where we going, anyway?
- Well, I don't know, Sixer. You tell me.

252
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,855
You, uh... You sure your driver
has his livery license?

253
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,858
- My driver? This is your surprise.
- My surprise?

254
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,777
My surprise was a bottle of Sangiovese
at the restaurant.

255
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,488
Are you telling me
neither one of us booked this car?

256
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,824
Must be some mistake.
We'll just talk to him.

257
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,952
- No, no, no, don't do that.
- What? Why?

258
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,456
Project Eagle, the limo. What if
we open that thing and he shoots us?

259
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,292
- I've seen it in the movies.
- Ha, ha...

260
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,963
Babe,
what if we're on a real spy mission?

261
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,763
- Martini!
- Martini!

262
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,480
Please, tell me you're not about
to do something foolish.

263
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,734
Me, foolish? No. Just preparing the gear
I need to get Chuck's P.A.N.T. S...

264
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,488
...without being seen by those large
scary agents waiting outside for us.

265
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,657
And how exactly are you planning
on doing that?

266
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,994
That's easy. Hop out the side window.
Climb onto the roof.

267
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,247
Shoot a cord to Chuck's.
Zip-line across. Sneak into the patio.

268
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,375
Grab Chuck's P.A.N.T.S.
In and out, never even being seen.

269
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,710
Easy. At least it was...

270
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,838
...when I had a computer in my brain.
- That is crazy.

271
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,092
Not only are you gonna get caught,
but you'll probably break your neck.

272
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:18,346
Oh, thanks. Look.

273
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,015
I know I was a jerk
and I know that you're mad at me.

274
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:25,853
And I deserve that, okay?
I've made many, many poor decisions.

275
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:30,691
This is not one of them, okay?
I have to help my friend.

276
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,073
Morgan, wait. I have a better idea.

277
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,543
Hi. Yes, um,
I'd like to report an emergency.

278
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,255
Yeah, my crazy ex-boyfriend
is outside my house.

279
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,841
I think he might do something
really dangerous.

280
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,135
Yeah, that's right.

281
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:02,557
Okay, he's 6 feet tall and he has
blond hair and he's wearing a black suit.

282
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,060
Could you hurry, please?
Because I'm really, really scared.

283
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,270
Thank you.

284
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,398
There. Okay,
so as soon as you hear the sirens, just go.

285
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,235
- I think I bought you about 10 minutes.
- That was...

286
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,736
...diabolical.

287
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,409
- Honey, we have to form a plan.
- Babe, deep breath.

288
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,244
It's gonna be okay. I have an idea.

289
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,580
- Okay, I'm listening.
- All right.

290
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,374
We need to dive out of the car.
We'll be fine.

291
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,085
- All we need is a sturdy combat roll.
- Ah, I can't do it.

292
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,172
Of course you can.
You have done way harder things.

293
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,425
- We need to just open the door, roll out.
- You don't understand.

294
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,760
I went to Agent Provocateur
and got an outfit.

295
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,597
The panties were optional
and I didn't opt to wear them.

296
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,601
- Really?
- Surprise.

297
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,478
Whoa.

298
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,774
Casey. Casey, finally.

299
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,444
We got big problems.
Ellie and Awesome were abducted.

300
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,779
- Yeah, I know.
- You know?

301
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,449
Yeah.
They were taken by Beckman's men.

302
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,285
- Don't worry. She's helping us.
- Oh, thank God.

303
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,830
We have to get her agent
on the phone, okay?

304
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,500
Ellie and Awesome are probably
freaking out. I'll meet up with the car...

305
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,920
...bring them to Beckman myself.
- Roger that.

306
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,133
Yes, general?

307
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,303
- What kind of lingerie was it again?
- Devon, concentrate!

308
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,473
Okay. Babe, babe,
the car is slowing down. We can do this.

309
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,060
Just like Chuck and Sarah.
Tuck and roll. Okay, ready?

310
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,020
Ready. No peeking.

311
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,234
One, two, three!

312
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,247
- Babe, babe, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

313
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,332
We gotta get out of here.

314
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,011
General, we may have a problem.

315
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,555
See? They're safe with Beckman's men.

316
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,683
We have nothing to worry about.

317
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,271
I'll track them down
and I'll call you back.

318
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,357
Looks like you lost your passengers.

319
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,276
Robyn, what are you doing here?

320
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,570
Oh, Simms.

321
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,996
- I think we lost him.
- Yeah, for now.

322
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,873
Oh, God!

323
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,545
Mr. And Mrs. Bartowski.

324
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,384
No, there's a mistake, okay?
We're the Woodcombs.

325
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,054
Chuck's my brother, though.
Who are you?

326
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,558
Robyn Cunnings, special agent
with the CIA. Somebody's after you.

327
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,228
- Don't worry. I work with your brother.
- You work with Chuck? Where's Chuck?

328
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,273
He's on his way, but I was closer,
so he sent me to get you.

329
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,901
Please, you have to come
with us immediately.

330
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,778
I'm here to help.

331
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,574
Okay, let's go.

332
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,916
Oh, no, is that?

333
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,920
Sarah, where are they?

334
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,090
Thank you.

335
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,802
No, thank you, Mr. Woodcomb.

336
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,270
It's now or never, Morgan.
Move like the wind.

337
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,547
The coded message
was from Decker's men.

338
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,717
They were following Ellie and Awesome,
mistaking them for us.

339
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,636
They shot Simms to cover their tracks.

340
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,138
We have to find whoever is in charge
and stop this.

341
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,309
If they think Ellie and Awesome know
about the Omen, they'll torture them.

342
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,853
Why are we sitting here?
What's the plan?

343
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,564
I'm sorry, Chuck, but for now, we wait.

344
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,317
- They'll call to set up a meet.
- How can we just wait?

345
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:27,738
Ellie and Awesome are probably having
their fingernails ripped out as we speak.

346
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,416
Babe, it's like a real masseuse.

347
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,502
I can literally feel her fingers
on my spine.

348
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,839
Or his or whoever's, but you know.

349
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,385
- Gotta get one of these in the living room.
- Sounds great.

350
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:55,182
Mr. And Mrs. Woodcomb, again,
I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

351
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,059
Your brother will pick you up soon.

352
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,687
In the meantime,
I hope these accommodations suffice.

353
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,648
We reserve this room
only for the most regarded of spies.

354
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:07,111
Can I offer you anything to drink?
A soda pop? Some water, perhaps?

355
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,029
Actually, we were on a date tonight.

356
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,866
So some wine, if possible.

357
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,534
Sangiovese, perhaps?

358
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,456
It would be my pleasure.

359
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,958
Bring that insufferable woman
a bottle of wine...

360
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,669
...and get me Chuck Bartowski
on the phone.

361
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,596
Oh. Ellie, thank God.

362
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,724
Lovely sister you have.
Husband's not so bad, either.

363
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,560
Can't say I'm fond of them
long-term, though.

364
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,355
I don't know who the hell you are, but if
you touch one hair on my sister's head...

365
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,649
Come on, Chuck. Spare us both.

366
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,068
They're comfortable for now
and I prefer it stay that way.

367
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:52,114
But if things get complicated,
I can't guarantee their safety.

368
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,451
Let me tell you
how this is gonna work.

369
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,829
What'd they say?

370
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,250
We have three hours
to deliver the Omen...

371
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,837
...or they kill Ellie and Awesome.

372
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,924
Mm.

373
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,344
- They're bluffing.
- We need to start making a fake to deliver.

374
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,346
What if they figure out it's a fake?

375
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,807
I know you're scared,
but we just can't hand over a weapon.

376
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,602
It's bigger than us, Bartowski.
It's national security.

377
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,771
I promise we will take
every precaution.

378
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,483
I will not let them do anything
to your sister.

379
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,488
You guys are the pros.
You know what you're doing.

380
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,951
So let's go with the fake.

381
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,963
Hey.

382
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,507
Look, I know you're concerned.
Talk to me.

383
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,552
I'm scared. This is a mistake.
This whole plan is a mistake.

384
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,138
Giving them a fake virus is a mistake.
Ellie and Awesome are in danger.

385
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,976
We need to give them the real virus
to get them back. I have to do it alone.

386
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,479
You don't have to do it alone.
There are people here who are with you.

387
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,982
I'm with you,
and I happen to think you're right.

388
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,820
This is my curse. Don't you understand?
People I love are in danger. It's my fault.

389
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,738
- I need to fix it.
- Forget the curse.

390
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,534
I'll go convince Casey and Beckman
that your plan is the right thing to do.

391
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,868
Then we'll go together.

392
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,080
You heard them. They're...
They'll never be on board with this.

393
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,416
Trust me. I will talk to them.

394
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,712
- And what if they say no?
- It's gonna take some time, okay?

395
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,510
- Okay, fine. I'll wait right here.
- Okay.

396
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,024
Honey, I can't find my phone.

397
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,735
Probably just fell out
when we rolled out of the car.

398
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,528
Yeah, you're probably right.

399
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,034
I'm sorry, there was no Sangiovese.

400
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,454
But, uh, I managed to rustle up
some Chardonnay.

401
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:08,208
My apologies if it's not that good.
It's only 2009.

402
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,378
No worries, bro. This'll be fine.

403
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,256
Hardly. I forgot the ice.

404
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,466
Oh.

405
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,593
But we did find this in the car.

406
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,720
Oh, heh.

407
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,555
Thank you.

408
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,813
See, babe?
All's well that ends well, huh?

409
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,440
Right. Heh.

410
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,234
- Anyway, I'll go get the ice.
- Okay.

411
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,740
- What the hell are you doing?
- They're gonna kill us.

412
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,242
What? He just brought us wine.

413
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,829
No, I've been in this situation before.
The CIA doesn't bring you wine.

414
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,415
They stole my phone
and they called Chuck with it.

415
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,794
So it's clearly some
sort of ransom situation.

416
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,588
I don't know... We gotta find another way
to get out of here.

417
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,175
I think we're making a mistake.

418
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,637
Ellie and Awesome are not spies.
They're civilians.

419
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:05,307
We know what this group is capable of.
Fake could put them over the edge.

420
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,435
They're savages.
Reckless and single-minded.

421
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,437
I think we need to support Chuck.

422
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,523
This is his family
and it's my family too now...

423
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,693
...and we need to do everything
we can to protect them.

424
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,946
Let's get the Omen and find Chuck.

425
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,503
Boss, I think you need to look at this.

426
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,341
Hi, there. It's me, Chuck Bartowski.

427
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,720
From the phone call?

428
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,304
Right on time.

429
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,482
Well, hand over the Omen.

430
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,153
You didn't think I was actually dumb
enough to bring it with me, did you?

431
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,321
It's hidden.

432
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,658
Release my family
or you can spend the rest of your lives...

433
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,744
...searching for a virus
you're never gonna find.

434
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,999
Follow me.

435
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,173
What the hell? How did this happen?

436
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,010
I guess you've never met my sister.

437
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:31,185
Upstairs clear.
No sign of the Woodcombs.

438
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:35,189
Copy that.
Orders are shoot to kill on sight.

439
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,358
- This is really hardcore.
- I told you.

440
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:44,531
I'm not giving you anything until I know
my sister and her husband are safe.

441
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,908
Ha!

442
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:49,203
You're not exactly in a position
to bargain now, are you?

443
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,371
There's something
I'm known for, Chuck.

444
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,541
Some people call it torture.

445
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:58,212
I like to think of it
as more of an art form.

446
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,425
You're going to give me
exactly what I want.

447
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,429
And I'm very, very good at this.

448
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,434
- Honey, Chuck came to save us.
- He's in trouble, babe.

449
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,103
- We have to help him.
- We can't just go down there.

450
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,148
- We need a tactical advantage.
- Okay.

451
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,901
I can handle anything
you throw at me.

452
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,070
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

453
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,613
They always say that.

454
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,116
So sad.

455
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,244
Bring out the Toy.

456
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,297
Whoa, whoa, really? Really?
That's the Toy?

457
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:46,051
I don't think children should be involved
with that device in any way, shape or form.

458
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,970
Shh, shh.

459
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,973
Okay, all the lights are hooked up
to that electrical panel.

460
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,768
If we can get that guard away, we can
short the circuits, cause a blackout.

461
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,438
That's genius, babe.
Okay, okay, you cause a distraction.

462
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,691
I'll blow the power
and I'll go grab Chuck.

463
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,777
We can do this, honey. Like real spies.

464
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,696
Babe, right now we are real spies.

465
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,155
Do you ever cry, Chuck?

466
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,659
Sometimes,
particularly during sports movies.

467
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,620
Field of Dreams is just gut-wrenching,
but also uplifting.

468
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,164
A good cry is cathartic.

469
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,503
I need a piece of metal,
something to short the fuse.

470
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,798
Uh... Oh, here, here, here.

471
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,468
You can't jam metal
in the circuit breaker.

472
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:32,306
- You're gonna burn your hands.
- Right, I need something to insulate it.

473
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,017
- Here, shirt.
- Right, shirt.

474
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,480
Whoa.

475
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:44,026
- You look hot.
- So do you.

476
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,905
- I love you.
- Yeah.

477
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,244
One last chance.

478
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,247
Omen or pain?

479
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,440
The Omen or pain?

480
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,859
Shouldn't there be a third option? Heh.

481
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,529
What are you doing?

482
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,908
- Who, me?
- Where's your shirt?

483
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,371
Heh. It's kind of a long story.
Let me tell you the short one.

484
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,583
This is going to be very, very painful.

485
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,213
Here we go.

486
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,424
Hey!

487
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,426
What was that?

488
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,727
Sorry, Chuck.

489
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,896
There's usually a backup generator.

490
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:04,690
Oh.

491
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,400
Just FYI.

492
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,110
Oh, my God.

493
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,073
I can't believe he'd do the drop
on his own without me.

494
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:17,786
He thinks it's the Bartowski Curse, that
he can protect me by leaving me behind.

495
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,415
- And instead, he's walking into a trap.
- Let's just hope he's smart.

496
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,583
If he gives up the Omen,
they're all dead.

497
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,297
Thanks for trying to save me.
I really do appreciate it.

498
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,592
No sweat, man. It just kind of
seemed like the right thing to do.

499
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,428
Are you done?

500
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:39,474
Tell me where you hid the Omen
or I permanently change this man's face.

501
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,811
Not the face. No.

502
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:47,482
Out the front doors, 30 paces south,
under the yellow rosebush to the right.

503
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,818
You're joking.

504
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,988
You're not joking.

505
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,389
Oh, my God. Thank you.

506
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:23,310
- It's gonna be okay.
- Rescuing Bartowskis is our business.

507
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:30,984
I'm a little upset I didn't get
to use the Toy. It's truly my favorite part.

508
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,571
Do you have any idea
how much damage that virus will cause?

509
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,866
In truth, Chuck,
the virus is just a piece of the plan.

510
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,495
- What do you mean?
- Means I don't know.

511
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,997
I'm just doing my job,
cleaning up Decker's mess.

512
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,334
- I release the virus and then I'm done.
- What happens now?

513
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,544
That's the real surprise, isn't it?

514
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:54,007
You've pissed off
a lot of powerful people, Chuck.

515
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,888
There. The Omen is officially
unleashed upon the world.

516
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,517
Sorry, I'm afraid
I don't need you anymore.

517
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,894
You still don't know
who you're dealing with, do you?

518
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,231
Right now there's a spy in your midst.

519
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,192
She'll take you and all your men down
to save her husband.

520
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,695
Your sister? The doctor?

521
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,869
Are you kidding me? Again?

522
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,229
All clear.

523
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,897
All clear.

524
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,073
- Put down the gun.
- Now.

525
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,118
Walker. Casey.

526
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,580
- I give up.
- Robyn Cunnings.

527
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,415
You don't get off that easy.

528
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,004
Safe. Come on out.

529
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,424
Chuck. Devon, honey, are you okay?

530
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,718
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good, I'm good.

531
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,887
Mm. Mm, I'm just really cold.

532
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,431
I love you. Mm, I love you.

533
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,183
We are so not meant to be spies.

534
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,895
Don't worry. I'm fine too, really.

535
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,983
I love you so much.

536
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:39,529
- You're upset. I can see you're upset.
- This isn't over.

537
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,116
Hey, Sarah... Guys?

538
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,455
I'm still... I'm still tied.
I'm still bound.

539
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,457
Little help.

540
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,964
Looks like we found a conspirator.

541
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,716
You're gonna tell me everything.

542
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:03,345
What exactly the plan is.
Who you're working for. All of it.

543
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:07,974
I have nothing to say to you.
You're not my general.

544
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:15,565
You know, we found something
interesting at the factory.

545
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,403
I'm very excited to see how it works.

546
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,240
I believe you call it the Toy.

547
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,841
Robyn has confessed
to the conspiracy.

548
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,177
I am happy to say
on behalf of the U.S. Government...

549
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,555
...all charges against this team
have been dropped.

550
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:52,018
Oh, and Casey, your record shall
be expunged. You're free to go home.

551
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,395
Hmm.

552
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:57,691
General, that's all fantastic news,
uh, but what about the Omen virus?

553
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,943
- Who did Robyn work for?
- Robyn didn't know.

554
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:05,699
But we have our top people working on
the virus. For now, well done, team.

555
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,870
It was a bit like old times, wasn't it?

556
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,044
So...

557
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,507
...no living on the lam,
running from the law.

558
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,802
Sounded a little romantic, didn't it?

559
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,389
- You're still mad?
- You left without me.

560
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,391
I'm sorry, Sarah.

561
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,728
I'm sorry. It was stupid.
I didn't wanna take you down with me...

562
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,063
...and my family's curse.
- There is no curse.

563
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,567
You're not your father. You're not fated
to be alone or hurt anybody.

564
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,612
Those things happen because of the
choices that people make, that you make.

565
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,409
You're right. I'll never do it again,
leave without you.

566
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:54,414
The Bartowski Family Curse ends here,
and not with me, with us.

567
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:05,967
If you ever go out alone again,
just remember, I'm a trained assassin.

568
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,804
- Noted.
- Good.

569
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,185
Wouldn't shoot me, would you?

570
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,856
Yeah? Great news, man.

571
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,443
The agents are dispersing.
I wonder what's going on.

572
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,279
Yup, you got it, Chuck.
Mission aborted.

573
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,323
I'll see you soon. Okay.

574
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,117
Great news. We're not on the lam.

575
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,536
- Don't need Chuck's P.A.N.T.S.
- That's great.

576
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,163
But you just got it.

577
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:39,459
It's all right. I'll shoot over to the
apartment and put it back. No problem.

578
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,879
Just gotta ask,
what's in Chuck's P.A.N.T. S?

579
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,715
No, no, no. Not allowed.

580
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,846
There's something
I can show you, however.

581
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,102
I want you to have this. Uh...

582
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,647
You know, in case something
terrible has happened to me.

583
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,148
You keep an eye on it.

584
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,238
- Last night was nuts, huh?
- Heh. Crazy.

585
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,823
It was crazy. It was.

586
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,785
But despite all the craziness,
kind of a nice date.

587
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,663
Morgan, that was not a date.

588
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:22,335
Yeah, no, well,
not in the conventional sense, right?

589
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,675
- I should get going.
- Heh. Okay.

590
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,718
Okay. Um...

591
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,179
Thank you for everything.

592
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,641
- Yes. You too.
- All right.

593
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,616
Ugh.

594
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:58,371
I know that I am supposed to be tired
and a little freaked out...

595
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,875
...but last night was...
- Kind of incredible.

596
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,627
Yeah.

597
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:08,715
When you cracked that baddie over the
head with the bottle, that was pretty hot.

598
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,552
I was gonna say the same thing
when you took out that electrical panel.

599
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,473
What were you saying earlier
about Agent Provocateur?

600
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,608
- So all's forgiven?
- Maybe.

601
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,487
Okay, fine, all's forgiven.

602
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,198
Oh, something's wrong
with the computer.

603
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,625
You mean all the computers.

604
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,712
What is going on?

605
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,299
It's the Omen virus.

606
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,469
- It's affecting our entire system.
- It's not just our system.

607
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,596
That is the Internet.
That is everybody.

608
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:04,646
Oh, my God. This is all my fault.
I let it out and now the code is digging in.

609
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:08,149
It's hiding in every networked computer
in the world, just waiting.

610
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,527
Waiting for what?

611
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,739
I don't know.
