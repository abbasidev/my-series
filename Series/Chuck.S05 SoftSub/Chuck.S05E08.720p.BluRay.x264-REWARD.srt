1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,253
Here are a few things
you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,714
I'll be in solitary the rest of my life...

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,133
...but one thing's gonna keep me warm
at night.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,759
Do you remember Hungary?

5
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,346
Does Chuck know about the baby?

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:23,188
Hey, honey, I haven't
heard from you for a while. I miss you.

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:28,027
Wherever you are,
I hope you're okay, safe.

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:33,032
I want you to know, if you ever feel
like you need a place to come home to...

9
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,785
...well, you have one.

10
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,000
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

11
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,670
- Are we a go?
- Affirmative.

12
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,580
Ryker, I'm in.

13
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,124
- How many?
- I count 11.

14
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,584
Copy that.

15
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,378
On my word, take them out.

16
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,630
All of them.

17
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:37,221
The men in that room slaughtered
the couple that lived in this house.

18
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,682
Given the opportunity,
they'll kill you too.

19
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,185
Now move.

20
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,346
- Next?
- Double doors. Three o'clock.

21
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,473
The package is inside.

22
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,237
Ryker, the package...

23
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,780
The baby is the package.

24
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,699
Grab it and get out of there.

25
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,784
But what am I supposed...?

26
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,620
Move, Walker.
I'm your handler and that's an order.

27
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,430
Oh, my God. He knows.

28
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,269
Hey, honey.

29
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,229
You ready for my big surprise?

30
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,525
Absolutely.
You know how much I love surprises.

31
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,068
Chuck, where are we?

32
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,070
Okay, here we go. A little farther.

33
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,073
Straight, straight, straight, and ta-da.

34
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,745
Oh, my God, this is the house.

35
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,496
It's our house.

36
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,915
How did you do this?

37
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:31,835
The real estate agent gave me the keys
so we could try it out for the weekend.

38
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,631
Full disclosure, I think she
might have a little crush on me, so...

39
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:39,176
Chuck, this is beautiful,
but we still can't afford it.

40
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,553
Actually, we can.
I was talking to Beckman...

41
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,474
...and, apparently, her offer to rejoin
the CIA comes with a signing bonus...

42
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,434
...enough for a down payment...

43
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,771
...and that dresser I've been eyeing
at Anthropologie.

44
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:56,109
- Uh, I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything. Just visualize.

45
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,905
Think to yourself, "What would my life
be like in such an amazing home...

46
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,532
...with the most dashing man
I've ever met?"

47
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,368
- Okay.
- All right, all right.

48
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,203
So after a hard day's work...

49
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,122
...we come home
to the sweet, sweet sounds...

50
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,792
...of Nina Simone emanating
from our record player...

51
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,295
...which would fit, I don't know, say,
in this corner right behind me, huh?

52
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,966
Open floor plan, great for relaxing
and watching your husband cook.

53
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,426
Cooking and talking,
talking and cooking.

54
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,304
This area right here,
perfect for my game chairs.

55
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,139
Or not.

56
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:30,519
Ahem. Maybe. We'll talk about that.
But this... This is perfect.

57
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,604
The door frame?

58
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,816
When Ellie and I were kids...

59
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,069
...our dad would measure us
to see how tall we were getting.

60
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,531
I remember being so excited
when I was finally taller than Ellie.

61
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,035
It took a while,
but tenth grade was a good year for me.

62
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,791
What's the matter? What have I done?
Something's missing? Wrong?

63
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,712
- The game chairs? Those are negotiable.
- No, Chuck, it's not that. Um...

64
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,674
Look, I want this house and the life
that you have envisioned for us.

65
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,593
I want every single part of it.

66
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,346
It's just that something urgent
has come up.

67
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,766
What is it?
You know you can tell me anything.

68
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,061
Well, that's just it.

69
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,897
This time, Chuck, I can't tell you.

70
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,991
There are more men coming.

71
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,951
Get the package and get out of there.

72
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,915
It's gonna be okay.

73
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,464
Sarah. Sarah, please.

74
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,384
Just tell me where you're going.
Tell me what happened.

75
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,262
We decided no more secrets, no more
doing things on our own. Your words.

76
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,516
I know. I know that.
It's just... I need you to trust me on this.

77
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:36,228
- It's not that I don't trust you.
- What's so urgent, Bartowski?

78
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,105
Yeah,
why make Casey come down here?

79
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm gonna follow everywhere,
and I was doing something important.

80
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,527
No, I wasn't.

81
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,821
- Where you going, Walker?
- I'll be back.

82
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,574
Just wait. Just wait one second.
Hear me out.

83
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,995
Yes, I love you, so, of course, I'm going
to wanna know what's going on...

84
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:59,126
...why this mission needs to be so
secretive, why you need so many guns...

85
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,711
...but I'm willing to put that aside.
- Really?

86
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,046
- Really?
- Really?

87
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,340
You're not helping.

88
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,467
Husbands ask a lot of questions.

89
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,136
Who doesn't? Carmichael Industries.

90
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:13,348
And as CEO of Carmichael Industries,
I would like to offer you our services.

91
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,808
Pro bono, of course.

92
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,979
It wouldn't change anything.
There are things I can't tell you.

93
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,939
You're the client. You're the boss.

94
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,442
Whatever this is, Walker,
backup couldn't hurt.

95
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,325
Here's what I can tell you.

96
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,744
The man that we're going after
is Kieran Ryker.

97
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,746
Ex-CIA, very dangerous.

98
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,291
Before we took down Shaw,
he sent a communiqué.

99
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,127
I'm gonna send one back as Shaw
so I can set up a meet.

100
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,504
Morgan, you're gonna stay in Castle.

101
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,008
Chuck and Casey, pack your bags.
We're going to Budapest tonight.

102
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,302
All right. Great. I'll bring a sweater.

103
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,012
Good.

104
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,933
You sure you can keep your mouth shut
this time?

105
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,312
Of course. Jeez, Casey,
you act like I haven't learned anything...

106
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,856
...in the last four years.

107
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,859
I need to know what's going on.
I've done some research.

108
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,569
Research on Hungarian culture...

109
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,490
...cross-referenced with horrible things
that Sarah might wanna keep a secret.

110
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,450
Didn't you tell Sarah you wouldn't...?

111
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,785
Wikipedia-ing facts about Hungary
is harmless.

112
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,580
I had no idea
the Rubik's Cube was invented there.

113
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,625
I just think you should give Sarah
the benefit of the doubt.

114
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,628
Any time you disagreed about anything,
she's been right.

115
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,380
- I can name four or five different times.
- No, I know.

116
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:31,092
It's just... I'm worried that we won't be
prepared if something goes wrong.

117
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,720
But if you'll be here in Castle,
we'll be okay.

118
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,138
Yeah.

119
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,101
Bummer about the timing. Supposed to
have game night with Ellie and Awesome.

120
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,772
Alex was gonna come by too, and I still
don't know where her and I stand.

121
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,107
Why do you have to cancel?
You don't have to.

122
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,819
Have game night in Castle. Ellie and
Awesome have wanted to check it out.

123
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,572
They keep asking me
tactical questions...

124
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,784
...and using the term "ghost op"
as if they know what it means.

125
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,871
Plus, this way, if anything does
go wrong, we'll be ready.

126
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,790
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

127
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:12,092
Hey. Listen, I know you can't talk to
Bartowski about what's really going on.

128
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:16,221
That blabbermouth can't keep a secret
to save his life, but you can tell me, hmm?

129
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:21,017
I appreciate that, John,
but the less you know the better.

130
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,938
Really.

131
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,484
Sure. No problem.

132
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,377
Walker.

133
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,551
Uh, look,
before I hand over the package...

134
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,679
...I need to know
what's gonna happen to her.

135
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,057
I'm afraid that's above your pay grade.

136
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,771
This mission wasn't sanctioned
by the CIA, was it?

137
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,070
Look, we did a good thing.

138
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,325
The men you took out
killed that girl's entire family.

139
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:24,080
She's the only heir to a massive fortune,
so whoever has her has access to it.

140
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,582
She's the key.

141
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,417
And you want the money?

142
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,255
Listen, I know this job is everything
in your life...

143
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,675
...but someday you're gonna realize
it's not enough...

144
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,512
...that keeping your whole life a secret
from everyone who loves you...

145
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,514
...is too much.

146
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,183
But you don't have a family.

147
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,898
That money's just for you. And what's
gonna happen to her when you take it?

148
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,779
She has claim to that fortune...

149
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,114
...and she can come back
and take it from you.

150
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,618
And you expect me to believe
that you're gonna let her live?

151
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,832
You're a rotten handler, Ryker.

152
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,334
Okay.

153
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,839
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Stay. Stay.

154
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,602
So, honey, this Ryker fellow.

155
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,021
Anything about him
you'd care to elaborate on?

156
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,816
Any details we should know?
How he takes his coffee?

157
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,736
No. You know everything
that you need to know.

158
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,574
Okay, I'm gonna be at that cafe
waiting for him.

159
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,576
I need the two of you to stay here...

160
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,704
...surveilling the street
to see if anybody is watching me.

161
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,080
Okay.

162
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,752
No. Wait. No. You know what, Sarah?
Sarah, no. Not okay.

163
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,630
Can't we just set aside the whole
CEO of Carmichael Industries thing?

164
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,965
That wasn't the deal.

165
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,218
I'm your husband who would do
anything for you, and I'm worried.

166
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,053
Okay, look, this isn't about me.

167
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,098
There are lives in danger
because of something that...

168
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,102
If I tell you, I'm not only compromising
their safety, but your safety as well.

169
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,439
Okay, so, when you see Ryker,
what then? What are you gonna do?

170
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,066
I'm gonna kill him, Chuck.

171
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,540
Still nothing.

172
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,960
I know I overreact to stuff like this...

173
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,922
...but there's something about this
that I do not like.

174
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,258
This time, you might be right, Bartowski.
Did some digging.

175
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,677
Turns out,
Ryker's whole file's been redacted.

176
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,515
Which means whatever happened
between him and Sarah ended badly.

177
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,910
- Sarah, what's going on?
- It's nothing.

178
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,413
I need you to follow the waiter.
I think he may be working with Ryker.

179
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,167
Don't move. We'll be right down.

180
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,425
Where...? Where's Sarah?

181
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,429
Got him.

182
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,476
Sarah, wait. Wait.
Wait, where are you going?

183
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:17,522
Ryker figured out it was me.
I'm sorry. I gotta go do this alone.

184
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,151
The waiter. Come on. Come on.

185
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,659
No word from Chuck. Everything
must be going well on the mish.

186
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,328
- Your turn, bro.
- All right.

187
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,540
Okay.

188
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,251
You know what?
I feel so lucky to have a lady...

189
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,461
...to share my little plastic car with.

190
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,215
And not afraid to put
a couple of kids in the backseat.

191
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,759
Not now, obviously. That'd be crazy.
But someday.

192
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,637
You know,
commitment is not something that I fear.

193
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,890
Well, I'm keeping my options open.

194
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:56,603
I noticed. There you are in your little
pink car by yourself. Must be so lonely.

195
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,771
What is going on?

196
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,648
- I thought they worked everything out.
- Me too.

197
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,400
Maybe they need some alone time.

198
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,487
Great. Because if I have to spin for a new
mortgage rate again, I'm going to die.

199
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,489
We're actively wasting our babysitter.

200
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,034
Okay, let's speed things along here.

201
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,870
Then you and I can have a little look-see
in the Castle.

202
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,204
Ellie.

203
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,831
- Your turn.
- Yeah, my turn.

204
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,875
Hey, spin a ten, game is over.

205
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,961
- Honey, spin a ten.
- Okay. Ha, ha.

206
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,350
Millionaire Estates! Yay!

207
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,352
- Yeah, baby.
- We won at Life.

208
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,854
- We did.
- Yeah.

209
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,690
Okay. We'll take a little breather
before the next game.

210
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,985
- Bye.
- Good kids. Heh, heh.

211
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:54,953
Oh! Our hands touched for a second,
and I kind of got, like, a chill on my back.

212
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,205
It's kind of funny, just because...

213
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,456
Morgan.

214
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,291
What am I really doing here?

215
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,753
I'm not here to try anything,
if that's what you're asking.

216
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,297
Unless what you're asking
is that you want me to...

217
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,175
- No.
- That's what I'm saying. No, of course.

218
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,470
There's no quick fix for us.

219
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,306
It's just gonna take some time.

220
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,892
I know that. Hey, I totally get it.

221
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,230
How about a game of Sorry!?

222
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,275
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

223
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,028
Sorry. Sorry.

224
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,702
Whoo! Yeah. Once again,
look who doesn't need the Intersect.

225
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,121
Where's Ryker? Where the hell is he?

226
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,838
- Do you speak Hungarian?
- No.

227
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,882
Do you,
Mr. I-Don't-Need-The-Intersect?

228
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,468
I think I got a phrase book on me
somewhere.

229
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,028
What are you doing?

230
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,487
I got her in the deli.

231
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,699
What? She wasn't busy. It's Europe.

232
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,536
Would you mind asking this gentleman
what his business is with Ryker?

233
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,806
He said this man you are asking about
gave him 20,000 forint...

234
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,560
...to put a note under a coffee cup.
He doesn't know anything else.

235
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,354
He's lying.

236
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,274
I think you understand
every word I'm saying.

237
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:52,195
You're gonna tell me where Ryker is
or you're gonna lose a lung.

238
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,405
Where the hell is Ryker?

239
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,412
- Any sign of her?
- Nothing yet, sir.

240
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,375
You didn't think I was gonna use
the front door, did you?

241
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,377
I knew you wouldn't use
the front door.

242
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,922
You tell me everything Shaw told you
right now.

243
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,928
What is that?

244
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,852
Oh, God, I don't know what you want.
What do you want? What do you need?

245
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:30,691
Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. Okay.

246
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,364
Okay.

247
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,993
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom. It's me.

248
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,871
Honey? Are you okay?

249
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,333
- Where are you?
- I'm just... I'm in a bit of a situation here.

250
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,086
- Are you hurt?
- No, no, no, it's nothing like that.

251
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,921
I was on a mission and...

252
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,674
I'm looking after a baby.
She won't stop crying.

253
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,009
I'm not sure what to do.
Can you help me?

254
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,346
Okay. Uh, yeah. Is she wet?

255
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,808
Uh, no. No, it's not that,
and I fed her an hour ago.

256
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,686
- Did you try rocking her?
- What? No.

257
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,564
Okay, honey,
I want you to bring her close to you.

258
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,857
She needs to feel safe.

259
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:15,194
- She needs to feel your warmth.
- Okay.

260
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,821
Okay, she's close. Now what?

261
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,949
Okay, now, just rock her.

262
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,326
Slowly, back and forth and...

263
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,790
This is not working. I'm not good at this.
What am I supposed to do?

264
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,586
Don't freak out, honey. It's okay.
It's okay. Just, um...

265
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,379
Just try singing to her.

266
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,633
Um, what am I supposed to sing?

267
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,889
Do you remember the lullaby I used
to sing to you when you were little?

268
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,975
Yeah. Uh, I think so.

269
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,730
Slumber, my darling

270
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:57,695
Mother is here
Guarding your dreams

271
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,200
From all terror and fear

272
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:10,082
Sunlight has passed
And the twilight has gone

273
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,754
Slumber my darling

274
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,799
And the night's coming on

275
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,306
Did it work?

276
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,393
Yeah. Yeah, it worked, Mom.

277
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,812
Thank you.

278
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,503
Tie her up.

279
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,263
I have to give you credit
on that fake communiqué.

280
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,892
Unfortunately for you, I already knew
that Shaw was back in prison.

281
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,854
So tell me,
did you just come all this way...

282
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,941
...to have a cup of coffee
with your old handler?

283
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,695
You're asking the wrong question.

284
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,365
Just get to the point, Ryker.

285
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,244
The point
is that it's not about money anymore.

286
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,914
You know why I requested
to be your handler?

287
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,126
Why I brought you to Budapest
in the first place?

288
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,712
Because your file screamed "loner."

289
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,382
You had no family to speak of,
never trusted anyone.

290
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,469
I knew that you could keep a secret
because you had no one to tell.

291
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,055
Uh-huh.

292
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,558
And you still don't, do you?

293
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,061
I bet no one even knows
that you're here.

294
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,980
Do they?

295
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,066
And that's why
you're gonna die today.

296
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,444
Unless you tell me something.

297
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,573
Where is she?

298
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,159
Shaw told me she's still alive.

299
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,161
Where's the little girl?

300
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,998
What?

301
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,752
You don't know where she is
and you're never gonna find out.

302
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,671
That's why I came here.

303
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,923
That's all I needed to know.

304
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,135
Sir, there's a problem in the foyer.

305
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,931
I'm not done with you.

306
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,603
Stay with her.
You two come with me.

307
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,108
- What the hell?
- They made me talk.

308
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,034
- What are you looking at?
- Sarah. Sarah, baby, are you okay?

309
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,621
Move. He was just a distraction.
Let's go.

310
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,797
Tell me where the nukes are, doctor.

311
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,928
Or should I call you Damian?

312
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,306
You may know my real name...

313
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:17,353
...but that doesn't mean
that I'll give you my intel, Cobress.

314
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,523
Well, I have ways of making you talk.

315
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,403
Oh, okay. Ow, ow, ow.

316
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,906
- Is this part of the bit, babe?
- No, I'm stuck. It's my earring.

317
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,826
- I'm stuck.
- Okay. Hold on, hold on. All right.

318
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,704
- You all right?
- Yes.

319
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,081
What was that accent?

320
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,043
- My British accent.
- Really?

321
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,171
Morgan, stop.
I thought I could do this, but I can't.

322
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,509
If you don't want
to play a game, that's okay.

323
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,553
You know what?
We could watch a movie.

324
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,596
You broke up with me in a text.

325
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,515
I don't know how to trust you again.

326
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,017
I think I should probably just go.

327
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,686
- Babe.
- Babe.

328
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,355
Maybe alone time
isn't what they needed.

329
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,692
- We have to do something.
- Yeah.

330
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,697
- Hey there.
- Hey. I'm actually heading home. No...

331
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,700
- Devon, really...
- I think you're making a mistake.

332
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,869
Hey, you got a sec?

333
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,745
- What's that?
- What?

334
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,206
- The...
- Oh, nothing. Just...

335
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,043
I actually wanted to talk to you
about Alex.

336
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,548
I don't think you're gonna understand
what I'm going through here.

337
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,886
I don't know if you know this,
but when Devon and I started dating...

338
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,721
...we took a break for a while.

339
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,097
What happened?

340
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,225
As you probably know,
I was an A & F model.

341
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,061
I gotta admit, I let it go to my head.

342
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,980
He was a real ass.

343
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:48,235
For our first anniversary, he gave me
a signed photograph of himself.

344
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,572
He was carrying a canoe
in nothing but suit pants.

345
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,948
So I broke up with him.

346
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,325
I had to win her back.

347
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,745
I couldn't lose a woman like that.
So I pulled out all the stops.

348
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,665
I made a Tracy Chapman mixtape. You
know, got front-row tickets to Les Mis.

349
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,085
I even baked those little cupcakes
with the peanut butter inside.

350
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,254
- Yeah, I like those.
- Yeah, so does she.

351
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,089
- Did it work?
- No.

352
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,259
So then what did he do?
I mean, why did you take him back?

353
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:16,180
I don't think he knows this,
but I came home from work one day...

354
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,642
...and he was sitting on my doorstep
with a bunch of calla lilies.

355
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:23,270
He must have been there for hours.
He was on the phone with his mom...

356
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,439
...and he was so sweet with her.

357
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,651
He really cared
about what she was saying.

358
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,779
I remembered
that was the man I fell in love with.

359
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,365
Calla lilies. Works every time.

360
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,621
- Devon, I appreciate this, but I gotta...
- No, Alex, come on.

361
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,999
Now, yeah, we all make mistakes,
and Morgan made some big ones.

362
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,795
- Yeah.
- Trust me, he loves you.

363
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,800
She's in pain, Morgan,
but if she's the one that you love, just...

364
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,638
You just have to be yourself.
Stop trying to force it.

365
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,725
You are a catch, okay?

366
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,103
She's gonna realize that soon enough.

367
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,826
- Hey. You're up. Feeling better?
- Yeah.

368
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,538
You were in and out, so I took the liberty
of putting your dresses away.

369
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:27,334
I wasn't sure if they went on the left
or the right, so I went with the right.

370
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,008
Uh, Sarah, look.

371
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:41,223
You know that I'm not the kind of guy
who says things like this...

372
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:46,437
...but whatever it is
that you thought you needed to hide...

373
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,275
...not telling me the truth,
going out on your own like that...

374
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,696
...I think it was a mistake.

375
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,077
I think that you were wrong.

376
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,581
You're right.

377
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,087
When Ryker captured me in Budapest,
I kept thinking:

378
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,589
"Why am I doing it this way?

379
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,383
Why do I feel like I have to do everything
on my own?"

380
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,386
But it's what my dad taught me,
the way the CIA taught me...

381
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:23,223
...that you can only ever
trust yourself.

382
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,144
But the truth is that I trust you
completely...

383
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,980
...and I wanna tell you everything.

384
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,290
Hello?

385
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,501
How are you holding up?

386
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,423
Look,
I know what Ryker made you do.

387
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,133
I know everything.

388
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,135
I was just obeying orders.

389
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,596
There's no need to worry
about that now.

390
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,140
Where's the package?

391
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,812
If I had the package
in my possession, then what?

392
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,272
CIA would take it into custody,
and then...

393
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,443
- Could you guarantee its protection?
- You know I can't make guarantees.

394
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,530
The CIA keeps records
on these kind of things.

395
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:23,450
Records that a man like Ryker
might be able to get his hands on.

396
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,327
And who knows what he would do.

397
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,746
He's a wild card.

398
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:30,999
Agent Walker?

399
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,461
Sarah.

400
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,880
I'm not in possession of the package,
director.

401
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,966
It must be somewhere else.

402
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,634
This is your home too.

403
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,302
It doesn't have to be this way.

404
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,139
Mom, I've thought a lot about this...

405
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,141
...and I can't stay.

406
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,476
Because for both of you to be safe...

407
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,187
...well, I can never see you again.

408
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,194
When the CIA recruited me,
I was on the run with Dad.

409
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,156
We changed identities so much
they never knew you existed.

410
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,409
And we can't let them find out
about you now.

411
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:09,246
When you were a little girl, all I ever
wanted for you was a normal life.

412
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,834
But you went off with your father,
and he was never one to...

413
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,590
You just...
You never got to go trick-or-treating...

414
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,508
...or play on the soccer team or...

415
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,803
Never got to go to prom
or homecoming.

416
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,557
I just wish I could have given you
at least some of that.

417
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,105
Don't forget this.

418
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,943
Um, yeah, she likes to be wrapped up
in a blanket. It helps her sleep.

419
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,571
She likes the sound of the rain.
And I've noticed...

420
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,947
It's okay, honey.

421
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,327
I'll take good care of her.

422
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,956
Yeah, I know. I know.

423
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,254
Mom?

424
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,548
Yes?

425
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:08,639
Going to prom
and soccer games...

426
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,226
...and all those normal things
that you wanted for me...

427
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,441
Will you just make sure
that she gets them?

428
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,363
Of course I will.

429
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,243
Thank you.

430
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,292
So the baby has been with your mom
this whole time?

431
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,337
Yeah. Yeah, now I know
that they're both safe.

432
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,589
Ryker has no idea where she is.

433
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,092
He has no idea
that my mom ever existed.

434
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,306
I'm so sorry that I never told you
any of this before. I really am.

435
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,434
I just... I didn't wanna put anybody else
in danger.

436
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,145
But thank you for trusting me.

437
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,815
Babe, I love you.

438
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,616
- What was that?
- Yeah, what was that?

439
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,294
That's feedback.

440
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,631
It's a bug.

441
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,939
Ryker. Oh, my God, he knows
that the baby is with my mom.

442
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,861
I've been looking forward
to this little visit for a long time.

443
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,821
Let's go.

444
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,623
Your call has
been forwarded to an aut...

445
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,334
She's not answering.
I sent her coordinates.

446
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,419
I just hope she remembers the signal.

447
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,280
Mom? Mom?

448
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,659
Please remember the signal. Please.

449
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,373
- Did you get a hold of Morgan?
- Not yet, but I'll keep trying him.

450
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,719
Stay there.

451
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,840
I've got her.

452
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,805
- Nice apron.
- Thanks.

453
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:41,351
Guys, this street is permit parking only.
You're gonna have to move your vehicle.

454
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:27,981
You came so close to keeping her safe,
you really did.

455
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,608
But I'm gonna kill you.

456
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,651
And then I'm gonna kill your mom.

457
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,654
And then after I get that money...

458
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,324
...you know what I'm gonna do
with that little girl? Hmm?

459
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,909
Get up.

460
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,376
You just don't quit, do you?

461
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:52,255
But you always manage
to make the same mistake.

462
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:58,261
Even when you have a team,
here you are all alone.

463
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,931
When the hell are you gonna learn?

464
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,775
I'm not alone.

465
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,820
She'll never have nightmares.

466
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,490
And she'll never even know
that you existed.

467
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:23,912
She's gonna have the life
that she deserves. A normal one.

468
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,843
- Sarah. Thank God you're okay.
- We got Ryker's men.

469
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,636
My mom saw the signal.

470
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,681
She must be at the coordinates I left.
She remembered.

471
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,267
Okay,
this is where I make my comeback now.

472
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,311
This is where I make my come...
Every time, this is where I...

473
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,067
What? You are good.
You are good. You're using cheat codes.

474
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,737
This is what I... No, you... Come on, you...
What? Some kind of...

475
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,141
I missed you.

476
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,643
I know.

477
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:41,489
Molly, I want you to meet
someone very important.

478
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,452
This is your sister. Sarah.

479
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,830
Hi, Molly. It's nice to meet you.

480
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,041
Nice to meet you too.

481
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,867
- Who's this?
- This is Rex.

482
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,160
Hi, Rex.

483
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,872
I used to have a stuffed dog too, when I
was little and I named him Bunny.

484
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,999
That's a funny name for a dog.

485
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,501
- I know. Ha, ha.
- Heh, heh.

486
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:39,172
You know, I can't even begin to tell you
how excited I am that I get to meet you.

487
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,842
It means a lot to me too.
More than you know.

488
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,681
It's been so long since I've seen her.

489
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,184
She was always a tough little thing,
you know.

490
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,061
But I worried about her.

491
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:57,232
Growing up mostly with her father,
she always kept to herself.

492
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:05,991
I know I don't know you really well yet,
but thank you for giving her this.

493
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm gonna practice.

494
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,753
Bartowski and his fancy chardonnay.

495
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,256
Don't worry.
I know where Sarah keeps the Scotch.

496
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,718
- Kitchen, top left cabinet.
- Nice.

497
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,436
You were pretty good
with Molly today.

498
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,564
Well, you know,
I'm kind of a sweet guy...

499
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:43,737
...when I'm not in douchey Intersect
brain-melting, life-ruining phase.

500
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,910
Mission accomplished today, huh?

501
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,080
Yep. Looks like Morgan
finally found the right girl.

502
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,457
I know how he feels.

503
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,544
- Aw.
- Your favorite.

504
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,256
- Honey, you didn't have to do that.
- I wanted to.

505
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,053
I'm the lucky one now. Is this Dog?

506
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,807
- Rex. I like that.
- Joining the CIA...

507
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,560
...and giving up everything you did...

508
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,063
...did you ever think
it would lead you here?

509
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,108
- No.
- Don't you? Ha, ha!

510
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:27,781
No, but Chuck's taught me that every
now and then, it's okay to be surprised.

511
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,253
It's good to have you back,
Agent Walker.

512
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:46,925
Sometimes when an agent goes through
what you did, we lose them.

513
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,802
Well, you're not gonna lose me, sir.

514
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,471
But I am done with handlers.

515
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,306
Oh, I agree.

516
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:57,268
In fact, I think that it's time
for you to become one.

517
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,687
I have a new assignment for you.

518
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,815
Something stateside.

519
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,989
You think you can handle this one?

520
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,664
I like it here.

521
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,291
Me too.

522
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:28,299
You know, I really want the life
that you imagined for us, Chuck...

523
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,343
...but if we go back to the CIA...

524
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:34,764
...it's just gonna be missions and secrets
that we have no control over.

525
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,018
What are you saying?

526
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,314
I gave my life to the CIA
for a really long time...

527
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,361
...and I chose it
over my family and my friends...

528
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:52,031
...and that was the right thing
for me to do at the time...

529
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,575
...but I'm different now.

530
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,204
You know, things have changed.
You've changed me.

531
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,500
I don't wanna go back.

532
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,503
I wanna turn down Beckman's offer.

533
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:19,017
Okay.

534
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,061
We don't need that bonus...

535
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,816
...and we don't need this house
because all we need is each other.

536
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,618
Sarah?

537
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,080
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

538
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:45,210
I am carving our names
into the frame.

539
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,754
Honey,
you know we don't own this home.

540
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,881
I know.

541
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,967
But we will. One day.

542
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,595
Might not be tomorrow
or the next day...

543
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,431
...and it might take us months or years
of hard work...

544
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,267
...but one day this will all be ours.

545
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,648
And when it is, I would like
to remember this moment.

546
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,775
So, what do you say?

547
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,777
You still in?
