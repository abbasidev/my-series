1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,503
I'm Chuck. Here are things
you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:09,258
Omen. A computer virus that can erase
a hundred zettabytes of data per second.

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,761
It could take down the Internet
and erase every database.

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,181
In truth, Chuck,
the virus is just a piece of the plan.

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,268
- What happens now?
- That's the real surprise, isn't it?

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,771
There. The Omen is officially unleashed
upon the world.

7
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,254
I'm not leaving
without my money back.

8
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,798
Christmas cheer? Try Christmas fear.

9
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:54,595
A virus dubbed "the Omen"
has infected computers worldwide...

10
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,805
...and it has Christmas shoppers
in a panic.

11
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,767
Are their hard drives in danger
of being erased?

12
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,436
Or is the virus a gag
that does nothing?

13
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,271
Why panic? Ask yourself:

14
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,899
- "What would baby Jesus do?"
- And you are?

15
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,902
I'm Michael Tucker, assistant manager
of Burbank Buy More.

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,322
I want customers to remember
the true meaning of Christmas...

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,076
...and get back to what you're supposed
to be doing: Buying stuff.

18
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,787
Like this iPad, a bargain for 599.

19
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,415
Honestly, it's overpriced.
You can get this on the Internet.

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,127
See, everything is fine here
at the Buy More. Totally fine.

21
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,004
No computer virus problems here.

22
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,925
Dear God. Jeffrey. I need your help,
buddy. These people are animals.

23
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,844
The virus is everywhere and nobody
knows how to stop it. Nobody knows.

24
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,639
What is going on here?

25
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,350
Authorities do not know...

26
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,602
...who is responsible for the Omen virus...

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,022
...but assume
it is an act of cyberterrorism.

28
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,109
Every prison cell in here is connected
to the mainframe.

29
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,444
What if the Omen virus hits us?

30
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,698
You worry too much.
Take another snort of almond-milk nog.

31
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,456
Do you hear that?

32
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,850
Ellie, relax.

33
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,395
We are so behind. We are
so crazy behind and I can't find it.

34
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,231
- Find what?
- The star for the Christmas tree.

35
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,901
- The one that Dad gave me.
- Deep breaths, namaste-style.

36
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,613
Devon, it's Christmas Eve,
we are having a party in six hours.

37
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,116
We don't have a tree,
we don't have decorations...

38
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,410
I am Eleanor Woodcomb.

39
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,205
- What are you doing?
- I am Eleanor Woodcomb.

40
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,292
Saying your name aloud helps
to calm you.

41
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,753
Reminds you you're in control
of your own actions.

42
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,424
- I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
- I am Eleanor Woodcomb.

43
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,259
Yeah, that didn't work.

44
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,927
Okay.

45
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,973
What are you freaking out about?

46
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,934
Because Christmas
was my first memory, okay?

47
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,437
The presents,
the smell of fresh-baked cookies.

48
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,771
I know Clara is young...

49
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,817
...but I thought that maybe it could be
her first memory too and I just...

50
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,569
I want everything to be perfect.

51
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,115
All right, what's gonna turn that frown
upside down?

52
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:25,787
A real tree, lights, fake snow,
and a picture of Clara on Santa's lap?

53
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,458
- That's a tall order, babe.
- I know.

54
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,295
But that is why I recruited someone
onto our team.

55
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,590
- Ellie.
- Sarah, I need an update.

56
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,009
It's okay.
Project Santa is under control.

57
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,137
I got the decorations from your list.
Get the tree and snow.

58
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,598
- Thanks.
- Okay, bye.

59
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,479
- Hey, Sarah.
- Your sister is in full Christmas mode.

60
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,483
It wouldn't be Christmas with the
Bartowskis without a little bit of trauma.

61
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,652
- Speaking of...
- No progress on the virus?

62
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,488
Whoever's behind this is a ghost.
Untraceable.

63
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,032
No such thing.
They just haven't slipped up yet.

64
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,952
When they do? Carmichael Industries
will take them down.

65
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,038
But for now, I promise,
nobody is gonna ruin our Christmas.

66
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,831
Just everyone else's.

67
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,502
Chuck, it's gonna be okay. Look, I'm
gonna lock up Castle and come home.

68
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,713
Oh, by the way, will you tell Casey...

69
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:21,927
...uh, Mr. Pippers, the Preppy Polar Bear,
has arrived.

70
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,681
Mr. Pippers? Really?

71
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,684
Oh, man, that's, like,
our favorite childhood toy, right?

72
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,852
- One of, yeah.
- Top five. Maybe.

73
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,688
But still our generation.

74
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,191
- Not really yours.
- Got it on eBay.

75
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,237
Alex's mom said she used to run around
with a little bear thing like that.

76
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,364
It's still in its original package.

77
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,701
I thought it was a good idea.
Dumb, huh?

78
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,744
No.

79
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,038
It's actually quite touching.

80
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,040
Like you're feeling
real human emotion.

81
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,086
Don't you ever say that again,
and don't breathe a word of this to Alex.

82
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:00,549
No. No. My lips are sealed. Presents
are sacred in the Grimes family.

83
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,676
- Gentlemen.
- General.

84
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,261
We have an emergency.

85
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,847
We know who's behind this.

86
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,064
Merry Christmas, Sarah.

87
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,528
- Miss me?
- Not for a second.

88
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,957
That's no way
to treat an old boyfriend.

89
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,135
Just give up, Walker.
You're no match for the Intersect.

90
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,995
Comfy?

91
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,666
No?

92
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,793
Good.

93
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,339
Sixty-nine percent complete.

94
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,008
Only a couple more hours
before the virus activates.

95
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,052
What are you doing, Shaw?

96
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,304
You're the one behind the Omen?

97
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,639
The plan?

98
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,643
Surprise.

99
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,853
Why?

100
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,149
Why stay in jail
when I could break out...

101
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,235
...release the virus...

102
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,156
...and take over the CIA?

103
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,992
Oops.

104
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,535
Gave away my plan.

105
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,334
Sarah, thank God. Shaw broke out
of prison. Where are you?

106
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,712
- Sarah?
- Hello, nerd.

107
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,506
Do me a favor?

108
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,884
Turn on the monitor.

109
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,600
Merry Christmas.

110
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,101
Hey, can I tell you a story?

111
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,769
You untie Sarah right now.

112
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,732
There's this tradition in Germany,
where Santa Claus...

113
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,942
...or Krampus, as they call him...

114
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,070
...visits all the naughty children
on Christmas Eve.

115
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:13,200
But instead of giving them coal...

116
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:17,078
...he wakes them up,
and the naughtiest of children...

117
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,247
...never see Christmas Day.

118
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,460
- Let her go.
- Or what?

119
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,921
No Sarah, no Intersect.

120
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,048
You're worthless, Chuck.

121
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,591
Put Castle on lockdown.

122
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,721
Do everything I say or she dies.
Get my drift?

123
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,599
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you put me in jail?

124
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,894
Because of our last fight?
Because you tried to kill me?

125
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,562
So much history, Chuck.

126
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,564
Could be anything.

127
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,983
- Fine. What do you want?
- The CIA base downtown.

128
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,612
Break into Decker's office,
retrieve the Macau device, bring it to me.

129
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,323
What is it? What does it look like?

130
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,243
Figure it out. You have three hours.

131
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,620
Don't you hurt her.

132
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,165
Impressed?

133
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,960
I implicated Chuck
in a massive conspiracy...

134
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,628
...and captured his girl.

135
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,256
All from an 8-by-8 cell.

136
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,678
You?

137
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,847
- Working with Clyde Decker? How?
- Decker was a slug.

138
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:22,602
He tried to interrogate me and in
one flash, I knew all his filthy secrets.

139
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,981
A little blackmail and his entire team
was working for me.

140
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,108
You know what the best part is?

141
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,363
There's nothing that Chuck can do
to stop me.

142
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,367
What now, Chuck?

143
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,120
Chuck?

144
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,123
Oh, boy.

145
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,167
This is bad. This is really bad.
He is shutting down.

146
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,295
Then we take care of Shaw ourselves.

147
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,840
But he has the Intersect. We're gonna
need a plan, a really good plan.

148
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,301
I've got the plan.

149
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,349
Daniel Shaw murdered my father
and now he has my wife.

150
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,352
He's gonna wish he never left
that prison cell.

151
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,521
That plan's kind of vague.

152
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,483
Morgan, I need you to reverse-engineer
that virus. Use the nerds.

153
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,069
They're better than any computer expert
in the CIA.

154
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,406
We need to figure out
what happens when that virus activates.

155
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,492
- I'm on it.
- Casey, find alternate routes into Castle.

156
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,828
I need options
in case I can't get the device.

157
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,039
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
You're gonna break into the CIA?

158
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,875
Decker's office is on level five.
Omega level.

159
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,543
You go in alone, it's suicide.

160
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,546
Who said anything
about going in there alone?

161
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,217
The Macau device was stolen two
months ago from a Chinese company.

162
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:40,221
It compresses huge quantities of data
to fit onto a single computer hard drive.

163
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,015
Why would Shaw want it?

164
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,725
I have no idea.

165
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,061
What's the best way
to get into the CIA?

166
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,604
There's only one way in.

167
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,399
With me.

168
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,235
I can't tell you how happy I am
to hear you say that...

169
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,404
...but you're putting yourself
on the line.

170
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,906
This is my team.

171
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,242
And nobody, especially Shaw,
is going to take us down.

172
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,413
I got off the phone
with Buy More Corporate.

173
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,124
They wanna know everything
there is to know about Omen virus.

174
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,921
What happens when it activates? To
stop it, we need to know its next move.

175
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,881
Fold.

176
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,883
No. You are the only ones...

177
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,094
...that understand C-plus-plus
and other languages.

178
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,096
I need you to crack this thing. Do it now.

179
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,099
- Yeah. NI.
- What?

180
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,767
- Not interested.
- Thank you.

181
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:30,563
It's an immature response, I know,
but I too am under-incentivized.

182
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,109
Until this virus is cracked, nobody's
buying any crap at the Buy More.

183
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,779
Which means no double overtime
and no Christmas bonus.

184
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:42,742
True. But it seems a little above
and beyond our usual duties.

185
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,120
- Name your price.
- I got this.

186
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:51,751
Ahem, I would like a 6-inch
classic Italian B.M.T. From Subway. Boom.

187
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,505
- I was going to say a trip to the Bahamas.
- Subway. Done. I'll make it a footlong.

188
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,133
Nice. Make mine flatbread, boys.

189
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,469
I'm going into Castle,
in through the ducts.

190
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,304
All right. Hey, be careful.

191
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,810
It's a war zone.

192
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,855
Some Scrooge stole Christmas
right out of the Buy More.

193
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,524
Sorry to bother you.
Maybe we should just forget it.

194
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,817
You kidding?

195
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,112
Getting this angel her picture
might be the only cheer I get...

196
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,656
...to spread around here this year.

197
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,159
Let Santa just grab his suit.

198
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,162
Damn hell.

199
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,291
What kind of monster steals a Santa suit
on Christmas Eve...

200
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,793
...but leaves the eyebrows?

201
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,715
I am Eleanor Woodcomb.

202
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,801
Babe, don't worry,
I'm calling in the big guns.

203
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,138
Chuck, there's been a robbery
at the Buy More.

204
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,724
Now, brace yourself:
The Santa suit is gone.

205
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,517
Oh, that's terrible.

206
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,061
Sounds like someone could use
a dose of the Christmas spirit.

207
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,690
Promise me that you and Sarah will
make it in time for Christmas dinner.

208
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,193
- Ellie really needs her family right now.
- Yeah.

209
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,488
Yeah, of course, buddy.
We wouldn't miss it for the world.

210
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,991
My wife has been kidnapped...

211
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,953
...and I'm officially ruining Christmas
for the children of Burbank.

212
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,876
We have a CIA Christmas party
to crash.

213
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,586
Now, let's go save our girl.

214
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,852
Why's it getting so cold in here?

215
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,606
Tapped into the internal generator...

216
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,360
...lowered the temperature
to stop the mainframe from overheating.

217
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,364
Once the virus activates, the resulting
data influx could fry it in seconds.

218
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,366
You with me?

219
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,284
No, you're not.

220
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,746
If you were,
you would've brought a coat, silly.

221
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,040
You're going into hypothermic shock.

222
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,417
Soon,
you'll be in and out of consciousness...

223
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,087
...until finally,
your heart stops beating.

224
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,091
Why don't you just kill me?

225
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,218
Kill you?

226
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,263
This is about you.

227
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,433
Why do you think I wanted you in Castle
and I sent Chuck to the CIA?

228
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,019
Both know
that you're the superior spy.

229
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,773
- I've missed you.
- You're insane.

230
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,943
What we had was special.
I know you felt it.

231
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,113
You've laid in bed at night
thinking about me beside you.

232
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,447
I'd rather be dead.

233
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,951
Got what I needed.

234
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,787
This is Sarah Walker...

235
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,623
...and Daniel Shaw
is in complete control of me.

236
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,168
I don't know what your plan is,
but it's not gonna work.

237
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,964
Shaw's so handsome and smart.

238
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,427
- I bet he reads a lot of books.
- You think you can beat Chuck?

239
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,304
You're not half the man that he is.

240
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,265
You're not half the man that he is.

241
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,934
This isn't about Chuck, Sarah.

242
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,811
This really is about you.

243
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,816
See, I'm finally gonna crush your soul.

244
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,319
The way that you crushed mine.

245
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:28,384
Mm, twelve inches of bubbly cheese,
spicy pepperoni and ham.

246
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,512
You really should try
the Fresh Fit option.

247
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,015
No offense. Thank you.

248
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,350
What have we got so far?

249
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,646
All right, so if this virus hits
at the expected rate and magnitude...

250
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,066
...everything electronic will shut down:
Traffic lights, computers.

251
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,152
God, can you imagine a world
without the Internet?

252
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,403
What if it's up to us?

253
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,364
Two Buy More employees left...

254
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,659
...to stop the Omen virus
and save the world.

255
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,662
Come on. Government
has their best people working on this.

256
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,372
Right?

257
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,673
God, I hate corporate Christmas parties.

258
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,259
Everyone turns into sloppy,
embarrassing messes.

259
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,554
Well, hello, Diane.

260
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,723
Oh, Stan, not again.

261
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,351
How about joining me
at the punch bowl?

262
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,230
Enough.
You're embarrassing yourself, Stan.

263
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,234
Well,
if that's gonna be your attitude...

264
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,279
Stan Lee is a spy? That is so weird.

265
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,156
Los Angeles spies.

266
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,286
Now, focus. The woman by the giant
Subway sandwich is your target.

267
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,580
Mm-hm.
- Colonel Caroline Hayne.

268
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,750
She's in charge of internal security
with electronic access...

269
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,586
...to every room,
including Decker's office.

270
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,715
- So, what's our next move?
- Seduce her, Bartowski.

271
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,133
Steal her key card.

272
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,554
She's a notorious tight ass, except
for one night of the year. Tonight.

273
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,432
Six hot toddies and men
are running for cover.

274
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,808
You're sure I'm her type?

275
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,728
You're drawing breath
and you're in a Santa suit.

276
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,106
Ho-ho-ho!

277
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,943
Oh, Merry Christmas.

278
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,282
Ahem, or happy Hanukkah.
Whichever is applicable.

279
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,578
You look like you want some alone time
with old Saint Nick.

280
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,621
I wanna sit on your lap.

281
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,666
Come here.

282
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,462
Ahh. Whoo.

283
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:31,674
I don't think Mrs. Claus would approve
of any "shenanigans," you know?

284
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,428
Well, it's a good thing Mrs. Claus
is a no-show.

285
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,806
Oh, ha, ha.

286
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,684
Oh, that seems inappropriate. Ha-ha-ha.

287
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,823
- Aah.
- Ooh, yeah. Naughty Santa.

288
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,618
- Ah.
- That's just how I like it.

289
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,746
Oh.

290
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,333
- Caroline.
- Diane.

291
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:10,171
Mr. Claus, I will personally escort you
off the premises.

292
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,967
Oh, what a shame.
Merry Christmas. Happy Kwanzaa.

293
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,513
Pull yourself together.

294
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,872
Play a little cat-and-mouse?

295
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,707
Fine.

296
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,794
But I'll find you.

297
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,505
I know you're unarmed.

298
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,383
The armory's been on lockdown.

299
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,902
You can't hide.

300
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,446
I know every secret...

301
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,074
...every mission...

302
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,535
...and every mistake.

303
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,745
Scar on your left hand?

304
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,456
Calgary, 2004.

305
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,586
You never tried catching throwing stars
after that, did you?

306
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,881
I know everything, Sarah.

307
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,216
I know everything.

308
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,932
You're upset with me.

309
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,393
That's obvious.

310
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,855
But do you really think I wanna spend
the holidays with you?

311
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,108
That I wouldn't rather be
with my family?

312
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,861
It's a trick question, Sarah.

313
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,824
Because you shot my wife
in cold blood.

314
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,744
You brought this all upon yourself.

315
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,407
Very disappointing, Casey.

316
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,670
We have less than a minute
before a team figures we've broken in.

317
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,216
Never took Decker
for much of an art collector.

318
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,184
Think I found it.

319
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,065
Col. Hayne accessed Decker's office,
but I'm looking at her.

320
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,192
She's in the bullpen.

321
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,528
We got a code five.

322
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,030
This way, Colonel Hayne.

323
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,076
- Our minute came and went.
- Mm.

324
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,078
What are we gonna do?
No place to hide.

325
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,415
Pucker up, Bartowski.
You're about to become a man.

326
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,875
Like a bar mitzvah?
Or something that's a bit...?

327
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,877
I mean, what exactly are you...?

328
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,715
Santa?

329
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,886
Retreat immediately
or I will see you court-martialed.

330
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,723
Hmph.

331
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,567
- I brush my teeth before I...
- We never speak of this again.

332
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,569
Never ever.

333
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,407
Shaw, I've got the device.

334
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,744
- Chuck, it's me.
- Sarah, oh, my God. Are you okay?

335
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,288
Yeah. I escaped Shaw
and I'm hiding in Castle.

336
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,583
But Shaw's still down here. Hurry.

337
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,752
I'm on my way.

338
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:32,058
I know, I know. It's a madhouse.
Jeff and Lester made some progress.

339
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,602
- How'd your day go?
- I got the device and Sarah's in Castle.

340
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,773
Sarah. Hey, is everything okay?

341
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,109
Casey disarmed Shaw. He's locked up.

342
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,404
- Thank God. I'll be there soon.
- Hurry up, dear.

343
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,285
- Everything all right?
- Sarah says that Casey took down Shaw.

344
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,412
Yes. Nice. Way to go.

345
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,457
But she called me dear.
She never calls me dear.

346
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,293
- Shaw's using her somehow.
- Oh, crap.

347
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,588
Last time he was in control,
he blew up the Buy More.

348
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,968
- We've got to get these people out.
- I tried, Morgan.

349
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,179
But we haven't made a single sale
all night.

350
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,847
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

351
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,766
Don't be, buddy. It's okay.

352
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,604
Attention Buy More shoppers, um...

353
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,691
I know everyone's a little scared
about this Omen virus.

354
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:27,655
But, uh, you should not be waiting in line
on Christmas Eve.

355
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,824
- Yeah.
- It's not about the gifts.

356
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,369
It's about spending time
with your friends and your family.

357
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,289
And eggnog and cheer.
Spreading lots of cheer.

358
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,670
So, uh, as of now,
the Buy More is officially closed.

359
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,463
- What?
- Yeah. Sorry.

360
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,799
Cheers. Thank you, come again
and shop at Buy More.

361
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:52,346
Sorry. Sorry. You have to...
You're gonna have to kind of...

362
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,559
- Thanks, buddy.
- Come on, son, I'll drive you home.

363
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,020
Your mama's cooking us
a big, fat, honey-glazed ham.

364
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,023
Oh, I'm gonna stay here
and close up shop.

365
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,234
Can you make sure everyone
gets out safe?

366
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,695
- All right. All right.
- Okay.

367
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,197
Hey. What's happening?

368
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,199
Ellie, what are you...? What are you...?

369
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,035
We're, uh...
We're closing down for the night.

370
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,538
Yeah, the picture with Santa
was a bust.

371
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,039
I sent Devon and Clara home.

372
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,834
Mom's flight's cancelled.
Sarah was supposed to help...

373
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,004
...and she's not answering her phone.
Have you heard from her?

374
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,881
Yeah, uh, sort of.

375
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,841
She's kind of busy.

376
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,635
Chuck, what's going on?

377
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,849
It's Shaw.

378
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,726
He kidnapped Sarah.

379
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,395
Daniel Shaw, who killed Dad?

380
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,567
- What can I do?
- Uh.

381
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,402
I hate to say this. Just go home.

382
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,613
- I wanna help.
- Ellie, please go home, okay?

383
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,240
I have to know that you're safe.

384
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,536
Okay, but, um, call me. Call me as soon
as you know something.

385
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,413
Yes. Yes. Okay.

386
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,166
Chuck, you be careful.

387
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,376
I love you.

388
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,738
Ugh, you sick son of a bitch.

389
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,699
Just wanted to see
if any of the old fire was still there.

390
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,953
No. Ice-cold.

391
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,915
This was Mary Bartowski's, wasn't it?

392
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,293
I think I'll keep it.

393
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,963
Token of our last night together.

394
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,968
I had no idea she was your wife,
Shaw.

395
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,972
I had no idea who you were.
I was just...

396
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,641
I was just on an assignment.

397
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,268
Hmm.

398
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,854
- Is that supposed to make me better?
- I was just a young agent.

399
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:09,316
I was just doing my job, okay?
You, of all people...

400
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,111
...need to understand that.

401
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,822
Really?

402
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,659
Well, what about the pit
you dug out of my chest?

403
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:22,955
- Is that supposed to fill it in?
- Is this going to?

404
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,002
You were a good man, Shaw.
You can be that man again.

405
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,505
Just stop what you're doing, please.

406
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,507
Okay?

407
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,303
You can let this...
You can let this all go.

408
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,890
I know you're in pain
and you want this to stop...

409
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,350
...but not yet.

410
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,397
Not until you feel a pain more
excruciating than you ever imagined.

411
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:55,154
Chuck is coming up with a way
to stop you as we speak.

412
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,366
This whole Omen virus,
end of the world, apocalyptic thingy...

413
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,868
...it's a hoax. It's a hoax.

414
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,038
The virus is designed
to suck information out of computers...

415
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,956
...and move information to a location.

416
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,708
But it's not doing that.
Absolutely not.

417
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,085
Or it's not doing that
with our computers.

418
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,088
It looks like this virus
is targeting government computers.

419
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,174
I think it's a real-life conspiracy.

420
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,676
Problem is no one computer can hold
all that information.

421
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,679
- Ha, ha, I mean, right? Right?
- Yeah, of course not.

422
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,265
Morgan, it's not going into a computer.

423
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:27,227
Shaw is using the Macau device to
relocate the CIA database into his brain.

424
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,313
He's trying to create
the Intersect 3.0.

425
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:34,068
Oh, crap. With the CIA's databases wiped
clean, they'll rely on Shaw for their intel.

426
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,445
They'll have to make him a spy again.

427
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,739
Gentlemen. Gentlemen, uh.

428
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,075
The Buy More is closed.
You can go home.

429
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,620
- Happy holidays. Drink some water.
- Water can only dilute this feeling.

430
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,080
Plus, fish have sex in it.

431
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,790
- Let's go for a run.
- Great idea.

432
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,376
- Great idea.
- Great idea.

433
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:57,299
Chuck, tell me you got some kind of
an idea here because I'm a little scared.

434
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,927
No, don't freak out. I've got an idea.

435
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:04,056
- Okay. Just hope it works.
- Me too.

436
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,059
Seeing as how our lives
kind of depend on it.

437
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,602
You knew that already.

438
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,270
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

439
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,131
You've got the device.
Let Sarah go and take me instead.

440
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,966
And why would I trust you?

441
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,592
Look at the monitor.

442
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,474
Buy More's empty.
You can come up here and kill me.

443
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,810
As long as Sarah's safe.

444
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,484
Pitiful.

445
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,798
Good, you're awake.

446
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,925
You know
what the ultimate revenge is?

447
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,970
Spending Christmas Eve with you?

448
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,722
I'm gonna let you live.

449
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,308
I want you to watch
while I kill your husband.

450
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,478
Chuck has a plan.

451
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,813
So do I.

452
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:38,317
And I've spent the last two years
in prison perfecting it.

453
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,487
You killed my wife.

454
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,323
Now you're gonna suffer, just like I did.

455
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,827
You're gonna spend the rest of your life
without Chuck.

456
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,526
Hi, I'm Mr. Pippers, the Preppy Polar Bear.

457
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,695
You can leave a message
by pressing the heart on my paw.

458
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,781
Have fun.

459
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,212
Alex.

460
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,589
Dad.

461
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,720
I just want you to know
that I'm proud of you.

462
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:54,268
And I'm sorry I haven't been there
for you all these years.

463
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,816
And I'm really sorry...

464
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:06,029
...that I'm having to tell you this
recorded on an electronic bear.

465
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,160
Electronic bear.

466
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,988
I'm unarmed.

467
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,033
You can shoot me now,
if that's your plan.

468
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,660
But for some reason,
I don't think it is.

469
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,330
Oh, you're absolutely right.

470
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,541
It's very important that I enjoy this.

471
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,084
Really?

472
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,464
Well, that's a nice idea, Shaw.
However, if I remember correctly...

473
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,175
...the last time we were face to face,
I kicked your ass.

474
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,887
I've made sure
that'll never happen again.

475
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,181
No Intersect to help you this time,
Chuck.

476
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,185
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

477
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,854
I've been training for a while now.

478
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,689
Oh, really?

479
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,858
Well...

480
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,528
...can you compete
with the Intersect 3.0?

481
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,531
I can practically catch a bullet
in my teeth.

482
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,742
But you did some push-ups?

483
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,160
You hit the heavy bag?

484
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,706
Oh, just so you know,
while you're begging for mercy...

485
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,166
...your wife is watching.

486
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:03,689
I've spent every waking second in jail
thinking about this moment.

487
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,408
This time...

488
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,702
...I'm gonna kill you.

489
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,795
Agh.

490
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,090
You seriously underestimate
the power of the Nerd Herd.

491
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,802
- The Omen virus. You put it...
- Inside your head.

492
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,722
Instead of downloading
the Intersect 3.0, you removed it.

493
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,307
And it turns out that's the last flash
you're ever gonna have.

494
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,771
I'm a much bigger nerd
than you thought I was.

495
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,781
Oh, jeez.

496
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,456
Hey. Hey. Hey.

497
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,915
Wake up. Wake...

498
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,251
Oh, my God,
you're like a little ice cube.

499
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,851
Hang in there. I got this. I got this.

500
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:27,481
Uh, I'm gonna pick you up with the chair.
All right, so just bear with me. Okay.

501
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,735
Holy cow. Oh, man.

502
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,031
Agh.

503
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,159
One, two...

504
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,955
I'm still gonna kill you.

505
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,124
Like to see you try.

506
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,381
I've been working on that one.

507
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,675
- That one's for Sarah.
- Is that all you got?

508
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,135
I got a little bit more.

509
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,687
All right, listen to me.
You're gonna have to wake up.

510
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,357
Wake up because you're bolted in here
and I don't have a key.

511
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,364
What are...? You're shot.
You're bleeding.

512
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,283
Shut up, numbnuts.
We gotta get her out of here.

513
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,328
- Get her.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

514
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,579
Okay.

515
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,674
"Dear? Hurry up, dear?"

516
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,676
Sloppy, Shaw.

517
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,011
Won't happen again.

518
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,194
That was for my dad.

519
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,031
You're good, Chuck.

520
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,077
But you're not lucky.

521
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,918
That was for me.

522
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,591
Nice shot, sis.

523
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,595
But I told you to stay at home.

524
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,308
I'm Eleanor Woodcomb.

525
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,060
Since when do I do what I'm told?

526
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,734
That man took our father away
from us, Chuck.

527
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,279
I wasn't gonna let him take
anybody else.

528
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,618
Merry Christmas, Ellie.

529
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,747
Merry Christmas, Chuck.

530
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,839
Authorities have confirmed
that the Omen virus...

531
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,343
...was planted by a terrorist
named Daniel Shaw.

532
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,472
A private security team stopped him
before the virus was activated.

533
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,308
And although they've chosen
to remain anonymous...

534
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,144
...we here at KCKH
wanna say thank you...

535
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,481
...and also wish our viewers
a happy holiday.

536
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,443
And now, onto other news,
where a dog barks like a duck...

537
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:22,489
All members of Carmichael Industries
have a position open to them at the CIA.

538
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,492
The agency would be lucky
to have you back.

539
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,871
Well, we couldn't have done it
without you. So thanks, colleague.

540
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,959
With that, I'll bid you farewell
and merry Christmas.

541
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,464
Do you have a place
to spend the holidays?

542
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,007
You could come to our place.

543
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,301
But I think my Christmas party's
a bust.

544
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:47,389
No, no, no.
Your Christmas party is not a bust, sis.

545
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,558
Don't you know that when you roll
with General Diane Beckman...

546
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,227
...you roll in style?

547
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,188
General...

548
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,901
...don't you think the CIA
could help us throw...

549
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:05,657
...just a little eensy-weensy Bartowski
family Christmas party?

550
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,037
You're talking
about American tax dollars at work.

551
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,874
Oh, hell, let's do it.

552
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,710
That's the spirit.

553
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,766
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

554
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,063
Without Mom and Dad around,
it could never be the perfect Christmas...

555
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,025
...but I hope you know
that you'll always have me.

556
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,277
I do.

557
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,195
Felt pretty good taking down Shaw.

558
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,530
Mm.

559
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,615
I think Dad would be proud.

560
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,536
I know he would be.

561
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,707
I miss him.

562
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,751
Me too.

563
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,419
- I love you.
- I love you too.

564
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,712
Merry Christmas.

565
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:08,595
I, uh, made a recording
when things got a little grim.

566
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,598
It's just that...

567
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,769
It's probably better
I tell you in person.

568
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,106
I love you.

569
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,650
I love you too, Dad.

570
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:26,237
I know it's, uh, just a little bear.

571
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,907
It's not gonna make up
for all the lost holidays.

572
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,575
No, it's...

573
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,535
It's perfect.

574
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,749
You know, that Grimes kid,
he's not that bad.

575
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:41,127
You should maybe give him
another chance.

576
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,267
It was fun, man.

577
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,937
Like old times,
before you got all smart.

578
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,815
It's actually the only Christmas Eve
I remember.

579
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,150
I'm usually drunk
on Manischewitz by now.

580
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,443
I miss that.

581
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,031
- Thank you.
- For defeating Daniel Shaw?

582
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,700
For stopping the Omen virus?

583
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:16,079
Or was it me getting us invited
to rejoin the CIA?

584
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,874
- For saving me.
- Technically, Morgan saved you.

585
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,753
Because of all the saving...

586
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,965
...I wasn't able to get you your gift
in time for Christmas.

587
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,427
However...

588
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,599
An oldie, but a goodie.

589
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,186
I hope that this will suffice for now.

590
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,523
Thank you.

591
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,695
- Smile.
- Smile.

592
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,699
Oh, now, she'll always be able
to remember her first Christmas.

593
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,247
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

594
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:04,711
Chuck, you should know that, um,
while I was tied up in Castle...

595
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,212
...Shaw kissed me.

596
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:12,343
Well, as long as we're airing things out,
you should know...

597
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,054
...that Beckman kissed me.

598
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:20,185
Walker, a word?

599
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:28,526
Uh, General, I know about the, um...

600
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,031
- With you and Chuck.
- We have to make sacrifices for the job.

601
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:37,869
Shaw requested a meet with you.

602
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,955
I suggest you don't go.

603
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,608
What?

604
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,276
I'm glad you came.

605
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:14,280
I'll be locked in solitary
the rest of my life.

606
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,575
But one thing's gonna keep me warm
at night.

607
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:23,289
Little something I put into motion
that you'll never be able to stop.

608
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,793
Do you remember Hungary?

609
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,007
Does Chuck know about the baby?
