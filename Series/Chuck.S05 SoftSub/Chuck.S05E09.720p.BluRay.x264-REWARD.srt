1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,044
I'm Chuck.
Here are things you need to know.

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,879
Come on. Carmichael Industries.

3
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,632
The independence and freedom
to do what we want.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,845
I had no idea I had such strong feelings
for him. I have to disappear for a while.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,140
All members of Carmichael Industries
have a position at the CIA.

6
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,309
If we go back,
it's just gonna be missions and secrets.

7
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:23,188
- I don't wanna go back.
- Okay. All we need is each other.

8
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,328
So, Mr. Carmichael...

9
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,039
...tell me...

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,624
...how do you feel like dying today?

11
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,211
Honestly?
You're gonna make me decide?

12
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,339
I find it says a lot about a man.

13
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,092
You know, I don't know.
Can't you just pick something?

14
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,428
- I've got a lot on my plate now.
- Like what?

15
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,888
Running your own company.

16
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,141
You know, there's a lot of responsibility
that comes with that.

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,437
Not that I don't care about
recovering spent nuclear fuel rods.

18
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,148
I do, but you gotta keep your eye
on the bottom line.

19
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,068
And with missions,
the bottom line is cash, man.

20
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,321
You know, with all these
private security firms out there...

21
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,199
...I think maybe I'm coming at this
the wrong way.

22
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,826
Maybe Carmichael Industries
needs a new hook.

23
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,828
Almost there, Chuck.

24
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,330
You're very good at talking.

25
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:26,293
Exactly. Any spy can sneak
into a building and snap a few necks.

26
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,796
But what are we doing right now,
the two of us?

27
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,632
We're talking
about our hopes and our dreams.

28
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,759
So you're spies that care?

29
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:40,390
You're a genius. That's inspired.
I'm gonna use that. Can I use that?

30
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,229
I'm glad I could help you, Mr. Carmichael.

31
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,774
I think I'll start
by cutting out your tongue.

32
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,276
That would be a horrible idea.

33
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,321
I would not do that.
Especially with a blunt object.

34
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,031
Drop it, baldy.

35
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,909
Oh, my God. Chuck, are you okay?

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,453
We just had a breakthrough.

37
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,623
Do you think it's okay to touch that
without a radiation suit?

38
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,127
Shouldn't be any worse
than a couple dozen X-rays.

39
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,045
We'll be fine
as long as no one's pregnant.

40
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,467
Ha. Okay, Casey,
I'm gonna let you take that. Let's go.

41
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,521
Don't tell me
you're getting sentimental.

42
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,484
Welcome back, Gertrude.

43
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,027
Good to see you, Gertrude.

44
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,280
I missed you, Gertrude.

45
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,575
Just nod your head
if you agree with any of this.

46
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,538
- Didn't hear you come in.
- That's because I took off my heels.

47
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,457
Among other things.

48
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,836
I guess you heard
you're not wanted for murder anymore.

49
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,046
Beckman put a lid
on that Decker thing.

50
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,924
Turns out, he was just a patsy, just...

51
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:04,641
I didn't fly halfway across the world
to be debriefed.

52
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,102
- Uh-uh.
- That's your job, John.

53
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,770
Mm.

54
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,044
I thought you said
you were coming to bed.

55
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,671
Have you been up all night long?

56
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,381
That bad guy got me thinking.

57
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,508
The one who tried
to cut your tongue out?

58
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,262
Our mission statement. We spend so
much time focusing on spy missions...

59
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,972
...that we've lost sight of the...

60
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,643
The, you know, uh, "what are we doing,
why are we here" mission.

61
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,894
Are you feeling okay?

62
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,147
That pizza that Morgan left
in the fridge is starting to turn.

63
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,483
I have never thought more clearly
in my life.

64
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,527
Ah. "The things we feel,
but do not share."

65
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,364
What can we, Carmichael Industries,
offer our clients...

66
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,908
...that other security firms can't? Go.

67
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,287
- Discount electronics?
- We care, Sarah. We care.

68
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:13,085
C-A-R-E. Clandestine Agents
Relating Emotionally. Get it?

69
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,378
- Uh...
- You hate it.

70
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:18,090
No, I think it's very interesting.
I just, uh...

71
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,300
I just feel very queasy suddenly.

72
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,012
Oh. Maybe the pizza was bad.

73
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,730
Who told you you could get dressed?

74
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,943
It's a work day, remember?

75
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,114
First of all, I have something for you.

76
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,200
Open it.

77
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,665
It's, uh, a sweater.

78
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,626
- Why is it so soft?
- It's cashmere.

79
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,336
It doesn't feel flame-retardant.

80
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:01,049
It's the perfect weight
for a winter night in South Beach.

81
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,137
- What's in South Beach?
- The second part of your surprise.

82
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,764
You and I are going to Miami...

83
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,101
...for three nights at the Maya.

84
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,563
In the middle of the week?

85
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:19,067
I can't just take off and sun my buns
in Miami. No, no, no.

86
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,278
I have a job. Two, technically.

87
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,488
Right, right. I get it.

88
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,490
Well, uh, I'll call you later.

89
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,950
- Okay.
- Good.

90
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,327
Hey.

91
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,330
Don't forget your new sweater.

92
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,464
Why are we looking at surveillance
footage from this morning?

93
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,841
I don't know yet.

94
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,345
Ever since I got my brain cleaned,
I've had this suspicion...

95
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,889
...that something's happening
behind the scenes.

96
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,849
Wait a minute.

97
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,309
Is that?

98
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,730
Bingo. John Casey wearing a deep
V-neck cashmere sweater.

99
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,191
Who are you, John Casey?

100
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,028
What's he doing sneaking around the
Buy More hours before his shift starts?

101
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,489
Maybe he's here to meet somebody.

102
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,286
Those two. Of course they're in on it.

103
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,998
In on what? They're probably doing it
in the home theater room like I do.

104
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,877
Not likely. I'm gonna need
some three-by-five cards, stat.

105
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,922
- Okay.
- Stat.

106
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,764
Ooh. I gotta say, I'm grooving
on that deep V, Casey.

107
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,102
What do you got here?

108
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,814
"Clandestine Agents
Relating Emotionally."

109
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,273
- CARE?
Mm-hm.

110
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,609
You really think
this is what our clients want?

111
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,028
A private security firm
that holds their hands...

112
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,781
...builds their self-esteem,
tells them they're special?

113
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,658
Isn't that what everyone wants,
Casey?

114
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,036
And it's no coincidence
that we booked our first client in forever...

115
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,705
...hours after I put my CARE statement
on our website.

116
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,749
- We have a website?
- Who's the client?

117
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,711
Hey.

118
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,547
I told you I was working.

119
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,799
- Yeah.
- So am I.

120
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,427
You're the...? She's the client?

121
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,348
May I remind you that you
have your own personal-security firm.

122
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,809
My personnel are stretched a bit thin.

123
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,521
Besides, your company
offers a level of service...

124
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,232
...that other companies
just don't offer.

125
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,402
- You care.
- We care.

126
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,738
And I intend
to take full advantage of that.

127
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,783
See?
Mission statement working already.

128
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,747
Rocky Falcone,
cologne-wearing scumbag.

129
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,081
He's murdered his way...

130
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,502
...into becoming one
of the biggest arms dealers in Miami.

131
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,339
We have some business that he insists
on conducting face-to-face.

132
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,883
- You'll act as protection.
- Where's the meet?

133
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,303
- Miami.
- Mm. What a coincidence.

134
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,348
Is it okay if I make the retainer fee...

135
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,684
...payable to Carmichael Industries?
- Sure.

136
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,687
Actually, I'm gonna pay the whole fee
right up front.

137
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,022
We haven't said yes to...

138
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,357
- Yes.
- Yes.

139
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:52,155
Meet you on the runway
bright and early.

140
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,408
That way
we can catch some pool time.

141
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,370
Sounds good. See you in the a.m.

142
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,121
What is your problem?

143
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,708
Yeah, seriously, what is your problem?
That was not very caring, Casey.

144
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,962
An above-board arms deal in Miami?
Sounds like a vacation.

145
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,298
Haven't you had enough kidnapping,
torture and bloodshed?

146
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,842
Besides, we haven't made a cent
in months...

147
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,178
...and your girlfriend
has deep pockets.

148
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,721
She's not my girlfriend.

149
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,391
Whatever you wanna call her,
she's our new client.

150
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,893
Pack your bags, lover boy.

151
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,812
We're going to South Beach.

152
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,234
Are you going out of town?

153
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,113
Yeah, something came up.
I have to leave for a couple days.

154
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,325
- Movie night.
- It's okay, we'll do it next week.

155
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:42,747
Don't worry,
I have already chosen what we'll watch.

156
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,583
"Downton Abbey.

157
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,878
An upstairs-downstairs costume drama
in early 1900s England."

158
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,965
Something tells me, not gonna be
a lot of explosions in that.

159
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,468
Are you kidding? What about the bombs
they drop on Edwardian convention?

160
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,097
Uh, listen, I... Yeah.

161
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,099
It's okay, you don't have to explain.

162
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,853
You're my hero.

163
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,733
Please pardon the speculative nature
of my research.

164
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,654
This is just the first stab at what I think
our coworkers are really up to.

165
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,448
Okay.

166
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,660
Obviously, some of my deductions
are quite tenuous...

167
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,830
...but if you'll bear with me for...
- You think they're spies?

168
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:28,585
Casey and Sarah? Yes.
Probably NSA or CIA.

169
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,086
Chuck is some kind of asset.

170
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,255
The only thing left to figure out
is this.

171
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,508
There's a fourth member of their team.
He's their secret weapon.

172
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,769
- What are you guys doing?
- He's seen too much. Grab him.

173
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,606
Okay. What are you guys doing?

174
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,905
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

175
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,746
You see how he slipped out like that?
Maybe he's our mystery agent.

176
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,583
Wait, wait, easy. Easy there, Jeffrey.

177
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,044
I was with you
on the whole conspiracy theory...

178
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,506
...but seriously, this loser, a spy?
I mean, come on.

179
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,007
Yeah, I mean, come on.

180
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,385
He's gonna tell Chuck we're on to him.

181
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,886
Fine. We'll kill him.

182
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,014
What? No. Guys,
I'm not gonna tell Chuck squat, all right?

183
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,685
I've been conducting my own investigation
and you guys are absolutely right.

184
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,229
You nailed it.
There is a mystery agent.

185
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,148
I've tracked him down.
And, uh, heh, I got him.

186
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,567
Are you, uh...?
This is gonna blow your mind.

187
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,029
You're gonna be, like, "What?
There's no way he's, you know..."

188
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,740
But, boom, there he is.

189
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,493
If that's not James Bond,
I don't know what is, right?

190
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,869
Of course.

191
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,266
Hello, darling.

192
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,520
Oh, garçon, uh, another daiquiri for me.

193
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,106
- And you?
- Just another sparkling water, please.

194
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,859
You heard the lady.
Put that on Miss Verbanski's room.

195
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,485
Thank you very much.

196
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,824
Chuck, Sarah, stay focused on the mission.

197
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,582
Gertrude, you have a bogey
closing from your 9.

198
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,126
Walker, do you have a positive ID?

199
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,338
Uh, negative on Falcone, but it could be
another one of his heavies.

200
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,258
- Your call, Casey.
- I'll handle it.

201
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,096
- Package for Miss Verbanski.
- I'll take that.

202
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,725
Thank you.

203
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,561
A little jumpy, John?

204
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,439
Thought he was one of Falcone's.
Didn't know what he had.

205
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,525
It's a little something
that I found for you in the lobby.

206
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,363
- What the hell is it?
- It's a swimsuit, John.

207
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:08,286
Your job is to blend in around here,
and I'd like you to put it on, please.

208
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,540
Change room right there.

209
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,085
Oh, God.

210
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,925
Look, I mean, honestly, Falcone is not
gonna be showing his face down here.

211
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,345
You wanna go, uh, take a little dip
in the hot tub with me?

212
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,472
No.
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

213
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,142
No booze, no Jacuzz,
what's gotten into my wife?

214
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,353
Look, stay put
and take care of the client.

215
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,064
I'm gonna go check on Casey, okay?

216
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,816
Casey?

217
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,776
Just a minute.

218
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,237
Oh, God, I'm coming in.

219
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,281
I can't do it, Walker.

220
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,451
Gertrude, she doesn't listen
to what I'm trying to tell her.

221
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,912
I can sympathize.

222
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,748
- Thank you.
- You're putting on that suit.

223
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,667
- Like hell.
- This is a dream mission.

224
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,418
I'm not gonna let you screw it up.

225
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,088
Do you know know many skimpy outfits
I have put on?

226
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,091
Did you hear me complain
when I had to put on a catsuit...

227
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,386
...or 7-inch platform high heels
or a belly-dancing outfit?

228
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,763
Belly dancing?

229
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,139
Okay, that was private.

230
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,643
Look, just put on the banana hammock
and stop whining.

231
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,980
You okay, Walker?
You seem a little emotional these days.

232
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,108
Shut up.

233
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,620
- Guys, I lost Verbanski.
- What? What do you mean?

234
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,622
Falcone must've scoped our security.

235
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,957
Verbanski? Verbanski?

236
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,586
- She's not responding on comms.
- Her signal is still transmitting.

237
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,297
I'm showing her at the far west corner
of the hotel.

238
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,842
Casey, I need your help.

239
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,677
We're coming in.

240
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,641
Falcone must be holding her
in the Presidential Suite.

241
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,532
- Where's Falcone?
- We're meeting him for dinner, John.

242
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,202
In the meantime,
I suggest we work up an appetite.

243
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:20,209
I'll show you what's under mine
if you show me what's under yours.

244
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,270
You've been
a naughty, naughty colonel.

245
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,777
What is it?

246
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,529
Sarah, what's wrong?

247
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,782
Everything.

248
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,076
It's all wrong.

249
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,262
Very smart, Miss Verbanski.

250
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,766
Meeting in public,
bringing in your own security team.

251
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,811
It's like you don't, uh, trust me.

252
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,525
Easy, Casey.

253
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,865
This is my price.

254
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:38,871
And this is mine. Provided
the merchandise meets my specs.

255
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,752
Some woman, your boss.

256
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,505
I have a private weapons range.

257
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,966
Meet me there at midnight.

258
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,260
And don't forget your checkbook.

259
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,934
Are you seriously considering
going to an unsecured location?

260
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,273
John, I want those guns,
and when I want something...

261
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,159
Any... Ahem. Anyhoo, I'd like to...

262
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,911
...uh, on behalf of our team,
propose a toast...

263
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,622
...to you because, honestly, kudos.

264
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,332
I like how you do business. Heh.

265
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,877
Know what I mean?
This op is top-shelf.

266
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,507
Well, you know, at Verbanski Corp, we
have a work hard, play hard philosophy.

267
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:35,219
Here's to playing harder.

268
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,515
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

269
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,936
All right. Don't worry.
I got this. I got this.

270
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,814
Put it on your tab, Mr. Verbanski?

271
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,654
Mind if I give you a little advice?

272
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,740
Use the word "care,"
I'm gonna take this glass...

273
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,327
...shove it down your throat, and punch you
in the stomach so it shatters.

274
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,206
Okay. Uh, it's not spy advice.
It's actually relationship advice.

275
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,833
She doesn't want a relationship.

276
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,420
She wants a lackey, a lapdog,
a beefcake.

277
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,549
What is Verbanski really trying
to tell you, John, huh?

278
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,177
Because even tough women
like Gertrude and Sarah...

279
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,680
...they're giving out secret signals
that you need to be sensitive to.

280
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:24,185
We spend so much time sharpening our
spy senses that we forget to use this...

281
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,270
...this guy, the heart. You know.

282
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,941
And you need to learn
how to listen with your heart.

283
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,446
Come on. I'll show you how it's done.

284
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,327
Are you all ready to order?

285
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,789
Oh, uh, I think
I might need a couple extra minutes.

286
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,084
Hmm. You just kind of...

287
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,546
You have to listen to her,
listen to her, okay?

288
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:55,174
I know what she wants before she
knows what she wants. Observe.

289
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,261
Actually, I'd love to order for my lady.

290
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,887
If you don't mind, hon.

291
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,392
Uh, I think to wet her whistle,
she'll start with a glass of your Barolo.

292
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,061
Uh, I'm so wrong. We're on vacation.

293
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,022
Vodka martini... up.
Thank you very much.

294
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,942
Entrée, bone-in rib eye, extra rare.

295
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,361
I'm talking blue
or as blue as you can find.

296
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,071
As in mooing on the plate.

297
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,700
It's bad? I don't do a good cow.

298
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,496
She's like a book...

299
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,040
...and I'm an emotional speed-reader,
my friend.

300
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,712
What's going on, bro?

301
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,173
Devon, you have been targeted.

302
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,966
Targeted? What? Who?

303
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,469
Jeff and Lester. They think that
you're some international super-spy.

304
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,555
Those idiots? Why?

305
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,849
Because I told them.

306
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,268
Maybe it's because
Jeff is no longer an idiot.

307
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,313
But those two stumbled
upon our actual spy operation.

308
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,064
- You see?
- Gotcha.

309
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,774
You need me
to throw them off the scent.

310
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,694
Ah. Hey, now you're thinking like a spy.

311
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,698
Here's the key question,
can you act like one?

312
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,158
Can I go formal?

313
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,127
I've secured the U-238.

314
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,297
This device will make you more powerful
than you ever dreamed.

315
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,882
Location forthcoming.

316
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,807
Wait, wait, wait.

317
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,354
Are you sure you don't want us
to do a little recon before it's too late?

318
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,106
It's not my first arms deal.

319
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,906
I'm good for my half.

320
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,409
And you?

321
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:52,583
Miss Verbanski, do you always
dress your security this well?

322
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,879
Looks soft.

323
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,132
Just show us the guns, huh?

324
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,676
Yeah.

325
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,849
I present to you the Aegis.

326
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,269
Please, have a try.

327
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,905
Casey, don't we need ear protection
or something?

328
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,705
Ah. Not bad. Not bad.

329
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,209
Verbanski Corp will take full delivery.

330
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,711
Three million dollars.

331
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,716
No deal.

332
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,637
Actually, I'll take your money.

333
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,059
But you can leave me your guns.

334
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,198
Casey, why aren't they dead?

335
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,994
What your boss didn't tell you
is that the Aegis has a safety feature.

336
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,747
Each gun can be coded
so that it can't be fired...

337
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,291
...at someone carrying an Aegis
with the same code.

338
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,586
It's a way of preventing, uh, friendly fire.

339
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,301
Ingenious, no?

340
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,303
Quite.

341
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,274
Except my team's weapons
don't have that safety feature.

342
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,195
And it would be a shame
if someone got shot.

343
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,866
The price just changed, Rock.

344
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,826
How does free grab you?

345
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,290
Would someone like to explain to me
what the heck is going on?

346
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,958
So this was your plan all along.

347
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,670
We were the loser team you hired so
Rocky would think you were vulnerable.

348
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:05,383
- Nice.
- No. I still need you, John.

349
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:10,179
Rocky is just the first piece
of the puzzle.

350
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,056
The real mission starts now.

351
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,768
I'm out.

352
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,145
Casey, wait.

353
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,487
Whoa, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
team meeting, team meeting.

354
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,740
Casey, if you quit now,
we'll be lucky to see the retainer.

355
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:33,661
Besides, what did we talk about at the
restaurant? What did we talk about?

356
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,871
Are you using this?

357
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,665
I think you owe it to our client.

358
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,167
Listen to her signals.
What is she telling you?

359
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,795
You think I need to be more sensitive?

360
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,172
More in tune
with my girlfriend's emotions?

361
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,342
- You're one to talk.
- What's that supposed to mean?

362
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,303
You've got your head
so far up your new CARE manifesto...

363
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:55,224
...you don't even realize your wife
thinks she's pregnant and is hiding it.

364
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,269
What, are you crazy?
There's no way she could be pregnant.

365
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,188
I'd have to be the most clueless,
insensitive, uncaring...

366
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,190
Uh, Chuck...

367
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,412
Sarah, I'm sorry
I didn't exactly pick up on your signals.

368
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,373
No, I'm sorry.
I should have just told you.

369
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,334
It felt like if I said it out loud,
it would become real.

370
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,504
It's changing, it's changing,
it's changing.

371
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,259
- What is that? An equal sign, an arrow?
- A peace sign?

372
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,511
Is that an option?

373
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,557
Uh...

374
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:41,604
Uh, okay, that means no.

375
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,397
I'm not pregnant.

376
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,733
Okay, all right.

377
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,653
- And you feel?
- Strange.

378
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,739
Maybe a little relieved.

379
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:56,827
Same.

380
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,957
But this whole thing has gotten me
thinking about our lives, our future.

381
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,334
- Chuck...
- I mean, Sarah...

382
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,004
...is the spy lifestyle really
where we wanna be raising our kids...

383
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,672
...putting ourselves in danger?

384
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,299
- Chuck.
- Yeah?

385
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,011
- You're spiraling.
- Mm-hm.

386
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,893
I need you back in immediately.
I was telling Casey the truth.

387
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,687
I leveraged Rocky Falcone
to give up his supplier.

388
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,731
Pedro St. Germaine is notorious.

389
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,984
Guns and narcotics that come up
from the south flow through him.

390
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,154
He has an enormous FBI bounty
on his head if I'm not mistaken.

391
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:36,075
That's where the real mission comes in.
The FBI hired me to find St. Germaine.

392
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:40,579
And Falcone kindly gave up
his exact location in the Everglades.

393
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,915
We're in.
We'll be in Miami by nightfall.

394
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,543
- I think we should discuss this.
- Discuss what?

395
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,339
I don't think it's safe for prospective
parents to be in a situation like this.

396
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:54,552
Cute. I just figured you'd wanna finish the
mission and take some of the proceeds...

397
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,304
Wait. I was just saying
maybe we should talk about...

398
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:01,141
- And she hung up.
- Chuck, stop spiraling.

399
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:05,104
I'm... I'm not spiraling.
You're spiraling.

400
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,699
Ooh. Yeah, cashmere, nice.
Do you mind?

401
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,868
I have a tailor who can make me
two sweaters out of this bad boy.

402
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,039
- Rough mission?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

403
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,834
Okay, that's no problem.

404
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,003
Tons to talk about.
Lot of stuff going on.

405
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,089
Verbanski
wasn't bringing me a mission.

406
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,049
It was an all-expenses-paid vacation.

407
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,844
Sun, sand, sex.

408
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,762
The nerve of that woman.

409
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,515
I'm not a kept man. I'm a spy, damn it.

410
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,934
Don't I know it. Trust me.

411
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,978
In fact...

412
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,733
...I might have a little spy work for you.
- What kind of spy work do you have?

413
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,484
Hmm.

414
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,702
I'm making the drop now.

415
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,998
I have my eyes on the drop spot.

416
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,376
Ten-four. Let's go.

417
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:21,013
Okay.
It's oddly comfortable running in heels.

418
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,689
Perfect. Come on.

419
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,026
Just so you know,
I'm keeping these shoes.

420
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,320
Easy. Calm down, Jeffrey.

421
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,426
Get out of here!

422
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,805
We strike from the east entrance.

423
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,473
Take St. Germaine alive.

424
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:32,126
Figured it was only a matter of time
before that rat Falcone sold me out.

425
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,839
You waving that gun around for show
or are you gonna use it?

426
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,274
Yeah? I take it this is an apology.

427
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,485
I got your girlfriend, so, uh,
you might wanna listen up.

428
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,658
You got her all tied up, do you?

429
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,869
Uh, yeah, yeah, she is.

430
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:11,415
Uh-huh. And she needs her big, strong
boyfriend to come rescue her, right?

431
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,168
Again, correct.

432
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,795
And bring $10 million cash.

433
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,298
That's a nice detail.

434
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,009
Look, you tell Verbanski
she fooled me once...

435
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,511
...she's not gonna fool me again,
got it?

436
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,638
She said you'd be playing hardball.

437
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,433
Don't pay him anything, Casey!
I can handle it myself!

438
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,894
Didn't I tell you to shut up?

439
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,105
Gertrude? Gertrude?

440
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:42,112
So $10 million by tonight or she dies.

441
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,079
Okay.

442
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,081
Ten mil, good to go.

443
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:57,044
- Think they'll check if it's counterfeit?
- Oh, I'm pretty sure they will.

444
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,964
If all goes according to plan, they're not
gonna be in any condition to check.

445
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,425
Undetectable if the case is searched.

446
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,761
Walker,
when I say the code word "care"...

447
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,056
...you start so I can get to my weapon.

448
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,892
- And my job would be?
- You're getaway driver.

449
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,729
You don't want to have anything to do
with this. It's gonna be a bloodbath.

450
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,981
Be ready for extraction
when the time comes.

451
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,441
Okay, let's do it.

452
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,193
Oh, hey, Walker, listen.

453
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,779
You sure you're not, uh?

454
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,366
- I'm not pregnant.
- Okay.

455
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:32,120
- This is gonna be dangerous.
- I know. I get how dangerous it is.

456
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,372
Let's go.

457
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,636
- Stop.
- I'm unarmed.

458
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,305
I'm here for a trade
with St. Germaine.

459
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:57,229
There's a guy here who says he
wants to make a trade with St. Germaine.

460
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,898
Copy that.

461
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,252
- What if we had a baby at home?
- Excuse me?

462
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,088
What if we had a baby relying on us
to come home...

463
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,090
...and something happened?
- Something?

464
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,217
Something, anything.
We didn't come home.

465
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,512
Who would raise the kids?
What would happen then?

466
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,891
Honey, we don't have a baby,
let alone babies, plural.

467
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,351
Not now, but we will.

468
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,564
Spying and parenting
just don't go together.

469
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,067
Sarah, you are spiraling, okay?
Take a deep breath.

470
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,987
- Everything's gonna be fine, I promise.
- Okay.

471
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:51,241
- You sure?
- Yeah. We need to split up.

472
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,495
Your knight in shining armor
has arrived.

473
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,725
Let's see what you brought me.

474
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,396
I'm almost to the compound, Casey.

475
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,491
Sarah? I'm coming.

476
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,833
- Sarah, are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

477
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,336
It was just a flash grenade,
but I can't see.

478
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,797
I could have handled this myself.

479
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,383
I couldn't leave you out here
in the swamp.

480
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,805
Because I care.

481
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,182
Okay, that's Casey. You've gotta go.

482
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,476
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- No. I'll be fine.

483
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,521
Please, just take my gun
in case something goes wrong, okay?

484
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,232
I'm not gonna need it.
I have the Aegis.

485
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,776
I love you. Be safe.

486
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,654
I said, I care.

487
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,784
Maybe I care too much.

488
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,959
I've been working so hard
on my spy senses too.

489
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,546
My eyes, my ears, my fists.

490
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,466
What I should've been working on
is this.

491
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,011
John, stop. Stop. Please stop.

492
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,180
No, I can't, Gertrude...

493
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,266
...because I love you.

494
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,313
And I need you to know
how much I care.

495
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,527
I care a lot.

496
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,531
I don't know who you're trying to signal,
man, but it all stops right now.

497
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,659
Go, go, go.

498
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,413
Sorry I'm late.

499
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,129
I've got the Aegis. They can't hit us.

500
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,841
We need to get to cover.

501
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,217
I am the cover.

502
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,095
- Move, move, move.
- Aah. Aah.

503
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,015
Move!

504
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,725
I heard your speech.

505
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,603
It's great that you're opening up
your heart like that.

506
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,354
Yeah.

507
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,570
Move, move!

508
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,697
Good show.

509
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,741
Very entertaining.

510
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,536
But shotguns ain't got safeties.

511
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,581
Oh...

512
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,091
Don't worry. I wore my seatbelt.

513
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,070
- Hey.
- Hey.

514
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,531
Everything all right?

515
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,158
Yeah, I'm just doing some thinking.

516
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,495
Uh, I have a small confession to make.

517
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,957
Part of me was kind of hoping
that I was pregnant.

518
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,463
I've thought a lot about that too...

519
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,175
...and, yeah,
I think it'd be kind of exciting.

520
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,303
I mean, it's not like I want a baby
right this second.

521
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,933
- But it's not the worst idea in the world.
- No. No, it's not.

522
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:50,480
Listen to us, talking about kids
and a house and a real family.

523
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,983
Did you think we'd ever be talking
about this?

524
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,111
Nope.
Especially not with such a huge nerd.

525
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,696
Ha, ha.

526
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,290
I thought we were past this.

527
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,126
Just open it.

528
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:14,296
Stops anything
this side of a thirty-aught-six.

529
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,925
I saw you eyeing that guard's vest
in Miami.

530
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,636
Look, I'm...

531
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,057
I'm sorry for dragging you
on a glorified vacation.

532
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:32,439
I guess it was just my misguided way
of saying that I...

533
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,191
...wanna be close to you.

534
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,944
Thanks. Hmm.

535
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,198
I feel the same.

536
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,078
I know
Miami wasn't really your scene.

537
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,334
But my next mission
is in a much better place.

538
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,961
- Hmm?
- Mm-hm. Dresden.

539
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,882
Ah. Dresden. Harsh, cold.

540
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,426
Come with me.
Two months, real danger.

541
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,012
Who knows? We could both get shot.

542
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,264
You know I'd love to.

543
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,393
But, uh, two months is a long time
to be away from here.

544
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,896
Hmm. Well...

545
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,523
...when you're ready...

546
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,359
...I'll be there.

547
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,904
Unless, of course, you have
another woman behind the scenes.

548
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,698
No.

549
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,826
Not exactly.

550
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,999
So I have this friend.

551
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:37,462
She's out of town right now, but I'd like
for you to meet her sometime.

552
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,130
Friend?

553
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,715
Like a girlfriend?

554
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,427
No, not like a girlfriend.

555
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,766
Yeah, actually, like a girlfriend.

556
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:54,020
Well, I would, uh, love to meet her.

557
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,856
Perfect.

558
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,360
- Oh, no.
- What?

559
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,989
The housemaid is laying out
coffee spoons with the dinner service.

560
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:08,326
There is gonna be hell to pay
at Downton Abbey tonight.

561
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,582
So Devon Woodcomb...

562
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,209
...who, last time I checked...

563
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,546
...was an extremely handsome
medical doctor...

564
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,924
...and you think
he's building a nuclear bomb?

565
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:28,763
- We know the location of the bomb.
- We don't just think it, we know it.

566
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,140
Voilà.

567
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,058
That's a Outback coupon.

568
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,895
So it is.

569
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,940
Voilà.

570
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,489
Come with us.
Let's blow this thing wide open.

571
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,451
Yeah, fine.

572
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:54,873
I've only walked.53 miles today.
Another few steps wouldn't hurt me.

573
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,875
You, sir, are an American hero.

574
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,430
He's up to something.

575
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,942
What on earth?

576
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,285
After we open this door,
there's no going back.

577
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:36,414
Let's do this. I'm still at 1,500 steps.

578
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,878
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

579
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,110
What are you doing here?
How'd you find this place?

580
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:08,488
Uh, the better question is,
what are you doing here?

581
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,866
Really, what are you doing here?
I'm confused.

582
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:15,161
Ellie doesn't like my workout equipment
around the house...

583
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,705
...so I figured this would be perfect.

584
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:23,169
But the U-238.
It was being delivered here.

585
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,879
You mean this?

586
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,257
About to make my biceps go nuclear.

587
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,677
Then why all the secrecy?

588
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:35,640
Well, some of these exercise techniques
aren't exactly legal in the U.S.

589
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,975
If you catch my drift.

590
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,852
Are you two happy?

591
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:43,106
Let the statuesque man
work out in peace.

592
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,941
Is that a pedometer?

593
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,153
- Got a whole box of them upstairs.
- Phew. Sweet.

594
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,698
- I'll work you out a deal.
- Gotta work out sometime, Big Mike.

595
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,284
- I like your style.
- Do a lot of working out.

596
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,494
It's too easy.

597
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,373
Well?

598
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,292
The whole search...

599
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,960
...worthless.

600
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,755
There's no spies, no secret base.
Nothing.

601
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,133
Ah, Jeffrey, you know...

602
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:14,220
...maybe this wasn't a search
for a secret spy base.

603
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:18,099
Maybe this was a search
for friendship.

604
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,518
How do you mean?

605
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,189
I don't know. I just wanted
to say something to cheer you up.

606
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,275
Would you just come here?
Okay, buddy? Okay?

607
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,653
- Let's get out of here. This place reeks.
- Thank you.

608
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,156
What the?

609
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,665
- It's still wet.
- Oh.

610
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,126
- Oh, yeah.
- Remember when I was at Pine Ridge?

611
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,003
The, uh, mental institution? Yeah.

612
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,965
It was so dreary, they'd actually
put fake backdrops in the windows.

613
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,051
That's pretty cruel.

614
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,178
I always knew it was fake.

615
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:59,015
Um, where are we going with this,
buddy?

616
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,435
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

617
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:08,066
...it's not always easy
to trick a mental patient.

618
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,030
I knew it.

619
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,992
We were right. Lester.

620
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,206
Jeffrey? Jeffrey?

621
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,588
Oh, crap.

622
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,924
I think we've got a problem.

623
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,094
Yeah, yeah, I'd call it that.
