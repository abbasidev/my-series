1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,586
I'm Chuck. Here are a few things
you need to know.

2
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:07,464
You really think
you've been fighting evil?

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:08,757
Doing good?

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,427
You think it was all a coincidence?

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:16,223
The Intersect, Fulcrum, The Ring,
Shaw, Agent X?

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,642
You're just a pawn. You always were.

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,978
No! No, no, no. Don't take the Intersect.

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,105
- You're fired, Chuck.
- No!

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,276
Operation Bartowski is done.

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,112
What if we went into business
for ourselves?

11
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,449
Hartley turned over
all of Volkoff's assets to us.

12
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:36,326
Our first purchase was the Buy More
and everything below it.

13
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,619
Freelance spies.

14
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:42,249
Under the radar, above the law.
Oh, man, this is gonna be so much fun.

15
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,584
Oh, nice.

16
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,091
Guys...

17
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,509
...I know kung fu.

18
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,150
So ocean view. Gulls flying by.

19
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,486
Think this is something
you could get used to?

20
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,821
I'm more of a toes-in-the-sand
kind of girl.

21
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:17,451
I like the idea of waking up in the
morning and rolling out onto the beach.

22
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,413
Okay. Well, then maybe we can find
a nice little place on the sand someday...

23
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,499
- ...if we, you know...
- Survive this?

24
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,167
Yeah.

25
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,546
Hi. How you doing today?

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,508
No shooting.

27
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:36,011
I don't want the blood
and the mess on the pool deck.

28
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,431
Make them jump.

29
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,562
- Think we can survive this?
- Uh, I don't think so, honey.

30
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,356
"Honey"?

31
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,691
You talk like an old married couple.

32
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:52,861
Well, actually...

33
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,698
I'm sorry, I don't care.

34
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,242
Throw them off the cliff.

35
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,743
Do it and die, Jean Claude.

36
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,871
We came for the vase.
It belongs to our client.

37
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,916
You let us have it,
and maybe we'll let you live.

38
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,751
You've fallen into our trap.

39
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,713
You see, we work with a master spy,
somebody who you can't see coming.

40
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,799
In fact, right now, he's probably...

41
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,896
I want it noted
that I took out six of their guys.

42
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,399
He was taking this.

43
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,568
You thieves have expensive tastes.

44
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,779
This vase is worth $6 million.

45
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,782
It's times like these
I wish I had the Intersect.

46
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,534
Well, you don't.

47
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,911
- What now, Moriarty?
- Kill them.

48
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,581
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

49
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,000
We have another master spy.

50
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:00,137
Okay. Yes. Yes.
First mission as the Intersect.

51
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,555
You can do this.

52
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,142
They need you, Morgan, so get in there,
okay? And you be a man.

53
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,395
No, be more than a man.

54
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,731
Start with the man part.
Just be a man first.

55
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,944
Keep going, thief. This is fun.

56
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,323
The fun's about to end because,
while we've been chatting...

57
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:24,119
...our other spy has been effortlessly
breaching your compound's security.

58
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,124
I'm good, I'm good.

59
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,585
He's heartless, cruel.

60
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,130
Oh, I'm so sorry, fishies,
about your pond.

61
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,757
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

62
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,302
You think your security men
are the best? Top-notch?

63
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,429
I admit, I do.

64
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,974
Well, our spy is currently
slicing through them...

65
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,143
...like a hot knife through butter.

66
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,273
Go on, say something
about you-know-who.

67
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,067
Do I have to?

68
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,486
Yes.

69
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,198
He'll tear your limbs off
and beat you with them.

70
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,868
Okay, okay.

71
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,790
Points for trying,
but where is this master spy?

72
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,959
You looking for me?

73
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,294
Right here, tough guy.

74
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,383
Here we go.

75
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,886
Kill him too. Kill them all.

76
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,346
Come on.

77
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,516
- Now's the time, buddy.
- I'm working on it. Working on it.

78
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,227
And we're dead.

79
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,317
Let's dance.

80
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,264
Who the hell are you?

81
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,683
Charles Carmichael
of Carmichael Industries...

82
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,936
...private contractors, spies for hire.
Don't forget it.

83
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,863
Wow, I really thought
that the latch was latched, but, uh...

84
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,908
Buff that right out. I think we can still
make that... We'll make that work.

85
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,746
We're still working out the kinks.

86
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,792
Alrighty, folks.
It wasn't a total catastrophe.

87
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,002
The client was not interested
in the vase...

88
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,507
...but the microchip inside it,
and that is intact.

89
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,008
Boom.

90
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,305
- Bam, we're in the pink.
- The vase was gonna be our payment.

91
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,308
And still is, fully restored.

92
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:38,313
Who's not gonna pay 6 mil
for a slightly used Ming vase?

93
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,821
Chuck, we mowed through
the Volkoff fortune on start-up costs.

94
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,114
Look at these numbers.

95
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,699
Forty-two million dollars,
which is a lot of dough.

96
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,286
Rockets, bullets, the private jet,
servicing the private jet...

97
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:57,165
...the fresh shrimp that Morgan
likes to eat on the private jet.

98
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,334
They're just not the same frozen.

99
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,170
They're expensive,
and if we're going to stay solvent...

100
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,839
...we need to collect soon.

101
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,550
Or crawl back to Beckman,
get a government contract.

102
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,178
Never had a problem with Uncle Sam.
Beat the yahoos we got coming here.

103
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,681
Our problem is not Uncle Sam,
it's Clyde Decker.

104
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,851
- I don't see that changing any time soon.
- Beg, plead.

105
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,020
You know I get antsy taking cases
with moral ambiguity.

106
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,150
Guys, come...
Sarah, isn't this what we wanted?

107
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,860
Come on. Carmichael Industries.

108
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,696
The independence and freedom
to do what we want.

109
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,574
We're doing good. We're doing good.
We got a solid team.

110
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,910
We just need a little more time
to get our feet on solid ground.

111
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,705
And in the meantime,
we work for dirtbags.

112
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,251
Chuck, you're handling this really well.
All the bumps in the road...

113
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,546
...and Morgan with the Intersect,
and you without it.

114
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,381
Which is fine.

115
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,260
Morgan, yes, has the Intersect now,
but I'm happy for him.

116
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:55,557
Plus, I get to work with my
smoking-hot wife and my best friends.

117
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,934
Who could ask for anything more?

118
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,231
- What was that?
- What was what?

119
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,943
- Are you hiding something?
- Why would I need to hide anything?

120
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,614
- Okay.
- Okay.

121
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,617
Morgan, Operation VFTB is dead.

122
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,452
View From the Bluff is dead?

123
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,954
Ugh, Chuck, I found the perfect house
for you guys.

124
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,707
I was wrong.
Sarah doesn't want a house on the bluff.

125
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,752
- She wants her toes in the sand.
- Operation Toes in the Sand.

126
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,254
Actually, it makes a better acronym.

127
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,882
Toes in the... T-I-T...

128
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,426
Why don't we just call it
Operation Toes, okay?

129
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,596
Hmm, fine, fine. I'll start my research.

130
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,266
Oh, Chuck, I know you've been setting
aside funds for this house...

131
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,811
...and I hope my accident with the vase
didn't blow it for you.

132
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,980
No. Hey, hey, don't worry about it.

133
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,274
We got a very promising
potential client.

134
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,945
We're gonna wine and dine him,
and soon enough, we will be raking it in.

135
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,573
Good, and you know what?
If it all goes south, well, we still have...

136
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,576
The Buy More.
She's served us well over the years.

137
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,414
It all seems so normal.

138
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,291
A little too normal.

139
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,712
Yeah. Sleeping dogs, though.
Sleeping dogs.

140
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,091
Oh, it's Casey.
Wants us down in Castle.

141
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,926
Yeah, all right.

142
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,809
Hoist the flag.

143
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,693
Hey, Casey. What do you need?

144
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,653
New client's here. I don't like him.

145
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,531
What? The who? The what?
The client? The client is here?

146
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,158
I thought we were gonna
wine and dine the guy.

147
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,660
Waste of time. He's here.

148
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,037
Casey, this is supposed to be
a secret base.

149
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,290
I took precautions.

150
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,500
Oh, good.

151
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,547
Casey, what precautions?

152
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,513
What the hell kind
of operation is this?

153
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,142
We're still working out the kinks.

154
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,855
Twenty million dollars was stolen
from me by a high-level Ponzi schemer.

155
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,816
You heard the name Roger Bale?
Well, you will soon.

156
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,320
He's bilked investors to the tune
of about a half a billion dollars.

157
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,654
Why not go to the cops?

158
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,240
I did, but Bale has falsified records...

159
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,035
...saying he lost the money in trading
and he's broke.

160
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,079
But he keeps buying property
in St. Martin. He's a thief.

161
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,333
The heart of Bale's operation
is a computer vault...

162
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,587
...in his corporate headquarters.
Access the accounts, get my money.

163
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,213
Yes. We ride at midnight.

164
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,548
His security is deadly.

165
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,177
So maybe we ride
first thing in the morning.

166
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,220
- No need to rush.
- That's a better idea.

167
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:43,058
Twenty percent of what you recover
is yours.

168
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,023
Fifty. Done some digging
on you, Woodley.

169
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,401
You're just an ambulance chaser,
trial lawyer, scum of the earth.

170
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,863
Uh, he's kidding. He's kidding.
He's only kidding.

171
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,240
Casey,
Bale is worth infiltrating anyway.

172
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,535
Looks like he's stolen money
from teachers' unions and families.

173
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,913
He stole 2 million
from Rush Limbaugh.

174
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,793
Tell me everything you know
about this animal.

175
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,424
He's throwing himself a party
tomorrow night. His going-away.

176
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,261
But it's strictly invite, and everything
goes through his secure BlackBerry.

177
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,013
What a complete tool.

178
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,974
"Blah, blah, blah," on the Bluetooth
all day. How rude.

179
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,602
I'm getting a good feed from the satellite.

180
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,605
The party's being set up.
The place looks like a fortress.

181
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,565
See? Satellite was a good investment.

182
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,901
Just gotta figure out a way
to get into his PDA...

183
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,404
...and invite ourselves to this party.

184
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,739
Let's talk house, homeboy.

185
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,827
- What was that? Did you say "house"?
- Nothing. Just hopping off real quick.

186
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,331
The house is secret, remember?

187
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,585
The only real secret is gonna be
which room you're sleeping in.

188
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,796
Why? Seventeen of them.

189
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,632
Pool, screening room,
bowling alley, gourmet kitchen...

190
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,094
...second bowling alley,
and it's on the beach.

191
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,098
- I mean, it's crazy, but...
- Hey. Toes in the sand.

192
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,976
- Toes in the sand. Toes in the sand.
- Toes in the sand.

193
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,603
Could you imagine
how awesome this would be, buddy?

194
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,940
I mean, to give Sarah the dream life?
Owning our own company...

195
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,152
...living in the dream home,
a place that we can call our own.

196
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,987
We just need this gig to pay out.

197
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,280
I know.

198
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,657
One second.

199
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,544
Why don't we nab this guy's phone
while he's playing squash?

200
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,504
- What?
- I just zoomed on his gym bag.

201
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,174
Kensington Athletic.
A super-exclusive squash club.

202
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:44,179
- He's gotta have a regular game, right?
- Morgan, that's fantastic. Fantastic.

203
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,473
"Zoomed"? What did you say? You...?

204
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,184
What? Did you...?
You zoomed on his gym bag?

205
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,145
Yeah, because you had "flash,"
which was great...

206
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:56,649
...but, eh, wanna do my own thing, mix it
up a little bit, so I came up with "zoom."

207
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,194
- You don't like it. Ah, you don't like it.
- No, hey.

208
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,322
"Zoom" it is, buddy, you know.
Whatever you want.

209
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,656
Really?

210
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,533
You're amazing. You are so Zen now.

211
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,870
If I had a power like that and I thought it
was gone forever, oh, I'd be a wreck.

212
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,372
Whew. Not you, man. You are my hero.

213
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,167
You're great
even without the Intersect.

214
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:23,551
How certain are you that these glasses
only had one reload left in them?

215
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,597
Like, very certain.

216
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:32,519
I tried to access the program,
but there was no way to update it.

217
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,563
This version of the Intersect
is a one-time deal. I'm sorry.

218
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,610
That's okay. That's okay.

219
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:45,031
Morgan's got it now,
and he's doing surprisingly well, so...

220
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,243
Chuck, what's wrong?

221
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,623
The Intersect opened me up
to big dreams.

222
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,460
But in order for those dreams
to become a reality...

223
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,921
...I need this business to succeed,
and...

224
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,758
You think the company doesn't work
if you don't have the Intersect?

225
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,636
Yeah.

226
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:11,224
Chuck, I don't think that Dad wanted
you to have the Intersect forever.

227
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,935
And besides, you don't need it.

228
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,938
The computer
didn't make you a hero...

229
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,108
...it just gave you an opportunity
to become one.

230
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,652
Now it's up to you.

231
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,072
Training wheels are off, you'll fall down,
but I promise you...

232
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,199
...you can do this.

233
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,287
My 2 cents.

234
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,707
Thanks, sis.

235
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,835
I needed a good Ellie speech.

236
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,461
Well, what are sisters for?

237
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:57,145
The mission
is to access Roger Bale's PDA...

238
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,814
...and put ourselves on the guest list
for his party.

239
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,735
The phone is gonna be difficult to get to
and password-protected when we do.

240
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,487
If we do. Bale has bodyguards.
Could be trouble.

241
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,157
And that's why you're the one
going for the phone.

242
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,826
This plug-in will cut through
all the encryption...

243
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,662
...and install a virus
that will send me an invite.

244
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,750
Bale is playing in a squash tournament.
Morgan, delay his opponent...

245
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,837
...while I step in and match up with Bale.
He'll get to know my face and name.

246
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,673
When I show up at the party,
I won't be a stranger.

247
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,760
What? What's the problem?
What's up?

248
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,678
You're gonna play?

249
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,973
Do you actually play
any non-video game sports?

250
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,642
Yeah, I played some racquetball.

251
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,019
I think I can fake squash
for half an hour, heh.

252
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,272
- No, Chuck, I don't think so.
- Ahem.

253
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,608
Sarah.

254
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,780
Uh, well, sweetheart, um...

255
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,199
...you know, I think what, um...

256
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,201
Let's put Grimes on the court.

257
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,703
He can zoom on squash,
give the guy a game.

258
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,622
"Zoom," Casey?

259
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,208
It'll buy me some time.
You delay his opponent.

260
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,879
Take over the job I was gonna do. It'll be
great. What was the job I was gonna do?

261
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,426
Yeah. Oh.

262
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,055
Think I'm supposed to be playing now.
You sure it's only 2:00?

263
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,475
Oh, Mr. Burnham,
you just sit here and relax.

264
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,227
I will tell you when it's time.

265
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,980
And right now, it is not time.

266
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,987
Bale's coming.
Casey, he's headed your way.

267
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,574
- Get ready. He'll be there in a minute.
- Yep.

268
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,913
Chuck, you keep that bear on that table,
or this all falls apart.

269
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,417
Remember, I like it deep and hard.

270
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,585
That's great.

271
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,295
That just sounds great.

272
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,094
Hey, man, sorry for the delay.

273
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,222
I had a hot tub
full of nursing students.

274
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,516
- So chatty.
- Totally.

275
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,770
- So you must be Killer Burnham?
- He's a no-show.

276
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,857
I'm Michael Carmichael
of Michael Carmichael Industries.

277
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,775
That sounds like big money.

278
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:12,280
Hmm, you have no idea. You know,
if I was standing on my wallet...

279
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,866
...I'd be tall. Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

280
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,036
- Your skin is soft to the touch.
- There you go.

281
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,787
Is that a waxing situation?

282
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,624
My wife's talked to me about waxing,
but not a fan of physical contact.

283
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,794
Outside of my job, of course.
This is what I do every day, heh.

284
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,885
Hey, uh, your ball warm?

285
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,472
Here we go.

286
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:46,105
Amigo, my ball is red-hot.

287
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,445
- You're pretty quick.
- "Sneaky quick," they call that.

288
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,864
Bale. Sneaky quick.

289
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,956
- Put a little elbow grease into it.
- Oh, yeah? Should I do that?

290
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,583
- There you go.
- There it is.

291
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,337
Almost there.

292
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,005
Little deeper.

293
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,092
You know, you are a thick man.

294
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,969
- Yeah, right there.
- There it is.

295
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,805
Come on.

296
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,020
Turn and reach,
you old son of a bitch.

297
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,941
Hey, Chuck, we got a big problem.
Casey's caught up getting Bale's phone.

298
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,152
Maybe I can tranq my guy,
give Casey an assist.

299
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:40,034
So let me ask you a question. Uh, this guy
you're supposed to play, Jim Burnham...

300
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,203
...you called him something else.

301
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,873
"Killer." Heard he killed nine men
in the foreign legion.

302
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,166
The name stuck.

303
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,710
Hmm, only nine, huh?

304
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,007
- What the hell?
- Ah! No, no, somebody's not relaxing.

305
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,551
Relax, breathe, breathe.

306
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,719
I just dropped something.
Oil's slippery.

307
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,475
John Casey.

308
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:09,147
I knew you'd fall for that old line.
I haven't seen you since jump school.

309
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,983
Stark. Been a while.

310
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,318
- Breathe.
- Is that a gun?

311
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,905
I am gonna rip your head off.

312
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
What's a leatherneck like you doing
in the Kensington Club?

313
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,828
- Private security.
- Me too.

314
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,204
For a turd named Bale.

315
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,333
Real scuzzer, but at least it's a payday.
I don't have to sell you on selling out.

316
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,252
Guy with your skills, Casey...

317
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,963
...you've got to be raking it in.
- Uh-huh.

318
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,518
You think one little dart
is gonna drop 400 pounds of solid meat?

319
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:53,983
That's it.

320
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,111
Drop him and stretch it out.

321
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,742
You seem like
a moderately successful individual.

322
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,459
Let's say a fella had 40 mil
kind of lying around doing nothing.

323
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,420
- What would you do with it?
- You looking to invest?

324
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,256
I might be. I might be.

325
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,813
No. No. No!

326
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,153
Good game, Carmichael.

327
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,658
Oh, Bunny Doll. Bunny Doll, Bale.
Bale, Bunny Doll.

328
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,619
Hey, uh, why don't you guys come
to my party tomorrow night?

329
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,580
Tomorrow night? Bunny Doll,
do we have anything, uh, planned?

330
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,040
No. I don't think so.

331
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,209
- Well, how do you feel? You wanna go?
- Oh, I'm game.

332
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,670
- Hmm.
- Excellent.

333
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,963
Good, good, good.

334
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,589
It's a date, then, huh?

335
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,009
Tomorrow night. I'll e-mail you.

336
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,268
Quit goofing around. We gotta go.

337
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,312
- What about the mission?
- Don't worry. Morgan saved the day.

338
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,856
- Got an invite to the party.
- Huh?

339
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,192
Thank God for the Intersect, huh?

340
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,613
Hey, buddy.

341
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,199
- Nice work on the mish today.
- Yes.

342
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,203
We wired a couple million dollars into
Bale's account. You're set for the party.

343
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,372
Would you go Bogart
with the white tux...

344
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,208
...or would you go Bond
with the black tux?

345
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,294
Uh, black, definitely.

346
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,172
I knew it. I knew black tux.
Always bet on black. Right?

347
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,799
Okay, what's wrong?

348
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,886
Chuck, is this Intersect withdrawal?
I mean, are you missing it?

349
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,473
Sure. Yeah.

350
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,685
Of course. But it's more than that.

351
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,522
I'm just realizing
how hard it's gonna be without it.

352
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,859
I guess I got used to our spy missions
being a little easier.

353
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,406
But remember the big picture here.

354
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:11,746
Your beautiful wife, your perfect home.
It's all right here. "Toes in the sand."

355
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,498
- It's the big picture.
- Hey.

356
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,084
I gotta go. I'll get this to the lab.

357
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,377
- Good job, team.
- Yeah.

358
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,630
- Right. High-five here.
- Good, good, good. Good briefing.

359
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,258
Chuck, do you realize
that I'm a trained spy...

360
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,678
...who can tell when somebody
is keeping a secret? Especially...

361
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,139
...when that someone happens to be
my husband.

362
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:34,560
It's who I am.
Husband without a secret.

363
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,772
Casey and I are going
to scout Bale's headquarters...

364
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,607
...so we'll talk about this later.

365
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,942
Can't this be
that one-time conversation?

366
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,460
This isn't good.

367
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,922
We've finally lost control of this
store, haven't we?

368
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,965
All right, where's Jeff?

369
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,926
No. Where's Lester?

370
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,845
I can sense his evil little hand
all over this.

371
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,642
Hey, Jeff.

372
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,488
Heartbreaking, isn't it?

373
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,199
- What happened?
- What do you mean?

374
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,161
Is this about poor Jeffrey over there?

375
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,496
"Poor Jeffrey"?

376
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,290
He was trampled
by a stampede of secretaries...

377
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,128
...during the midnight release
of the talking Justin Bieber doll.

378
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,629
His legs were crushed.

379
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,341
He may never walk again.

380
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,343
But you would know that...

381
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,013
...if you ever bothered to come in
and actually manage the store, Grimes.

382
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,432
Or you, Bartowski...

383
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,768
...if you ever bothered to come by
and check up on your friends.

384
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,981
Shame.

385
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,696
Morgan, I can't believe it.

386
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,489
It's terrible. I feel so bad.

387
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,659
No, Morgan.
I mean, I literally can't believe it.

388
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,995
Really? This?
They wouldn't. They couldn't.

389
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:20,541
What am I talking about? It's Jeff
and Lester. It's a scam. Of course.

390
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,046
Please help.

391
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,548
Buy More insurance ran out.

392
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,552
Ugh. The audacity. As the secret owner
of this establishment...

393
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,721
...I know we have excellent insurance.

394
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,224
How are we gonna prove Jeff and Lester
are bilking from the store?

395
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:40,978
Maybe we construct some sort of ruse
and trick him up out of the chair.

396
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,063
Or we could... Hang on.

397
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,530
Or we could wait for him to stand up
like the moron that he is.

398
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,907
Yeah.

399
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,204
- This is some sort of insurance scam?
- Hey, guys.

400
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,664
Give back every penny,
or you're going to jail.

401
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,874
To see my mom?

402
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,002
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, guys, guys,
what are you doing?

403
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,837
This is a very sick man here.

404
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,174
Ah! Oh, my gosh.

405
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,593
Jeffrey, you can walk.

406
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,053
Guys, it's a miracle.

407
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,346
It's a miracle.

408
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,598
This is because of your donations.

409
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,525
Shame.

410
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,944
- Shame.
- Shame.

411
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,034
We may need to spend some more time
at the Buy More.

412
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,245
Yeah, we do. Oh.

413
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,289
Oh, I forgot.
Sarah wants to have a talk.

414
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,124
She knows I'm keeping a secret.

415
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,418
Oh, no. Not the house.

416
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,003
She's gonna try and break me.

417
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,296
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

418
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,799
Okay, I'm gonna hold on to this,
right?

419
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,218
And, uh, you go in there,
and you be strong.

420
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,597
Good luck. Remember,
I'm not there to save you this time.

421
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,229
- Sarah?
- In a minute.

422
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,190
Um...

423
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,820
So, honey, here's the thing.

424
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,155
Uh, I'm not trying to keep anything
from you.

425
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,450
You are my wife,
and that's a part of the deal.

426
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,785
I'm well aware of that.

427
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:24,999
I would, however, like to keep
a few things in a "special category"...

428
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,670
...of "you don't need to know about"-ness.
Yeah.

429
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,645
No, no.

430
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,815
Not today. This has worked in the past.
Not today.

431
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,317
What is it?

432
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,193
This. This. All that.

433
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,822
What's your secret, Chuck?

434
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,824
My lips are sealed.

435
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:03,120
Well, let me help you unseal them.

436
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,505
- Hand it over.
- He cracked like an egg.

437
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,343
- It's an acronym. You see the little dots?
- Whatever.

438
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,721
If you were to break it up
and sound it out phonetically...

439
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,895
It's very sweet, Chuck,
that you tried to surprise me.

440
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,064
With a dream home?

441
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,817
Like that one right there,
right on the sand.

442
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,321
The perfect house for
the perfect woman. What do you think?

443
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,660
It's not right, is it?

444
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,830
You know,
I could just keep playing detective...

445
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,708
...and trying to read your mind and...

446
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,877
Well, I haven't, um...

447
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,255
Well, this isn't something
that I've ever told anybody.

448
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,257
Hello?

449
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,592
Husband.

450
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,845
It's my official title now.
I have a ring to prove it.

451
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,848
You can tell me things
that you don't tell other people.

452
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:12,606
Uh, well, when I was a little girl, my, uh,
dad's "work" kept us moving around a lot.

453
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:17,277
And I always imagined
what a real family would feel like...

454
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,905
...what the perfect home
for us all would be...

455
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,033
...and, you know, the dream house.
Is this stupid?

456
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,994
No, no, it's not. Babe, continue.

457
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:31,792
Well, I always imagined, uh,
a little white house with a red door...

458
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,129
And don't laugh,
but it had a picket fence...

459
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:39,883
...just like, you know, the houses
that you see on TV that people live in.

460
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,260
Hmm.

461
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,804
Mid-century. Very Leave It to Beaver.

462
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,558
Cozy, homey and simple.

463
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,476
And perfect.

464
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:56,316
- Really?
- I'm gonna find you your dream home...

465
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,318
...whatever it takes.

466
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,487
I'll do anything. I promise.

467
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,326
Testing, one, two.

468
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,911
One, two, three.

469
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,422
Looking good, team.

470
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,257
Especially you, Sarah.

471
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,968
Well, let's have a great mission,
huh, team?

472
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,429
While I sit by myself in the van.

473
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,349
God, I hope this works.

474
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,522
All right.
Let's go over the plan one more time.

475
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,318
Casey, locate Bale's computer vault.
Morgan, Sarah, create a distraction...

476
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,696
...giving Casey time to get into the vault
and tap into the system.

477
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,031
Got it.

478
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:48,035
- Bale, old man. Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

479
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,204
- Right? Yeah, you remember Sarah?
- I do.

480
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,582
Right. This is Chalmers,
my mute manservant.

481
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,877
We have received your wire
and account information.

482
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,464
On behalf of our investors,
we're very excited to have you aboard.

483
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,216
Oh, I bet. I bet.

484
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,051
Follow me.

485
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,386
Will do.

486
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,473
I was to be your accountant.

487
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,225
What I did was I improvised.

488
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,601
- Okay.
- Hmm.

489
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,230
Morgan, buddy, you're doing great.
Doing great. Just stay on point.

490
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,232
Remember the mission.
Casey, you're up.

491
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:32,079
Excellent. Excellent, Casey. Excellent.
Cable leads down the hall.

492
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,915
- That's where the vault is.
- I'll need a key card.

493
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,917
- Sarah?
- I'm on it.

494
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,923
As you can see,
my fortune is based on shared wealth.

495
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:46,552
Finding others
who enjoy the better things in life.

496
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,929
Well, that's very bold, Mr. Bale.

497
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,599
Chuck, this jerk is starting to get handsy
with my girl.

498
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,268
Our girl. Your girl.

499
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,353
Calm. Calm, Morgan. Just calm down.

500
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,772
No, no, no.
I think I'm gonna zoom, okay?

501
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,442
I can feel it coming on. Kung fu.
I'll karate-chop this guy in the face.

502
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,362
No, no, no. Do not do that.
You're gonna zoom too soon.

503
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,948
Premature zoom? Really? Crap.

504
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,658
Okay, okay. What do I do?

505
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,119
Think about baseball.

506
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,453
Baseball.

507
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,790
Why baseball? I mean, come on.
It is so boring.

508
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,043
I mean, just pitch
the damn ball already.

509
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:24,464
And enough talk with the statistics. Do
you know what slugging percentage is?

510
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:29,177
I don't know what slugging percentage
is. And, honestly, who the hell cares?

511
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,224
All right, that worked.
Thank you, buddy. I'm good.

512
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,810
Perhaps I can show you around
the gardens outside.

513
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,564
They are modeled after
the pleasure gardens of Italy.

514
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,150
Well, the pleasure would be all mine.

515
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,320
You're a good girl.

516
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,908
- What a slime bag.
- Yeah.

517
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:55,162
Excellent work, everybody. Casey
is on his way to the computer vault.

518
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,166
- Morgan, Sarah, distraction time.
- Alrighty, Chuck. Am I up?

519
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,460
Oh, you are up, buddy. Zoom away.

520
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,469
Oh, yeah. I like that.

521
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,016
Sarah.

522
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,986
Let me show you how it's done.

523
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,972
Nice work, Morgan.

524
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,905
- We're in.
- Bingo.

525
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,074
Once all the accounts
are downloaded...

526
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:17,786
...we can reroute them
to the original investors.

527
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,040
No, no, no. What's happening?

528
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,335
Decker.

529
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,753
Hello, Chuck.

530
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,339
- What are you doing?
- I'm using your computer...

531
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,717
...to access Bale's accounts
and freeze them.

532
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,927
No, no, no.
You're gonna trigger the alarm.

533
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,512
My people are still inside.

534
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,097
Your people?

535
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,390
Cute.

536
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,114
I know you lied to me.
I know I'm not part of your plan...

537
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,908
...whatever the hell that is, okay?
You've won.

538
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,285
Now, let us go.

539
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,955
Payback's a bitch, Charlie.

540
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,375
No. Guys, guys, get out of there.

541
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,627
Mr. Carmichael?

542
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,965
Darling, I know what you did
with my key card.

543
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:17,095
Come with me now, or I will kill you
in front of all of my friends.

544
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:22,059
Uh-uh, I think, actually, what's gonna
happen is I'm gonna open up a big can of...

545
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,314
What?

546
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,566
Come with me, colonel.

547
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,611
Oh, I'm sorry.
You used to be a colonel.

548
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,407
Morgan, Sarah, Casey, please,
tell me what's happening.

549
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,173
I'm locked out of the accounts.
What have you done?

550
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:57,803
Do anything to us, and you'll never have
access to those accounts ever again.

551
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,805
You see, we work with somebody.

552
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:03,683
A master spy who always has a plan.

553
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,519
Okay. Okay, this isn't good.

554
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,522
No plan. No plan.
The master spy does not have a plan.

555
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,524
Uh, I don't wanna hear her voice anymore.

556
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:14,152
Take them all downstairs.
I'll decide what to do with them later.

557
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:18,198
I need you to get somebody from our
computer team on the phone right now!

558
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,491
Yes, sir.

559
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,700
I think I have a plan.

560
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,875
Computer emergency?

561
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,508
What's wrong with it?

562
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,386
An outside computer
is accessing your system.

563
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,887
You're under attack.

564
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,890
Don't worry. I cut into the attack.
Your accounts are here.

565
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,976
- Is it fixed?
- Yeppers.

566
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,853
Get rid of him.

567
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,397
Huh? Wait. What's happening?
I'm just the IT guy.

568
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:54,151
You saw things you weren't supposed
to see. And I don't like your face.

569
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,153
Kill him. Then the others.

570
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,530
I'd think twice about that, Bale.

571
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,701
I pull these wires,
your firewall goes down...

572
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,162
...and the CIA is inside of you
in seconds.

573
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,250
Inside of your computer in seconds.

574
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,043
Who are you?

575
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,879
Carmichael.

576
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,839
Charles Carmichael.

577
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,508
I have your brother, Michael.

578
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,595
I know, and you're gonna let him
and the others go.

579
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:26,892
I so much as sneeze,
and, well, you lose all your money.

580
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,478
Oh! Ha, ha. Oops.

581
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,606
That was about 10 million bucks
right there, Roge.

582
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,901
Let them go.

583
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,198
What the hell is going on?

584
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,283
You're free to go.

585
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,120
Hey, Chuck? Chuck, can you hear me?
Where are you?

586
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,039
- Sarah, you outside?
- Yeah.

587
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,625
They let us go. Are you still inside?

588
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,752
Don't worry about me. Just go.

589
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,629
No, I'm not going anywhere.

590
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:58,465
You, Casey and Morgan
get in the van and leave now.

591
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,758
Did I do great?

592
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:00,967
Shut up, moron.

593
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,470
Chuck, I am not leaving my husband
on a mission.

594
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,138
Sarah...

595
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,390
Sarah, I'm sorry.

596
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,517
I wanted to buy you the house.

597
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,812
I wanted to give you the future
you've always dreamed of.

598
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,732
- But more than that, I want you to live.
- Come on.

599
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,568
Don't make me die in vain.
Leave me behind.

600
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,237
Get in the van.

601
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,030
Leave. Leave me behind!

602
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,660
- We can't leave him behind like that.
- Please, leave!

603
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,749
Guys, please don't leave me behind.
I have a plan.

604
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,627
Your friends are safe,
but you're stuck here.

605
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,003
What were you thinking?

606
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,838
Actually, I was thinking fast.

607
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,841
There's a button on the control panel.
Hit that button.

608
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,969
I just hope they got my message.

609
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,193
Morgan, disconnect us
from the building's electrical line.

610
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,861
Casey, get the van moving.

611
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,115
Sarah, there's a rather large window
on the east side of the building.

612
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,702
It's the only way out.
So I'm gonna be jumping through it.

613
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,121
Casey, east side of the building.
Go, go, go.

614
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,727
And, Sarah...

615
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,562
...no matter what happens...

616
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,106
...I love you.

617
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,081
Also, ifat all possible,
if you could check...

618
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:59,336
...to make sure I'm still alive on the roof
of the van, that would be great.

619
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,589
- Good work, Chuck.
- Thanks, honey.

620
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,758
Hey, dude, that was awesome.

621
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:16,353
Listen, guys, team,
let's not get down, okay?

622
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,022
Yes, that was not
a classically successful mission...

623
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,068
...but, you know, we all made it out
alive, uh, so that's a plus.

624
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,278
And the news says
that Bale was arrested...

625
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,281
...so I think we should put that
in the "win" category.

626
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,742
Uh, win, uh... Win with an asterisk maybe.

627
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,453
- Ahem.
- It's not that, Chuck.

628
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,206
Well, okay, what is it, then?

629
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:43,171
Decker froze Bale's accounts, which
included the money we transferred in.

630
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:47,258
Castle and the Buy More
are the only things that aren't frozen.

631
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:51,304
Decker froze all of our money because
he tracked our deposit back to us.

632
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,474
Wait.

633
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,811
Wait. What? All of our money?

634
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,063
- We have nothing?
- Payback's a bitch.

635
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,401
Okay, think about it. We still have
the Buy More, and we still have me.

636
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,655
And, uh, Sarah and Casey, you.
This is still a team. We can still do this.

637
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,573
I think I, uh... I need a little air.

638
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,914
Chuck.

639
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,084
Listen, it's okay. We'll bounce back.
We always do.

640
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,003
Yeah.

641
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,256
I gotta...

642
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,925
Uh, I'll be back.

643
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,228
Chuck, you found it.

644
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,607
What's the matter?

645
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,527
I can't afford it.

646
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:51,489
If I bought it yesterday with our fortune,
we'd own it, but now...

647
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,784
I'm so sorry, Sarah.

648
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,709
Well, so what? I mean,
we knew this wasn't gonna be easy...

649
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:06,129
...and we didn't get married
because we thought life was easy.

650
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,174
We got married so that
we could be there for each other...

651
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,675
...when things got tough.

652
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:14,679
So we could work through things
together, rich or poor.

653
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,390
How are we gonna do this?
We gotta start over.

654
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,726
It's okay.
We'll get new clients and missions.

655
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,563
And we haven't lost everything.
We still have Castle and the store.

656
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,398
The Buy More?

657
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,402
The Buy More.

658
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:34,199
We use the store to support the
spy team. We take Buy More's profits...

659
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:37,994
...put them into Carmichael Industries
until both companies can make money.

660
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,830
For that to work,
the store has to turn a profit.

661
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,667
We can do that.

662
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,921
What about me, though?

663
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,840
You and Casey are super spies.
Morgan's the Intersect.

664
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,509
Who am I? What's my job?

665
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,845
Chuck, you're our leader.

666
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,107
That's the plan.

667
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,944
As you can see...

668
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,280
...our superiors' interference
in Chuck Bartowski's life...

669
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,949
...has only just begun.

670
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:21,079
