1
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,632
Mr. Quinn...

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,219
...I understand you are interested
in purchasing The Key.

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,555
Ted Roark gave this to me.

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:19,268
I worked at Fulcrum for 10 years
and this is all I have to show for it.

5
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,064
Of course, the only person who can
use it is someone with an Intersect.

6
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,985
I have one of my very own,
but the damn thing's glitchy.

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,613
Either it cooks your brain
or it steals your memories.

8
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,409
- And I need The Key to fix it.
- Interesting.

9
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:40,622
Edgar, keep that to yourself.
I have a few enemies.

10
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,610
You do realize
that's only one part of The Key?

11
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,738
- There are two other pieces.
- I do.

12
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,074
Sources tell me
a former member of The Ring...

13
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,701
...acquired one from Volkoff
a few years back.

14
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,163
The Ring. What amateurs.

15
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:32,466
Edgar, do you still carry that Walther
under your jacket?

16
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,344
Of course. Why do you ask?

17
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,810
Sarah.

18
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,940
You're upset, I can tell.

19
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,777
You stole my memories
and you ruined my life.

20
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:08,418
Sarah, I'm still alive.

21
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:14,174
Come on. Go for the gun.

22
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,220
You're so close. Go for the gun.

23
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,726
No!

24
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,930
- Good morning.
- Morgan...

25
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,309
You're feeling down and miss Sarah
but it's time to get out of bed.

26
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,644
She's gone, man. Sarah's gone.

27
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,772
Out of bed, Chuck.
You are getting Sarah back today.

28
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,194
What? What?
She doesn't remember me, okay?

29
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,780
Or you or us or any of it. How many
people are in my room right now?

30
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,783
Dude, you can do this.
You can get Sarah back.

31
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,328
- Even Clara agrees.
- Hi, Clara.

32
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,289
Think about it. Every impossible
mission starts with what?

33
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,167
James Bond taking that giant step
and getting out of bed.

34
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,002
First, you're mixing spy metaphors.

35
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,255
Second, if you haven't noticed,
I'm not exactly James Bond.

36
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,716
I'm actually no longer a spy
and I lost my wife.

37
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,677
I'm back where I was before,
alone in Burbank.

38
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,679
You are not alone. You have us.

39
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,974
You are not the person you were
five years ago. You are much more.

40
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,144
Yeah, there you go.
One sit-up closer to getting the girl back.

41
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,689
This is crazy. I tried to get her
to remember me and it didn't work.

42
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,150
I can't get her to fall in love
with me again.

43
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,571
Chuck, it's clear that we can't force
Sarah to remember...

44
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,991
...but emotions, feelings,
those are powerful things.

45
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:07,329
And if you can find Sarah, maybe you
can spark some of these memories.

46
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,375
- Really?
- She fell in love with you before, Chuck.

47
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,419
You can do it again. She'll remember.

48
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,131
Do you really think it could work?

49
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,634
That she could just...

50
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,719
...snap out of it?

51
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,780
Yeah, you know what? You're right.

52
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,617
I can do this.
I took down The Ring, Fulcrum.

53
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,661
I'm a very impressive spy for hire.

54
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,126
We fell in love once, we can do it again.
She'll remember.

55
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,752
That's what I'm talking about.

56
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,088
That's the spirit.
Wow, I just said that.

57
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,759
I mean, she may be the best spy
in the world, but I'm Chuck Bartowski.

58
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,761
It's not like she's out of my league.

59
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,603
I can do it.
I can get Sarah Walker back.

60
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,864
Your target is Nicholas Quinn.

61
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,909
- I take it you don't want him alive.
- No, I want him very dead.

62
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,789
- Done. I'm ready to go.
- Are you?

63
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,084
Carmichael Industries dropped the ball
on this already.

64
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,087
Five years in Burbank
could turn a man into butter.

65
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,799
But for this job, I need you ruthless.

66
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,302
Anything less and you'll get killed.

67
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,348
I need old Casey, my best agent.
I need the colonel.

68
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,942
I can do it.

69
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,986
It's not just about finding Sarah...

70
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,280
...it's having a plan
for what to do next.

71
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,910
Chuck, this is your mission, okay?
Find Sarah, be yourself.

72
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:14,373
Be myself? Be myself?
Okay, well, what version of myself?

73
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,042
Lord of the Nerd Herd
or charming Charles Carmichael?

74
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,045
- No, the guy that she fell for.
- Yeah, I agree with that.

75
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,840
Also, I have another notion.
I think that you should kiss her.

76
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,887
- Did you... I'm sorry, what?
- Kiss her. Grab this woman and kiss her.

77
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,306
- Just kiss her. That's the whole plan?
- Yeah.

78
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,060
Yes, I've been watching a ton of Disney
princess movies with baby Clara...

79
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,854
...but I firmly believe
one magical kiss from you...

80
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,357
...could unlock all of Sarah's memories.
I do.

81
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,110
Enough with the crazy.

82
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,113
Exactly. We're wagging the dog.
We gotta find Sarah first.

83
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,407
But how do you find a woman
who doesn't wanna be found?

84
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,577
Can we find women?
Can we find women?

85
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,121
Are you kidding me?

86
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:58,291
We can find a woman off the remnants
of an Outback Bloomin' Onion.

87
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,503
Unleash the perverts.

88
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,463
Stalk, it's Gawk, I got your specs.

89
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,716
Gawker, it's Stalker. We need a bead
on a big blonde bird, please.

90
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,387
- Sounds like a job for the DirtDog.
- Up and hot. I'll get a bead on your bird.

91
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,888
- Good Twinkie.
- Good Twinkie.

92
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,976
- My Twitter feed shows multiple...
- Helicopter just spotted a Lotus doing 60.

93
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,271
- A Van Nuys gas station...
- Puts her at Burbank.

94
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,732
- Use the breadcrumbs, nab that Gretel.
- Sniff it out. You got it.

95
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,402
- Use your sniffers.
- Tall blonde with amazing legs...

96
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,529
...and a TEC-9.
- ID'd as Uma Thurman...

97
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,489
- Follow that birdie.
- Thank you.

98
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,075
- Okay, Lester. Lester.
- Jeffery. Jeffery.

99
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,410
What's happening here?

100
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,872
She landed at LAX at 9:34 last night.
She's en route to Burbank.

101
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,125
In tight blue jeans
and a cleavage-enhancing top, meow.

102
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,836
- How do you know that?
- At an Internet cafe.

103
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,589
Web history shows search
for a Carmichael Industries.

104
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:50,427
Positive ID on one Sarah Walker in
this Buy More at the Nerd Herd desk.

105
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:54,473
I'm sorry, no nip-slips
nor pokey peaks.

106
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,975
What...? I'm sorry, wait, what?
She's here now?

107
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,561
No nip-slips.

108
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,971
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi.

109
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,808
I didn't know
whether I should ring the bell.

110
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:43,230
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry, let me try that one again.

111
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,983
It is really great to see you.
It really, really, really is.

112
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,861
You look fantastic.
Of course, you always look fantastic.

113
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,279
That's kind of your thing.

114
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,367
So with that, what are you doing here?

115
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,245
Your spy base.

116
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,248
- Castle? Yeah?
- I need it.

117
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,503
We lost track of Quinn but I know
what he wants. A device called The Key.

118
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,588
An ex-Fulcrum agent
had the first piece.

119
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,591
And a former Ring operative,
Renny Deutch, has the second.

120
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,594
I read your profile,
and you're good with computers?

121
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:19,516
Yeah, I can hack with the best of them.
Back in the day, they used to call me...

122
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,103
Doesn't really matter. Not important.
You need me to find Renny? Done.

123
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,146
Great. Thank you.

124
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,794
Hey, there, stranger, I...

125
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,673
Hi, Sarah.

126
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,510
Morgan. Hi. I'm sorry about that.

127
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,679
No, no, it's actually, it's my fault.

128
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,473
We've danced that dance before
and I should know.

129
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,476
I should know better
than to sneak up on you.

130
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,813
Can I help you?

131
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,154
No, no, I just wanted to tell you...

132
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,657
...that there was a time I was Chuck's
number one go-to best friend.

133
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,201
And then you came along
and things changed.

134
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:25,290
If I was to hand the title off to anyone,
I was always really happy it was you.

135
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,209
I just wanted you to know that.

136
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,086
Found him.

137
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,673
Renny Deutch. German arms dealer,
sets up shop in Berlin.

138
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,092
He's there now.
So we find him, we find Quinn.

139
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,719
Looks like I need a ticket to Berlin.

140
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,429
Mm-hm.

141
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,599
Go. You gotta be on this mission.

142
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:48,104
Uh, Sarah? Hey, quick question
before you go.

143
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,190
What's your plan
once you find Quinn?

144
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,399
I kill him.

145
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,528
And then I disappear forever.

146
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,739
Really? Really? Wow.

147
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,117
- Okay, well, then, my second question...
- I can't be here.

148
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,662
I don't know how to be
the woman you remember.

149
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,373
All I remember is being a spy.
A good one.

150
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,625
It's all I know how to do.

151
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:13,338
I understand that. I get that.
But I can help.

152
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,757
If you go to Berlin,
you're gonna get killed...

153
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,801
...but me and my team, we can...

154
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,014
Yes, I'm small
but I'm worth three spies on a mission...

155
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:27,018
...and I'm a very good listener.
- With us you stand a chance.

156
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,979
You don't have the Intersect
and you haven't been trained.

157
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,857
I am trained. You trained me.
You were my handler.

158
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,859
Okay.

159
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,321
Do you know how to use this?

160
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,615
Um...

161
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:47,664
Yeah, I can handle a Desert Eagle
because I'm a stone-cold spy.

162
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,668
- That's me. I'm lethal.
- You'll need to be.

163
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,753
Let's go.

164
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,313
- What if I have to use this thing?
- Don't do that.

165
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,818
Sarah fell in love with you in part for not
shooting people. Please remember that.

166
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,279
Okay, Renny just arrived.

167
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,365
We follow him until he makes contact
then take them both out.

168
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,118
Great. Cool. Sounds like a plan.

169
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,036
Okay, let's go.

170
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,040
- Was that okay?
- Do me a favor.

171
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,418
Don't worry about anything.
Be yourself, okay?

172
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,754
Under no circumstances
do you shoot anybody...

173
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,797
...no matter how dangerous it gets.

174
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,267
- El Compadre.
- What?

175
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,937
This place looks just like El Compadre.
It's a Mexican restaurant in L.A.

176
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,397
We went there when we first met.

177
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,243
Perfect, Chuck. This is fate. See?
Maybe Sarah will remember something.

178
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,287
Just use the old Chuck charm.

179
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,460
We just follow these schmucks around?
That's how we find Quinn?

180
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,963
Don't you sell Chuck and Sarah short.
They're damn fine operatives.

181
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,632
Yes, sir.

182
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,180
This has gotta be some sign.

183
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:31,059
I mean, think about it.
El Compadre was sort of our first date.

184
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,268
Not for you so much.

185
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,896
You were still just being
a spy back then...

186
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,525
...but for me, yeah, totally. I mean...

187
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,902
...I somehow thought
I stumbled on a date...

188
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,655
...with the most
beautiful woman in the world.

189
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,700
I was so nervous.
And you were so amazing.

190
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,286
We talked and laughed
and had such a great time.

191
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:54,082
We went dancing afterwards,
and you were doing these crazy...

192
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,668
...sexy dance moves.
- Chuck, stop.

193
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,797
- It's our story. Don't you want to hear it?
- Chuck, we're on a mission, okay?

194
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,298
The focus is Renny.

195
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,135
That's okay. If Sarah doesn't
wanna hear the story, focus on tonight.

196
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,429
You make this mish
as romantic as you can.

197
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,641
You make that girl fall in love
with you all over again.

198
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,687
You're right. No more stories.
Let's focus on the op.

199
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,859
The buyer's changing location.
Cancel my enchiladas rancheros.

200
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,820
- We're leaving.
- The target's on the move.

201
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:28,658
Morgan, track where he's going.
We may need a wardrobe change.

202
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,544
- You look beautiful, by the way.
- Thank you.

203
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,172
Your tie just needs a little fixing.

204
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,091
- You look great.
- Thanks.

205
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,261
Oh, Chuck, this is great.
Russian Consulate mission, right?

206
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,598
There'll be music and dancing
and sexy outfits. Now listen to me.

207
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:56,144
You grab her, and you look
in each other's eyes, and you kiss.

208
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,231
She'll remember the last five years, okay?
I promise you. You can do this.

209
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,483
Okay, I need to find somebody
to dance with.

210
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,862
- I'm gonna get close to Renny...
- Sarah, please.

211
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,780
You taught me how to dance.

212
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,048
Get me close. To Renny.

213
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,508
- Close to Renny.
- Right. Renny. Right.

214
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,605
Our buyer's paranoid.

215
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,442
He's changing the location again.
We have to go.

216
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,655
- New location.
- Morgan, we're on the move again.

217
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,049
This place is disgusting.

218
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,596
- What? What is it?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

219
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,306
Attaboy, Chuck. Play it cool.

220
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,187
Quinn must be running late.

221
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,481
We have to do some waiting around.

222
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,571
- Sarah, what are you doing?
- They're in the wrong order.

223
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,324
- What?
- Well, that's not how it should be.

224
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,620
You know this place?

225
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,959
Uh...

226
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,588
- No. No, I don't.
- No, Sarah, it's okay.

227
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,134
It's important. You used to work here.
I mean, not here in Berlin...

228
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,470
...but the Wienerlicious in Burbank.
It was your first cover job.

229
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,807
Come on, you can remember.
Please. Please try.

230
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,603
Touching.

231
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,196
- Mr. Deutch, did you bring The Key?
- I did.

232
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,116
- But it's gonna cost you, Quinn.
- Oh.

233
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,869
The Ring spent a lot of money
acquiring this.

234
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,007
I never liked The Ring.

235
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,717
One more to go.

236
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,056
I got more targets inside
the Wienerlicious.

237
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,807
Quinn's made his move.
Let's get down there.

238
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,688
This one was in a spy van
across the street.

239
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,232
Spy van? Really? It's that obvious?

240
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,611
Drop your guns.

241
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,284
It's Morgan.

242
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,582
Oh, Sarah,
you really don't remember, do you?

243
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,002
Relax, boys, these two are mine.

244
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,963
Your husband is
one of the world's greatest...

245
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,217
What's the word?

246
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,469
- Pussies.

247
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,612
Chuck, stop him!

248
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,087
Stop! Stop, Quinn, stop!

249
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:55,466
- Don't. I will shoot you!
- Chuck?

250
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,220
Chuck? Take your shot.

251
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,722
I don't have a clean shot.

252
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,891
Chuck! Shoot him.

253
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,476
Stop!

254
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,734
Hey, we're hit! Get us down!

255
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,909
Brace! Brace!

256
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,006
Hey.

257
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,216
Is that my Desert Eagle?

258
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,638
You shot down my helicopter
with my own damn gun.

259
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,141
It was more of a warning shot
than anything else.

260
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,320
Dude, uncuff me.

261
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,238
I want you to tell Alex something for me.

262
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,158
Tell her I'm going away for a while.

263
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,494
- What the hell is going on here?
- Bartowski and Walker screwed up.

264
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,789
- So you arrest your own team?
- Old team.

265
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,251
You had him in your sights.
All you had to do was pull the trigger.

266
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,755
- What do you want me to say?
- That your mistake cost us this mission.

267
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,592
You let Quinn get one step closer
to assembling The Key.

268
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:24,847
Fine. I'll take the hit. But in my defense,
killing was never my thing.

269
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,349
You're a spy, aren't you?

270
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,518
It's actually one of the things
you liked about me...

271
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,605
...the fact
that I wouldn't pull the trigger.

272
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,985
Tell me why
you're not returning Alex's calls.

273
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,489
She is worried sick. All she knows is
you're running covert missions.

274
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,825
They call them covert, numb nuts,
because you don't tell anyone.

275
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,286
- She's your daughter.
- She's a liability.

276
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:49,956
Wow.

277
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,584
I don't mean that.
Just, I have to be ruthless.

278
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,338
Well, at first, you thought
I was weak or scared, and maybe I was.

279
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,258
But you taught me how to be a spy,
Sarah.

280
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:05,221
And after we, you know...

281
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,103
After we fell in love,
you stood up for me.

282
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,773
You didn't want me to be any other spy.
You didn't want me to change.

283
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,567
What about Chuck and Sarah?
Liability too, right? Good.

284
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,529
Lock them up, throw away the key,
lock away your feelings.

285
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,616
Forget everything that
we've been through and you be ruthless.

286
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:30,621
You just don't understand, do you?
I got soft.

287
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,082
I lost my edge.

288
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,336
Your team was your edge,
you giant jackass.

289
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,506
What is wrong with you?
Wanna find Quinn, you know who to call.

290
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,426
Don't you try to blame this on us
because you're afraid.

291
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,554
You're afraid that, with us,
that's when you're the best...

292
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,015
...and that's the truth, man.

293
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,981
That's it? No response or anything?

294
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,279
- Screw it.
- Screw what, John?

295
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,406
The court-martial.

296
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,492
I'm in.

297
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,955
- What are you...? I'm free?
- Yep.

298
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,959
You, your wife, and my little roommate
are gonna help me track down Quinn.

299
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,545
Walker?

300
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,422
You're escaping without me?

301
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,216
Look, I heard your pep talk.

302
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,803
I think I'm better off hunting Quinn
on my own.

303
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,139
- No, we're doing this together.
- I'm leaving.

304
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,350
- No, no, you're not.
- Why?

305
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,019
- Because of my mother.
- What?

306
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,480
- She's a spy.
- So?

307
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,648
And she's standing right behind you
with a gun.

308
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,153
Sarah. Relax.

309
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,365
Chuck. I asked Mom to come...
Mom, why is there a gun out?

310
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,368
Sorry, dear, old habits.

311
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,330
It's good to see you again, Sarah.
My name is Mary.

312
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,167
Grandma, what did we say
about Baby Clara seeing firearms?

313
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:03,214
It's a no-no. I am sorry.
Your mimi loves you.

314
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:08,969
Chuck, I have intel on The Key.
You staying, Sarah?

315
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,683
Your father originally developed
the Intersect as a teaching tool.

316
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:18,521
The Key was the matrix
for programming the system.

317
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,730
So it can do anything.

318
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,441
Roark, Hartley and Stephen
split the pieces...

319
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,404
...so that no one could alter the Intersect
without their agreement.

320
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,825
Your father gave his piece to someone in
the government. There's one upload left.

321
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,494
If Quinn puts
all three pieces together...

322
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,872
...he could fix the bug that blitzed
Sarah and Morgan's memories...

323
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,001
...and then upload it into himself.
- He could also add new skills...

324
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,254
...new information.

325
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,298
Chuck, we need to talk.

326
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,637
What Mom is talking about
is an Intersect...

327
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,141
...that can create a new identity
or restore an old one.

328
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,686
We could load Sarah's memories
onto The Key.

329
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,397
This could work.
We create a file on Sarah, okay?

330
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,275
Your wedding album,
her dossier, everything.

331
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,611
All you have to do is get the
Intersect glasses back from Quinn.

332
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,781
It's gonna take a few days
but I can reprogram them for Sarah.

333
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,660
- Just convince her it's the right thing.
- You're amazing. This is fantastic.

334
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,329
Ooh.

335
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,582
- Hey.
- Chuck.

336
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,959
Quinn was entering
the Pacific Concert Hall.

337
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,836
Beckman's to meet
her Chinese counterpart.

338
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,006
Your mother says Stephen gave The Key
to someone in government.

339
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,175
She's the target.
Beckman has The Key.

340
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,637
We found Quinn. He's at
the Pacific Concert Hall. We gotta go.

341
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,935
Pacific Concert Hall.

342
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,438
They need us. Let's go.

343
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:57,953
Please sit still, general.
The bomb is pressure sensitive.

344
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,463
And if you don't mind, Diane...

345
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,550
...the badge of the person in charge
of the Intersect Project.

346
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,971
The designers gave it to you?
What an honor.

347
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:21,685
And all these years, you never knew
it was the third part of The Key.

348
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,319
Hey, general, it's Chuck.
We think you might be in danger.

349
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,738
She's in more danger than you know,
Chuck.

350
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,074
It's over.

351
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,493
I win.

352
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,180
- General, what have we got here?
- There is a bomb under my chair.

353
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,848
I can't stand up.

354
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,978
Get the Chinese delegation
out of here.

355
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,271
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,023
Pull up the blueprints to the hall.
We need to evacuate.

357
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:11,944
Wait. Guys, it looks like a sonic trigger,
probably tied to the performance.

358
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,447
- When the music stops, it goes?
- Exactly.

359
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,200
Get everybody out of here.

360
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,996
No, no, no. We disrupt the performance,
it'll blow up.

361
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,539
That is an order.

362
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,667
General, with all due respect, shut up.
We're saving you.

363
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,422
I got something.

364
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,346
If that's the bomb,
these are the brains. It's locked.

365
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,557
- Any ideas?
- No, not yet.

366
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,227
Chuck, I just picked up Quinn
on the internal security feed.

367
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,605
- He's heading to the roof.
- I'll get Quinn.

368
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,899
- Chuck, he has the Intersect glasses.
- No, Sarah.

369
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,278
- No, let her go. We don't have time.
- Well, get me more time, okay?

370
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,615
I need Quinn to stop this bomb
and I need those glasses for Sarah.

371
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,325
Go, go.

372
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,956
I'm ready for extraction.

373
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,500
We're on our way, sir. Three minutes.

374
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,918
- Morgan?
- Yeah.

375
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:13,297
Gotta keep the music going.
Can't let it stop. What are we gonna do?

376
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,341
Casey, Morgan.

377
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,344
Okay, we're here.
Who do we shoot first?

378
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,679
What are they doing here?

379
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,931
Hold on a second,
hold on a second, Casey.

380
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,101
I got a plan. You're not going to like it
but I got a plan.

381
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,441
Quinn!

382
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:39,114
Sarah! Wait, wait, wait. Don't kill him.
We need him to disarm the bomb.

383
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,868
The bomb?

384
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,623
It can't be stopped.

385
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:54,046
And it's wired to explode
when the music ends.

386
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,302
Which is right about now.

387
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,653
What's happening?

388
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,160
One word: Jeffster.

389
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,342
Talking away

390
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,094
I don't know what to say

391
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,303
We're doomed.

392
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,098
I'll say it anyway

393
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,351
Today is not my day to find you

394
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,146
I've been doing this for too long now.

395
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,773
But not tonight, not again.

396
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:59,111
Take on me

397
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,529
Take on me

398
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,783
Take me on

399
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,201
Take on me

400
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:10,164
I'll be gone

401
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:15,043
- You're done, Quinn.
- Then we die together.

402
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,552
Oh, God.

403
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,974
What are you doing?

404
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:35,314
I had a plan, Sarah,
a really good plan.

405
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,651
There's one upload left.

406
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:43,155
Ellie and I were gonna use these glasses
to help save your memories.

407
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,326
- Will it work?
- Yeah.

408
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,244
There's not enough time...

409
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,623
...and I don't know how to disarm
the bomb without the Intersect.

410
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:03,258
- There's only one upload left.
- Sarah, I'm sorry.

411
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,055
I can't help you get
your memories back.

412
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,141
I can't get you back.

413
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,270
I have to save them.

414
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,841
Let's go.

415
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,929
Take on me

416
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,180
Take on me

417
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:54,184
Take me on

418
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,811
Take on me

419
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:00,357
I'll be gone

420
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:05,904
In a day or two

421
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,341
All right, let me at it.

422
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,435
Oh, it's been a while
since I've done that.

423
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,027
So needless to say

424
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:48,363
- What's the matter?
- This laptop is an old Prism Express.

425
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,365
Configuration could be tricky.

426
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,410
You're all the things I've got to remember

427
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,245
Okay, what about Irene Demova?

428
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,374
Sarah, that's brilliant. That's brilliant.

429
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,878
The virus could circumvent the system
and disarm the bomb.

430
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,130
That was five years ago.
You remembered.

431
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,591
Take on me
Take me on

432
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,510
Chuck. Chuck, find the porn virus,
find it now.

433
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,220
Right, right, right, okay, okay.

434
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,933
I'll be gone

435
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,770
Five-year-old porn virus,
mere seconds until certain death.

436
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,231
- Can I do it?
- Am I sexy?

437
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,532
Who is sexy? Am I sexy? Am I sexy?

438
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,494
Sexy? Sexy?

439
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,085
Good work, team.

440
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,546
On behalf of the
United States government...

441
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,716
...and the great people
we serve, thank you.

442
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,677
Just happy to be doing good works,
ma'am.

443
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,888
I understand this is the end.

444
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,308
- Yes, it is, general. I think we...
- It's me.

445
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,810
I, um...

446
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,355
I need to go find myself.

447
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,191
We all do.

448
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:58,994
If you ever wanna save the world again,
you know where I am.

449
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:09,337
So here we are. The original band.

450
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,508
- Gotta go.
- No. What? Wait, really? Really?

451
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:17,471
I can smell it. You're gonna get weepy
and emotional. I'll just skip that part.

452
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,723
I'll see you when I see you, Bartowski,
huh?

453
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,600
Good-bye, Casey.

454
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:31,359
There's one thing Russians do well.
It's give good hugs.

455
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,448
- Walker.
- Colonel.

456
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,388
So Irene Demova.

457
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,724
I'm...

458
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,394
I'm not really sure what it meant.

459
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,564
Or maybe it's a fresh start,
a new beginning.

460
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,069
I need some time to think. To be alone.

461
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,573
I'm sorry.

462
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:26,456
You know, Morgan had this idea.
It's nutty, really.

463
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,583
That if we...

464
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,674
You have to go, I understand.

465
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,528
So the moment the music stopped,
the bomb would blow up.

466
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,322
- So Chuck calls us.
- So we could save the day.

467
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,908
So Jeffster could rock again.

468
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,459
So what you're saying is,
Chuck Bartowski is a spy...

469
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,879
...who runs a spy company
underneath the store.

470
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:17,757
The exciting part is we saved the day.
You didn't get that? We'll go again.

471
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,343
I got it. But do I believe it?

472
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,138
Not a word, boys. Not a word.

473
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,893
Things, though, are a-changing.

474
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,229
New owners moving in.

475
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,731
Looking fresh.

476
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,150
I'm gonna be eating fresh.

477
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,946
- We gotta get back to work.
- Excuse me.

478
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,157
Are you Jeffster?

479
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,827
I saw your performance last night
at the Pacific Concert Hall.

480
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,706
I'm a very important record executive
from Germany.

481
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,793
You're gonna be stars there.
Women and men will adore you.

482
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,964
- Women and men?
- Wait. Wait a minute now.

483
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:03,845
- You want us to leave this store?
- Yes. Right now. Come with me.

484
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,482
Jeffrey.

485
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,236
Are you ready?

486
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,446
Let's rock.

487
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,951
Wunderbar. Come on.

488
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,880
- You two moving in together?
- We're moving in together.

489
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,008
- It's not fun with you.
- It was a surprise. How did you know?

490
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,177
Hello? Spy.

491
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,762
And you're?

492
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,057
Happy that we're finally taking
this nice, giant step and...

493
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,351
- It's okay.
- Or you're gonna shoot me?

494
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,563
- Heads up. The place all is yours.
- We're all gonna live together?

495
00:37:55,982 --> 00:38:00,235
No, just the two of you.
I have someplace I need to be.

496
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,071
You're going after Gertrude.

497
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,618
- I was gonna ask you...
- Dad, you don't have to ask.

498
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,539
You deserve to be happy. Go.

499
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,374
- Run to her.
- Run to her.

500
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,918
I'm a Casey. I don't run.

501
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,337
I stalk my prey.

502
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,141
Oh, my precious Clara.

503
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,310
You are gonna love Chicago.

504
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,771
And Mimi is gonna come
and see you all the time.

505
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,861
I don't know
how I'm supposed to leave you like this.

506
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,157
Ellie, you have to.

507
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,744
You've taken care of me
for far too long.

508
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,789
You have Clara and Devon. I'm fine.

509
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,125
I'm all grown up now.

510
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,961
My little brother.

511
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,841
Aces, Charles. You're aces.

512
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,678
What about Sarah, Chuck?

513
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,682
I don't know.

514
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,730
- Morgan, she could be anywhere.
- Okay, you know where she is.

515
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:22,650
You once told me to listen to our hearts
because our brains only screw us up.

516
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:26,112
- I was in love then.
- You're still in love.

517
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:30,909
I want you to imagine something for me,
okay? Where is she right now?

518
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:36,247
Don't think. Use your heart.
Where is she?

519
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,356
I was hoping you'd be here.

520
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,069
This place is important, isn't it?

521
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,365
Yeah, yeah, very much.

522
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,953
This is actually where you told me
I was gonna be okay.

523
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,539
That I could trust you.

524
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,043
And that's exactly what I'm doing now.
I'm asking you to trust me.

525
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:27,173
Sarah, I don't want anything from you.
I...

526
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,927
I just need you to know
that wherever you go...

527
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,430
...I'll always be there to help you.

528
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,519
Someone you can call. Whenever.

529
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,693
Trust me, Sarah.

530
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,697
I'm here for you always.

531
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,959
Chuck?

532
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,004
Tell me our story.

533
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,510
Yeah, yeah.

534
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:18,349
Where to begin? Well, it started
with a guy who worked at Buy More.

535
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,271
And one day, an old college friend of his
sent him an e-mail...

536
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,607
...that was filled with secrets.

537
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,153
And then, the next day,
his life really changed...

538
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,239
...when he met a spy named Sarah.

539
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,659
And he fell in love.

540
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:40,431
You know, Morgan has this crazy idea.

541
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,392
What is it?

542
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,523
He thinks that with one kiss,
you'll remember everything.

543
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:54,779
- Ha. One magical kiss?
- Yeah. Ha, ha. Exactly.

544
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,116
- I know it's...
- Chuck?

545
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,954
- Yeah?
- Kiss me.
