00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,253
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things
that you might need to know:

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,839
There are repercussions
for your actions.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,091
- So you're under arrest.
- For what?

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,801
Attempted homicide.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,847
John Casey,
you're under arrest for murder.

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,602
Visiting hours are in effect.

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:25,858
All inmates with visiting passes
report to visitation area.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,110
How you holding up?

9
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,196
Well, the government I proudly served
for 20 years...

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,657
...has locked me up
with the scum of the earth.

11
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,409
I'm great.

12
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,912
Hold out your hand.

13
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,295
- What is that?
- We have a plan to get you out of here.

14
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,797
Just take it.
You have any idea how hard it is...

15
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:52,468
...to shrink blueprints to this size?
Guy at Kinko's thought I was crazy.

16
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,470
Put that away. I am not breaking out.

17
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,805
There is a very strong case
against you.

18
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,641
Escape might be your only option
to get your life back.

19
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,810
If I break out of prison, I'm a fugitive.

20
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,521
I don't run from the law. I am the law.

21
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,316
Now, Decker has me in here for a reason.

22
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,820
I'm gonna sit tight, keep my head down,
you figure out what his angle is, okay?

23
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,156
- Fine.
- You gonna be okay in here?

24
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,824
Yeah.

25
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,785
If that one doesn't drive me insane.

26
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:22,998
Okay, I admit it. I tried to poison you
to keep you subordinate.

27
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,250
- What is the big deal?
- I could have died.

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,002
But you didn't.

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,590
All right, look, recently I put some
people that I care about through, uh...

30
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,258
Through some rough times.

31
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,804
That's the thing. True friendship is...
It's confusing, isn't it?

32
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,514
Mm.

33
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,557
Look, guys, please...

34
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,727
...just, aah, tell me what I have to do
to get out of this place.

35
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:48,232
It's so simple. Okay. Jeff has agreed to
drop all charges under one condition.

36
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,483
Okay.

37
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,735
You promise
not to poison him anymore.

38
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,447
- Sorry, I can't promise that.
- Wake up, man.

39
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,867
You are gonna get yourself killed.
Doesn't matter. I don't care.

40
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,369
Good luck in prison.

41
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,205
Good luck finding
a better Indian guy in your life...

42
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,542
...or at the Buy More.
And I will see you both in hell.

43
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,752
Which is just what I call
visiting hours.

44
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,547
John, let's go back inside,
bench press some poundage.

45
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,758
I'm gonna look like a Hinjew
Michelangelo by the time I get out.

46
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,593
Hi, you. Johnny, move.

47
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,639
I told him I was in here
for parking tickets.

48
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,768
It takes every fiber of my being not
to drop that barbell right on his throat.

49
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,896
Visiting hours are now over.

50
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,773
I gotta get back in there.

51
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,817
Check into Decker.

52
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,654
But be careful,
he's capable of anything.

53
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,417
Thank you. I can't help feeling like
Casey going to prison is all my fault.

54
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,210
What? Why would you say that?

55
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,421
I'm the genius
who started a spy company...

56
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,339
...and convinced you
to work with me.

57
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,717
Decker wanted Casey in jail
no matter what.

58
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,262
Whether we worked for ourselves
or the CIA, it doesn't really matter.

59
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,806
And I'm not saying that
to make you feel better.

60
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,767
Well, maybe a little.

61
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,729
- Thank you.
- Chuck, you've got...

62
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,814
- Sarah, you got a...
- Oh, no.

63
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,941
Honey... Uhn.

64
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,410
Sorry for the theatrics getting you here.

65
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:28,123
Sometimes it's just more fun to knock
somebody out and toss them in a van.

66
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,043
Why'd you bring us here?

67
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,003
I need you to do a job for me.

68
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,381
You throw our partner in jail
and now you want a favor from us?

69
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,218
In exchange,
I will make all of his charges disappear.

70
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,596
Think of Mr. Casey
as a giant slab of leverage.

71
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:47,142
And we all know that stubborn bastard
will rot in prison unless I say otherwise.

72
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,895
You have the entire CIA
under your thumb. Why us?

73
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,941
This mission involves some extremely
dangerous technological terrorism.

74
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,318
Sure, I have agents
who can write code...

75
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,697
...but none who can do it as well as you
can and handle themselves in the field.

76
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,451
There's no room for error here.
We need you.

77
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,290
Okay.

78
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,043
We're listening.

79
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,755
We've been tracking a computer
super virus named the Omen.

80
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,341
Tech has only been able to uncover
bits and pieces.

81
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,010
They assured me
they've never seen anything like it.

82
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,765
Metamorphic code capable of erasing
a hundred zettabytes of data per second.

83
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,726
What does any of that mean?

84
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,605
It means this virus could essentially
wipe out every database in the world...

85
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,440
...in, oh, five seconds.

86
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,237
And just as we were zeroing in
on its origin, all signs of it disappeared.

87
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,155
That's why I need you.

88
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,909
Locate the Omen, bring it back to me,
Mr. Casey goes free.

89
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,704
And what if we say no?

90
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,166
I have men on the inside who can make
your friend's life a living hell.

91
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,546
Though, to be honest, I imagine hell
will have no trouble finding him in there.

92
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,262
No fights. Keep your nose clean.

93
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,019
Harder than I thought.

94
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,202
What do you think you're doing, inmate?

95
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,876
Sorry if I got too physical.
It's the uniform.

96
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,253
Don't apologize. I actually enjoyed it.

97
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,214
Thought you would.

98
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,761
I'm glad you came.
I have something...

99
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,971
I'm all for business...

100
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,515
...but wouldn't you like
to take advantage...

101
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:55,354
...of your state-given right?

102
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,606
What right is that?

103
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,942
A conjugal visit.

104
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,782
I would very much like
to take advantage.

105
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,201
I thought you might.

106
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,337
I'm assuming
you don't wanna stay over.

107
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,674
Ha. Maybe next time.

108
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,387
- What's on your mind?
- Bartowski and Walker are good spies...

109
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,349
...but I don't like that they're down
a man. Decker's up to something.

110
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,310
So you want my team to track them,
make sure they're safe?

111
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,896
Not your team. You.

112
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,274
I figure you could take my place.

113
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,986
Right, I'm gonna take orders
from Ward and June Cleaver.

114
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,197
It was just a suggestion.

115
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,366
Well, stop making suggestions.

116
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,368
Okay. I'm done.

117
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,666
It is hard to say no to you.

118
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,209
I know.

119
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,927
I hate this. Do you remember why
we started Carmichael Industries?

120
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,054
Corporate discount
on the pinball machine, right?

121
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:57,058
Ha. We did it to gain independence.
And where are we now?

122
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,729
Beholden to Decker, the exact type of
person we said we'd never deal with.

123
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,649
- Stop it. We're doing this for Casey.
- I know, I know.

124
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,446
All right, let's find us a virus,
shall we?

125
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,242
Uh... What is happening? Is that...?
Is that chardonnay?

126
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,244
Wow, I haven't seen this
in a long time.

127
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,914
We used to call this routine
The Routine.

128
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,875
- That's very creative.
- Yeah.

129
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,961
Yeah, Chuck has quite a reputation
as a hacker, you know?

130
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,172
They used to call him The Piranha.

131
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,467
Swordfish, right?
The movie is based on him.

132
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,011
Doesn't talk about it,
he didn't think it wasn't an A-plus film.

133
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,263
- I thought it was pretty good.
- It was okay.

134
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,724
A lot of plot holes,
and those hacker scenes were just, like:

135
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,062
Someone coded the name
into the Telix script.

136
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,524
Little inside joke for anyone running
viral countermeasures.

137
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,779
When The Piranha got really
into a decoding session...

138
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,822
...he could get a bit giddy.

139
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,951
- Yeah, it's kind of cute.
- Yeah, it's also super nerdy.

140
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,453
It's definitely that too.

141
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,249
Got it. The name was encrypted.

142
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,670
I ran an elliptic curve algorithm to find
the key. Of course after that, it was cake.

143
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,383
Hello, Colin Davis,
the man behind the Omen virus.

144
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,343
Coming your way in three, two, one.

145
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,679
Guy was a head programmer
at The Collective...

146
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,139
...a rogue group
of technological terrorists...

147
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,308
...who sell viruses
to the highest bidder.

148
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,686
Three months ago,
he disappeared with the virus.

149
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,688
Drop off the grid. Crazy. I like that.

150
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:29,109
Well, Mr. Colin Davis, let's see if you left
us any clues as to where you went.

151
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,613
Shoot. I promised Jeff that I was gonna
help him with this whole Lester thing.

152
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,117
All right, you guys will be okay here.
Oh, make sure that he eats.

153
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,619
He goes overboard
with the chardonnay.

154
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,329
Calls it his thinking juice.

155
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,337
- Ahh.
- Ahh. Thanks, buddy.

156
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,173
- I love you.
- Love you.

157
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,725
How's the brain, Mr. Grimes?

158
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,019
It's okay, thanks.

159
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,607
Casey sent me to help
with this Decker situation.

160
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,359
So if you'd be so kind as to take me
to the newlyweds.

161
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,446
I can't... I can't bring guests
down to Castle.

162
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,198
Are you really gonna make me
use this?

163
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,869
- You'd shoot me?
- I'd beat you over the head with it.

164
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,833
This is Davis' last known location.
Must have brought the virus here.

165
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,085
Some kind of encampment
behind this barrier.

166
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,129
Looks like some
separatist compound.

167
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,340
There could be militia training
back there.

168
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,258
Casey would have loved this mission.

169
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:39,220
And you're aware that you're gonna
get yourselves killed without Casey?

170
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,182
Decided to let her in
after we had an adult conversation.

171
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,435
What are you doing here, Verbanski?

172
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,064
Ease up. I'm not here to steal
any of your precious secrets.

173
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,900
I'm here because I'm going on
this mission with you.

174
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,109
Oh, is that right?

175
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,404
Look, we both want Casey out of jail.

176
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,740
You want your partner back, and I...

177
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,035
I hate to see the competition struggle
like this.

178
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,246
As far as I can tell,
you need a sniper on this mission.

179
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:09,417
Well, I've done some pretty amazing
sniper work on "Call of Duty."

180
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,170
I believe I've made my point.

181
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,344
Well, the sniper rifles
are behind you in the armory.

182
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,846
I'll bring my own.

183
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,731
Things can get really nasty
really fast...

184
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,067
...if you're not running
with a crowd in here.

185
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,404
- Is that a fact?
- You look like you can use some friends.

186
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,615
And we could use some muscle like you
in the yard.

187
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,992
I'll expect your answer tonight.

188
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,786
Hmm.

189
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:50,792
Dude, this place is no joke. Especially
for a guy with unpaid parking tickets.

190
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,877
What do you want?

191
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,673
Look, I've seen Caged Heat.
I know how to survive in prison.

192
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,009
You gotta be the shot-caller,
and I figured out a way to do that.

193
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,304
You know, Caged Heat
was a women's prison movie.

194
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,725
Well, the lessons remain the same,
John.

195
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,312
Hey, homes.
Got that 12-gauge you wanted, man.

196
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,939
Word.

197
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,525
- Drop it in my cell.
- Done.

198
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,961
All right. Easier than I thought.

199
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,512
- That sounds like some military drill.
- I'll look for cover.

200
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,514
Get ready for action.

201
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,743
Okay, this is definitely not a militia.
Sarah.

202
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,704
- Sarah, I think we walked into a cult.
- Way ahead of you.

203
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,581
Strip. Now.

204
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,000
What...? What are you doing?
What are you doing?

205
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,086
Joining a cult. Strip. Come on.

206
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,517
Now, keep a close eye.
I really have no place to hide a gun.

207
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,311
Not too close an eye, though.
I'm serious, for real.

208
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,855
Calm down.
No one's looking at anything.

209
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,399
Not much to look at, anyway.

210
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,320
That is not fair.
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

211
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,783
Children, are you lost?

212
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,285
Can I help the new arrivals
find their way?

213
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,706
We were told to come here to seek
enlightenment.

214
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,000
Then enlightenment you shall find.

215
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,419
Please, help yourself to some robes.

216
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:03,925
Welcome to
the Church of the Eternal Wind.

217
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,844
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

218
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,679
We'll just...

219
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,142
We have uninvited guests.
Find out who they are.

220
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,275
We have a situation.

221
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,954
Oh-ho. Ha.

222
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,624
It's a little... Little chilly under here.
These are very short robes, huh?

223
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,961
Well, the church believes
that the spirit enters from underneath.

224
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,006
Well, that's a totally natural
entry point.

225
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,133
That's an interesting pendant.

226
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,802
I imagine it has
some kind of significance for you?

227
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,221
All members of the church
wear a pendant...

228
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,434
...to remind them of their past lives. I
worked on Wall Street, lived the fast life.

229
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,102
Until I came here.

230
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,979
Not looking for a life story here.

231
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:02,191
Figure out where Davis is, locate
the virus. My patience is wearing thin.

232
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,195
My wife and I were looking for an escape
from our everyday chaos.

233
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,531
Our friend, Colin Davis
recommended we come...

234
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,826
...and check out your church here.
- Colin. What a caring man.

235
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,121
But now we call him Moon Meadow.
That's his wind name.

236
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,374
Do you know where we could find
Moon Meadow?

237
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,460
- We'd love to see him.
- Mm.

238
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,671
I believe he's leading a drum circle
in the garden.

239
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,257
It's mostly free-form,
experimental drumming...

240
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,010
...but there'll definitely be
some jamming as well.

241
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,179
- Sounds like fun.
- Let's go check it out.

242
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,976
Hey.

243
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,978
How you holding up, man?

244
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,690
I didn't think it would be this hard
without Lester around.

245
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,317
I'm starting to forget him.

246
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,403
I can't even picture what Lester
looks like anymore.

247
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,572
Close your eyes.

248
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,617
Imagine David Beckham.

249
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,287
Lester's a shorter, feminine version
of his wife.

250
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,499
Right. I can see him now.

251
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:05,505
Look, when I went through my
dark period, I alienated a lot of friends.

252
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,466
But I was able to realize
what I was about to lose...

253
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,387
...before it was too late. We have to make
sure he knows what's slipping away.

254
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:16,224
I get it. This reminds me of the time
my dad tried to win back my mom...

255
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,018
...when he heard
she was having sex with Uncle Steve.

256
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,687
They ended up as a threesome.

257
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,480
I had a messed-up childhood.

258
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,315
Yeah, you did.

259
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:29,654
But you know what? It actually gives me
a great idea how to handle Lester.

260
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,824
It's not a threesome.

261
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,410
These people dropped everything
and came here.

262
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,661
Yeah, it's crazy.

263
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,163
I don't know what I'd do
if I left the spy life.

264
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,375
I'm so caught up in it,
I can't think of a world outside of it.

265
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,919
You're really good at computers.
You love them.

266
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,296
Yeah, maybe.

267
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,428
We got eyes on Davis.

268
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:59,142
I'm in position to shoot
any and all of these filthy hippies.

269
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,602
- It's almost like Casey never left.
- Yeah.

270
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,480
Stay focused.
This is over as soon as we find the virus.

271
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,482
So let's just get in and get out.

272
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,286
I found their clothes.

273
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,621
And these were with them.

274
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,356
Wrap up the Phish concert.
Make a move.

275
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,944
Ah-ah-ah! Whoo!

276
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,496
You got some skills.

277
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,331
As do you, my friend.

278
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,503
So you worked in tech, huh?

279
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,671
Oh, a lifetime ago.

280
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,716
And this... This would've been
my crowning achievement.

281
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,177
Till I walked away.

282
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,721
You know, I used to work in computers
as well.

283
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,182
- You mind if I take a look?
- Oh, no, I couldn't.

284
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,644
It's against church policy
to ever remove your pendant.

285
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,687
But I do take it off twice a month,
when I shower.

286
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,439
Ah.

287
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,194
Intruders! We have intruders!

288
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,073
We've been made.

289
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,872
You get the chip,
I'll take care of the guards.

290
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,211
After her. Go, go, go.

291
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,088
Stop!

292
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,969
- Leave me alone!
- Colin!

293
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,887
Colin, I'm trying to help you.

294
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,223
- Don't help me!
- Come on.

295
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,183
Stop!

296
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,147
Too much tree cover.
I don't have a shot. I'm coming down.

297
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,109
- Wait up.
- Go away.

298
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,485
I'm trying to help.

299
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,168
Some of our members
have a checkered past.

300
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,713
They pay a lot of money for
enlightenment, as well as protection.

301
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,383
Looks like you walked
into the wrong cult, bitch.

302
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,931
Colin!

303
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,269
Oh.

304
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,605
No, it's okay.

305
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,947
I vowed never to let anybody have
this virus, no matter what I had to do.

306
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,407
Davis.

307
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,624
No! No. Stop. Come on.

308
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,751
Come on.

309
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,772
Come on. Get it out of there.

310
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,149
Give me the chip. Give me the chip.

311
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,738
Davis? Davis?

312
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,782
Huh? Huh?

313
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,242
Where's the chip?

314
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,660
Huh?

315
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,536
I hid it.

316
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,290
- Inside him.
- So he swallowed it.

317
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,084
Yes, he did.

318
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,543
Hey. Honey.

319
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,712
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah, never better.

320
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,215
Good. I need your help.
Davis swallowed the chip.

321
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,384
We gotta get him out of here now.

322
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,345
Okay, let's cover up his...
Guys, can we find him some pants?

323
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,984
Decision time.

324
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,529
You gonna join us?

325
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,030
Not interested.

326
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,492
Thought you might say that.

327
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,301
Come on!

328
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,978
Hey.

329
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,897
Hey!

330
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,406
You touch one hair on his head,
and I will pull your plug.

331
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:11,495
Mark my words, son. Step back
or your nights will get real long.

332
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:16,625
Real long. Step back.

333
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,556
- What the hell?
- I told you.

334
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,933
I figured out a way
to become the shot-caller.

335
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:38,105
Now, any of these people get out
of line, and I will pull their plugs.

336
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,608
Literally. I've been using
my Buy More skills...

337
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,027
...to set up cable and Internet
for the inmates.

338
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:47,281
- Of course you have.
- In fact...

339
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,825
...I got a shipment
of 12-gauge electrical wire...

340
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,453
...that is making installations a snap.

341
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,540
These monsters are petrified because I
can take their tech away at any moment.

342
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,293
- That sounds like a good plan.
- I know.

343
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,922
All right, I'll see you in the yard.

344
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,060
Please let me go. This is a mistake.

345
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,397
Look, I promise you
we're not gonna hurt you.

346
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,818
We just need to wait for the chip to,
you know, complete its journey.

347
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,028
- Then you can go.
- You don't understand.

348
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,322
The virus is too dangerous
to be released.

349
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,993
It could wipe out everything.
I knew I should've destroyed it, but...

350
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,705
It was my finest work.

351
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,835
You know, I just couldn't.

352
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,628
Hey. Uh...

353
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,673
I understand.

354
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,592
I tried to get out of that life.
It's sucking me back in.

355
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:53,264
It's like I'm trying to outrun something
I shouldn't have done in the first place.

356
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:58,352
I get it, Colin. Believe me, I do. And I
assure you, we're the good guys here.

357
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,356
I hope to God
you're telling me the truth.

358
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:12,158
There are two parts to the virus:
A chip and a distribution device.

359
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,660
It's like a modded USB drive.

360
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,290
You insert the chip into the device,
and the virus can be uploaded...

361
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,709
...to any system.

362
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,879
I'm hoping you didn't swallow
the device, as well.

363
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:30,092
No, it's still locked up at The Collective,
my former employer.

364
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,137
Right. Right, right, right.
So, what you're saying, then...

365
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,891
...is we just need to sneak past a few
hackers and get the device back?

366
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,561
No, it's not that easy. There are
some extremely dangerous people...

367
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,271
...selling these viruses.

368
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,648
- Can you help us get in?
- No.

369
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,360
Best I can do is show you
where they're storing the device.

370
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,239
Okay, great. That's a great start.
Thank you. I'll go grab a computer.

371
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,912
Is there anything I can get
you while I'm up?

372
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,581
Our kitchen's fully stocked.
Sandwich? Nachos?

373
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,791
We have some of those gourmet
jellybeans.

374
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,544
Do you have the kind that tastes
like buttered popcorn?

375
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,338
I think I can make that happen.

376
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:15,346
A snack? Casey's in lockdown
and this jerk wants jelly beans?

377
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:19,016
We should just cut him open
and get that chip out right now.

378
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:23,812
You know, I know that we're not
partners or friends...

379
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,483
...but are you okay? You seem to be
on edge since we started the mission.

380
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,859
I'm fine.

381
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,278
- We can talk about it if you want.
- No, no, no.

382
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,073
We don't talk. Okay? I'm just off.

383
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,160
- Stop trying to be my shrink.
- Okay.

384
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,166
Is it, um...

385
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,168
...about Casey?

386
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,132
I just noticed that you have
some emotions for him.

387
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,302
Can we stop with this garbage
and just get to work?

388
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,097
You can still have feelings for somebody
and be a spy.

389
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,726
Oh, and be like you and Mr. Hospitality?
That's my fate? No.

390
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,062
No, no, no.

391
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,073
So I've been noticing Lester popping up
online about the same time every day.

392
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,325
- Fancy prison.
- Yeah, right.

393
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,036
So look, we initiate a chat, and then...

394
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,789
...we begin
Operation: Scare Lester Straight.

395
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,082
You ready?

396
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,719
Hello, friends. Guess you couldn't live
without me. Huh?

397
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,929
Hey, listen,
I'm sorry to tell you this...

398
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,558
...but we've been interviewing people
to fill your spot at the Buy More.

399
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,895
Oh, come on. Right.
What, are you gonna just replace me?

400
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,814
Actually, he just showed up.

401
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,572
- Who's this fool?
- This is our new Nerd Herder.

402
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,326
- Vali Chandrasekaren.
- Oh, come on!

403
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,662
That is a pretty stupid name.
Where are you from, Mr. Fake Name?

404
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,541
Look at my face. You can't tell I'm
from Montreal? Like all true Hinjews.

405
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,544
- Oh, no, you did not.
- I did. And I am.

406
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,172
I just wanted to say thanks
for giving up your spot.

407
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,800
Some great people here. I'm excited
to start getting to know everybody.

408
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,637
Lester, you should hear
this guy's singing voice.

409
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,598
- Like an angel.
- Come on. It really is though.

410
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,892
Oh, Canada

411
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,821
- That's just a little bit, you know.
- My word.

412
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:42,618
Many people say it's the type of voice
that would go perfectly with a keytar.

413
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,582
May I have a moment alone
with Jeffrey, please?

414
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,126
Of course. Sure, sure.

415
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,422
- Hmm?
- Well done, well done.

416
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,758
Yeah, yeah, perfect. You nailed it.
Your voice... Wow.

417
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,760
- You really underplayed it.
- It was fun.

418
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:04,139
- Yeah. You earned this.
- Okay, this one's just Wi-Fi?

419
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,684
The Indian Modeling Agency
said you'd give me...

420
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,770
...one of the good ones
if I helped you out, so...

421
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,236
- You know, this comes out of my salary.
- Don't care one bit.

422
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,279
Jackpot.

423
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,283
Who's the new guy?

424
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,704
Don't worry about it. I'll find out myself.

425
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:35,963
You know, it is amazing. They're like
little popcorn pills, you know?

426
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,465
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
He agreed to help.

427
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,844
I just wanted to extend
our full hospitality to our guest...

428
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:46,014
...make sure he's perfectly comfortable
while we wait patiently for the chip.

429
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,601
- I was just telling your partner...
- He's not my partner. Go on.

430
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,521
The Collective has an unbreakable
security system...

431
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:58,110
...but it does have one weakness.
- It can be manipulated from the inside.

432
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,366
Man, these jelly beans taste funny.

433
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,870
Just speeding up the process
a little bit.

434
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,349
You've got something on your shirt.

435
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,520
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God!

436
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,856
Keep it in the can.
Keep it in the trash can.

437
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,945
What do you think? Do I look like
a hacker? Is the beanie overkill?

438
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,031
You look perfect.

439
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,035
Okay, I found a duct opening
on the east corner, just below the roof.

440
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:51,538
We have our entry. At 2200 hours,
we'll be in the server room...

441
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,124
...waiting for you to override
the security system.

442
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,752
- Got it. Be careful, babe.
- You too.

443
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:10,766
I'm here for a job.

444
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:21,109
You realize what happens
if you don't get the job?

445
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,905
I do.

446
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,765
Welcome to The Collective.
The very best of the very best.

447
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,185
You said that you want a job.
Let's prove it.

448
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,649
- Sit.
- Okay. Hi. Howdy.

449
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,112
Freddy is my best programmer.

450
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,909
If you can prove your skills
up against him, then you have the job.

451
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,578
But if you fail...

452
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:22,129
...you might not be so fortunate.
- So a good old-fashioned hack off, huh?

453
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,551
Great. Perfect. I'm just gonna take a
moment to get prepared, if you don't...

454
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,219
Don't mind.

455
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,973
Boom.

456
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,643
Oh. Once you've had Rombauer,
you just can't go back...

457
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,605
...to any other chardonnay, right?
- Who are you?

458
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,190
I've been out of the game
for a while...

459
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:45,736
...but they used to call me The Piranha.
- There's no way.

460
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,491
Let's do this, huh?

461
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,928
Okay, the first person that hacks
into Federal Reserve...

462
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:15,349
...and transfers one penny into secure
account wins. Are we clear?

463
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,477
Begin.

464
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,031
Freddy's an expert at subverting
complex security systems.

465
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,618
He is the reason our own system
is so secure.

466
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:39,039
Oh, yeah. I can tell. He did a great job.

467
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,376
That's my man.

468
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,687
You seem to know your way
around a computer.

469
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,773
Oh, I'm sorry, are we still talking?
I'm kind of busy here.

470
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,734
You have a little hiccup there
at the bottom of your page.

471
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,697
A compiler can't optimize a value away
like that. If you don't mind.

472
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,493
There you go. Rookie mistake.
I'm sure it won't happen again.

473
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,204
Oh, I'm losing.
Better get back to work.

474
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,041
I forgot something.

475
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,919
I'm really good at this.

476
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,425
The servers are in here somewhere.
Can you pull up the schematics?

477
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,054
- Verbanski!
- Fine, I love Casey. Just... Just...

478
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,515
Jeez, stop grilling me.

479
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,104
So do you wanna talk about it?

480
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,440
I've been a wreck since
Casey went to prison.

481
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,942
I had no idea
I had such strong feelings for him.

482
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,778
Now I'm petrified that this
could turn into something.

483
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,655
You're looking at it the wrong way.

484
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,617
What, we're gonna have some kids
and I quit because it's too dangerous?

485
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,578
Relationships
are about communication.

486
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,122
Big life changes
don't just spring up on you.

487
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,207
Hey, stop!

488
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,714
I couldn't imagine my life
away from this.

489
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,632
Do you think it's gonna be that bad?

490
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,802
Sarah, girls like us,
we don't just leave the spy business.

491
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,805
I've been doing this since I was 16.
Never had another job.

492
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,349
I wouldn't even know what to do
if I did.

493
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,684
Stop right there!

494
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,688
How about you?
Could you do anything else?

495
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,403
Thanks.

496
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,656
This might be it.

497
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,840
Chuck, I've got the device.
Let's get out of here.

498
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,178
Thanks for the help.
Hope you enjoy losing.

499
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,016
- Done.
- Done.

500
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:08,897
One penny, transferred out of the
Federal Reserve into a secure account.

501
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,857
Easy.

502
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,653
Little too easy if you ask me.
Honestly, who wants a penny?

503
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,696
So...

504
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,243
I hacked into the Buy More
and got us all flat screens.

505
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,246
- All right.
- With extended warranties, I might add.

506
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,248
You are clearly very talented.

507
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:31,336
Unfortunately, I don't care
that you are talented.

508
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,713
We have all the flat screens
that we need.

509
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,382
Whoa, uh... Whoa, whoa, whoa!

510
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,844
Before you use that,
I've got a little business tip for you.

511
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,220
And what is that?

512
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,224
You should really look into finding
a better security expert.

513
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,979
- Freddy! Alarms!
- Fixed it.

514
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,649
Find him!

515
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,652
Guys, I'm in trouble.
Coming your way.

516
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,413
I don't think I got the job. Heh.

517
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,207
Let's get out of here.
Go, go, go.

518
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,258
Your plan worked. As soon as Lester
saw the other better Lester...

519
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,927
...he changed his tune.
- That's fantastic.

520
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,306
He said he wouldn't poison me anymore,
so I dropped the charges.

521
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,601
- He'll be back at work tomorrow.
- Mm. Man, I can't wait.

522
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,895
This wasn't about me and Lester,
was it?

523
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,313
Hmm? I don't know.

524
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,900
There's someone who hasn't forgiven
your dick-ish behavior...

525
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,777
...and you need to right that wrong.

526
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,450
I'm talking about John Casey.

527
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,911
I know, dude.
I'm not brain damaged. Oh.

528
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,205
I'm sorry. Too soon? That's... I don't...

529
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:58,298
- You want me to do the talking?
- No. It was supposed to be me and Chuck.

530
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,467
We don't wanna do anything
to spook Decker.

531
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,136
You should probably
make yourself scarce.

532
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:13,939
So I've been... I've been thinking
about life after the spy game.

533
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,108
What do you mean?

534
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,655
You know, maybe you're right.
I'm great with computers.

535
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,157
Maybe Carmichael Industries
isn't a spy firm.

536
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:29,371
Maybe it's a tech company.
What do you think?

537
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,542
Sarah?

538
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,047
Well, what would my job be
at Carmichael Industries?

539
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,758
I mean, what would I do?

540
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,847
Well, you'd...

541
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,350
He's here.

542
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,033
- Did you bring the virus?
- The deal...

543
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,869
...it's still good?
John Casey goes free?

544
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,589
Here.

545
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,592
What are you planning
on doing with it?

546
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:29,973
This? The real question is:
What do you plan to do with it, Chuck?

547
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,684
What are you talking about?

548
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,980
I got some good footage of you
and your team...

549
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:42,193
...in possession of the most dangerous
computer virus in the world.

550
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,656
Smile. Ha-ha-ha.

551
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,744
Don't worry, we'll release the virus,
but you'll get the blame.

552
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:55,498
That should get you on the
FBI's most wanted list pretty quickly.

553
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,251
So this was a setup. You set us up?

554
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,920
Now that I think of it,
it was pretty irresponsible...

555
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,965
...to release Casey into the hands
of his criminal colleagues.

556
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:08,678
That's enough of this nonsense.
You release Casey now.

557
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:12,015
Gertrude, what's happening
is bigger than just me.

558
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,477
The plan is in motion.
It's too late for all of you.

559
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,522
It's just a shame that Casey
had to be the first to die.

560
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:24,277
Give me one reason not to kill you.

561
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,364
Go ahead.
It'll only further prove your guilt.

562
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:32,410
So I suggest you get your hands off
of me and get a little head start...

563
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:37,040
...because soon, people will be hunting
Chuck the way they hunted Bin Laden.

564
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,087
Go.

565
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,800
Let's go. Let's go right now.

566
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,477
Hey, Decker.

567
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,189
Aren't you forgetting something?

568
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,777
Don't worry.
I left a little consolation prize.

569
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,333
- He deserved that.
- Go.

570
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,627
Go, go, go! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

571
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,350
So it was all a setup, huh?

572
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:43,898
Chuck was gonna be the fall guy, and
you were never getting out of here alive.

573
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,484
John, your team needs you now.

574
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,281
Okay. What do we do about Decker?

575
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,159
I already took care of him.

576
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,869
You didn't.

577
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,290
I have to disappear for a while.

578
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,543
Yeah. I understand.

579
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,342
We could've been something.

580
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,637
Still can be.

581
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,017
Perhaps someday.

582
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,154
Surveillance changes shifts
in two minutes.

583
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,657
We gotta get into the heating ducts
before they realize you're gone.

584
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,367
You're gonna break me out alone?

585
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:42,081
No. I found someone who cares
about you as much as I do.

586
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,588
Huh.

587
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,842
Prisoner transfer from CB-11,
section 3-8.

588
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,469
Copy that.

589
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,514
I missed you, big guy.

590
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,860
What plan was Decker talking about?
Why would he wanna frame you?

591
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,154
I don't know, but I intend to find out.

592
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:18,451
If he was telling the truth, then we're
already in deeper than we know.

593
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,040
Sarah, I was wrong
about quitting the spy life.

594
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:28,711
Because right now, we've gotta be
the best spies we've ever been, okay?
