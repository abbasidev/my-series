1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,586
I'm Chuck.
Here's what's been going on lately.

2
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:07,881
You wouldn't have downloaded
the same version Morgan had...

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,299
...would you?

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,802
I know you lose memories when you flash.

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,307
- Ooh, Sarah.
- Who are you?

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,476
Your handler. Orders are in.

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,812
Kill Chuck Bartowski.

8
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,484
Okay, Sarah's out there.
She's out there.

9
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,362
We need to find her.
Quinn said he's after the Intersect.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,365
If we find it, we will probably find Quinn,
and with him...

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,325
- Sarah.
- Exactly.

12
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:39,663
Which is why I hacked
into the CIA's database.

13
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,082
Stay with me.
I found something interesting.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,626
- These are the blueprints to DARPA.
- DARPA.

15
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,670
That's an acronym. I can figure it out.

16
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,839
Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.

17
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,718
Morgan, if the CIA had a Q working
for them, he'd be working right there.

18
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,055
I've seen enough Intersect white rooms
to know that they have one.

19
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,225
Guys, I know this is a long shot,
but I have to do something to find her.

20
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,145
I cannot continue to sit idly by
and wait.

21
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,981
Are you with me?

22
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,067
- Let's go.
- One hundred percent.

23
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,906
Sarah?

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,409
I'm sorry it took me so long
to come home.

25
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,870
Baby?

26
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,664
Baby, what happened to you?

27
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,045
I know you've forgotten a lot, Sarah,
but you've been undercover...

28
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,964
...for the past five years
monitoring a rogue spy.

29
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,926
His name is Chuck Bartowski.

30
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,637
Everything's in here.

31
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,767
Strengths, weaknesses,
profiles of the people closest to him.

32
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,020
Memorize it. Any questions?

33
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,607
Yeah. Yeah, just one, um...

34
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,693
Why the hell should I believe you?

35
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,247
I'm on your side, Agent Walker.
I don't wanna have to hurt you.

36
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,549
And then I threw him out the window.
And that's how I escaped.

37
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,969
What? I can't believe that.
That's nuts, amazing.

38
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,054
- Quinn?
- He's dead.

39
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,349
And the Intersect is out of my head,
so it's all over.

40
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,561
Well, thankfully these cuts
look pretty minor.

41
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,856
We should let you get some rest.

42
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,025
Eleanor Bartowski...

43
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,277
...the sister.

44
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,613
- Goes by Ellie.
- Thank you, Ellie.

45
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,617
- You remember her husband's name.
- And thank you, Devon.

46
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,080
Thank you, all of you.
I'm really glad to be home.

47
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,333
- Glad you're safe.
- Me too.

48
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,552
I don't remember you any more
than I remember this Bartowski guy.

49
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,430
So you tell me what happened to me.

50
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:07,311
Walker, give me a chance.
There's something you need to see.

51
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:13,442
This is Agent Sarah Walker.
Today is September 24, 2007, Day One.

52
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,154
Today I made contact with the Intersect,
Charles Irving Bartowski...

53
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,740
...or rather, Chuck.
My mission is simple.

54
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,826
Find out what he knows, gain his trust
and monitor actions...

55
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,121
...until the Agency can decide
what to do with him.

56
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:31,293
Well, the Agency has made a decision,
Agent Walker.

57
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,130
Chuck Bartowski has proven to be
a major threat to...

58
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,758
...national security.

59
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,138
Well, then put Director Graham
on the phone. He gives me my orders.

60
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,182
He's dead, Sarah.

61
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,935
Well, what about my partner, Bryce?
Where is he?

62
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,978
I'm sorry, Sarah.

63
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,980
He's dead too.

64
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,192
That's not possible.

65
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:04,076
We believe that Bartowski and his team
are responsible for both of their deaths.

66
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,330
And I wish I could just...

67
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,542
...let you forget everything horrible
that this man has done...

68
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,880
...but Chuck Bartowski
needs to be stopped.

69
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,299
He's a traitor.

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,095
- And you want me to kill him.
- Yes.

71
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:28,016
But first, I need you to retrieve
something that he's stolen from us.

72
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,768
A pair of Intersect glasses.

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,312
We believe that Chuck
wants to use them...

74
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,898
...to upload a pristine version
of the Intersect.

75
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,735
Sarah?

76
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,196
If you want your life back...

77
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,448
...the life he stole from you...

78
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,202
...return to Burbank,
retrieve the glasses...

79
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:52,374
...and put Chuck Bartowski to rest
once and for all.

80
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,429
I'm so glad you're okay. I love you.

81
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,223
I love you too.

82
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,483
Aah. Wow.

83
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,819
Wow, you are...
You are really going to town on that thing.

84
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,030
I'm just cutting the chicken up.

85
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,074
You're just getting it...

86
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:11,703
I'm gonna make a quick phone call,
okay? Love you. Be right back.

87
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,291
- I'm alone.
- Good.

88
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,836
Find the glasses.
Look for a hidden safe or vault.

89
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,673
Be careful, Walker.
Do not underestimate him.

90
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,886
He has proven time and again that
he's more dangerous than he looks...

91
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,932
...and remember, the rest of his team
is only a few feet away.

92
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,315
- Different how?
- I don't know.

93
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:45,153
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Sarah just seems different.

94
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,988
Look, of course she's not herself.

95
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,534
She was kidnapped by some maniac
on a Japanese bullet train...

96
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:56,081
...and to escape, she had to kill the dude,
and walk home from his base barefoot.

97
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,459
- Wow, she really is incredible, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, maybe you're right.

98
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,921
Maybe I just need to try
and make her feel a little more relaxed.

99
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,633
Yes, yes, un-tense the tense girl.
Loosen up that leggy blonde.

100
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,593
I can do that.

101
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,473
Hey, uh...

102
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,309
Hey, honey.
You wanna meet me in the bedroom?

103
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,437
- I have a surprise for you.
- Okay.

104
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,980
Okay.

105
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,733
Think he's up to something.

106
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,318
Stay alert.

107
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,779
It could be a trap.

108
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,078
Welcome to the Bartowski Inn
and Spa Resort...

109
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,039
...where all of your worries melt away.

110
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,876
You have to use imagination,
but picture, if you will...

111
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,379
...outside those windows
the gorgeous Ojai Valley.

112
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,091
And what may look like a normal,
five-year-old mattress...

113
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,179
...is, in actuality,
a luxurious massage table.

114
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,933
A sheet has been provided
for your discretion.

115
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,143
Oh.

116
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,396
Great.

117
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,655
Walker, what's going on?

118
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,159
He claims he wants to give me
a massage, but I think he's onto me.

119
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,661
- You almost ready?
- Just a second.

120
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,038
Calm down.

121
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,998
You should use this
as an opportunity.

122
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,001
Allow yourself to be vulnerable
with him.

123
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,337
It'll convince him
that there's nothing wrong.

124
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,047
Okay.

125
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,602
Okay. I'm ready.

126
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,317
All right. Here we go.

127
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,280
Starting with the application of the oil.

128
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,951
Ah, yes.

129
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,578
Relax, relax.

130
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,622
This would actually
go a lot smoother...

131
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,958
...if you just brought these down
to your side

132
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,126
Just down to your side.

133
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,754
Relax. There we go. There we go. See?

134
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,006
Yes, better already.

135
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,343
Breathe. Yeah.
Baby, your muscles are so tight...

136
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,222
...they're hurting my hands. A lot
of lactic acid buildup, huh? Why don't?

137
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,057
- Uh, why don't I crack your neck?
- No.

138
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,726
What? What did I...?
What did I do? What did I say?

139
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,939
- You love it when I crack your neck.
- Don't blow your cover. Talk to him.

140
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,441
Uh, I'm sorry, Chuck.

141
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,320
I really appreciate
everything that you are trying to do.

142
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,949
It's just it's been
a long couple days, and, uh...

143
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,077
You know,
maybe it's just best if we go to bed.

144
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,620
Yeah.

145
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,206
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

146
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,542
Whatever you need.

147
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,627
Wow.

148
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,254
It's all ending, huh?

149
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,506
What are you babbling about?

150
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,300
Just getting nostalgic, you know?

151
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,011
Quinn's dead, Sarah's home safe,
so we're done, man.

152
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,846
- No more missions.
- No more gunplay.

153
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:04,144
Think about it, Casey. Five years.
I went from pip-squeaky sidekick to this.

154
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,314
And you were the most cold-blooded
sniper in the whole world...

155
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,109
...and now you're scrubbing our floors.
- Well, if you would use a plate...

156
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,863
...when you're eating taquitos,
I wouldn't have to scrub the floors.

157
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,409
Do you really think I've changed?

158
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,622
I'm so glad that Sarah's back. Bill.

159
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,751
Social event. Me too. I don't know
what Chuck would do without her.

160
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,044
- For you.
- For you.

161
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,467
- Babe.
- I got a letter from...

162
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,471
- Carlos Shuman Medical Center?
- In Chicago offering me a position.

163
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,475
They want me to head up their division.
They must know we're a couple.

164
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,395
Babe, I think we're being wooed.
By Midwesterners.

165
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,775
I know, I know. We could buy a house.

166
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,236
We could buy a big house. Okay.

167
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,031
Are we...?
Are we really considering this?

168
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,241
We've lived
our whole lives in California.

169
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,036
And we've always said a change
would be nice.

170
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,872
I just always assumed
I would live close to Chuck.

171
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,584
Yeah, yeah. But Sarah's back now.

172
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,835
He's okay, right?

173
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,029
- Quinn, I found the glasses.
- Good.

174
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,657
Then it's time to finish your mission.

175
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,993
Take out Bartowski.

176
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,253
Sarah?

177
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,903
Chuck just left. I'm following.

178
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,419
- Hey.
- Hi.

179
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,672
- Sorry, did I wake you up?
- No, uh.

180
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,382
I couldn't sleep. How's Sarah?

181
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,802
Um...

182
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,888
You'd better come inside.

183
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,681
Thanks.

184
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:05,533
I don't know. I guess it's, uh, the little
things that are different, you know?

185
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,286
Like, her feet get cold at night...

186
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,499
...so I always put mine on top of hers
to keep them warm.

187
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,127
And I know it sounds stupid,
but tonight she...

188
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,215
...pulled her feet away from mine.
She never pulls them away.

189
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,508
Walker. Where are you?

190
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,968
Ellie's apartment. They're talking.

191
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,554
Chuck, it's her first night back.

192
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,723
Can't imagine
what Sarah's been through.

193
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,101
She's involved in this too.
What are they talking about?

194
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,397
- About me.
- I almost lost my best friend.

195
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,692
And now, my wife,
and always for the same reason...

196
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,237
...which is the Intersect, Ellie.

197
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:46,616
Which is why I keep thinking that I need
to destroy it for good this time.

198
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,035
What do you mean?

199
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,374
Quinn is dead, yes, but there will always
be someone who wants it...

200
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,169
...and we will never be able to move on
with our lives until it is gone.

201
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,756
Quinn, are you hearing this? He doesn't
wanna download the Intersect...

202
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,759
...onto the glasses.
He wants to destroy it completely.

203
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,428
I know where the latest version
of the Intersect is.

204
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,265
All I need to do is
sneak in and plant the virus.

205
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,683
What do you want me to do?

206
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,561
You have to go with Chuck
and download the Intersect...

207
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,063
...onto the glasses yourself.

208
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,774
It's up to you to keep it safe.

209
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,026
Then you can kill him.

210
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:29,033
First I just wanted to get
a little sisterly advice.

211
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,875
I think if you can be safe,
then you should do it.

212
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,043
It's what Dad always wanted.

213
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,881
Thanks.

214
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,674
Love you.

215
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,594
- Get some sleep.
- Oh, no.

216
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,612
Chuck?

217
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,531
- Yeah?
- I'm cold.

218
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,826
Babe? Hey.

219
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,590
So that's how I figure
we'll infiltrate headquarters.

220
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,967
Once we're in,
I'll boot up their system.

221
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,845
Sarah, you'll plant the virus
using this...

222
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,514
...and we'll destroy the Intersect,
once and for all.

223
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,809
- That seems a little drastic.
- Yeah, it is drastic.

224
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:40,104
Think of all the Intersect
is responsible for. My father's death.

225
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:44,400
Volkoff's very existence.
Morgan's brain melting. Sarah.

226
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,988
Let's just say
it's been more bad than good.

227
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:53,284
When my dad found out I had it,
he told me to destroy it and I wish I had.

228
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,786
We'd all be better off.

229
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,789
I'm not gonna miss that opportunity again.

230
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,125
If this is what you want, Chuck, I'm in.

231
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,964
- I'm in.
- I'm on board.

232
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,466
Wanna say I'm glad
we're having this mission...

233
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,427
...seeing as how I wasn't a part
of the other two.

234
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,054
Great, we leave in 20.

235
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,643
Buddy,
you have any extra tranq darts?

236
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,895
I used all mine up
at tranq-dart practice.

237
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,480
Yeah.

238
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:27,068
Uh, actually, Sarah normally keeps
an extra clip for me in her bag, so...

239
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,114
No dice, buddy.
She must have forgotten.

240
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,490
Don't worry about it.

241
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,077
Hey, Casey, Chuck says you gotta let me
use your tranq darts.

242
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,329
What is she doing with these?

243
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,808
What the?

244
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,953
Three, two, one.

245
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,710
I think we're okay.
Let's find the Intersect room.

246
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,171
We don't have long before they wake up.

247
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,966
Look at this place. It's incredible. Wow.

248
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,886
What's under here?
It's like a big silver ghost.

249
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,972
Bit creepy.

250
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,685
A cloak of invisibility.

251
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,812
Yes.

252
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,148
You're a wizard, Harry.

253
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,612
Grimes, you on a diet?

254
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,863
What?

255
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,449
You started to disappear in front of my eyes.

256
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,284
Get it? Oh.

257
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,163
Hey, Intersect room is down this hall.
Let's go.

258
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,916
What? Couldn't hear you.
I'm the headless Grimesman.

259
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,085
- Headless Grimesman.
- Would you?

260
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,879
It wasn't me. It was the one-armed man.
Find this man.

261
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,799
- Go.
- You never saw The Fugitive?

262
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,480
Five guards.

263
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,857
All right, team, what's the plan?

264
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,609
Let's use some sort of distraction.

265
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,654
I think if, you threw, like, a rock...

266
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,864
Sarah?

267
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,182
Let's go.

268
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,271
Wow. Quite a woman you've got
on your hands, huh, buddy?

269
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,106
Yeah.

270
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:29,125
All right. Just give me a few minutes
to get the system up and running.

271
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,677
All right, got it. Sarah, you're on.

272
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,849
But I'm not sure for how long,
though, so upload the virus now.

273
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,767
Uploading.

274
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:00,031
Should've gone through by now.
Is there something wrong?

275
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,908
Just a second.

276
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,920
- Walker?
- Drop the gun.

277
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,172
Sarah? Sarah, what are you doing?

278
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,465
Drop the gun.

279
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,143
Now I have the Intersect,
and you can't destroy it.

280
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,189
- You can't hurt anybody else with it.
- Baby, what are you talking about?

281
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,816
- Quinn told me the truth.
- Quinn's not dead?

282
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,739
I know about you.
I know what you've done, all of you.

283
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,074
I know everything.

284
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,451
I don't know
what's happening right now...

285
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,412
...but whatever he told you is a lie.

286
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,792
The Intersect is... It's damaged
your memory or something...

287
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,963
...because the Sarah that I know
would never do something like this.

288
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,341
Baby, please. It's me.

289
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,969
It's your Chuck.

290
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,018
Get the hell out of there, Walker.

291
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,817
Don't.

292
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,127
This can't be happening.
Doesn't make any sense.

293
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,803
She attached an explosive to the door.
She could detonate it at any second.

294
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,931
- No. No, she wouldn't.
- Chuck, take cover.

295
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,141
She wouldn't.

296
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,864
Quinn, maybe we don't have to do this.
They're inside. They'll be arrested.

297
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,741
That's not your call.

298
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,094
We gotta get out before guards come.

299
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,305
What just happened? Sarah, she just...

300
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,725
Quinn must've turned her, convinced her
that she's working for him.

301
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,227
Now she has exactly
what he's been looking for...

302
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,689
...the last version of the Intersect.
- No, she doesn't.

303
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,193
- I switched them out.
- What the hell? How'd you do that?

304
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,778
I saw the glasses in her bag.

305
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,947
I didn't wanna say anything
because I didn't wanna believe it.

306
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,993
But deep down, I knew it was true.

307
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,287
My wife never came home.

308
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,844
That was a government facility
you just blew up.

309
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,597
And that was a man
who deserved to die.

310
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,808
Did you get the glasses?

311
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,400
These are empty.

312
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,902
- They're fake.
- That's not possible.

313
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,030
- I had them on me the whole time.
- No one got close to you?

314
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:33,119
Chuck. Chuck did, I guess.
As I was leaving, he tried to grab me...

315
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,539
...and convince me
that our relationship was real.

316
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,208
I guess he must've switched them out.

317
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,878
This is exactly what I warned you about,
Agent Walker.

318
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,089
That's why
I pushed the detonator button.

319
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,634
This man is a liar. He is a manipulator.

320
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,850
He's still alive?

321
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,104
I made a mistake. I promise
I will not make the same mistake again.

322
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,107
I will get those glasses back
no matter what it takes.

323
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,444
- She's not picking up.
- Yeah, of course she's not. She's evil.

324
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,988
That's unfair.
It's the faulty Intersect talking.

325
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,657
It's kind of like what happened with me,
only worse.

326
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:12,992
Quinn turned her.

327
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,744
We have to consider the fact
that she's gone.

328
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:19,957
How can you say that? She's your friend.
She's not gone. Not completely, anyway.

329
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,918
Did his memory come
back after the Intersect? It didn't.

330
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:27,006
All I have to do is remind her of who
she really is. Look, I have the glasses.

331
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,717
If she doesn't remember me,
she wanted these.

332
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,385
She tried to kill us, Chuck.

333
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,596
Can't pretend
that everything is as it was.

334
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:38,225
Otherwise, she's gonna succeed next
time. And I'm not gonna lose you both.

335
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,020
- You don't think that.
- She's a trained assassin.

336
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,481
She knows where we live,
she knows our families.

337
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,902
God, he's right, Chuck. He's right.
Okay, what about Ellie and Awesome?

338
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,779
She wouldn't.

339
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,496
Come on, come on, come on.

340
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,754
Hey. Sorry. I was trying
to get Clara down. What's up?

341
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,757
- Are you okay? Is everyone all right?
- Yeah, of course.

342
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,927
Thank God.

343
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,428
Everyone's at the apartment?

344
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,598
Well, no. Elliejust went
to grab a cup of coffee with Sarah.

345
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,308
Why?

346
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,356
I'm glad we're doing this.
You've been through so much lately.

347
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,858
- How are you holding up?
- Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

348
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,027
We were all really worried about you.

349
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,155
- Chuck was a wreck.
- I can imagine.

350
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:39,495
Oh, hmm, speak of the devil. Do you mind?
I have to talk to him.

351
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,207
Hey, sweetie.

352
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,670
So I see you that you switched out
the Intersect glasses.

353
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:51,423
That was a nice move.
Should've known I couldn't trust you.

354
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,259
I have some moves of my own.

355
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,803
We're at the Bergamot Café
off Gower.

356
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,681
Bring the glasses. Come alone.
You have 15 minutes.

357
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,058
This is crazy. Sarah, please...

358
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,228
Oh, Bartowski, if you try anything...

359
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,856
What are you doing?

360
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,693
- I'm gonna put a bullet
between your sister's eyes.

361
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,573
- Oh, my God.
- I've heard enough.

362
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,701
You were right to contact me.
Go to that café.

363
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,663
But convince Sarah that you've hidden
the Intersect glasses somewhere else.

364
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,082
I'm moving men into place
at Regal Plaza.

365
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,627
- Get Sarah there.
- Then what? Have a sniper take her out?

366
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:32,006
We will do whatever it takes to ensure
the safety of your sister...

367
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,717
...while bringing in
Agent Walker peacefully.

368
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:39,805
But Chuck, you know what happens
in that plaza depends entirely on Sarah.

369
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,687
Sarah, I think that the Intersect
may have damaged...

370
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,731
Stop talking. I know you're involved.

371
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,946
You okay?

372
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,531
Have you got the glasses?

373
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,075
I don't have them with me.

374
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,036
Wait, wait, wait.

375
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,998
Just wait a second, okay?
Whatever you think I've done...

376
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,626
...she didn't do anything.
She's innocent.

377
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:13,922
So I will lead you to the glasses,
but just you and me, okay?

378
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,883
Please just let her go.

379
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,470
I'll follow you in a separate car.
She'll come with me.

380
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,764
If I see anything suspicious, then...

381
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,643
Well, you better hope I don't.

382
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,145
Okay, okay. Follow me.

383
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,980
You drive.

384
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,783
All right, Bartowski,
we have eyes on the plaza.

385
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:52,336
Okay, she's following me,
but Casey, she brought Ellie with her.

386
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,799
Don't worry, Chuck.

387
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,094
I'll make sure Ellie comes out
of this without a scratch.

388
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,599
Sarah...

389
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,519
...you don't have to do this.

390
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,231
Casey, what if she resists?

391
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,109
Hey, this isn't the Sarah you know.

392
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,321
You were in my wedding.
You were at the hospital. We're family.

393
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,906
No, we're not.

394
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,868
This was always a mission for me,
and today I'm gonna finish it.

395
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,206
Chuck, you listen to me.

396
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,834
She's not in there anymore.

397
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,003
Sarah's gone.

398
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,464
No, she's not.

399
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,299
My wife is not gone.

400
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,010
Bartowski? Chuck!

401
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,929
Where are you going?

402
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,814
So once you get the glasses, what then?

403
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,317
Hmm, what happens to Chuck?

404
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,861
Just stay close.

405
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,158
Okay. He's right up there ahead.

406
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,416
If you could remember...

407
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,795
...if you were still you, you would want
me to do anything I could to save Chuck.

408
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,839
- You would want this.
- Want what?

409
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,340
Sorry, Sarah.

410
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,885
Ellie, no!

411
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,771
Oh, my God. Ellie? Ellie.

412
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,774
- Oh, God, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

413
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,444
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking about protecting you.

414
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,488
Chuck, Sarah's trying to kill you.

415
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,491
There's something seriously wrong
with her, Chuck.

416
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,077
That's why I'm taking her somewhere
that'll help her remember.

417
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,917
Agent Walker, what's happening?
Walker? Where are you?

418
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,752
What if she doesn't remember?

419
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,505
She's further gone than Morgan
ever was, Chuck.

420
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,049
You need to call the CIA.
You need to turn her in.

421
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,636
Listen, everyone keeps telling me
Sarah's gone. She's not. She's here.

422
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,846
Chuck.

423
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,973
What if it was Devon?

424
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,987
- Hey, where are you? You okay?
- I'm fine, but Chuck isn't.

425
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,073
He just took off with Sarah.

426
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,866
Damn it, Bartowski.

427
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:32,162
John, I know my little brother,
and I know where he would take her.

428
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,591
Hi. Look,
I know you don't remember me.

429
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:49,680
I thought maybe you'd remember this,
our dream home.

430
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,266
The one you always told me
that you wanted.

431
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,270
Our relationship was a cover,
Bartowski.

432
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,689
It always has been.

433
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,190
You were just an assignment.

434
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:05,863
No, I was an assignment,
and then you fell in love with me.

435
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,409
And I know that sounds crazy, and if I
didn't know better, I'd say it's crazy too.

436
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,203
But the fact remains, you fell for me,
Sarah, you did.

437
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,747
My job is to make you think
that I feel something.

438
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,709
That's what I do best, I lie.

439
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,546
Actually, you're not as good
of a liar as you think you are.

440
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,591
It's true, okay?

441
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:34,057
Our first kiss. Not our first cover kiss,
but our first real kiss...

442
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,977
...was when we were trying to
defuse a bomb...

443
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,480
...and we thought we were gonna die,
and I closed my eyes...

444
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:45,068
...and I felt you grab me and kiss me.

445
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,823
You kissed me. And then there was a
lot of pretending that it didn't happen...

446
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,784
...and awkward back-and-forth
and dating other people...

447
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,870
...but one day...

448
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,456
...one day when I was sure...

449
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,127
...that you could never love
a nerd like me...

450
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,087
...you came over...

451
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,591
...and I asked you if you loved me.

452
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,884
Sarah, do you love me?

453
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,011
And you...

454
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,262
...Sarah Walker...

455
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,057
...said yes.

456
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,518
And when I asked you to marry me...

457
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,229
...you didn't have to say yes,
because we both knew.

458
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:24,399
We both knew that we'd spend
the rest of our lives together.

459
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,361
So please remember this house,
and the red door...

460
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,156
...and the white-picket fence, and
the family that we were going to raise.

461
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,492
And remember me.

462
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,496
Because if you remember me...

463
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,083
...then you'll remember...

464
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,922
...that a nerdy guy like me
who works at a Buy More...

465
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,633
...could make you happy.

466
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,720
So I'm gonna give you a choice.

467
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,516
Right here, right now. It's up to you.

468
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:02,479
You can either take a chance on me
and we can start over...

469
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,405
...or you can take these glasses
that you came for...

470
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,574
...and never see me again.

471
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,499
This is real?

472
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,419
You really love me?

473
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,422
With all of my heart.

474
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,516
I'm sorry I did my job too well.

475
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,272
I have a mission to finish.
And I need those glasses.

476
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,815
No, you can't!

477
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,234
Give them to me!

478
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,740
- Why won't you fight back?
- I'm not gonna fight you.

479
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,660
I'm never gonna hurt you.

480
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,705
Sarah, you're my wife!

481
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,238
You can kill me.

482
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,282
I will never hurt you.

483
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,253
I wrote that.

484
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,464
Yeah, you did.

485
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:56,176
- Honey, we don't own this home.
- I know.

486
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:01,807
But we will.
One day this will all be ours.

487
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,769
And when it is, I would like to
always remember this moment.

488
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,741
Very good work, Agent Walker.

489
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,035
The glasses.

490
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,541
You lied to her. You used her.

491
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,296
You're right.

492
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,174
He's right. I'm not CIA.

493
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,511
And I suppose I could explain it
all to you, but honestly...

494
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,055
...you're not worth the time.

495
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,057
Goodbye, Sarah.

496
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,892
No!

497
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,565
Oh, my God, are you okay?

498
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,776
I'm wearing a vest.

499
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,028
They're coming for you, Sarah.

500
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,075
- Run.
- But...

501
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,660
Run.

502
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,588
He's here.

503
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,882
Chuck.

504
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,758
- Hey.
- Where's Sarah?

505
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,636
She's gone.

506
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,431
Sarah's gone.

507
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,939
You're lucky the bullet
only hit your vest, bro.

508
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,026
Yeah, it's the best news
I've heard all day.

509
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,612
I'll get you something for the pain.

510
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,697
Thank you.

511
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,161
I lost her, Ellie.

512
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:52,459
For a split second, it felt like she was
starting to remember, but she's gone.

513
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,880
Why don't you get some sleep?

514
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,467
I'll be right here when you wake up.

515
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,264
Come on.

516
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,229
Thanks.

517
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,737
Don't ever leave me.

518
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,656
Never.

519
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,213
Figured I'd find you here.

520
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,009
You can put the knife down,
I'm not here to fight.

521
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,183
- What do you remember about me?
- Your reputation mostly.

522
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,811
Unfriendly, unforgiving...

523
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,230
...and unquestioning
about your orders.

524
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,190
That's funny.

525
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,945
When we met, people said the same thing
about you. Probably why we never got along.

526
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,573
Well, if we didn't get along,
then why are you here?

527
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,041
Guess Bartowski's
made us both a little soft.

528
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,631
Beckman's got a new job for me...

529
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,552
...but these past five years,
we changed, you know?

530
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,222
We became friends.

531
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,646
Take care of yourself, Walker.

532
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,454
Day One. My mission is simple.

533
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,457
Find out what he knows, gain trust,
and monitor actions...

534
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,668
...until the Agency can decide
what to do with him.

535
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,006
Day 21. Chuck came over
to my hotel room today...

536
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,091
...and brought me a pizza.

537
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,676
Vegetarian, no olives.

538
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,429
I think he's making it his mission
to get to know me.

539
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,223
It's sweet. Day 49.

540
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,768
Chuck broke up with me today.

541
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,269
Well, fake...

542
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,189
Fake broke up with me, technically.

543
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,232
Day 56.

544
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,402
Chuck and I were
defusing a bomb today...

545
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,948
...and there was a moment where
we were sure we were going to die.

546
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,079
He closed his eyes...

547
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,831
...and I kissed him.

548
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,962
I kissed him.

549
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:48,593
Day 564. Things are calm for once.

550
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,261
No missions, nothing.

551
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,722
Nothing really to report...

552
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:57,018
...except I still find myself
sitting here...

553
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,937
...talking to myself...

554
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,314
...because...

555
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,900
Because I love him.

556
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:12,367
I love Chuck Bartowski,
and I don't know what to do about it.

557
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,795
Are you sure you don't wanna spend
the night? You're more than welcome.

558
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,464
I'm gonna have to go home
eventually.

559
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,842
Tonight's as good a night as any,
I suppose.

560
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,094
Okay.

561
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,681
Well, I'm coming over bright and early,
and I'm making you pancakes.

562
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,516
Thanks, sis.

563
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,228
- Love you.
- Love you too.

564
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,699
Chuck?

565
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,078
Sarah?

566
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:09,632
I just wanted to tell you
that I believe you.

567
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,386
I believe everything
that you told me about us.

568
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,015
But...

569
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:23,229
...the truth is, Chuck, I don't feel it.

570
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,067
Everything that you told me
about us and our story, I just...

571
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,903
I don't feel it.

572
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,281
Right. Heh.

573
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,744
Right, of course, I, uh...

574
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,831
I don't know what I was expecting,
you know?

575
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,293
So, what are you doing here, then?

576
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:50,215
Well, I wanted to say sorry
for everything that happened today.

577
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,930
But most of all,
I wanted to say goodbye.

578
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,058
Where are you going?

579
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,939
Quinn took away my life,
and I have to...

580
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,441
Well, I have to go find him.

581
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:25,458
Goodbye.
