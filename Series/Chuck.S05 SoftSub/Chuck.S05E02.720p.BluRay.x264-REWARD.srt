1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,421
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things
that you might need to know.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,423
Let's dance.

3
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,428
- Hello, Chuck.
- Decker froze Bale's accounts.

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,763
Castle and the Buy More aren't frozen.

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,766
- All of our money? We have nothing?
- Payback's a bitch.

6
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,977
The Buy More.
We take Buy More's profits...

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,272
...put them into Carmichael Industries
until both companies can make money.

8
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:28,986
My name is Charles Carmichael,
and I have one final question for you:

9
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:33,323
Have you ever needed to subdue
a Basque terrorist on a Swiss train?

10
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,952
Or fight your way
through the jungles of Southeast Asia?

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,537
Or take out an arms dealer...

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,956
...with a penchant for murder
and ice cream?

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,458
Well, we have.

14
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:46,712
So while considering security needs,
when lives are on the line...

15
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,923
...I implore you to consider us.

16
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,056
It's not that one.

17
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,017
It's not that... Carmichael Industries.

18
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,477
Thank you.

19
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:05,981
- You did good.
Mm-hm.

20
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,191
That was good.

21
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,153
All right,
we have one more team presenting.

22
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,572
Uh, they should be here, uh, any minute.

23
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,827
What's happening?

24
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,170
Wait, this is not a real attack, is it?

25
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,175
No, this is our competition.

26
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,179
Three hundred agents
from all over the world.

27
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,265
CIA, KGB, Mossad and Interpol.

28
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,393
We work for the Pentagon,
we work for the Kremlin...

29
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,354
...and we'll work for you.

30
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:50,901
My name is Gertrude Verbanski,
and we are Verbanski Corp.

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,363
And if we can get to you,
we can get to anyone.

32
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,045
Verbanski.

33
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,880
Yeah, Verbanski.

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,928
Sorry, kind of got carried away there.
I thought... This is not a bit that?

35
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,014
Right. Uh... Go ahead.

36
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,641
Who is she?

37
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:27,187
One of the KGB's most ruthless spies
till the fall of the Soviet Union.

38
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,274
Then she went
into the private-security game.

39
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,733
And how do you know her?

40
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,403
Minsk, 1995.

41
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,905
I was being a patriot.

42
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,616
She was being
whatever she was paid to be.

43
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,536
Wow, 1995.
I was still in middle school.

44
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:49,418
Anyway, we had an altercation.

45
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,296
I ended up with a Rosewell blade
in my shoulder.

46
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,757
Made a nasty scar
right over one of my favorite scars.

47
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:00,304
Well, Verbanski is good. She took
all of our potential clients today.

48
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,514
Awesome ditched rock climbing
to help me.

49
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,600
He is gonna be so disappointed.

50
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,268
It didn't go well?

51
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,438
Did you give eye contact
to all four quadrants of the audience?

52
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,607
It was great,
all of your advice was great.

53
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,776
Of course it was. Same tactics I used
to woo your hot sister, heh.

54
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,279
Okay. Um...

55
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,616
Look, we were just a little outmatched
is all.

56
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,870
Well, at least
you still have the Buy More, bro.

57
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,706
Still cash flow coming in there.

58
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,210
Right?

59
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,643
- What? Is that an actual tumbleweed?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,812
We put in a home-and-garden section
to drum up business.

61
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,023
I'm glad someone
put out the tumbleweed.

62
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:57,069
- Oh, boy.
- Anyway, how was the presentation?

63
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,739
Not good. No, not good.
Verbanski Corp took all of our clients.

64
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,034
Put me out there, you don't worry
about what other companies are doing.

65
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,912
Look, I know I seem
like just an ordinary guy...

66
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,748
...but I am, in fact, the Intersect.

67
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,335
Multibillion-dollar CIA asset
turned super-weapon-for-hire.

68
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:17,422
Buddy, no one can know that we
have the walking CIA database...

69
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,840
...on our team, okay?

70
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,343
The Intersect is a secret weapon
for a reason.

71
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,179
That sucks, man.
I have all these powers and abilities.

72
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,391
And how am I to help people
if I can't tell anybody about it?

73
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,060
Because, Morgan, if you do,
it could get you killed.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,447
- What?
- Oh, I just zoomed. I just zoomed.

75
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,033
- There's a bad guy in the Buy More.
- Are you sure?

76
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,327
Know what we gotta do?
We gotta take him down.

77
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,206
Take a breath.
We gotta be subtle about this.

78
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,458
He's going for a weapon.
He's coming.

79
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,296
- I'm in. I'm in.
- Morgan. Ah...!

80
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,434
Not good.

81
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,813
You just found out that the zoom
is mightier than the sword, my friend.

82
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,148
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

83
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,400
Man, I feel incredible.
Did you see that?

84
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,069
You like that,
"the zoom is mightier than the sword?"

85
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,071
Oh. Casey,
we have a bit of a situation here.

86
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,115
Listen. I just got a call...

87
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,326
...and someone wants to hire
Carmichael Industries.

88
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,120
He's coming to the Buy More
to meet with us now.

89
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,007
We actually just met, heh.

90
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,966
Mr. Sneijder? Mister...

91
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,762
We are so sorry.

92
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,722
Please, take a muffin.

93
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,019
What's happening?

94
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,479
Welcome to Carmichael Industries.

95
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,274
Uh, I must apologize for your unnecessarily
rough welcome, Mr. Sneijder.

96
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,277
Or, uh, shall I call you Karl?

97
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,657
- You want a muffin or not?
- He made them fresh this morning.

98
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,870
Um, I just have one, uh, little question
for you.

99
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,249
Is there a reason why our, uh...

100
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,084
...partner...

101
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,087
...thought that you were, I don't know,
a criminal?

102
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,674
I do work in the diamond industry
in South Africa. We're not known...

103
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,093
...for keeping our hands clean.
- Hmm.

104
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,807
I don't eat bran. Nobody does.

105
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,267
I told you.

106
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,604
Listen, I've come to ask for your help
on something entirely legitimate.

107
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,442
We're listening.

108
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,820
My little brother, Wesley,
was kidnapped...

109
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,781
...by a buyer I may have wronged
in the past.

110
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,285
I don't know where he's being held,
but I do know he's being tortured.

111
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,789
My little brother, he never wanted
to have anything to do with my affairs.

112
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,000
He's a good man.

113
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,545
- And they will kill him unless...
- We save him.

114
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,547
Exactly.

115
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,301
Why should we believe
these people actually took your brother?

116
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,015
They sent me this.

117
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,938
We gonna draw straws
to see who opens that thing?

118
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,983
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

119
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,068
Oh, my God.
That's not even on ice. I...

120
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,696
That's probably not gonna be able
to be reattached.

121
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,157
I know it's not a lot of money...

122
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,326
...but I'm willing
to offer you $200,000 upfront...

123
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,705
...and another 200,000
when you deliver my brother to me.

124
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:23,335
And I know you don't wanna help me,
but please consider helping my brother.

125
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,754
No one else will.

126
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:30,509
If you don't mind, we'll take some time
to consider your offer and check facts.

127
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,552
Thank you. Thank you very much.

128
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,262
Oh, I...

129
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,141
Is your friend with the beard
going to be a problem?

130
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,601
- No. No.
- No. No.

131
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,311
No.

132
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,858
What Morgan did today in the Buy More
could've really blown our cover.

133
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,569
The first months with the Intersect
are a big adjustment.

134
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:53,031
It's scary and exciting.
Your hormones are totally out of whack.

135
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,992
You're really rediscovering your body.

136
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,289
- It's a lot to take in, all I'm saying.
- That's exactly why he needs a handler.

137
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,875
What? Who, me?

138
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,920
You had Casey and me, Chuck, okay?
Morgan needs you.

139
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,261
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Chuck. Good.

140
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:19,182
Listen, I wanted to, uh... say sorry
about what happened with Sneijder.

141
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,060
No, hey, buddy, you know,
look, I totally get it.

142
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,397
It took me a while to be out there
with the Intersect too, so...

143
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,732
It's like, uh, Peter Parker,
Amazing Spider-Man.

144
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,820
The thing is, it took him a while
to kind of really harness in his powers...

145
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,030
...to really get ahold
of his Spidey sense.

146
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,824
- Right.
- So...

147
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,492
Yeah, heh.

148
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,536
Uh, which, interestingly enough...

149
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,871
...brings me to something
I wanted to talk to you about.

150
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:48,295
Um, I was wondering what you thought
about me maybe being your handler?

151
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,132
I could show you the ropes
just like Sarah and Casey did for me.

152
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,509
- Yeah.
- Great. Yeah.

153
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,179
And on missions, you know,
you can still show off your...

154
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,224
...zooms.

155
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,228
But for now, we gotta keep the Intersect
under wraps and focus on the store.

156
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,856
Aloha, Chuck. Hello, stepchild.

157
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,441
- Hey.
- Like my new threads?

158
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,069
I just got back from four weeks
of sexual experimentation...

159
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,364
...and snorkeling
with my new wife in Hawaii.

160
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,451
So, what you boys been up to?

161
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,662
The Buy More seems empty.

162
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,790
Are we observing
International Pancake Day?

163
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,500
No, no, no. Um...

164
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,212
Business has just, you know,
been a little slow.

165
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,174
That's not gonna work for me.
I need this job.

166
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:39,846
Bolonia Grimes Tucker
is not a cheap tigress, boys.

167
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,807
I think we're on the same page,
Big Mike.

168
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,352
Not having to do
with your mother being a tigress.

169
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,270
I wouldn't know anything about that.

170
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,524
But we need something new, we need
something big to save the Buy More.

171
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,234
Hmm.

172
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,197
I may actually have just the thing.

173
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,450
Say, Miss Lady, you need any help?

174
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,035
Yeah, Pops, I do.

175
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,328
Do you have Betamax?

176
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,039
Sure enough. We even sell VCRs...

177
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,458
...depending, of course,
on what you're into.

178
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,294
- And it's on sale, only 2 grand.
- Oh!

179
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,047
That's a far-out deal, mister.

180
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,216
But come on now,
you only buying that?

181
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,467
Why don't you...

182
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,136
...Buy More?

183
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,265
Damn, I was skinny.

184
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,811
Boogie fever

185
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,190
So I figure we just re-air this spot.

186
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,444
Brought in a lot of business at the time,
if you know what I mean.

187
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:41,950
No offense, Big Mike,
but it feels a little dated.

188
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,535
Maybe we should come up...

189
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,997
...with something that showcases
some of our more current merchandise.

190
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:52,627
Maybe what we're looking for
is a fresh face...

191
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,131
...uh, to kind of tell people
that the Buy More, um...

192
00:11:56,298 --> 00:12:00,051
...has something new to offer.

193
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,595
- Hmm, yeah.
- Right?

194
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,057
I hear you.

195
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,685
Everybody wants something new.

196
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:20,029
The finger is a positive match, Casey.
It definitely belongs to Wesley Sneijder.

197
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,490
Yeah, got it.

198
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,702
You were right on the location too.
Got eyeballs on Wesley.

199
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,204
He's being held
in a guarded compound.

200
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,376
Well, let's just see
how well protected you are.

201
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,428
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

202
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:48,933
Hey, hey, I'm just hunting waterfowl,
that's all. What are you doing?

203
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,479
- You're on private property, man.
- Oh, well, my bad, then.

204
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,273
Uh, sorry, I didn't realize.

205
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,567
No harm, no fowl.

206
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:04,115
Get it? Okay, have a nice day.

207
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,494
At least 12 guards
with weapons pointed at the entrance.

208
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,039
- We are not going in the front door.
- There has to be another way in.

209
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,333
If there is, I'll find it.

210
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,962
Oh, I get it, he meant waterfowl.

211
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,559
Hello?

212
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,246
Ah. Please forgive me.

213
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,789
It's our busy season.

214
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,415
- Hi.
- Hi.

215
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,003
Oh, yes, not many people
have disarmed Colonel Casey...

216
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,090
...but I like to remember all my victories,
even little ones.

217
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,925
Have a seat.

218
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:08,930
Uh, you mind telling me what I'm here for?
You said you had some information.

219
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,890
Verbanski Corp has a job opening.

220
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,811
- And?
- And put simply, I want you.

221
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,106
Private security isn't a game
you just try your hand at.

222
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,024
I have agents in 38 countries...

223
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,862
...under 15 separate Pentagon contracts
worth over 2 billion annually.

224
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,406
Well, that's very impressive.

225
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,325
And what does
Carmichael Industries have...

226
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:33,621
...other than a former colonel
and a CEO with skinny arms?

227
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,582
What am I really doing here?

228
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,334
We both know I'm not gonna
leave my husband's company.

229
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,545
Are you trying to recruit John Casey?

230
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,551
Is that his name
on that second folder?

231
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,138
Let me be frank.

232
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,599
I'm talking to you
because you're good...

233
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,310
...but your company isn't going to last,
Miss Walker.

234
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,020
You should switch while you can.

235
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,189
First of all, it's missus,
and second of all, I'm disappointed.

236
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,816
I thought this was gonna be...

237
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,819
...a friendly cooperation
between business associates.

238
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,990
But if it's competition that you want,
then I suggest you watch your back.

239
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,788
Oh, by the way,
when this whole thing ends...

240
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,834
...don't expect me to mount anything
of yours in my office. It's just tacky.

241
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,550
Casey said he wanted something light.

242
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,053
He said that, but he doesn't mean it.

243
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,389
Is this the best use of our time?
We could be doing so much more.

244
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,433
Zim-zam-zoom, chop-socky.

245
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,810
- Morgan.
- I... I know.

246
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,565
I'm talking a lot about the Intersect,
but, you know, I finally get it, though.

247
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,109
For the first time,
I sort of feel as cool as you.

248
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,487
I can't figure out
why I can't use what I have...

249
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,449
...to make this dusty little rock
that we all have to share...

250
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,453
...well, just a bit better for all of us.

251
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:59,415
- It's a pretty good speech...
- Give me all your money. Get it now.

252
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,125
- Morgan. Morgan, look.
- Hurry up.

253
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,044
- Please. I'm getting it.
- My God.

254
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,172
- I know.
- This is it, what I've been waiting for.

255
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,717
What? What? What do you mean
what you've been waiting for?

256
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,263
A chance for
the Bearded Bandit to come out and play.

257
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,808
What are you talking about?
This isn't a game.

258
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,268
I know, but I can do this,
I can save the day.

259
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,396
Do you even know
what "bandit" means?

260
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,731
It's like "robber" or "crook."

261
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,025
No, I Googled it. It's a fighter aircraft.

262
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,027
What? I don't...
What did you say?

263
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,071
I Googled it.

264
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,366
It's slang also for "fighter aircraft,"
so there's that.

265
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,743
This is not a good idea, Morgan.

266
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,037
Wish me luck.

267
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,874
Morgan, Morgan.

268
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,464
Oh, no.

269
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,429
Oh, my God.

270
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,014
Are you a cop?

271
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,141
Heh, not even close, sweetheart.

272
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,434
I'm the Bearded Bandit.

273
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,519
Oh, no. Uh...

274
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,105
Take whatever you want.
Just don't hurt me.

275
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,816
No, no.
It's a slang term for fighter... For... Uh...

276
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,163
- Morgan.
- Nice save, Chuck.

277
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,416
That's what I'm talking about.
We could do this. Be superheroes.

278
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,460
I'm the worst handler in the world.

279
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,964
Holy crap, Chuck.
Move, move, the fuzz, fuzz, fuzz.

280
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,308
Explain.

281
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:47,190
- I know, uh, I know, it's just...
- Chuck, we are a legitimate company...

282
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,359
...not a bunch of vigilantes
fighting crime at the Circle K.

283
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,320
I know that, I know.

284
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,823
But his heart is in the right place.
That should matter for something.

285
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,492
Morgan is your responsibility.

286
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,203
He could have gotten killed
and the clerk yesterday.

287
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,454
That is what matters.

288
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,789
Hmm.

289
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,670
We found the compound
where Wesley's kept.

290
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,172
We've already alerted Karl.

291
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,342
There's just one thing left
we need to handle.

292
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,387
Morgan.

293
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,016
You're sticking me in the van?

294
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,978
Chuck, come on, dude,
I am the Intersect, man.

295
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,189
Okay, all right, okay, look.

296
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,734
You don't wanna pitch me to potential
clients, that's up to you, okay?

297
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,694
But you gotta use me on the missions.

298
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,489
- Morgan, it's not that simple.
- But it is that simple.

299
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,325
How is it not? You're my friend.

300
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,706
Buddy, we got lucky at the Circle K.

301
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,751
Very, very lucky.
What you did was dangerous...

302
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,507
...and letting you do that was my fault,
I'm your handler, not just your friend.

303
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,676
I need to protect you.

304
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,182
Buy More commercial, take 28.

305
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,894
- Rolling, and quiet.
- It's one line.

306
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,729
Can't you even deliver one line?

307
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,189
Why not...

308
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,234
...Buy More?

309
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,695
Remind me of one of them troll dolls.

310
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:20,324
- And action.
- Why not Buy More?

311
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,034
Wow!

312
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,914
Man, I am so over
this whole Jeffster thing.

313
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,792
- Me too.
- Cut.

314
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,631
Just stop. My commercial was a hit
because I was a hot piece of meat...

315
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,426
...a thing women and men wanted...

316
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,762
...which, at the time,
was a lot less common.

317
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,723
The store's on the line here.

318
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,852
None of you have a face
that'll bring in customers.

319
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,896
Sookie, sookie.

320
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,159
Mike, you guys got any baby pads
around here?

321
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,121
Yeah, uh, Aisle 3.

322
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,915
Okay, heh.

323
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,259
That's a pretty man.

324
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:29,518
Casey did some recon and the
house is impregnable from the front road.

325
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,521
Yeah, and this cliff is impossible
to free-climb.

326
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,815
Told you, sounds like a job
for the old...

327
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,277
A job for real spies.
There, why don't you wait in the van?

328
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,156
Don't worry, buddy,
you'll be with us on the next one.

329
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,449
Right.

330
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,495
Unbelievable.

331
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,832
- Ready?
- Absolutely.

332
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,510
"Wait in the van, Morgan."
"Yeah, wait in the van."

333
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,305
"Oh, in the van, moron.
Hmm. Grunt, grunt, grunt."

334
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,688
We're on a private line.
I didn't wanna...

335
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,024
...worry Chuck, but I had a meeting
with Verbanski yesterday.

336
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,236
What did she want?

337
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:26,200
Ugh, apparently she wanted to recruit me,
but I think she was really after you.

338
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,160
What do you mean?

339
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,204
Well, she has your gun...

340
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,499
...on display in her office.

341
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,168
The gun from Minsk?

342
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,879
She kept my gun?

343
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,591
Oh, God. Oh, God.

344
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,511
Casey?

345
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,764
- Casey, I'm slipping.
- Casey.

346
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,063
Looking good, babe.
Doing good up there.

347
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,857
Doing good. There you go.

348
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,736
Jeez, what's up
with you and Verbanski anyway?

349
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,532
Don't worry, Walker. I got your back.

350
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:30,264
Still climbing. Holy cow.

351
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:50,826
- All clear.
- All clear. Yeah. About time.

352
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,956
Okay, Chuck, this is all you.

353
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,769
- Who are you people?
- We're here to save you.

354
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,772
- What are you talking about?
- Relax. Your brother hired us.

355
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,315
He did what?

356
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,527
What are you doing?
We're here to protect you.

357
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,695
The only thing
keeping my brother from killing me...

358
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,989
...are the men I hired
to guard this compound.

359
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,825
What?

360
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,496
- But your finger.
- Who do you think cut it off?

361
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,957
I'm trying to testify against him.

362
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,502
This is a giant misunderstanding.
We're not here to hurt you.

363
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,839
- Yeah, my men will be here any second.
- Morgan, get the van ready.

364
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,842
Morgan, do you copy?

365
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,680
Morgan?

366
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,976
Get back.

367
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,564
Kamikaze!

368
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,199
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

369
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,376
What's up, team?
You guys need some help?

370
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,546
- Yes and no.
- Okay. That's...

371
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,221
Just zoomed. Wesley's brother's
not trying to save him.

372
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,056
- He's trying to...
- We know.

373
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,225
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

374
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,937
If the Intersect wasn't stifled, we
would've known that ahead of time...

375
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,940
...and I wouldn't have had
to take out Wesley's guards.

376
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,109
- Really sorry about that, dude.
- It's, you know...

377
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,783
- Hey, Karl.
- Sat images show...

378
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,412
...that you took care of the guards
at the compound. Nice work.

379
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,582
I have a team coming up the access road
to pick up my brother.

380
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,709
Do you? That's great.
That's great news.

381
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,336
We'll be right here waiting for them.

382
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,130
Bye now.

383
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,466
Karl's men are gonna be here
any minute.

384
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,468
- Yes.
- Well, then I'm a dead man.

385
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,554
No. We came here to save you
and that's what we're gonna do.

386
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,265
What? No, no, no.
The Intersect runs from no man.

387
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,809
For now, he does. Let's go, Morgan.

388
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,107
- We had a deal.
- Exactly.

389
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,109
You hired us to save your brother.

390
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,946
No, I paid you to extract him
and bring him to me.

391
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,115
We didn't know you were planning
on killing him.

392
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,786
Nor did we know you were responsible
for the finger-cutting. That's crazy.

393
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,081
Listen, you have exactly four hours
to deliver Wesley to me.

394
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,124
Otherwise, I'm coming after you...

395
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,961
...and that is something
you will not enjoy.

396
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,880
And that comment card you sent
with the contract?

397
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,465
Well, you can consider...

398
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,930
- What are we gonna do?
- Got a fingerless guy in the game room...

399
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,975
...and his psychopath brother
threatening to come after us.

400
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,436
So we go to the source.
We take out Karl before he gets to us.

401
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,648
With what army?
We don't work for the government.

402
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,818
If we can get to Beckman,
she can help put Wesley into custody.

403
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,320
No, there's no time for that.
We have to act now.

404
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,739
We're not going into a firefight
unprepared. End of story.

405
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,662
I feel like a burrito.
Go on a food run, huh?

406
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,080
- A food run?
- Yeah.

407
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,499
- Again, I am the Intersect.
- Then act like it.

408
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,002
Okay, okay.
Why don't I just go with you, buddy?

409
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:32,172
And we can get a little breather while
we wait to hear back from Beckman.

410
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,425
Don't forget the utensils.

411
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,928
Thank you.

412
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,180
Must have had
one too many piña coladas...

413
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,808
...and my blood pressure
is generally outrageous.

414
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,686
I'm just glad I was here
for your dizzy spell.

415
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,817
Devon, ever given any thought to doing
something that involves less doctoring...

416
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,361
...and more making a commercial
for the Buy More?

417
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,656
- What?
- The Buy More needs a fresh face.

418
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:04,121
I'm about to go on paternity leave
to spend more time with my family.

419
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,625
Sure, I did some modeling for
Abercrombie & Fitch back in college...

420
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,836
...but, heh, I hung up those cargo pants
a long time ago.

421
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,839
Hold on. I'm not talking
about doing some teenage porno.

422
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,843
Look. This is your brother-in-law's
place of business, and it's empty.

423
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,386
But your creamy skin...

424
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:23,390
...and unusually high cheekbones
can change all that.

425
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,227
And if you are taking time off
to help your family...

426
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,647
...isn't Chuck your family too?

427
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,652
I can't believe Casey sent us out
for burritos.

428
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,155
Burritos, Chuck? I'm tired of running
errands for that man's stomach.

429
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,240
Look, Casey means well.

430
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,661
Yeah, but it's not just Casey, dude,
okay? It's Sarah too.

431
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,704
What is that supposed to mean?

432
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,500
Isn't she the one who told you
to be my handler in the first place?

433
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,669
- Yeah...
- Did it occur to you...

434
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,587
...that she made you my babysitter...

435
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,423
...to distract you from the fact
you're being sidelined?

436
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,760
I don't know if you noticed, chief.
You're on a food run with me.

437
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,555
Look, I'm not...

438
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,432
Look, I love Sarah, I do, okay?

439
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,978
It's just I wanna make sure
that she's not the one handling you.

440
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,067
She's not.

441
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,781
- You just passed the exit for Dos Locos.
- We're not going to Dos Locos.

442
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,784
We're going to Karl Sneijder's
corporate headquarters.

443
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,787
Oh, yeah. Zoomed on a file in Castle.

444
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,915
Oh, did you?
And why didn't you tell anyone?

445
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,376
Why would I, okay?
We're gonna take him down.

446
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:36,046
No. No, no, Bearded Bandit.
No, we are not. It is far too dangerous.

447
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,465
I'm gonna call Casey and Sarah.
They can help.

448
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,759
They can what?
Stick us both in the van?

449
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,761
No. Come on, Chuck.
We don't need them.

450
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,139
We're here.

451
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:49,393
Hey, they don't understand that you
and I are like Batman and Robin, okay?

452
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,062
Unless you don't wanna be Robin.
Who wants to be Robin?

453
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,647
We'll be Batman and Batman.

454
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,275
We should be saving the day,
not running errands...

455
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,736
...or waiting for Beckman
to get back to us.

456
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,906
Morgan, I know what it feels like to have
the Intersect surging through you.

457
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,783
- Like you can do...
- Anything.

458
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,076
Yes, yes, anything.

459
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,996
Save the day, be a hero, anything.
Put those away. What are you doing?

460
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,958
Here's the thing, though, Chuck.
You don't need the Intersect to feel that.

461
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,295
With or without it, you are a hero,
so don't call them.

462
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:21,175
All right, we can handle this together.
Just come with me.

463
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,968
I need you.

464
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,933
Morgan, no, no, no! God. Ugh.

465
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,854
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay.

466
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,275
- Chuck?
- Sarah.

467
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,027
We're at Sneijder's headquarters.

468
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,112
What? Don't go in there.

469
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,364
I know. Morgan ran inside,
he's in trouble.

470
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,366
We're in trouble, I'm going after him.

471
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,952
Chuck, no, you can't.
Please wait for us, okay?

472
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,705
I'm Morgan's handler.
It's my job to take care of him.

473
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,209
Which is why I called you, which is why
I have to go help him now.

474
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,377
You'd do the same for me.

475
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,466
Oh, God.

476
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,387
Chuck's doing a great job
handling Grimes.

477
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,556
The blind leading the blind out there.

478
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:12,768
We get to Sneijder's headquarters
before something happens.

479
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,063
Casey, what is this?

480
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,858
Your team...

481
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,487
They're at my brother's building,
right?

482
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,573
That place may look
like an ordinary office...

483
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:31,078
...but Karl realizes something's up,
he's gonna lock it down like a fortress.

484
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,290
No one's gonna be able
to get in or out of there alive.

485
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,097
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

486
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,765
- You came.
- Let's go.

487
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,352
No, no. Stop, stop, stop. Through
that door, that's Sneijder's office.

488
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,022
We find proof that he's smuggling
conflict diamonds and then grab him.

489
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,191
What are you talking about?
We have to go.

490
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,818
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

491
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,945
Whoa, whoa, whoa, trouble.

492
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,864
No, no, no.

493
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,366
Yes. Listen, you are the best spy
that I know...

494
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,286
...and I would rather have nobody else
watching my back.

495
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,038
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna take it slow.

496
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,165
Please don't.

497
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,150
- See? Nothing to it.
- It's great. Very good. Now what?

498
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,531
In the old days, we'd just
call the commandos for backup.

499
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,326
Wanna work for Verbanski Corp,
have a DOD contract...

500
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,494
...go ahead.
- I don't wanna work for her.

501
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,705
I saw her website
on your computer, okay?

502
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,374
- How much is she offering you?
- Nothing.

503
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,048
The only thing Verbanski's interested in
is me.

504
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,883
Physically.

505
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,551
- Sexually.
- What?

506
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,761
Watch the road, Walker.

507
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,683
Sweep the leg. Nice.

508
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,525
It was a long time ago.

509
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,778
It only happened once.

510
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,365
Seeing her again
makes it, ugh, complicated.

511
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,533
Complicated how?

512
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,036
Well...

513
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,374
...you ever, uh, have sex with someone
who'd just tried to kill you?

514
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,583
Oh, God.

515
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,085
It was incredible.

516
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,587
Okay, I think we should focus
on the mission now.

517
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,838
Yeah.

518
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,397
Uh-huh?

519
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,581
- Wow, good job, Indy.
- Yeah.

520
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,208
Who?

521
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,877
Indiana Jones?

522
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,506
- You know?
- Cool. Let's go get Sneijder.

523
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,092
Wait, no. We have to get out of here
right now.

524
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,096
Good rule about bad guys: If there's five
to start with, then there's more.

525
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,765
- Chuck...
- Da-da-da-da. Intersect. Handler.

526
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,769
But look what we did here, man.
Just like I said, Batman and Batman.

527
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,857
Just because you have the Intersect doesn't
mean you don't have something to learn.

528
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,693
You have a lot to learn.
I'm not gonna let you kill yourself today.

529
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,446
- I called Casey and Sarah.
- What? You called them?

530
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,322
Mr. Carmichael?

531
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:59,327
I do wish you would have called
before dropping by.

532
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,791
Place is a mess.

533
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,380
So did you bring me my brother?

534
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,467
About that...

535
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,851
Wesley was right.
The building's already in lockdown.

536
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,979
We have to get in there.
Chuck's not answering his phone.

537
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,647
Can't. Suicide.

538
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,317
- We have to do something.
- We're not gonna get in now.

539
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,320
Place is a fortress.
The boys are on their own.

540
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:37,908
Well, that is not good enough. I'm gonna
do whatever it takes to get us in there.

541
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,750
Who are you gonna call?

542
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,211
I cannot believe that you called them.

543
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,338
I had Sneijder
right where I wanted him.

544
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,132
We're not superheroes, not vigilantes,
we're a team.

545
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,718
I thought this one was you and me.

546
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,096
Why are you
so against Casey and Sarah?

547
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,015
Because they don't believe in me,
they don't trust me.

548
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,351
And it's very clear to me now,
neither do you.

549
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,895
- Morgan...
- Shut up!

550
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,773
I can't listen to you schoolgirls
babble on anymore.

551
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,025
Come to think of it...

552
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,862
...I only need one hostage
to get my brother back.

553
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,367
What's happening?

554
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,752
Oh, I know what's happening.

555
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,095
Put your weapons down.

556
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,976
I'm sorry, one more time for clarity,
and then I shoot something that counts.

557
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,894
Put your weapons down.

558
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,945
I got a couple of buddies in Moscow
who would love to get you...

559
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,823
...in a tiny windowless room
for a couple hours.

560
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,580
- You came.
- Well, it wasn't cheap.

561
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,258
You know,
some might say it's tacky...

562
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:22,137
...hiring your competition to help you,
but I think it takes balls.

563
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,101
Oh, and I'll have someone
from our Burbank office...

564
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,271
...drop off your bill.
We don't have a payment plan.

565
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,318
Always a pleasure, John.

566
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,366
You guys all right?

567
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,163
Yeah. Thank you for coming.
We needed you today.

568
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,832
Yeah, of course. We're a team.

569
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,209
Hmm.

570
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:06,556
What's with all these people? My God,
do you think something's wrong?

571
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,560
Just tell me Jeff's not trying to bathe
in the washing machine again.

572
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,482
So this is more thanjust a store.
This is my second home.

573
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,318
It's the 1080p television
that I watch the big game on.

574
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,987
The waterproof radio
that I listen to in the shower.

575
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,990
It's the blender that I use
to make my protein shakes...

576
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:28,495
...that help me look like this all day.
- His eyes follow everyone in the store.

577
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,081
So, yeah,
I guess for someone like myself...

578
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:35,252
...who's a heart surgeon and a natural
athlete, why not buy from the best?

579
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,671
Why not Buy More?

580
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,554
Well, I guess we're in a better
financial situation than we thought.

581
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,181
Sneijder gave us 200 grand.

582
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,893
Yeah, well, we still owe Verbanski Corp
150,000 of that.

583
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,688
Plus, 30 grand for the repairs
on Wesley's safe house.

584
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,606
- The climbing gear.
- V-21 bolt gun.

585
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,608
Gas for the Lotus.

586
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,279
What? Okay, fine, I'll cover that.

587
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,365
Hey, it's a start,
and it's what we needed.

588
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,035
Well, it's something.

589
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,959
Hey. Ahem.

590
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,711
Chuck.

591
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,137
I feel like I should just say that, uh,
I'm sorry, you know, for what happened.

592
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,723
Buddy, me too. I'm sorry.

593
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,893
I called Casey and Sarah to protect you,
not hurt you.

594
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,064
I'm trying to be the best handler
I can be. I'm just new at this, you know?

595
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,317
Sure. I get it.

596
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,824
So I'm not gonna be a spy
for a while, right?

597
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,077
That's kind of what I'm picking up,
though. Yeah?

598
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:56,166
Look, you have all the potential
in the world. It just takes time, that's all.

599
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,419
And I promise you, I will be with you
every step of the way...

600
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,921
...until the day that you are ready.
- Hmm.

601
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,757
Yeah, I bet. I bet.

602
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,095
Someday, though.

603
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,853
Okay. I gotta get to Alex's place,
see her.

604
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:21,483
Uh, you're still in for movie-trilogy night
tomorrow, right?

605
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,069
Sure, man.

606
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,614
So Star Wars or Die Hard?

607
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,700
I don't know, dude. Uh...

608
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,827
You pick, man.

609
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,954
That's more your thing.

610
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,628
Intersect's going to his head, isn't it?

611
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:49,219
Yeah, uh, maybe. I don't... He certainly
doesn't seem like himself lately.

612
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,098
Today on the mission, it's like he
had never even heard of Indiana Jones.

613
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,142
And just now with trilogy night...

614
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,646
Ugh, I don't know,
maybe he's just distracted.

615
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,982
Grimes better get his head on straight.

616
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,985
And soon.

617
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,496
- Ah.
- No, don't stop.

618
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,164
It'll just get harder if you stop.

619
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,500
Thought you'd still be in bed.
It's so early.

620
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,585
No. No. Come on, I'm used to this.

621
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:27,006
Us spies without the Intersect
have to find time to exercise.

622
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:33,263
Hey, hey, hey. So, uh, quick question
since you're here, heh.

623
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,269
Did you ask me to be Morgan's handler
because you were trying to handle me?

624
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:43,523
If you don't think I should be in the field,
I just need to know that.

625
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,527
No, I asked you because the job entails
bringing out the best in somebody...

626
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,280
...and what better example for Morgan
than you?

627
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,574
So, no, I'm not handling you.

628
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,909
A, because you don't need a handler
anymore...

629
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,204
...and B,
because handlers can't do this.

630
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,749
Okay? Come on. Let's go.

631
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,711
That's not fair. That's not fair.
You can't just take off.

632
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,045
Oh, yes, I can.

633
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,551
Hello, Gertrude.

634
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,595
It's Colonel John Casey.

635
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,474
I'd like to have a meal with you.

636
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,310
My treat.

637
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,398
That was good.

638
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,734
That'll work.

639
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,575
Hello?

640
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,291
Hello?

641
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,588
I'm sorry about that.

642
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:52,759
So I assume you're here
about the job opening.

643
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,512
Let me assure you
that I am more than ready.

644
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,263
See, uh...

645
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,519
...I have something I can offer you
no one else can.

646
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,814
The Intersect.

647
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,109
Really?

648
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,112
I've heard about that.

649
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,948
I wasn't sure it really existed.

650
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,285
Oh, ahem, believe me, it exists.

651
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:25,959
Well, I was wondering who the real
Luke Skywalker was on your team.

652
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,961
It's good to finally know.

653
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,170
I'll bet it is.

654
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,006
One question, though.

655
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,387
Who's Luke Skywalker?
