1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,253
I'm Chuck.
Here are things you need to know.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:08,674
I've had a suspicion that something's
happening behind the scenes here.

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,926
I knew it. We were right.

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,887
X-13 gas. Short-term memory eraser.

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,347
They'll forget the last 24 hours.

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,182
Lester, something really weird is up.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,935
I remember something going on
underneath the Buy More.

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,729
Nice to meet you. I'm Nicholas Quinn.

9
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,397
I'm about to become the Intersect.

10
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,941
I have your husband. Bring the Intersect...

11
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,484
...to the San Pedro docks, Pier 23.

12
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,653
- It was a trap.
- We gotta get out of here.

13
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,615
Walker, no! Don't do it.

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,681
So we're taking the bullet train, huh?

15
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,309
You nailed it, genius.

16
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,149
The Tokaido Shinkansen...

17
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,692
...will be departing in 10 minutes.

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,780
So Nagoya, Osaka or Kyoto, Quinn?
What's the lucky city?

19
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,281
The location's a secret.

20
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:18,035
Naturally. I still don't know
what you expect from me. I told you...

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,288
You didn't know how to fix the Intersect.
Yes, you mentioned that.

22
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,415
Maybe you failed in the past...

23
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,251
...because you didn't have my servers
or my technicians...

24
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,130
...or maybe you weren't
properly incentivized.

25
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,633
What's that supposed to mean?

26
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:36,053
You didn't have a gun to your head.
But you will this time.

27
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,388
Without the Intersect,
I have nothing to fix.

28
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:42,476
Walker and Casey just delivered
the Intersect glasses to my men.

29
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,395
They're en route to my base.

30
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:52,861
You've had your time, Bartowski.
Now it's my time.

31
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,740
And don't think
that you're gonna get rescued.

32
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,244
There's a second part
to that communication. It's bad news.

33
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,745
Your friends are dead.

34
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,648
Train rolls out in seven minutes.
We are right on time.

35
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,442
Everything goes smooth
when you've got the Intersect.

36
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,819
To a point.

37
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,821
We took out Quinn's henchman
in a snap.

38
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,199
And I flashed on the computer
and sent out those phony communiqués.

39
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,952
It is useful. You're awfully good at it.

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,079
Thought how Chuck's gonna
take the news?

41
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,915
I will find the right time.
When we get off this train...

42
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,919
...the Intersect in my head
is gonna be suppressed, so he'll be fine.

43
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,256
One last thing, just for grins.

44
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,466
Name, rank and serial number.

45
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,136
Oh, come on,
I've had this in my head for three days.

46
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,555
It took Morgan a month
to start losing his memory.

47
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,224
I think I have some time.
Now, let's move, Frank.

48
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,188
Relax, Casey. I'm kidding.

49
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,107
It also took Morgan a month to be a jerk.

50
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,735
I don't mean to be a jerk,
but I should be in Tokyo...

51
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,571
...with Sarah and Casey,
not stuck here like some lab rat.

52
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,365
Tough. Sarah has the same version
of the Intersect...

53
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,367
...that made you deteriorate socially.

54
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,996
As in, breaking up with me
via text message.

55
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,957
- Which made us stronger.
- So we're trying to be proactive.

56
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,167
Determine the cause.

57
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,878
We gotta poke around in your prefrontal
and temporal lobes.

58
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,798
Mm-hm. I should be out there in the action.
I got this mission, man. Just...

59
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,301
By helping me,
you are helping the mission, okay?

60
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,637
If we figure this out,
we can help save Sarah...

61
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,639
...from the deleterious side effects.

62
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,933
That's a good point. Okay, you're right.

63
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,101
What does "deleterious" mean?

64
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,687
Could be worse than we thought.

65
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:54,274
Morgan's vocabulary never expanded
beyond cereal boxes and comic books.

66
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,861
I'll have you know there are puzzles
on them that can be challenging.

67
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,821
Morgan, you're gonna get through this.

68
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,700
I know. It's just, I'm a trained spy now.
I should be out there with my team.

69
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,954
- Hold still, Morgan.
- I'm a weapon. Hey, now! Oh, that hurts.

70
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,790
- That's hurt-y.
- My hero.

71
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,631
The train will be departing in two minutes.

72
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,655
Hey.

73
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,241
Hey. Hey, guys.

74
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,370
It was stuffy in here, you know,
so I thought I'd open the window...

75
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,539
...and then thought maybe I'd escape.

76
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,667
Your tricky little ring?
Say goodbye to it.

77
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,210
You don't wanna do that.

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,716
Sarah, thank God. I knew you weren't dead.
How'd you get here?

79
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,634
I'll tell you as soon as we're safe.

80
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,643
Hey-oh.

81
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,786
That was some major
ass whupping, honey.

82
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,248
- What? Have you been taking Strip Kick?
- I did upgrade my technique.

83
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,250
We'll talk about that later.

84
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,425
Gotta get out of here. Let's go.

85
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,302
The train is now departing.

86
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,720
How you doing with the door?

87
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,806
- First stop, Yamashiro Station.
- It's sealed.

88
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,101
I'm working on an override.
We may have missed our window though.

89
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,646
Don't worry, when I get there
I'll just have to, uh, figure something out.

90
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,482
We'll figure it out. We always do.

91
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,779
We're out of luck on the door.
It won't let me override.

92
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,657
Let me take a stab at it.

93
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:14,790
Well, it looks like somebody
sent me false messages.

94
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,419
I don't know how you did it,
but, uh, I'll applaud later.

95
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,004
Meanwhile, nobody moves.

96
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,430
You don't wanna do that.
I know more than you think.

97
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,102
You got out, can he?

98
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,063
We put digital locks in.
He'll never figure out the combo.

99
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,566
There's a coupling under the train
that connects to an exhaust intake.

100
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,820
I remember that from a schematic
that I flashed on.

101
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,240
- If we get down, maybe we can jump up.
- Easy for you to say, Walker.

102
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,787
Looks like Bartowski and I are stuck
on this bucket till Yamashiro Station.

103
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,167
I'm sorry, did you just say "flashed"?

104
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,503
- As in?
- Shh.

105
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,218
Uh, Chuck, honey...

106
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,594
I, uh...

107
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,973
I have the Intersect.

108
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,770
Surprise.

109
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,857
Okay. So, Sarah, explain to me please...

110
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,319
...uh, when, how and why
you downloaded the you-know-what?

111
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,821
Okay, we'll talk about it in a minute,
I promise.

112
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,866
Train lands at Yamashiro
in about an hour and a half.

113
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,119
- Until then, we're stuck.
- I'll have Beckman meet us with CIA...

114
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,872
...and Japanese Intelligence
to take control of Quinn.

115
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,750
I'll ask her to bring
the suppression device.

116
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,420
Chuck, does Quinn have any other men
with him on this train?

117
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,674
Wait, you wouldn't have downloaded
the same version...

118
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,885
...of the
That Morgan had, would you?

119
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,639
Okay, I did, yes, but we will talk about it
in two seconds, okay?

120
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,517
We'll need to lay low.
Keep guard. I'll take first watch.

121
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,894
You two pretend to be gaijin tourists.

122
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,646
Let's go.

123
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,778
Now that we have that covered,
there's a few bullet points regarding...

124
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,198
...what the hell is going on.
That computer erased Morgan's memory.

125
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,912
Morgan, you're helping the mission.
Just keep telling yourself that.

126
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,165
Yeah, I know. I just... I don't know, man.

127
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,709
No matter how much
they poke around in my skull...

128
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,088
...and look around in there,
they're not gonna find anything.

129
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,090
- Okay, ha, ha.
- Come on.

130
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,968
- Yeah, I know.
- Looks pretty normal.

131
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,137
There's no evident long-term effects
from having the Intersect.

132
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:20,517
I don't know what caused the memory loss
and why it triggered after a month?

133
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,020
Between him getting the Intersect
and his amnesia, what happened?

134
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:29,818
Castle was renovated, retooled.
Carmichael Industries was formed.

135
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,196
- They started going on missions.
- Anything different on missions?

136
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,615
Uh, I started wearing tight slacks.

137
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,784
Any head trauma, concussions?

138
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,037
No. Nobody would even get close to me.
I would flash and then, bam...

139
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,373
...I dropped those baddies
like they were hot.

140
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,126
- Were you flashing before missions?
- Didn't have to.

141
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,545
In the field,
I was busting out the Intersect.

142
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,881
- That's when you became a douche.
- Would you say "douche"? Seems like...

143
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,301
Maybe there's a correlation
between number of flashes...

144
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,178
- And brain deterioration.
- Brilliant. Can I go to Japan?

145
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,849
No, no, no. This is just a hypothesis.
We have more work to do.

146
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,726
Course you do.

147
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,270
Morgan, what's gonna make you
feel better? Pizza?

148
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,981
- Well, I don't know.
- Combos?

149
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,734
You know me so well.

150
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,322
Pizza Combos.
That's my favorite growing up. Heh.

151
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,198
Pizza Combos.

152
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,201
We were surrounded.
And so there really was no choice.

153
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,954
No, no, of course. I get it.

154
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,165
It's just,
with what Morgan went through...

155
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,417
Ellie's working to head off complications.

156
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,630
And this will be gone in an hour and a half.
I promise.

157
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,927
Okay, I guess
we'll just chill then, huh?

158
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,737
- It's the coolest thing, isn't it?
- The coolest.

159
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,365
- Do any parkour?
- Off a bridge, onto a moving truck...

160
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,659
...onto a car
going the opposite direction.

161
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,827
- Oh, awesome.
- I've been a spy for so long...

162
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,456
...and I've never felt this powerful
in my entire life. It's incredible.

163
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,543
Are you ready to say goodbye to all of it?

164
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,338
The guns, the bullets, the parkour?

165
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,174
I don't wanna live my life
in danger anymore.

166
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,843
I'm ready to retire and start a family.

167
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,431
Our future is exciting enough.

168
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,141
Hmm.

169
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:30,271
You know, uh, we still have a good bit
of time before we get to Yamashiro.

170
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,275
And starting a family's not something
you can just, you know, jump right into.

171
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,903
Yeah, no, uh, we need some practice.

172
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,490
Lots and lots of practice.

173
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,244
Allow me to set the mood, my lady.

174
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,371
We...

175
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,834
I have no idea what any of this means.
Is that a chicken?

176
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,628
Does a chicken come out
when you hit the button?

177
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,138
Mm.

178
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,974
Hey. Well done.

179
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,439
Domo arigato, Mrs. Bartowski.

180
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,324
- Who the hell are you?
- Hey, great. We're with the Flu Bus.

181
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,327
- Did you get your flu shot?
- I do not believe in shots.

182
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,706
- Who authorized this?
- Morgan Grimes.

183
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,752
Nobody tells nobody nothing.

184
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,131
Aw, hell, no. This place will not fall to seed
on my watch.

185
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,343
We have a lot of expensive
new inventory here. You will not destroy it.

186
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,137
It's for selling microwaves.

187
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,973
Not for exploding eggs, avocados,
Christmas ornaments...

188
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,852
...fluorescent light tubes,
bars of oatmeal soap, or a football.

189
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,438
- Fine. Be lame.
- Son, have you considered...

190
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,316
...maybe it's time for you to grow up,
like Jeffrey?

191
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,026
Thank you.

192
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,696
Is it really your destiny
to be a complete moron?

193
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,160
- Ah! Oh, Lord.
- I overheard what Big Mike said.

194
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,704
- And I hope it sank in.
- It did not. Leave me be.

195
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,333
Jeffrey, stop it.
I do not want to discuss this topic again.

196
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,419
What are you so afraid of, Lester?
Maybe this is our destiny.

197
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,046
But they're just dreams, man.

198
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,216
How can they be dreams
if we're both having the same dream?

199
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,301
The fallen snow, a different Buy More?

200
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,303
It's like someone wiped our memories.

201
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,055
I know. It's true. It's just...

202
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,349
- It scares me.
- We can't be scared.

203
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,894
We have to figure out who would wanna
scour our minds and why.

204
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,440
I think better
when I'm blowing up avocados.

205
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,235
There are mysterious happenings
around here.

206
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,237
We can't ignore them anymore.

207
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,990
Hey.

208
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,210
- Had your flu shot?
- Uh, yeah. Thanks.

209
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,713
How about you get another
or I will kill you right here?

210
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,924
Don't make a sound.

211
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,098
- Did you see that?
- In my previous state of impairment...

212
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,102
...I wouldn't have cared or noticed
that Grimes' woman... Forgive me, not PC.

213
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,897
Grimes' significant other
was just taken at gunpoint.

214
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:22,694
The newly unimpaired you
is a master of the obvious.

215
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,945
This is the call.

216
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:28,324
We'll find the truth,
even if we have to face mortal danger.

217
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,285
Okay.

218
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,750
Cherry blossoms.

219
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,711
Colonel, would you mind...

220
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,129
...opening the lid for a moment?

221
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,131
I'd like to discuss something with you.

222
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,216
Not interested.

223
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,927
You can keep your gun on me.
I won't try to escape.

224
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:52,056
In fact, there won't be any need to.

225
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,685
Your daughter's name is Alex McHugh,
correct?

226
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:02,275
If you want her to live,
do exactly as I say.

227
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,655
Dad? I'm okay, but they have guns.

228
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,872
And now the picket fence.

229
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,709
See, I haven't forgotten anything.

230
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,920
Mm-hm.

231
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:28,426
And perhaps... this little man.

232
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,889
- Or woman.
- Heh.

233
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,187
Someday.

234
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,449
It's a text from Casey. He needs a break.

235
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,370
This is gonna be so good.

236
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,763
Hey, Casey, what is going on?
Where's Quinn?

237
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:20,269
His men have Alex.
I'm gonna need you to follow me.

238
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,732
Sorry. I have no choice.

239
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,368
I'm gonna need you two
to follow me now. Come on.

240
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,246
Do what I say and no one gets hurt.

241
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,957
Do what I say and nobody gets hurt.

242
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:46,879
If you fight or try to run, my sweet little
daughter gets her head blown off.

243
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,799
And really sell that one, colonel.

244
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:57,765
If you fight, or try to run,
Alex gets her head blown off.

245
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,689
Now move to the control panel
and shut down the dining car.

246
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,441
I want some privacy.

247
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,569
Go to the control panel, Chuck.
Open it.

248
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,696
- Move.
- Okay.

249
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,452
Shut down the dining car.
Upper left. Hit it.

250
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,296
The dining car is closed until further notice.

251
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,714
Is Quinn on comms?

252
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:37,055
Inn-quay s-ai on-way um-scay.

253
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,557
Enough of the Kabuki.

254
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,393
- Move it out.
- Let's go.

255
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:54,489
Chuck. Text Morgan.
Tell him to get Alex to safety. Do it.

256
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,789
"Alex in danger.
Get her to Castle, ASAP."

257
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,750
What is...? No. She's all good, guys.
She's with us.

258
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,001
No, she's not.

259
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,713
She went up to Buy More
for Pizza Combos. She should be back.

260
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,841
Wait a minute. Hold on a second.
What are you...?

261
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,430
She's not in the Buy More.

262
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,606
Okay, we got a situation here.

263
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,741
- I don't know what you want from me.
- I want you to shut up.

264
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,495
- Ron, what the hell is the holdup?
- I don't know. It just won't start.

265
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,998
We can't exactly call for a tow.
So we'll wait for instructions.

266
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,626
If the order comes to kill her,
we do it here.

267
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,089
I'm not walking across this parking lot
with a gun in her ribs.

268
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,430
- Exactly what did you do?
- Sugared their gas tank.

269
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:08,396
It's an oldie, but a goodie.
Man, I haven't sugged a tank in days.

270
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,400
Anyway, now that they are incapacitated
in a mobile sense, we need a plan.

271
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:17,155
It should be keen and clever.
Utilizing our unique talents.

272
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,532
Do we have any of those?

273
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,953
I think you are uniquely wasteful
and destructive.

274
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,915
- Let's build on that.
- Yeah.

275
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,672
- Think Casey has a plan?
- He's not letting on.

276
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,841
We don't know
what's around that corner.

277
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,011
- But we can handle it, right?
- Of course. It's just...

278
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,930
The end is so near, you can taste it?

279
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,227
I want that house
and dog and baby, Sarah.

280
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,229
Me too.

281
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,441
Okay, let's wrap this up,
take out Quinn and save Alex.

282
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,318
Save the day.

283
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,446
Quinn says stop whispering
like fourth graders.

284
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,836
Uh, tea? No?

285
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,631
I'll get to the point.

286
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,053
I want my Intersect technology
and someone has stolen it.

287
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,972
Release Casey's daughter
and we'll give you the glasses.

288
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,603
You mean these?
I had the colonel fetch them.

289
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,022
Worthless.

290
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:39,862
But then again, you know that,
because one of you has the Intersect.

291
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,116
Then you know you're outmanned.
Casey's not gonna fire at us.

292
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,409
He may.

293
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:50,373
If I don't call my men on the half-hour...

294
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,834
...his little girl gets sprayed with bullets.

295
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,170
That half-hour's up
in two minutes, Quinn.

296
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,755
I brought them here. Make the call.

297
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,438
I have something I wanna say first.
You're gonna help me.

298
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,026
A pristine version of the Intersect
is available.

299
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,820
It's in a government facility.

300
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,282
You're gonna find it
and download it onto these glasses.

301
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,535
Time's up, Quinn.
Call your men off my daughter.

302
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,371
Do it.

303
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:40,423
Hey, it's Quinn. Uh, yeah,
the little lady gets another half-hour.

304
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:47,346
That's all I need. Half hour's an eternity.
I'll come up with some way to save her.

305
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,889
Ooh.

306
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,035
Walker, pull up.

307
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,662
Sarah, we might need
to trade him for Alex.

308
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,080
No!

309
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,213
Maybe he hit the station
you were talking about.

310
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,716
I don't know what happened.
I couldn't stop.

311
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,801
Oh! God!

312
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,637
Sarah. Sarah, get up.

313
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,520
I didn't know what happened.

314
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:41,192
I wanted it to stop and I couldn't.
I just kept flashing.

315
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,027
God, I screwed up so bad.

316
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,821
No, no, no.
Hey, this is not your fault, okay?

317
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,991
Look, Casey is working on a plan
with Morgan as we speak.

318
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,619
Ellie's working on the Intersect.

319
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,830
I didn't wanna flash a second time,
Chuck. I... Ugh.

320
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,916
I don't have control of it anymore.

321
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,882
- Sis, talk to me.
- The amount that Sarah's been flashing...

322
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,968
...is compromising her motor control,
causing the migraine...

323
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,597
...which could be cranial pressure,
so we don't want it exacerbated.

324
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,475
- That caused Morgan's memory loss?
- I'm pretty certain.

325
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:18,562
He flashed for a month. When he started
going on missions, the numbers jumped.

326
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,107
How many times
before he started feeling effects?

327
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:25,319
Well, he didn't have a specific amount.
A few times a day. What about Sarah?

328
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,030
Baby, how many times
have you flashed?

329
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,034
Forty times.

330
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,161
In two days?

331
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,622
That intensity level...

332
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,458
...in such a short period
has to be the cause.

333
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,461
Okay, okay, the fix for now,
until she can stop flashing...

334
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,505
...she has to get to me or Beckman...

335
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,715
...suppress the Intersect, get her an MRI.

336
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:50,052
Listen, Ellie, Sarah said that
she can't control when she flashes.

337
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,139
Okay, that's a problem. We have to think.

338
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,559
Think, Morgan. Can you sneak up
on the Flu Bus without being seen?

339
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,604
Casey, listen. We're coming at this blind.
We don't know what they got weapon-wise.

340
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,731
You sure you don't wanna call
in the CIA?

341
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,525
There's no time.

342
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,194
I have an idea.

343
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,406
Devon's gonna be the magnet.
Morgan, you're gonna pick a fight.

344
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,782
A firefight.

345
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,868
A firefight?

346
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,328
First thing you have to do
is blindfold Sarah.

347
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:20,749
She can't react to what she can't see.
Chuck, I think that there might be a way...

348
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,878
...for you to build a suppression device.
It's a long shot.

349
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,588
I'm in the mood for a long shot.

350
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,548
Beckman delivered the suppressor.

351
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,759
Maybe I can download it, e-mail it to you.

352
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,846
If I did, could you build something
and deliver it to Sarah?

353
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,306
Not exactly.

354
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,558
Well, what if one last time I just flashed...

355
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,103
No way. Absolutely not.
What if that's the one that kills you?

356
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,398
All I need is a laptop, a PSP
and some virtual reality glasses.

357
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,735
If I was in a Buy More,
I'd have it all in 10 seconds.

358
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,281
We have something better.
We have a train full of Japanese people.

359
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,783
Quinn's thugs are expecting
a call in 19 minutes.

360
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,954
It doesn't come, they're gonna kill Alex.
You are not gonna let that happen. Clear?

361
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,832
Crystal. I will not let my last words
to Alex...

362
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,251
...be a demand for Pizza Combos.

363
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,753
Go to my Crown Vic.

364
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,193
Devon. Dev...

365
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,379
Wow. Casey rolls strong.
Like, raring-for-the-Apocalypse strong.

366
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,256
The case in front of you, open it.

367
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,217
Put in the comm device,
sync it to my phone. Do it.

368
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,846
- We're hot.
- I'm gonna talk you through this.

369
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,475
Grab a rifle,
the Sig and a survival knife.

370
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,395
Leave the heavy stuff.
You'll just blow yourself up.

371
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,363
Just a few more minutes
and everything's gonna be good.

372
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,824
Hang in there.

373
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,993
All right, Chuck...

374
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,288
...I'm gonna start sending the file,
as soon as it's complete...

375
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,040
...put the glasses on Sarah.
It should run right away.

376
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,335
It's coming in strong, EI.
You're gonna be all right, Sarah.

377
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,176
Chuck, I didn't wanna say
anything before...

378
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,681
...but this whole time we've been talking
about Alex and how she's in danger?

379
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,100
Yeah? Why?

380
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,978
I don't, um...

381
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,355
I don't remember anybody named Alex.

382
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,621
But you remember this?

383
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,585
Yeah. I wouldn't forget that.

384
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,171
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

385
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,884
Of course it is. It's gonna be fine, Sarah.
You're gonna be fine.

386
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,305
Casey, we are ready to roll.

387
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:30,522
Okay, Morgan, listen up. You find cover
20 meters from the target. Got it?

388
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,941
I see a Civic
that might serve our purpose.

389
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,985
Which is what, exactly?

390
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,280
Devon's gonna call them out.
You're gonna do some sniper work.

391
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,948
Some wet work. Got it?

392
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:44,787
Just so you know,
I've never sniped in my life, wet or dry.

393
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,705
Remember, you're sniping for Alex.

394
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,335
For Alex. I'll snipe for Alex.
Yeah, you got it.

395
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,586
- You ready?
- Hell, yeah.

396
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,590
Sensing some wind kicking up here.
Probably have to overcompensate.

397
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,718
Probably about 30 degree...
Don't nudge a guy when he's sniping.

398
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,139
- Oh, man.
- I can't believe we're this terrible.

399
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,725
- Yeah, you are. Hand over the rifle.
- Morgan?

400
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,060
- Let's go.
- Morgan?

401
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,104
I'm not your little sister.

402
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,064
Morgan?

403
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,775
Morgan, what the hell's happening?

404
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,069
Morgan!

405
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,656
- Morgan?
- Hello?

406
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,075
Who the hell is this?

407
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,412
I might ask you the same question,
little earling.

408
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,247
Lester? Lester Patel?

409
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,003
Maybe?

410
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,216
Morgan was taken.

411
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,511
Jeff and Lester are my only option.

412
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,932
This sounds crazy but
I've worked with those guys for years.

413
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,394
They may seem like botulism victims
but they're loyal.

414
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,603
They can do it.

415
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,985
Lester, I'm gonna tell you something
I never dreamed I'd tell you.

416
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,530
Never dreamed I'd have to tell you.
But the situation is extreme.

417
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,200
This is Colonel John Casey
of the National Security Agency.

418
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,203
That is funny. There's a John Casey
who works at Buy More.

419
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:12,249
That's me, you idiot. I'm NSA.
Sarah Walker, Chuck, they're CIA.

420
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,959
They are so not.

421
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,086
They are "so" so, you colossal dope.

422
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,508
Now, I need you, my daughter needs you,
and your country needs you.

423
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,929
Canada?

424
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:31,602
Patel, listen up. You do what I tell you,
I'll make you a hero.

425
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,522
It's the call.

426
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,858
Go to my Crown Vic.

427
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,238
Each of you grab a pistol.

428
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,032
Leave the big stuff.

429
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,543
Hang in there, okay?

430
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:30,744
- The call never came from Quinn.
- We'll kill them all and leave the bus.

431
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,707
- Her first.
- Don't you touch her.

432
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,917
Or what?

433
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,127
Attention, Flu Bus.

434
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,713
We have tapped into
your internal public address.

435
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,968
We are armed and dangerous
and suggest you surrender immediately.

436
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,761
- Over.
- Who the hell is that?

437
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,598
I have no idea. But somebody's
getting ready to lose a limb.

438
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,600
We appreciate that you, too, are armed...

439
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,603
...but we have heat-vision
infrared scopes...

440
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,481
...laser guidance system,
and armor-piercing bullets.

441
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,234
- Over.
- I think this is where we should get down.

442
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,111
Nobody has all that. It's a bluff.

443
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:29,553
You're outgunned, outmanned, outside.

444
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,513
And it's a lovely day.

445
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,850
So throw down your gun
and nobody gets hurt.

446
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,562
You should be worried
about getting hurt.

447
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,564
Ah.

448
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,908
Behold the flames of destiny. Ha, ha.

449
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,167
What he said.

450
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,844
Boys, we cannot thank you enough.

451
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,805
- How do we begin to even repay you?
- There is a way.

452
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,184
Honesty.

453
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:23,357
We know that there is something going on.
Something spy-ish.

454
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,485
We need the truth at this point. Come on.

455
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,531
Yeah, you do. Gentlemen, follow me.

456
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,284
Dad, don't worry. I'm fine. I promise.

457
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,120
Morgan and Devon were great but...

458
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,914
This is so cool.

459
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,167
...those guys you talk about,
the ones that give you nightmares?

460
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,127
- Jeff and Lester?
- Eh.

461
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,296
Yeah, they were the real heroes.

462
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,883
- It's a miracle.
- Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey.

463
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,844
- Yeah. No. No. No.
- No, but look. I got the whole thing on.

464
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,137
Dangerous. No.

465
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,598
When are you coming back?

466
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,266
We're on our way.

467
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,561
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Problem-o.

468
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,607
Alex, I'm gonna call you back.
So glad you're safe.

469
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,610
Internet went down.

470
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:12,114
If there's one thing I know,
it's how to fix an Internet connection.

471
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,701
The control panel is between the
last passenger car and the dining car.

472
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,661
I remember that from my prep flash.

473
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,621
Easy peasy.

474
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,249
Keep your guard up.

475
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,102
It's been tampered with.

476
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,354
This is not good.

477
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,903
No, hey, uh, hey.
I'm Burbank Buy More, so I know...

478
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,795
A little warning,
the only thing I can't beat down...

479
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:12,299
...is the Intersect itself,
but I've studied the program obsessively.

480
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,676
I've done a little training myself,
so let's rumble.

481
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,227
I can hear you pacing.

482
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,397
Bartowski's really taking his time.

483
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,149
What are you thinking?

484
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,697
Nothing. He's probably just goofing off.

485
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,033
You check on him or I will.

486
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,703
I'm going.

487
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,981
Freeze! Now!

488
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,484
Put it down, Quinn.

489
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,362
Down.

490
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:25,122
Two on one? That's not fair.
How do I even things out?

491
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,249
- You move, he dies.
- Aah.

492
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,960
Just let him go, okay?
It's over. You're on a train.

493
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,755
- Where are you gonna run to?
- I'll figure something out.

494
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,091
It was never meant to be like this,
Bartowski.

495
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,093
You weren't meant to get involved.

496
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:43,306
And until that Intersect is mine,
this is never going to end. Ever.

497
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,643
- Come on.
- What's happening?

498
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,563
We're searching the train for Quinn.

499
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,699
He's heading towards the baggage car.

500
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,076
Sarah, stay put.

501
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,248
Step away from the console, Quinn.

502
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,879
No. Sarah.

503
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,173
Focus on your fighting abilities, okay?

504
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,425
Keep your emotions even. Do not flash.

505
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,552
I'll try, Chuck.

506
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,223
You won't survive this one, Quinn.

507
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,185
This is over. For good.

508
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,525
Sarah!

509
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,736
Is it?

510
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,198
No! No! Unh!

511
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,076
Maybe not over quite yet.

512
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,207
Open the door, baby.
See if you can open the door.

513
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,336
No! Sarah!

514
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,010
Sarah!

515
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,688
No! No! Stop!

516
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,234
No! Sarah!

517
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,903
Sarah.

518
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,623
Please.

519
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,429
You're up. Good. Let's get started.

520
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,684
- Quinn, this isn't just gonna end...
- Shh. Don't.

521
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,019
This is going my way from now on.

522
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,772
No more screw-ups, no more left turns.

523
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,942
The Intersect in your head is rotten.

524
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,028
We're going to remove it
with a suppression device.

525
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,739
Then I'm sending you on a mission...

526
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,867
...to retrieve a pristine version
of the program.

527
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,787
- I'm not working for you.
- You are.

528
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,665
Until I get what I want, you're my soldier.

529
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,750
Now...

530
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,004
...I know you lose memories
when you flash.

531
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,756
These, for want of a better term,
are flash cards.

532
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,050
They may look like random images...

533
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:27,470
...to someone who doesn't
have the Intersect, but to you...

534
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,307
...they're stimulants.

535
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,559
What are you saying?

536
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,778
Until I get what I want...

537
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,238
...you're mine.

538
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,637
Hey, bro, please,
please try to eat something, okay?

539
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,018
I'll eat when I know Sarah's all right.

540
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,230
Quinn said he needed Sarah
to steal Intersect technology...

541
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,776
...from a government facility.
I need to figure out which one.

542
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,654
I get it. I know.
Hey, it's gonna happen, Chuck.

543
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,115
All of it. I promise.

544
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,784
So close I can taste it.

545
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,371
Hey.

546
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,165
She set off her emergency beacon.
She's close.

547
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,250
What'd I tell you? See?

548
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,063
Almost there, Chuck.

549
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,649
Hang in there, Sarah.

550
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,574
Okay, guys. We got a lock on Sarah.

551
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,868
And the signal is strong.

552
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:42,397
We'll find her.

553
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:34,115
Whoa. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah. Easy, girl.

554
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,994
- Who are you?
- Nicholas Quinn, your handler.

555
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,290
We've only known each other
for the past five years.

556
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,751
I guess you're not all back yet, huh?

557
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,462
What do you mean?

558
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,341
Well, you took a nasty blow to the head.

559
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,260
A week in the hospital.
Any of that ring a bell?

560
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,388
Japan? The bullet train?

561
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,350
No? Well, doesn't matter.

562
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,269
I'll fill you in on the details...

563
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,105
...if you're fit for duty.

564
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,568
- I am.
- Good.

565
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,195
Orders are in.

566
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,077
- You recognize this face?
- Never seen him before.

567
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,746
He's the reason your last mission
went south.

568
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:27,544
- What are my orders?
- Your orders are to kill Chuck Bartowski.
