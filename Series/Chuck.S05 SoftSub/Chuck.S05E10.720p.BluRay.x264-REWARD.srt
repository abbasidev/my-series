00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,503
Hi. Here are a few things
you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,090
The Intersect made me a jerk.
Not that it was the Intersect's fault.

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,301
It brought out my inner jerk.
Don't scuff it, Cabbage Patch.

4
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,972
I am really sorry
for what I did to Alex.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,475
This whole thing has gotten me thinking
about our lives, our future.

6
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:22,187
Is the spy lifestyle really
where we wanna be raising our kids?

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,565
This is what I think our coworkers
are up to.

8
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,525
You think they're spies?

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,322
I knew it. Lester.

10
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,089
Okay.

11
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:54,511
I love this. This is the most fun you and I
have had together in quite some time.

12
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,555
- Yeah.
- We should make more time for us.

13
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,099
Anyway, I still don't get it.

14
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,478
I don't see how this is gonna make them
forget they found Castle.

15
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,397
X-13 gas. Short-term memory eraser.

16
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,316
They'll forget the last 24 hours.

17
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:11,361
Oh, right. Got you. They come to,
think they tied one on in Vegas...

18
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,197
...boom, back to normal.
- Yeah.

19
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,492
- Whatever normal was for these guys.
- Yeah. Right.

20
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,368
Pop this right here. Heh, heh. Watch this.

21
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,246
- Uh, that's not professional.
- Of course.

22
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,415
- That's good.
- Good?

23
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,305
Good morning.

24
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,017
I wanna quit spying.

25
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,564
Wow. Wow. Okay.

26
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,774
Okay. Let's talk about that.

27
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,526
Look, I've been up all night...

28
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,237
...and I've been thinking
about our futures...

29
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,031
...and, you know, maybe babies.

30
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,117
- Oof. Yeah.
- I want all of that.

31
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,618
The more I think about it...

32
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,164
...I don't know if that future
goes with the life we're living now.

33
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,499
Both of us have been captured
more than once.

34
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,543
Every day we make
a new dangerous enemy.

35
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,547
I just ran to the door with a gun because
I heard the newspaper being delivered.

36
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,716
Yeah.
Parents can't be shooting paperboy.

37
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,553
Look, I'm a spy,
and that's all I ever thought that I could be.

38
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,473
But I realized that we don't have to give up
what we've already built.

39
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,685
We can just shift
what Carmichael Industries does.

40
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,938
Okay, shift it to what?

41
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,357
Countering cyberterrorism.

42
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,943
It's your tech firm idea
but more spied up.

43
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,737
We keep your computer know-how...

44
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,866
...and mix it with my experience
in international bad guy-ery.

45
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,245
So we'd go after bad guys
who use keyboards instead of bullets.

46
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,873
Which means
we don't have to use bullets either.

47
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,460
I mean, the timing of it
does kind of feel right.

48
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,921
We've got nothing left hanging,
no new missions.

49
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,589
No wrongs to right.

50
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,759
Let's do it.

51
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,889
Now, how do we pitch the idea
to Casey?

52
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,351
Well, I love it, okay?

53
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:51,104
You know how I feel about bullets,
which is negatively. This is fantastic.

54
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,315
Where do I fit in? Am I chief Googler?

55
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,901
You'd be doing the same stuff
you already do.

56
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,363
Yeah. We're still gonna need field ops
to recover stolen systems...

57
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,449
...and breaching companies' security
to find weak spots.

58
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,576
Wouldn't it be lovely
not to get shot at?

59
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,663
- Aren't you sick of being shot at?
- Or getting shot?

60
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,498
I mean, you get shot a lot.

61
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,000
Not considering
how much I get shot at.

62
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,293
Hm.

63
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,713
Okay. Think about Alex.

64
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,966
Do you know how happy she will be...

65
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,261
...knowing that you're not out there
doing scary stuff?

66
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,559
All right, I'll think about it.

67
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,813
One thing's for sure, we go through
with this, no more Buy More.

68
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:37,025
We don't need a cover. Let's kick
the creepy cousin out of the family.

69
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,320
Wow. No more Buy More.

70
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,089
Son, this came for you.

71
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,051
- What is this?
- Boy, get your fingers out of there.

72
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,764
- Hey, how you doing, Big Mike?
- Always a beautiful day at the Buy More.

73
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,268
- You really love it here.
- Like a turkey loves Thanksgiving.

74
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,439
You might wanna rethink
that one, actually. You know?

75
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,234
- My old iPhone.
- Doesn't really seem to be your style.

76
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,155
No. This is from a few months ago.
I was kind of going through a thing.

77
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,157
- Ahh. The frosted tips phase.
- Yeah.

78
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,200
Made it real hard not to smack you.

79
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,328
Yeah. I can imagine.

80
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,539
Oh, Lord.

81
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,249
Chuck. Chuck.

82
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,794
If you're getting this,
something has gone terribly wrong.

83
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,213
I was getting my party on,
having a great time.

84
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,717
This dude comes up to me
with this pair of Intersect glasses...

85
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,802
...and he grabs me. I kicked his ass.

86
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,763
No prob, as per ushe.

87
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,931
I grabbed the glasses
and stashed them.

88
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,893
Dude, I stashed them in a vault.
But like I was saying...

89
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,771
...I have been partying my face off...

90
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,940
...so I'm a little discombobulated.
Which is an amazing word.

91
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,360
- Stop right there!
- If this guy catches me...

92
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,737
...I know that you know that you love me.

93
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,739
Tell the world of my glory.

94
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,657
But above all...

95
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,493
...you find those glasses.

96
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,703
You find the... Ahh!

97
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,582
Huh.

98
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:20,128
Morgan, what is this?
And where were you?

99
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,590
I don't know, Chuck. I don't know.

100
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,344
Between the Intersect mind melting
and copious amounts of booze...

101
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,014
...it's blank. Thank God I bought
that label maker you all made fun of...

102
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,183
...because at least I got the phone back.

103
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,436
So there's a stolen Intersect out there
somewhere.

104
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,313
Guess we're not retiring after all.

105
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,526
Well, it doesn't change the plan.
It just means we have one last mission.

106
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,777
- Why would she...?
- No.

107
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,487
- Come on, Walker.
- What?

108
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,115
Things never turn out well
when you say "one last mission."

109
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,409
Is this just because
of some stupid movie?

110
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,701
- Yes.
- Yes.

111
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,495
You never say "one last mission."

112
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,746
Never.

113
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,998
Wow, Morgan,
look at the air you got off this cliff.

114
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,835
Yeah, I was so cool back then.

115
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,838
Counterpoint: Are you wearing
a fake dreadlock ski hat?

116
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,465
Really? Is that...?

117
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,468
- Oh. Yeah, I was.
- Look at the dates on these phone calls.

118
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,053
It's when you were working
for Verbanski.

119
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,264
And look at these text messages.

120
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,267
There's a name. BD.
Does that jog your memory?

121
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,728
Negative. No. What does BD say?

122
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,272
"Where'd you go?"

123
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,067
Send BD a message. If they were with
you the night you found the glasses...

124
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,737
...then maybe we can get a clue.
- Okay.

125
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:13,867
Uh... Sorry, disappeared.

126
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,327
What's up?

127
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,038
No.
I was a little more douchey than that.

128
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,999
- "Wassup?" With a bunch of S's?
- Sure.

129
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,295
And in the meantime, let's try and find
a way to help you remember something.

130
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,924
What is it exactly you two think
I do for a living?

131
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,759
Brain science.

132
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,471
Didn't you learn how to hypnotize
people? To get at lost memories?

133
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,849
Yeah, in psychotherapy class.
But that was years ago.

134
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,148
Fine. Okay.

135
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

136
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,902
Okay. I really hope this works.

137
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,364
I'm a little skeptical. I don't think
this brain can be hypnotized.

138
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,615
It's like a fortress.

139
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,537
So focus, look at the pen.

140
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,914
- Deep breaths.
- Mm-hm.

141
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,291
Breathe.

142
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,311
Ow.

143
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:34,030
Sweet mother of all that is holy. Ow.

144
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,908
Ow.

145
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,244
Dude, what happened? Where are we?

146
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,788
I don't...

147
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,124
- I don't know.
- You're wearing a Vegas hat.

148
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,835
We must have gone to Vegas.
And stole a car.

149
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,380
We must have just partied too hard,
and now... Ow.

150
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,633
A woman gave us her underpants?

151
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,970
Breathe on me.

152
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,975
There's no alcohol on your breath.
Just gefilte fish curry, like always.

153
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,310
Really?

154
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,353
Lester, something really weird is up.

155
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,397
Yeah, last thing I remember...

156
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,275
...is there's something going on
underneath the Buy More.

157
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,485
Right, with Bartowski,
Grimes, Casey...

158
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,987
...and that whore-y blonde.

159
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,573
- We've gotta get to the bottom of this.
- Right.

160
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,410
We're gonna do that by sticking to
those fools like the stank on my breath.

161
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,621
Now, to the Buy More.

162
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,458
Careful.

163
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,388
Light traffic day.

164
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,640
Yeah.

165
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,392
Morgan might really be hypnotized
in there.

166
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,104
Great. Hey, look, I've been looking
at some new possible office spaces.

167
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,940
Aboveground.
We could have windows.

168
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,609
If we ever get there.

169
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,985
What do you mean?

170
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,697
It seems like no matter what,
the Intersect keeps finding me.

171
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,491
I keep trying to break free...

172
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,786
...and the very thing that started this
keeps hooking us back in.

173
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,039
We're gonna finish this,
and we're gonna move on, I promise.

174
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,002
Hey, Casey, you wanna see
your new office space?

175
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,754
No, because we ain't out yet.

176
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:18,468
Even if it belonged to a little someone
named Ronald Wilson Reagan?

177
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,512
Seriously?

178
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,763
The Gipper?

179
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,141
Hey, guys, I got something.

180
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,603
Morgan keeps repeating the phrases
"emerald and gold" and number 10.

181
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,106
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

182
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:35,402
I tried to push him a little further,
but I think I got a little too aggressive.

183
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,654
You are so hot.

184
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,155
You're so hot.

185
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,450
If you went to prom with me,
I would be the stoked-est guy.

186
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,577
I think I took him back too far.

187
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,954
It's possible.

188
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:50,041
Okay, Morgan, let's undo this.
Look at the pen.

189
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,337
I don't know how to look at anything
but you.

190
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,588
You're so beautiful.

191
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,138
Wow. Hey, I didn't say anything stupid
while I was under, did I?

192
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:07,016
Heh, heh. No. No, no, no.
You get a return text yet?

193
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,644
No, nothing.

194
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,688
Are you the manager?

195
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,356
I wanna return this blender.

196
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,984
I'll take care of that for you.
You have a receipt?

197
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,861
Yeah, let me check.

198
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,696
Are you in a serious relationship?

199
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,117
- Excuse me?
- I just wanna know...

200
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,995
...if you're in a serious relationship
right now.

201
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,831
- I'll call you back.
- Uh...

202
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,458
I actually am.

203
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,710
- Back to the blender.
- Do you love her?

204
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,129
Personal question
for a blender return.

205
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:41,593
Dale, I told you to stop bothering me.
Morgan, I am so, so sorry.

206
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,056
Yeah. No, sure. Who's Dale?

207
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,977
He's just a guy I went out
with a few times when we broke up.

208
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,771
He's nobody, really.

209
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,230
What? Nobody?

210
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,776
Oh, so I guess it was nobody that...
Wait... How did you put it?

211
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,028
"Filled your body with rainbows"?

212
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,490
Oh. Tell me he's talking
about finger painting.

213
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:07,786
- I don't understand how that works.
- Morgan, there's nothing between us.

214
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,790
I was just hurt, and I was missing you,
and so I acted out a little.

215
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,041
Physically.

216
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,877
You acted out? Physically?

217
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,378
I think I'm gonna be sick.

218
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,632
There were rainbows.

219
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,676
I love him, Dale.
So just stop coming here.

220
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,304
We got a text.

221
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,932
Thank God.

222
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,312
Let's talk later, you and I, okay?
Just...

223
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,522
Any news?

224
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,981
- Dale.
- Hey, John.

225
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,736
What? You're the one that pulled
the text message breakup.

226
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,781
Alex, always great to see you.

227
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,076
Dale, store credit only.

228
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,661
Oh.

229
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,122
- We never hugged. Sorry.
- Are you kidding?

230
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,085
Where are they?
We lost them. We lost them.

231
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,711
She acted out physically?

232
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,506
Morgan, I know this is hard,
but you did dump her.

233
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,800
- Via text.
- I know, the whole text thing.

234
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,802
I know I shouldn't be mad, but I am.

235
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,847
You wanna know why?
Because I was true blue, baby.

236
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,517
While she was gallivanting all over
town spreading her filthy rainbows...

237
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,020
...to every Tom, Dick and Harry,
I stayed strong, dude. You know what?

238
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,731
I need to know every detail.
I gotta find out.

239
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,191
I know you're upset...

240
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,988
...but I don't think
knowing all the gory rainbowed details...

241
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,240
...is gonna make you feel better
about it.

242
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,200
Rainbows.

243
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,204
Guys, look. There's a Golden Peak
Resort in Vail, Colorado.

244
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,459
And look here. It's a Michael Carmichael
registered the night in question.

245
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,628
Hey. Looks like that's our ski town.

246
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,922
All right, kids, let's pack up.

247
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,551
Morgan, sadly, you're gonna need
to look the way you did that weekend...

248
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,804
...so do you still have any more
of that hair bleach...

249
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,848
...and your Affliction T-shirt?

250
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,227
Well, no. Why...? Yes.

251
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,146
Great, let's go.

252
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,369
Looks like all of Vail is here.

253
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,371
Hope BD is too.

254
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,874
Any of this triggering a memory,
Grimes?

255
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,294
Nope. Nothing yet.

256
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,506
You two better love each other.

257
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,509
Sickening, the amount of meaningless
physical encounters...

258
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,554
- ...that happens nowadays.
- Morgan?

259
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,396
Bo Derek?

260
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,773
BD.

261
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,108
BD is Bo Derek?

262
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,318
Wow.

263
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,904
- Thought I'd never see you again, lover.
- Mm.

264
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,876
- Hello, Bo Derek's tongue. Wow.
- Wow.

265
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,337
- Wow.
- You need to stay with it.

266
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,464
We need to find out
everything she knows.

267
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,884
I thought for sure
I'd hear from you sooner. Bad boy.

268
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,346
You're the guy who made out
with Bo Derek, so act like it.

269
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,141
Yeah, I know. That's just bad boy stuff.
That's just how I roll.

270
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,061
Hi, Bo Derek.

271
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,772
I'm Chuck. My name is Chuck.
Really big, big fan.

272
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,524
Just loved 10 so, so much.

273
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,110
- We do.
- I know what you did with that poster.

274
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,028
No, no, no. I wouldn't... No, no...

275
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,322
- Ew.
- Not that I didn't love the poster as a boy.

276
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,117
- How do you know my friend?
- I don't kiss and tell...

277
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,703
...but your friend rocked my world
one night...

278
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,621
- ...in November.
- Seriously?

279
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,748
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

280
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,167
No, I'll never forget that.
That evening.

281
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,587
But how did I go about that?
The rocking?

282
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,382
Words would ruin it.

283
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,010
But there were definitely rainbows
involved.

284
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,054
Is that...? Check that out.
There were rainbows.

285
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,809
I guess Alex wasn't the only one
with secrets.

286
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,728
What exactly happened that evening?

287
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,772
Because I'm a little fuzzy with all the:
Gluggity-gluggity-gluggity.

288
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,274
You were a bit out of hand.

289
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,444
- Come on, I'll show you.
- I'm always... I'm always out of hand.

290
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,866
Remember this?

291
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,619
Oh, seems like a lot of people
might know what you did that night.

292
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,747
He was telling everyone
who would listen.

293
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,790
How he'd saved the world that day.

294
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,127
- You're such a funny bunny.
- Heh, heh, heh. I am.

295
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,795
What else did I mention?

296
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,673
I lost something
and I'm trying to retrace my steps.

297
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,760
Yeah, what did Funny Bunny do
when he left the bar?

298
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,887
He came to my room.

299
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,557
Maybe the vault that the glasses are in
is a safe in Bo Derek's room.

300
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,142
You need to get up there now.

301
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,352
I have a girlfriend.

302
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,731
You should have remembered that
two months ago. Now, get to work.

303
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,025
Looking for a vault. Write that down.

304
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,819
We are not forgetting anything
this time.

305
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,030
Man, this brings back
some memories.

306
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,116
You're not still staying in that room,
are you?

307
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,578
Because if you are,
oh, boy, ding, ding, ding, round two.

308
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,705
- Come on.
- Yeah.

309
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,999
- Ohh. Have fun, tiger.
- Yeah, you know I will.

310
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,001
Remember this?

311
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,379
Yes. Yes, I do. Who could forget this?

312
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,006
Hey, now.

313
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:16,844
Okay. Incidentally, Bo Derek,
is this where the rainbows happened?

314
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,305
Because they've been coming up
a lot lately.

315
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,724
I'd love to know
what makes them happen.

316
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,977
- What is the trigger, you know?
- Oh, I'll show you.

317
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,270
Yeah, cool. Can't wait.

318
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,064
Taking off my pants now, Chuck.

319
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,191
Dude...

320
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,401
...Bo Derek is taking your pants off.

321
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:36,239
I mean, just go with it, okay.
Ask her to tell you more about that night.

322
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:42,161
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Hey, so you know
what I would love, love...

323
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,497
...totally love, Bo Derek, is...?

324
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,416
Tell me the story
about our night together.

325
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,668
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

326
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,671
But only if you tell me
exactly what you've done...

327
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,506
...since I was with you last.

328
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,049
Deal, lover.

329
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,052
So I first noticed you
when you were getting a lap dance...

330
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,013
...from that dirty whore Jaclyn Smith.

331
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,391
That was when he got the whole bar
singing...

332
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,935
..."Wake Me Up Before you Go-Go"
unironically.

333
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,938
Right. So he didn't tell you anything else
about his night?

334
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,273
He got me pretty wasted.

335
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,609
I woke up the next morning
in a puddle of Rumple Minze.

336
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:17,113
And then we played the funniest game
where you hid and I found you...

337
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,408
...and then I hid and you found me.

338
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,244
Oh, man, so fun.

339
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,664
Well, all I've been able to dig up
is what we already know.

340
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,458
- Grimes was an ass.
- Yeah. I'm getting the same thing.

341
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,085
Chuck, how's it going with Bo?

342
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,255
Have you had any sneak peeks
of your childhood crush's boobies?

343
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,425
What? No. Shut up.

344
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,594
Hey.

345
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,221
Ahem. We have a situation.

346
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,474
Oh, you are kidding me.

347
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,976
How did they track us here?

348
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,145
What you get
when you fly commercial.

349
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,064
- I'll take care of it.
- Copy.

350
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,901
Hey, were you just asking
about Morgan Grimes?

351
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,737
- Uh, yes.
- Ha, ha. That dude's hilarious.

352
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,947
I gave him the most wack tattoo ever.

353
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,532
You gave him a tattoo?

354
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,494
Tattoo.

355
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,455
Morgan, I need you out here ASAP.

356
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,207
Be careful.

357
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,418
Know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get us a little fresh ice.

358
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,712
- What do you think about that?
- Hurry back.

359
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,589
No problem. Okay.

360
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,009
And bring back a couple extra cubes
for playtime.

361
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,055
You two.

362
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,640
We know what's going on here.

363
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,392
And we are not...
We're not gonna forget.

364
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,103
I disagree.

365
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,108
What is that? That smells nice.

366
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,985
Doesn't it?

367
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:42,073
That woman is into me. I'm scared that
whatever's gonna take place in there...

368
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,408
...is gonna be worse
than whatever Alex did.

369
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,411
- Plus, we're broken up, technically...
- You have a tattoo.

370
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,288
No, I do not. No.

371
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,123
What? What are you...?

372
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,503
"Don't trust Bo Derek."
That's what your tattoo says.

373
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,506
Come on, she must be involved
with the Intersect theft.

374
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:04,553
Not the strangest place
a man has tattooed my name.

375
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,722
Now, take me to the glasses.

376
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,353
I'm just gonna go out and say it.
You're no longer a perfect 10.

377
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,481
I know you remember something.
My backup is on the way...

378
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,817
...and you do not wanna know
what they will do...

379
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,029
Sorry I had to do that
to your girlfriend.

380
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:26,158
Oh. Uh. You didn't hit her in the face,
did you?

381
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,536
- Kidding. But it's Bo Derek.
- Did you see her?

382
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,288
Okay.

383
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,049
Ow.

384
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,761
Sweet mother of all that is holy.

385
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,224
Ow.

386
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,269
Dude, what happened? Where are we?

387
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,521
I don't...

388
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,898
- I don't know.
- You're wearing a Vegas hat.

389
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,402
We must've gone to Vegas.
Yeah. And stole a car.

390
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,572
Must have just partied too hard,
and now... Ow.

391
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,574
A woman gave us her underpants?

392
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,910
Breathe on me.

393
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,915
There's no alcohol on your breath.
Just gefilte fish curry, like always.

394
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,417
Last thing I remember...

395
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,253
...there was something
going on underneath the Buy More.

396
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:23,466
Wait. We left ourselves a clue.
Bo Derek?

397
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,182
So...

398
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,476
...Bo.

399
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:38,147
Bo Derek.
Tell me about your night with Morgan.

400
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,941
- And this time for real.
- Yes, please.

401
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,819
And how Bo Derek got involved
with the Intersect.

402
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,156
Listen, acting isn't the only gig I got
because of my looks...

403
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,533
...and my capacity to make believe.

404
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:53,662
Are you trying to say
that Bo Derek is a spy?

405
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,124
My boss had gotten word...

406
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,586
...someone was running around
the intelligence community bragging...

407
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,046
...he was the Intersect.

408
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:06,926
We were already on the lookout for him
when he surfaced so publicly...

409
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,386
...one night in Vail.

410
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,347
Publicly? I doubt that.

411
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,517
Pretty sure
I was keeping a low profile.

412
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,687
Who wants to party
with the freaking Intersect?

413
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,155
I am the most powerful weapon
in the world!

414
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,573
Heh, heh. You maybe?

415
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,032
You, uh...

416
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,784
Ohh.

417
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,999
Hello.

418
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,754
Are you trying to take me down?

419
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,006
Hey. Ow.

420
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,177
Oh, boy.

421
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,761
Oh, yes.

422
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,268
That was real?

423
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,936
And a follow-up question:

424
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,730
If that was real...

425
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,315
...were the rainbows real?

426
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,234
Ha, ha. It meant nothing.

427
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,695
- It was only physical.
- What is it with women...

428
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,281
...and "it's only physica..."?
- Morgan!

429
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,533
Uh...

430
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,455
- What happened next?
- Then I drugged you and called my boss.

431
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:06,295
So this is what they put
the Intersect into these days?

432
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,798
What are you, an intern?

433
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,176
Hmm?

434
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,011
You take that back.

435
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,765
You take that back,
because this Intersect...

436
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,185
This Intersect can almost focus
on your stupid face.

437
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,937
- And when I do...
- Shut up.

438
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,188
Morgan Grimes...

439
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:29,360
...a.k.a. Michael Carmichael,
which is ridiculous.

440
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,072
You're not the only one
with the Intersect, Funny Bunny.

441
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,033
I spent a lot of time and money
getting these glasses.

442
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,120
I haven't used them yet
because I hear there are side effects.

443
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,914
Though you seem fine.

444
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,457
Oh, I'm fine.

445
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,209
I'm fine. It's you...

446
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,045
You made an enormous mistake
telling me this.

447
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,673
Your men here? Finished.
I'm gonna take them out.

448
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,677
And then I'm gonna hunt you down,
and I'm going to arrest you for treason.

449
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,011
I don't think so.

450
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,013
You're not gonna remember
any of this.

451
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,433
X-13.

452
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,394
As soon as you fall asleep...

453
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:10,025
...the last 24 hours of your little life
will just disappear.

454
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:13,153
And here's how confident I am of that.

455
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,703
Nice to meet you.

456
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,247
I'm Nicholas Quinn...

457
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,624
...and I'm about to become
the Intersect.

458
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,056
Give me the glasses.

459
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,943
Sorry, Bo Derek.

460
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,405
We're looking for Nicholas Quinn.
Bo Derek's been working for him.

461
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,157
Bo Derek's a spy?

462
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,784
I know, right?
And a talky one to boot.

463
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,829
Quinn's got an independent spy agency,
but not like ours.

464
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,665
Nothing like ours.
This guy's list of clients is gnarly.

465
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,627
You're talking Libyan Islamic
fighting group, Kim Jong-il.

466
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,587
And a couple of favorites as well...

467
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,798
...like Fulcrum, The Ring
and Volkoff Industries.

468
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,010
What? We've put
some of his biggest clients behind bars.

469
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,971
- Did we get Jong-il?
- He's been screwed by the Intersect.

470
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,224
- No wonder he wants it.
- The fat lip we can blame on the tattoo.

471
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,144
The ski jacket and the boxers
we can blame on Bo Derek.

472
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,647
- But where are the glasses?
- Where's this vault?

473
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,024
I don't know. Guys, I don't know.

474
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,360
Bo Derek said
that was the last she saw of me.

475
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,154
I wouldn't have just stashed
the Intersect anywhere.

476
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,200
I would have put it somewhere safe,
someplace I knew. That's my guess.

477
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,411
Alex.

478
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,998
Oh, boy. Okay, let me deal with this.
I'll be back. Uh...

479
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,878
I gotta come clean on a few things.

480
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,130
Buddy,
are you sure you wanna do that?

481
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:59,134
Because I think maybe we should just,
you know, let the past be the past.

482
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,971
It doesn't seem like telling her the
Bo Derek story is gonna do anything...

483
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,099
...except upset her.
- Yeah.

484
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,394
You slept with Bo Derek?

485
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,646
Yeah. Maybe more than once.

486
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,314
I acted out physically too.

487
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,610
And I rocked Bo Derek's world.

488
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,114
- Sorry. Morgan...
- Yeah?

489
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:24,410
Dale, he doesn't matter, okay?
You don't have to make up these stories.

490
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,954
No, I'm not lying.
Are you kidding me?

491
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,997
I made rainbows
shoot out of this woman.

492
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,961
There's Grimes. Let's just confront him.
I know he's part of this.

493
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,880
Wait. We are being sabotaged.

494
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,175
We've gotta fly under the radar,
quietly keep an eye on them...

495
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,511
...and record on our person
anything we learn.

496
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,971
Great idea.

497
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,806
I gotta pee.

498
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,517
It's 3: 14 p.m. Write that down.

499
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,646
I think, though, it's better
if neither of us knows the details...

500
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:56,024
...of each other's
rainbow-related activities.

501
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,028
Look, you were with Dale,
I was with Bo Derek...

502
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,490
...we're even. Let's move past it now.
- Okay.

503
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,742
Okay, baby.

504
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,744
We are even.

505
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,996
That's my girl. Okay.

506
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:14,918
Ahem. Son, you have the master key?
I checked the vault, it wasn't there.

507
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,670
What'd you just say?

508
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,840
The key. I checked the manager's vault.
Any ideas?

509
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,717
- He's getting away!
- Come on!

510
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,611
Sweet lady Buy More.

511
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,742
Emerald and gold.

512
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,870
Big Mike, is there a Buy More in Vail?

513
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,797
There's a Buy More in Vail.
They had a break-in that night.

514
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,800
Of course.
I knew I put it somewhere familiar.

515
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,760
It's in a manager's vault in Vail.

516
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,304
Looks like all roads lead
to the Buy More.

517
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,309
I'm never getting out of this place.

518
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,075
Oh, he's already down.
Watch out! Watch out!

519
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,036
Wow.

520
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,205
The Vail Buy More.

521
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,751
A lot of broken limbs
on these morons.

522
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,879
I think you only work here
if you've broken something skiing.

523
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,173
Grimes! Remember me, buddy?

524
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,593
Yeah.

525
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,054
Sweet.
I just tweeted you're back in town.

526
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,889
Beers tonight to celebrate, bro.

527
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,599
Oh, man. Sweet.

528
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,104
He tweeted you're back. If Quinn
has been waiting for us to come back...

529
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,273
We gotta hurry.

530
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,233
I hate Twitter.

531
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,238
Hello. Excuse me, mis... ter?

532
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,119
We're security specialists
with Carmichael Industries.

533
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,538
Corporate sent us to check
the recent break-in.

534
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,915
Bored of you. Talk to Big Michelle.

535
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,879
Right.

536
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,319
Our security is rock solid.

537
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,530
I don't understand why corporate felt
we needed to be checked up on.

538
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,574
This isn't any criticism on your store.

539
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,327
We just wanna do a proper check
for your safety.

540
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,955
Now, if you could first take us
to the manager's vault for a look-see.

541
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,793
How's a nice security check feel,
Casey?

542
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,421
This is as extreme as it will get
in our new job.

543
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,298
Nice, easy peasy last mission.

544
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,175
It ain't over. Keep your guard up.

545
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,346
I just don't understand
why no one told me you were coming.

546
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,973
I'm gonna have to call
and get the go-ahead...

547
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,768
...before I open the vault, obviously.

548
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:25,192
So much for her helping us open
the vault. We're gonna do safecracking.

549
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,319
Yeah? Well, hold on a second.
Maybe not.

550
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:31,114
Let me try something real quick here.
One, two, three, four, boom.

551
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,577
- Seriously?
- I was too lazy...

552
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,664
...to change the code in Burbank.
One thing you can count on:

553
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,457
Buy More laziness.

554
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,961
Oh, no.

555
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,756
Where else could they be?
Maybe somebody moved them.

556
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,968
Like, maybe the person
who is currently knocked out cold.

557
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,761
This place is hopping right now.

558
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,474
I guess it's the new expansion pack
for Gunz 'n Gold.

559
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,520
The vault.

560
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,940
Could it be?

561
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,453
Ha, ha!

562
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,872
Nice work, Morgan.
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

563
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,250
Let's go.

564
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,889
You people are spies!

565
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,601
And we are not gonna forget it.
It's right here on my arm.

566
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,646
Yeah. What he said.

567
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,985
Get down!

568
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,987
Everybody out.

569
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,700
Charles Carmichael.

570
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,747
First guy who got it instead of me.

571
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,207
What are you talking about?

572
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,710
I'm former CIA too.

573
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:13,383
The Intersect
was supposed to be mine...

574
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,094
...but then Larkin stole it for you.

575
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:20,682
So I went back out in the field,
and I got captured. Heh, heh.

576
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:28,523
Ohh. And tortured in a hole in the ground
for 378 days.

577
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,317
In a hole!

578
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,153
I was the best.

579
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,489
And then I was broken.

580
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,407
Dismissed.

581
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,576
And all because the Intersect
wasn't mine.

582
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,496
You don't want it, Quinn.
You do not want it. Trust me.

583
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,373
It doesn't work right.
I lost memories, important movies.

584
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,250
- A bunch of stuff.
- He's right.

585
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,629
Listen, you don't want it. Trust me.
Nothing good can come from it.

586
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,217
Take a good look at your wife.

587
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,345
You think you'd get that
without the Intersect?

588
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,265
I tried to win without it. I...

589
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,892
I tried.

590
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,062
Now, give it to me!

591
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,651
Jeffrey. Run!

592
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,595
Nice shot!

593
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,732
Thank you.

594
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,449
No, no, Casey. Casey, wait.

595
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,953
Quinn didn't get the Intersect. We did it.
We took down his team.

596
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,246
Let's call Beckman.

597
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,416
Call the authorities.
Tell them where he is.

598
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,711
But let's be done.
Can't we just be done?

599
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,213
We survived our last mission.

600
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:19,134
Let's leave behind the Intersect and
everyone involved with it, and be done.

601
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,264
Okay.

602
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:25,974
We're done.

603
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,934
- Okay. I'll call Beckman.
- Whoa!

604
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,147
I'm not done. No, I am not done.

605
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,941
I would like very much
to forget everything.

606
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,111
- Everything that I saw here today.
- Here we go again.

607
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,696
I'm scarred.

608
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,239
- I'm so scarred.
- Buddy.

609
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,490
Sorry, Casey.

610
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:46,536
Looks like we can't kick the creepy
cousin out of the family just yet.

611
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,510
There's no alcohol on your breath.
It's just gefilte fish curry, like always.

612
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,471
I believe we've been set up.

613
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,805
And what's all this?

614
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:12,229
Huh. We must have gotten
to the bottom of it.

615
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,065
I guess we were wrong.

616
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,067
That's kind of disappointing.

617
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,402
So now what do we do?

618
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,703
Hey, boys. Morgan told me
you might have gotten stranded.

619
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,705
Yeah, apparently we did.

620
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,500
Cheer up.
I brought turkey B.L.T. Subways.

621
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,629
- From the Fresh Fit menu?
- Yep.

622
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,923
- Watching my weight.
- How many you have?

623
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,591
Only two.

624
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,344
- Also, I had a thought.
Mm-hm.

625
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,263
- We're already halfway to Vegas.
Mm-hm.

626
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,600
And Bolonia's doing some
Native American feelings workshop...

627
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,852
...about her period all weekend.
- Ew.

628
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,854
But are you saying?

629
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,023
Vegas, baby!

630
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,297
Sarah?

631
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,382
Hey. Did I wake you?

632
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,094
No, it's... I mean, yeah, but it's okay.
Where are you so early?

633
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,929
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep.

634
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:31,558
I'm just...
I'm so excited about starting everything.

635
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:35,645
I made an appointment to check out
some of these new office spaces...

636
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,316
...and I thought that we could get
Casey and Morgan together...

637
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,484
...and have a little ceremony.

638
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:46,406
You know, pop some champagne
and toast to our futures...

639
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,242
...and destroy the Intersect glasses.

640
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,995
I think that's the right end to this.

641
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,913
Yeah. That sounds perfect.

642
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:58,585
Turns out saying "last mission"
wasn't a jinx after all, huh?

643
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,462
I love you, Chuck.

644
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,130
I love you too, baby. Bye.

645
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,757
Bye.

646
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:12,015
Never let the bad guy get away.

647
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,701
- Hey.
- I have your husband.

648
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,705
Bring the Intersect
to the San Pedro docks, Pier 23...

649
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,582
...2100 hours...

650
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,834
...or he dies.

651
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,027
Casey, where is everyone?

652
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,488
You got anything?

653
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,335
Casey, hold your fire. They've got Chuck.

654
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,506
Sarah Walker, put the glasses down.

655
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,384
You show me Chuck first.

656
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,428
The situation has changed.

657
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,679
He'll be needed.

658
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,182
Now, put the glasses down
on the ground in front of you.

659
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,247
It was a trap! Where is he?

660
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,332
I don't know. We gotta get out of here!

661
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,388
Casey, you got an exit?

662
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,015
No!

663
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,142
No. Not from here.

664
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,393
Watch the exit!

665
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,855
Move, move, move!

666
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,616
What's our next move?

667
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,370
I've got one mag left.

668
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,384
Walker, no!

669
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,261
Don't do it!

670
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,941
Okay.

671
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,192
I got this.
