1
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,302
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,553
Emily Birch?

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,264
Is that her? The one whose blood
Jordan wears round his neck?

4
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:16,724
Yeah.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,103
It was almost 20 years ago.
He was Eugene Greer.

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,522
That's Jordan Chase?

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,317
No one could ever take your place.
You know that.

8
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,404
You know, I'm glad you didn't touch
any of them.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,530
Really? Why is that?

10
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:35,284
Because this DNA test will clear you
and leave you all to me and to her.

11
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:38,079
The men who hurt you,
they made DVDs of everything they did.

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,372
Did everyone watch it?

13
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,874
I managed to get it
out of evidence in time.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,877
You think you can just pay me off
like I'm the corner whore?

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,422
Stay the fuck away from Deb!

16
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,507
I trusted you.

17
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,134
And while you were fucking me

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,720
you were spreading shit about my brother
behind my back.

19
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,346
Fuck you.

20
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,098
- Who'd you say you were?
- A friend of Joey.

21
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,142
I got to pick up a few things
for a stake-out.

22
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,894
It's for Detective Quinn.
You see his name there.

23
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,857
A strange call came into my office
from an Alex Tilden.

24
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,026
Alex Tilden, 3040.

25
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:10,153
Here it is.

26
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,613
Look at this. Looks like a partial footprint.

27
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,866
What if the vigilante
is one of their victims?

28
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,661
It's all become so... natural.

29
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,206
- You OK?
- Yes.

30
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,587
But with Lumen,
I'm someone different.

31
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:31,007
In her eyes,
I'm not a monster at all.

32
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,015
- Detectives.
- We appreciate you fitting us in.

33
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,268
We wanted to thank you for your phone call
regarding Alex Tilden.

34
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,186
- It was really helpful.
- That's good to hear.

35
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,814
We followed up immediately.
We went to his house, but...

36
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,191
- it looked like we'd just missed him.
- That's unfortunate.

37
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,237
Yeah, it is, because he seems to have
disappeared off the face of the earth.

38
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,907
- I see.
- Yeah, like Cole Harmon.

39
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,493
- And Boyd Fowler.
- Yeah, him too.

40
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,747
Now, I keep asking myself,
what's the connection?

41
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,041
What do these three people
have in common?

42
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,545
You. You're what they have
in common. You.

43
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,880
Oh, here it comes.

44
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:20,968
Why don't you just save us a lot of time
and tell us what that connection is?

45
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,849
It's ridiculous that you think
I have anything to do with this.

46
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,392
I gave you my DNA!

47
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,104
What were the results?
Go on, remind me.

48
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,274
Your DNA wasn't found
on any of the barrel girls.

49
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,526
That's correct,
so all this right here

50
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,820
is a colossal waste
of my time and yours.

51
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,364
Well, I've got nothing but time.

52
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,826
So you can keep fooling everybody
in your little seminars, but I'm onto you.

53
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,372
You're obsessed with me.
That's what this is about.

54
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,123
It happens. You achieve a bit of fame

55
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,543
and people latch on to you
in various twisted ways.

56
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,670
I'd be careful, if I were you.

57
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,838
It's typically seen
in someone who's trying to avoid

58
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,841
facing the dismal nature
of her own small life.

59
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,843
- I think you slipped up.
- It's not at all healthy.

60
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,304
- And I think a barrel girl got away.
- It's something I can help you with.

61
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,265
And now she's hunting down
the people that took her.

62
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,936
And people all around you
are dropping like flies.

63
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,396
You could be next.

64
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:18,150
Seriously, I'll be fine.
It's you I'm concerned about.

65
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,819
Don't say I didn't warn you.

66
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:30,037
Jordan Chase.
We know exactly where he is.

67
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,583
Yeah, but there's no way
to get to him.

68
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,460
The entire top floor is guarded.

69
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,295
Elevators?

70
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,756
Monitored.

71
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,217
Stairs?

72
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,179
- Locked from the inside.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,391
But you know how to pick locks.

74
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,359
Not without setting off the fire alarm.

75
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,407
OK.

76
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,827
So we have to figure out a way
to get him to come out.

77
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,579
How?

78
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,415
He has everything he needs up there.

79
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,127
Not everything.

80
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,464
Me. He wants me.

81
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,007
No.

82
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,301
There's got to be a way
to use me as bait.

83
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,388
- It worked with Cole.
- I'm not gonna use you as bait.

84
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,142
- It's too dangerous.
- You know I can do this.

85
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,978
Yeah, I do.
I saw you kill Alex Tilden.

86
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,396
But we have to be extra careful.

87
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,066
Jordan has more than
just our eyes on him.

88
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,861
- The police.
- My sister.

89
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:50,201
I'm so sorry that I put you in this position,
having to lie to her like that.

90
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,120
I don't like it,
but it's not the first time.

91
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,540
She's never suspected anything?

92
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,507
I don't know. Maybe Deb has a blind spot
when it comes to me.

93
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,928
Sometimes I feel like I'm taking advantage
of her, but it's for the best.

94
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,013
She's not like us.

95
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,057
"Us."

96
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,570
Oh.

97
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,573
There's a camera in the room.

98
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,160
The baby monitor
is picking up the signal.

99
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,287
Somebody's watching us.

100
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,587
Jordan has to be behind this...
and close by.

101
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,965
Wireless cameras
have a limited range,

102
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,093
their signal routed
to a recording unit

103
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,595
in a vacant apartment,

104
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,973
a motor home...

105
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,810
a van.

106
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,501
It could be anywhere.

107
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,348
Jordan Chase is up to
his ball sack in this. I fuckin' know it.

108
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,184
Just means we keep digging.

109
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,310
You coming in?

110
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,771
I got to grab something from my car.
I'll be right up.

111
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,570
- Hey.
- Hey.

112
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:54,116
- What are you doing here?
- My union appeal's been denied.

113
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,661
I am now officially terminated.

114
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,288
So how's your day?

115
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,498
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I don't want your pity.

116
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,666
Good. Then...

117
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,919
Thirty years of putting bad guys away,

118
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,963
this is what them cocksuckers
upstairs do to me.

119
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,007
Take my pension,
wipe their ass with it

120
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,551
and just flush it right on down the shitter.

121
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,761
Look, I got to get inside.

122
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,223
- I need your help on a bust.
- Bust? What are you talking about?

123
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,809
Something big. Something big enough
to make them stand up and take notice.

124
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,063
Something big enough to make them
give me my job back on the police force.

125
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,107
- Your boy Dexter...
- What the fuck? What are you doing?

126
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,985
Didn't you hear me, Quinn?
I'm not a cop any more.

127
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,946
Now, I need a cop to make this bust.

128
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,697
No. Forget it.

129
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,409
You little fucking wimp.

130
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,872
You're up to your ass in alligators
with this thing, whether you like it or not.

131
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,959
So you're gonna make this bust
and I'm gonna call you,

132
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,127
you'd best come running.

133
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,648
- What are you in the mood for?
- I'm thinking seafood.

134
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,775
It's a perfect night to grill.

135
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,697
I'll go check what's in the fridge.

136
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,714
Harrison's baby monitor made it easy
to pinpoint where this was hidden,

137
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,549
but the bigger problem remains.

138
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,176
What exactly has Jordan heard

139
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,345
and where are those recordings?

140
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,353
On second thought,
let's go out to eat.

141
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,407
It's not Jordan. It's worse.
It's someone from my own station.

142
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:03,037
What? Why would somebody from the
police department bug your apartment?

143
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,456
I don't know. There's a serial number
on the camera.

144
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,541
I'll go in tomorrow and find out
who checked it out.

145
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,876
I don't understand.

146
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,588
This could have something
to do with my sister's theory.

147
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,965
What are you talking about?

148
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:20,137
She has this theory about
vigilantes hunting down the rapists.

149
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,222
So you think she planted cameras?

150
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,184
No, it's not her. I'd know.

151
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,311
It could be anyone.

152
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,189
But how could they be onto us?

153
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,275
- We've been so careful.
- I don't know yet.

154
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,487
The one good thing is that no one
has seen those recordings yet.

155
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,988
How do you know?

156
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,282
Because we haven't been arrested.

157
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,287
Jordan is gonna get away with everything
and we're gonna be arrested?

158
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,414
We don't know that.

159
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,377
Look, for now we just pretend
like everything's OK.

160
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,630
If we have something to talk about,
we talk about it out here where it's safe.

161
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,548
But we were so close.

162
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,595
- It can't end this way.
- It's not going to.

163
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:16,693
I checked with the apartment manager,
then the neighbours.

164
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,446
That motor home is gone.

165
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,407
It's got to be one of these vans.

166
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,450
You said there were four vans last night.

167
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,868
It's down to three now.

168
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,454
I'll keep checking back.

169
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,042
- Sonya, everything all right?
- Everything is great.

170
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,670
Astor and Cody
are spoiling Harrison silly.

171
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,796
Good.

172
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,383
He's taking a little nap now,
so I was just making a list for Sunday,

173
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,094
and I wondered, do you have
any special requests?

174
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,805
- Sunday?
- Harrison's birthday party.

175
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,390
Of course! Right.

176
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,809
Harrison's birthday.

177
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,145
Astor and Cody
can't wait to see you.

178
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,272
I'm looking forward to seeing them too.

179
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,233
But... hold on a second.

180
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,694
It's not safe
to bring everyone here.

181
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,779
- We can go to them.
- You're coming?

182
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,740
I just invited myself.

183
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,410
Sonya, we're gonna have
the party in Orlando.

184
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,620
Oh. OK.

185
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,999
It's just easier than
making everyone drive down here.

186
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:18,172
Perfect.

187
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,050
Come on, I got to get to work.

188
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:25,762
Keep an eye on these vans
and call me if you see anything.

189
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,977
No torches, no pitchforks,

190
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,646
no one looking at me
any differently.

191
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,607
Dex, I need you.

192
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,443
In a minute.
I have something I need to do.

193
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,195
Find out who planted
those cameras.

194
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,405
We're all waiting on you.

195
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,532
That doesn't sound good.

196
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,629
So, as I was saying, everything keeps
leading back to Jordan Chase.

197
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,049
Why would he be running
a rape club with these putos?

198
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,426
I don't know.
But I'm pretty fuckin' sure he is.

199
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,637
Where are we on the banker,
Alex Tilden?

200
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,806
- He's gone. He disappeared.
- We got his DNA from a toothbrush.

201
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,808
Ties him to the barrel girls, like the others,

202
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,353
but no connection to Jordan
that we can find.

203
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,980
- Then I suggest you find that connection.
- I'm on it.

204
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,108
- And the dentist, Mendell?
- He's the odd man out.

205
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,653
He doesn't seem to have any connection
to any of the other guys.

206
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,363
Again, let's find that connection.

207
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,948
- Morgan, Quinn.
- We got it.

208
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,825
Phone the neighbours.
Wake the kids. Kick the dog.

209
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,704
Remember that muddy female boot print
outside Tilden's house?

210
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,122
Yeah, we found it.

211
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,501
Well, my brothers in blue, it...

212
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,046
has a twin.

213
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,173
Found it outside
the vacant house next door.

214
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,508
Let me see that.

215
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,094
Naturally, I went inside.

216
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,806
The dining room was spotless, and I mean
recently cleaned kind of spotless,

217
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,641
unlike the rest of the house.

218
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,978
My schnoz also detected
the smell of bleach.

219
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,355
One more day,
and the smell would have dissipated.

220
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,276
My guess, the vigilante brought
your missing banker over

221
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,653
and offed him right there
in the dining room.

222
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:09,116
Excuse me,
did I hear the word "vigilante"?

223
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:17,332
It was a theory
I was keeping to myself, but...

224
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,378
It's out there, but we may have
a vigilante on our hands.

225
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,965
I sent Masuka over to Tilden's
to see if he could comb for any evidence

226
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,883
that a homicide had taken place.

227
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,135
Keep going.

228
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,636
Please don't.

229
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,473
There are 13 DVDs
and only 12 victims.

230
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,060
So I'm thinking that
one of the barrel girls escaped

231
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,104
and now she's after the men
that abducted her.

232
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,481
And she is hunting them
and she is killing them.

233
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,359
How is that even possible?

234
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,403
The barrel girls are all slight of build.

235
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,449
- Alex Tilden was, what, 175 pounds?
- Minimum.

236
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,492
Maybe she had help.

237
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,203
- Like who?
- I don't know.

238
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,622
A...

239
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,208
A man. Someone she trusts.

240
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:05,172
Someone who cares about her.
A father, brother,

241
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,507
husband, boyfriend.

242
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,305
So now it's vigilantes in love.

243
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,182
Yeah, like Romeo and Juliet...

244
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,309
except they didn't kill anyone.

245
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,896
No, more like, uh, Bonnie and... Clyde.

246
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:21,980
Great.

247
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,983
They ended up dead
in a bullet-riddled car.

248
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,028
We all have our assignments.
Let's go.

249
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,220
Closer to ten minutes.

250
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,972
She likes a cup of coffee
with her smoke.

251
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,394
But that's more than enough time
to see that...

252
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,648
Detective Joseph Quinn
checked out the cameras.

253
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,443
Three cameras, to be exact,
two microphones, a recorder.

254
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,653
Only three days ago.

255
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,072
Maybe no one's seen
the footage yet.

256
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,035
Case number...

257
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:21,540
It's from 1982, when Quinn was
in grade school eating paste.

258
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,833
It's a fake.

259
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,137
No court orders authorised for my address.
This is off the books.

260
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,400
Quinn's doing this on his own.

261
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,485
Lumen. Plans for lunch?

262
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,954
Start with the hard drive.

263
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,833
Yeah, any storage devices,
video files, flash drives.

264
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,879
Wow, this thing is ancient.

265
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,297
Who is this guy?

266
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,300
Quinn. My sister's partner.

267
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,969
Oh, wow.

268
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,805
Are they... close?

269
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,141
They used to be.

270
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,226
You got anything?

271
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,104
Not much in the way of video files.

272
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,106
Anything of us?

273
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,192
No.

274
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:33,612
Just a cat that hiccups and farts
at the same time.

275
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,657
Cute.

276
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,785
Check the bedroom.

277
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,792
You take the closet.
I'll check the drawers.

278
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,094
Oh, shit.

279
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,264
What is it?

280
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,391
- Us.
- The marina.

281
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,977
That's the night we dumped Cole.

282
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,605
He's been watching us for weeks.

283
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,233
He knows everything.

284
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,444
Wait. You're not gonna
take them with you?

285
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,572
Tip him off that we found them?
No, he'll just print more.

286
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,282
We have to find the digital source.

287
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,452
Right. Find the recording equipment.

288
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,170
We're not open any more.

289
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:36,049
- Mrs Mendell? Laura Mendell?
- Yes?

290
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,552
I'm Detective Morgan.
This is Detective Quinn.

291
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,096
We'd like to ask you a couple of questions
about your husband.

292
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,015
Please, OK?
Just no more questions.

293
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,811
We've been through this, OK?
I don't know anything.

294
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,146
- Of course, I should have.
- Why is that?

295
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:53,817
I was very naive,
but now it all makes sense.

296
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,652
Those week-long fishing trips
he used to take.

297
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,821
- He'd go without you?
- Of course without me.

298
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,447
It was just him and his buddies.

299
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,491
He called it his "man time",

300
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,077
but of course that has
a whole other meaning now.

301
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,413
Did he ever give you names
of the men on those trips?

302
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,790
No. I never met any of them.

303
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,003
He kept me completely in the dark
about his whole closeted gay life.

304
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,631
I mean, why didn't he just tell me?

305
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,635
Actually, Mrs Mendell, we have information
which leads us to believe

306
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,679
your husband wasn't in fact gay.

307
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,391
The crime scene may have been altered
to give that impression.

308
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,853
But he was linked to a series of rapes.

309
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,813
And murders.

310
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,691
My God.

311
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,029
Who is this man I married?

312
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,949
I'm sorry to bring you that news.

313
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,077
But do any of these names
sound familiar?

314
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,332
- Boyd Fowler. Cole Harmon.
- No, I don't know them.

315
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,500
Alex Tilden.

316
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,086
Jordan Chase.

317
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,671
- Jordan Chase?
- Yes.

318
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,466
Well, that's him, right there.

319
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,178
"Best two-man sailing team,
Dan Mendell and Eugene Greer"?

320
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,056
Jordan Chase is Eugene Greer...

321
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,516
or he used to be.

322
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:12,103
Dan knew him when they were kids.
It was a really big deal to him.

323
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,897
That's our connection.

324
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,192
Why do you think the wife never had a clue
about what was up with her husband?

325
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,820
This barrel girl stuff has gone on
the entire time they were married.

326
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,531
He was probably a really good liar.

327
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:27,035
Men sometimes have that ability.
It was his fault, not hers.

328
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,496
How do you want
to go at this Eugene Greer thing?

329
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:33,249
Just pull up everything we can.
School records, juvie records.

330
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,251
I fuckin' knew Chase was full of shit.

331
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,504
Who creates a new identity
for themselves?

332
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,631
A dirt bag who has something to hide.

333
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,758
I've got it.

334
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,855
Jordan Chase lied
about knowing Alex Tilden.

335
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:59,150
In the past ten years,
Tilden oversaw six properties

336
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,986
purchased by Chase's corporation.

337
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,989
Dan the Dentist also knew him.
And Jordan Chase is an alias.

338
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,992
That whole bullshit persona
that he built for himself is a lie.

339
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,412
His real name's Eugene Greer.
Mendell and Chase were friends as kids.

340
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:15,917
So, wait. That ties Jordan directly
to each of the barrel girls' rapists.

341
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,212
Yeah, but still all circumstantial.
Not enough to bring him in.

342
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,048
Yeah, but it's enough to bring
his lying ass in for questioning.

343
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,383
We've got to keep pushing at him,

344
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,760
scare him a little bit
till he starts making some mistakes.

345
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:30,015
Deb's closing in on Chase.
Quinn's closing in on me.

346
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,559
Time's running out for both of us.

347
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,399
Hey, any good news?

348
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,861
Uh, yeah, we've connected Jordan Chase
to all of the rapists,

349
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,613
so I'm about to nail
this fuck to the wall.

350
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,157
Good.

351
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,577
What? What's up? I'm kind of busy.

352
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,579
Just wondering if you want to go with me

353
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,457
to Orlando on Sunday
for Harrison's birthday.

354
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,584
Oh. Wha...

355
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,212
- I do, but...
- You have other plans with Quinn?

356
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,382
What? No, it... It's with work.
It's the case.

357
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,511
Besides, Quinn's the last person
that you'd want to have there.

358
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,846
- Oh?
- Trust me.

359
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,266
- So it's over?
- Yes.

360
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,188
No. Fuck, I don't know.
It's complicated.

361
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,856
You don't have to tell me.

362
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,694
- He lied to me about something.
- Must have been something big.

363
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,865
He lied to me about you.

364
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,909
About me? What do you mean?

365
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,036
Quinn had this...

366
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:38,416
idiot notion that you were somehow
connected to Rita's death.

367
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:47,217
- That's...
- It's crazy, I know.

368
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,928
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because...

369
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,515
Because you've been through enough.

370
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,350
And I just found out.

371
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,314
When he finally told me
I felt so betrayed because...

372
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:07,070
...as much as I don't want to admit it,
I really care about him.

373
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,240
"Care", present tense?

374
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,493
It's complicated, remember?

375
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,416
I thought I knew him,
and he kept telling me he loved me.

376
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,131
But what he did...
I mean, I can't have somebody like that.

377
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:30,385
You don't lie to somebody that
you're close to. You have their back.

378
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,596
I need someone I can trust 100 per cent.

379
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,102
Like this.

380
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,646
- A boot print?
- The vigilante.

381
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,025
She has someone in her life,
a guy who's helping her,

382
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:49,696
someone that would do
anything and everything for her.

383
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,906
How do you know that?

384
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:57,745
Honestly, I don't know,
but... what they're doing takes devotion.

385
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,874
To kill someone together,
that's some pretty serious shit.

386
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,460
Is that what Lumen and I have,
serious shit?

387
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,129
He's risking his life.

388
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:10,175
He's putting everything on the line
to make what happened to her right.

389
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,055
As crazy as that sounds, what...

390
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,350
what word would you use
to describe that but "love"?

391
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,567
It's pretty fucked up, isn't it?

392
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,446
Yeah, pretty fucked up.

393
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,409
Kind of beautiful too.

394
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,252
Just got this in.
It's handmade. It's very chic.

395
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,462
Um...

396
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,548
- It's not quite me.
- Perhaps one of the rings.

397
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,468
How about... that?

398
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,020
It's nice.

399
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:07,565
Small enough to carry,
locking pin, stainless-steel blade.

400
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,151
- How does it feel?
- Good.

401
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,737
We'll take it.

402
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,950
- Thank you.
- Sure.

403
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,627
It's just an hour or so
till Quinn gets off work.

404
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:31,881
If he decides to check his recording
equipment tonight I should be there.

405
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:38,429
What is Quinn after?
What does he want with us?

406
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,890
He doesn't want us. He wants me.

407
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,060
He was coming after me
before we even met.

408
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,562
I didn't mean for you
to get caught up in this.

409
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,065
You should leave.

410
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,610
You tried that once before, remember?
You tried to ship me away.

411
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:56,781
That was different.
I don't want you to leave for good.

412
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:02,161
Just till I deal with this.

413
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,331
Deal with it how?

414
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,542
I don't know.
Whatever needs to be done.

415
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:13,548
I appreciate the offer,
but... I'm not going anywhere.

416
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:17,260
- Lumen, it's getting dangerous.
- Getting dangerous?

417
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,470
I'm not walking away.

418
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,597
We're a team.

419
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,976
We have serious shit.

420
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,478
What does that mean?

421
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,064
It's just something Deb said about us.

422
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,525
You told her about... us?

423
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,445
No, she was talking
about the vigilantes.

424
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:39,615
She was talking about us without
knowing she was talking about us.

425
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,795
Maybe we should both take off.

426
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:03,097
Get on a cruise ship.

427
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,516
Hop a freighter.

428
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,269
Steal a tugboat.

429
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:20,198
You said that you didn't
want me to leave.

430
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,325
Does that mean that you want me to stay?

431
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,285
I do.

432
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,088
We should go.

433
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:44,722
OK, so Eugene Greer grew up
in some redneck town near Tallahassee.

434
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,350
He had a single mom,
now dead, no siblings,

435
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,644
pretty nondescript childhood.

436
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,897
Moved to Miami when he was 18,
dropped about 100 pounds,

437
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:57,110
changed his name to Jordan Chase,
pretty much reinvented himself.

438
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:01,531
Take a look at these
before-and-after photos.

439
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,990
Ooh.

440
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,243
Like a different person.

441
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,870
I think he might have had
some plastic surgery along the way.

442
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:08,996
Look at this.

443
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,921
When they'd be off at the same time,
each of the barrel girls disappeared.

444
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,340
- Fuck, they did this for years.
- Mm-hm.

445
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,262
I gotta take this.

446
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:44,073
I'm, uh, having a really tough time here.

447
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,825
Doing what?

448
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:49,162
This. Being with you.

449
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,539
Yeah, well, you should have
thought of that before.

450
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,500
I'm sorry. I fucked up, I know.

451
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,420
I do dumb things.

452
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,963
I'm a dumb guy.

453
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,674
But the one thing I did right

454
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,343
was to get you to almost like me...

455
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,847
- because I really love you.
- Don't, Quinn.

456
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,265
No, I mean it.

457
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:14,770
There aren't many women like you.
I know that.

458
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,398
You're more like...

459
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,484
- a guy.
- A guy?

460
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,528
You don't play games

461
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,406
where I have to figure out
what it is you're really thinking.

462
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,450
You just say it,

463
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,911
usually with
a lot of really filthy words

464
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,121
that I've never heard before.

465
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:37,210
You're the first woman
who's ever called me on my bullshit

466
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,087
and made me take
a hard look at myself.

467
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,089
It's made me a better person, I think.

468
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,594
I just don't want to lose you, that's all.

469
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,722
Bad news.

470
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,477
Not only has Jordan declined our request
for another interview,

471
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:58,272
but he just booked a multi-city
speaking deal in Europe.

472
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,774
Sounds like he's on the run.

473
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,150
No fucking way.

474
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,319
As of tomorrow he is untouchable,

475
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,447
unless we can find a way
to keep him here.

476
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,367
But, like we keep saying,
we still don't have enough to arrest him.

477
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:13,120
No, but, uh... we can ground him
as a material witness.

478
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:15,373
We just have to get a court order.

479
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,084
- Should we go to LaGuerta?
- No.

480
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:22,004
She shoots me down every time.
She won't help. I can get it myself.

481
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:33,182
The only van that remains after 24 hours
just happens to be a rental.

482
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,020
Judging by the amount of dust,
it's been sitting there close to a week.

483
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:47,697
And here comes Quinn, checking in
before he heads to the station.

484
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,160
I never wanted it to come to this.

485
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,670
Agh!

486
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,257
Hello.

487
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,761
- Lumen, it's me, Emily.
- What's wrong?

488
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,055
I got a call from Jordan Chase.

489
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,015
He knows I talked to you.

490
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,975
What? How?

491
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,728
I don't know. You tell me.

492
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,272
- I didn't talk to him.
- What is going on?

493
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,193
I'm scared. He scared me.

494
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,195
Emily, I have no idea what's going on.

495
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,157
I'm going to the police.

496
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,409
- I'll tell them everything.
- No, no, don't do that.

497
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,994
Why? They'll protect me.

498
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,830
Emily, it'll just make things worse.
We'll protect you.

499
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,250
How? Jordan is too powerful.

500
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,836
- He has people.
- Emily...

501
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,089
You know what he did to us.

502
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:32,510
Just stay in your house. Wait for us.
We'll be there as soon as we can.

503
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,471
Please, just tell me
that you'll wait for us.

504
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:39,975
OK.

505
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,269
I'll wait, but hurry.

506
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,647
Please hurry.

507
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,735
Very nice.

508
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,865
You're quite the actress.

509
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,868
Dexter Morgan.

510
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,204
Please leave
a message at the tone.

511
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,289
Dexter, where are you? Emily called.

512
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,834
Jordan knows she talked to us.
We have to go see her.

513
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,817
I hope you got voicemail.

514
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,989
- You're Quinn's friend.
- That would be me.

515
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:38,617
FYI, Stan Liddy is my name.

516
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,831
- What are you doing?
- I just need you to relax.

517
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:48,169
I'm taking us to a little place to
have a little private chat, that's all.

518
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,380
Why? Why are you doing this?

519
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,508
Because our mutual friend Joey Quinn
hired me to look into you

520
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,969
and I guess you know
I found out some things.

521
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,555
So I just need you
to lie there and relax.

522
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,641
I don't want to zap you again,
but I will if I have to.

523
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:20,117
- What?
- Come on, now, Joey.

524
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,329
Is that any way to talk
to your new best friend?

525
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,040
- I told you, I don't want...
- Shut up and listen up.

526
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,958
You get your ass in your car

527
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,837
and you drive on down to the fuel docks
at Bayfront Park.

528
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,841
That big bust I want you to make,
I need you to come and make it now.

529
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,427
I don't know what you think you're doing,
but you got to stop it with this shit.

530
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,721
Oh, horseshit. Nobody's stopping nothing.

531
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,599
- You're the one who hired me.
- And then I fired you.

532
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,018
Listen, boy. This is going down
with or without you.

533
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,063
Now, you don't get down here
faster than a fuckin' jack rabbit,

534
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:53,067
I'm calling in another cop and then there's
no telling how this is gonna spin out.

535
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:56,403
- Jesus, Liddy...
- Jesus ain't got nothing to do with it.

536
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,074
Old fuel docks, Bayfront Park, now.

537
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,663
Fuck.

538
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,457
Your buddy Quinn is on his way.

539
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,626
Didn't sound like he wants to come.

540
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,879
Well, you're a real popular fella.

541
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,216
Sonya. Who's Sonya?

542
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,593
- My nanny.
- Nanny.

543
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:24,306
Well, Sonya wants to know
if you want a magician for the party.

544
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,933
Of course you do.

545
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,644
"Yes, do magician."

546
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,691
Well, now,

547
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,277
there's something I want to show you.

548
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,160
Looky here at this.

549
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,794
Ain't that neat?

550
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,006
And that's just a tiny bit
of what I recorded.

551
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,134
But I only got one problem here.

552
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,971
I didn't have no search warrant
and these people are sticklers for rules,

553
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:09,602
which is why... you're gonna give me
a full confession.

554
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,361
- Where's Dexter?
- He's not here.

555
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:23,866
No, I need you both.
You said you would protect me.

556
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,618
Emily, it's OK. Calm down.

557
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,121
You have to call him.
Make him come. Now.

558
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,791
OK.

559
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,045
OK, maybe I should just go get him.

560
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,088
Maybe not.

561
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:45,220
I ain't stupid. You're thinking, "I got
no reason to make a full confession."

562
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:48,474
So I'm gonna give you a reason.
Lumen walks free.

563
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,267
Why should I trust you?

564
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,896
Cos I don't give a shit about her,
and I don't give a shit about you either.

565
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,316
I just want my goddamn job
on the police force back.

566
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,444
I bring in somebody like you,
I get my picture in the news,

567
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,072
everybody thinks I'm a goddamn hero,
everybody loves me,

568
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:07,242
and they have to hire me back.
So I don't need your girl.

569
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,913
What do you say?

570
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,873
Shit!

571
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,138
Liddy!

572
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,267
Ah!

573
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:54,832
Go away, Quinn.
Don't make this any worse.

574
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,134
Liddy, where the fuck are you?

575
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,962
Leave a message.

576
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:46,050
Liddy, it's Quinn. You're really starting
to fucking piss me off.

577
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,827
Dexter, where are you?

578
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:18,499
Emily called. Jordan knows
she talked to us. We have to go see her.

579
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,398
I don't have time to deal with you.

580
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,251
- Please leave a message.
- I'm on my way.

581
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,004
Morgan.

582
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,133
My office.

583
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:17,015
I got a call earlier from the judge
you petitioned for your court order.

584
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,643
- When's it coming?
- It's not.

585
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,062
What?

586
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,775
Your request to detain Jordan Chase
as a material witness was denied.

587
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,529
That fuck is scheduled
to fly out of here one-way today.

588
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,198
- This was our shot.
- I understand why you're upset,

589
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,659
but what I don't understand is
why you didn't come to me.

590
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,287
- You're kidding.
- I'm asking.

591
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,040
You are the last person I think of
when I need support.

592
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,751
Detective, you've been
on the force long enough

593
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:47,671
to know that situations
are rarely black and white.

594
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,631
Politics come into play.

595
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,800
That doesn't mean
that I signed up to be used.

596
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,345
We all get used, and in this instance
you should have used me.

597
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,223
You made it very clear that you don't
support my vigilante theory.

598
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,476
And I'm still not sure
that there's anything to it,

599
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:05,439
but I have always trusted
your instincts as a cop.

600
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,405
You know, at one point
I actually thought we were friends.

601
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,409
Well, Detect...

602
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:22,706
Debra, I'm sorry
if I betrayed that friendship.

603
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,875
OK.

604
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,544
- Wait.
- What? What?

605
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,005
- What is it?
- Here.

606
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,424
- What is this?
- It's your court order.

607
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,093
From a different judge
who owed me a favour.

608
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,225
Fuck me.

609
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,437
Now I'm the asshole, right?

610
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,023
You better get going
if you want to catch Jordan.

611
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,524
Right.

612
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,995
Lumen?

613
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,716
What could he be doing
that is so important

614
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,885
that he would let you
come here by yourself?

615
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,222
- I don't know.
- Yes, you keep saying that.

616
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,475
You're surprisingly short of answers.

617
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,312
Maybe you should let me call him.

618
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:32,025
Yes, brilliant, because you certainly
wouldn't tip him off in any way.

619
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,736
- I could try calling him.
- Quiet, please.

620
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:39,157
Are you mad at me?
I did exactly what you told me to do.

621
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,575
Please, shut up.

622
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,494
- I'm just trying...
- Shut up!

623
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,917
- It's not my fault.
- Of course it's your fault!

624
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,463
Aah!

625
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,264
I find this profoundly distasteful.

626
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,308
I've never had to do anything before!

627
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,810
Now I've no choice.
I can't leave any witnesses.

628
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,229
No, you said you wouldn't kill her.

629
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,631
Lumen.

630
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,301
Lumen?

631
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,772
Is this the only kind of love
I'll eνer find?

632
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,317
The kind that ends in blood?

633
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:18,548
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Jordan Chase.

634
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,759
I have a court order that prevents
him from leaving Miami.

635
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,511
Well, I guess I can go home, then.

636
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,305
- Is he on the plane?
- No. I have no idea where he is.

637
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:29,017
We were scheduled to fly out over
an hour ago and he never showed up.

638
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:39,027
Emily was killed with two blows.

639
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:44,950
Lumen was here.

640
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,370
Multiple footprints in the blood,
a scuffle.

641
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:52,082
More blood, not from Emily,
leading out.

642
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,878
She was running.

643
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:04,428
She's putting up a fight.

644
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:06,346
Lumen.
