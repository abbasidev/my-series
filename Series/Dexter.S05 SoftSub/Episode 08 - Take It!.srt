1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,094
Oye, mami.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,387
Previously on Dexter...

3
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,429
Ven aquí.

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,182
- He's calling me over.
- Officer Manzon, go to him.

5
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,893
Lieutenant, no, this is a problem.
These guys are dangerous.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,353
Stand down, Morgan.

7
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:28,403
Drop the gun now!

8
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,407
Our informant, Yasmin Aragon,
was shot and killed.

9
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,783
This is a fucking disaster.

10
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:36,828
If mistakes were made,
they most certainly were not mine.

11
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,374
- I just gave you 500 bucks.
- And I told you about the girl.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,376
But if you want to find out who she is,

13
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,087
where she's from,
and what she's doing in that damn house,

14
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,755
you're gonna have to pay.

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,217
Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me.
There were others.

16
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:55,346
Besides the ones
that we've already taken care of,

17
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,639
suit and tie.

18
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,476
He'd take off his jacket
and fold it very carefully,

19
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,395
like he didn't want to mess it up.

20
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,731
Someone tried to move
the girls in the barrels.

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,985
- Where's the driver?
- He took off.

22
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,987
That means he's still mine to find.

23
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,947
You're never gonna guess
who this truck is registered to.

24
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,198
Jordan Chase.

25
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,367
Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,827
Do you know this man?

27
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,081
That's the guy who folded his jacket.

28
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:26,252
His name's Cole Harmon.
He's Jordan Chase's head of security.

29
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,837
- That's Cole.
- And Boyd.

30
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,674
- And Dan the Dentist.
- It's them from, like, 15 years ago.

31
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,010
What does this mean?

32
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,461
We are born primal.

33
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,969
Conceived with the impulse to fight

34
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,220
for what we desire.

35
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,811
It's written in our genes.

36
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,024
It's engraved in our souls.

37
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,612
But we've traded
the wilderness for pavement,

38
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,197
trees for skyscrapers.

39
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:04,702
We've lost touch with our instincts,
with what we are.

40
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,080
We have fallen from nature's grace.

41
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,876
But we shall be delivered!

42
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,803
It's time to tap into your primal selves

43
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,140
and seize the power of instinct.

44
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:30,144
We're gonna cast off those shackles

45
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,521
that bind us to jobs we hate,

46
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,440
people we don't love,

47
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,692
lives that aren't worth living.

48
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,404
We are going to...

49
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,448
Take it!

50
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:47,036
I've never been around so many people
that made me feel normal.

51
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,748
Yeah! Yeah!

52
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,375
Really normal.

53
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,669
- The power of risk!
- Take it!

54
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,045
The power of desire.

55
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,213
Take it!

56
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,298
- The power of instinct.
- Take it!

57
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,176
Instincts are all I've ever had.

58
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,720
Cole Harmon, Chase's chief of security -

59
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,431
torturer, rapist, killer.

60
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,600
It's time to tap into my primal self.

61
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,852
- The power of life!
- Take it!

62
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,646
- We're gonna take it!
- Take it!

63
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,649
- Take it! Take it!
- Take it! Take it!

64
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:17,900
All right.

65
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,154
Lieutenant LaGuerta!

66
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,449
Multiple rounds were fired
at the recent Club Mayan shootout.

67
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,869
Was Miami Metro responsible for the deaths
of innocent bystanders?

68
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,247
I have nothing to say at this time.
Excuse me.

69
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,750
Do you agree with the Mayor? Did this
operation needlessly put people at risk?

70
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,211
Every undercover operation is high-risk.

71
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,879
Is there going to be
an independent investigation?

72
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,008
- No comment.
- Have you personally retained counsel?

73
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,968
Counsel?

74
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,680
Isn't it true the victims' families
have filed a civil lawsuit?

75
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:53,060
Let me through.
Excuse me, let me through.

76
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:57,356
Lieutenant LaGuerta, neither confirming
nor denying Miami Metro's culpability

77
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,066
in the recent Club Mayan shootout.

78
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,570
As we know,
two innocent people are dead, six...

79
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,196
Did ballistics come in?

80
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:08,451
Good news. Bullets from the victims' bodies
belong to the Fuentes brothers, not us.

81
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,995
That is good news.

82
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,956
But this is far from over.
I'm sure you heard the Mayor's statement.

83
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,584
A prime example
of how shit just rolls downhill.

84
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,086
He should have kept his mouth shut
until all the facts came out.

85
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,964
He was right.
This operation was too risky.

86
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,259
And now because of us,
two innocent people are dead.

87
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,302
Not by our bullets.

88
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,722
Shots would have never been fired
if we hadn't been set up in that club.

89
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:33,059
- Those are the facts.
- On the upside, Carlos Fuentes is dead.

90
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,273
None of us should have any illusions.
There are gonna be consequences.

91
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,614
Yeah, I've seen that look on her face before.

92
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,033
Someone's about to get bent over
and fucked.

93
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,994
It's gonna be me, isn't it? I screwed up.

94
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,954
No, you didn't. You were following orders.

95
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,998
LaGuerta's orders,
just like the rest of us.

96
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,418
That's what you put in your report, right?
You were following her lead?

97
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,253
I haven't written it yet.

98
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,589
I'm still sorting through the events
in my mind.

99
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,382
Sorting through what exactly?

100
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,717
What I'm gonna say about them.

101
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,720
- Here's a crazy idea. How about the truth?
- Deb, I'm on it.

102
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,192
- Who's that?
- It's Yasmin's mother.

103
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,446
You all right?

104
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:31,158
Three people are dead,
Carlos Fuentes and two girls.

105
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,161
- Nobody's crying about Carlos.
- Fuentes was a scumbag.

106
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,206
Yeah, he's a scumbag
that I shot and killed.

107
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,126
And? What's the problem?

108
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,003
Don't tell me you feel bad
about killing him.

109
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,589
I don't.

110
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,926
That's the problem.

111
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,855
Yasmin didn't feel any pain.

112
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,109
She died instantly.

113
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,242
- I'm ready.
- OK.

114
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,589
I have some bad news for everyone.

115
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,509
You're all going to die.

116
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,472
Some of us sooner than others.

117
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,894
And if you're not in touch with
your primal self, you're already dead.

118
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,937
You may be breathing
and walking around,

119
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,732
but you're an empty shell,
just one of the herd,

120
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,194
completely unaware
of what you truly want.

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,864
And when we come back,
we're gonna start using your instincts

122
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,658
to design the life that you deserve,

123
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,036
fuel the passion to make it real,

124
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,787
and find the power...

125
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,582
...to take it.

126
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,797
Jordan Chase's Take It Now
Experience will resume at 2:00pm.

127
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:12,968
In the meantime,
we invite you to visit our vendors.

128
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,055
Jordan promises change,

129
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,349
but he also accepts credit cards.

130
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,939
- Lumen?
- Can you talk?

131
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,942
Or are you about to have
a major life revelation?

132
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,612
No, that came around 9:00am,
when I realised I really wanted a doughnut.

133
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,864
What'd you find?

134
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,076
I haven't been able to find out
how these guys know each other.

135
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,620
The picture was taken
when they were teenagers, but...

136
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,996
Did you check high schools?

137
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,041
Cole went to Westland Prep in Hialeah,

138
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,920
and Dan the Dentist went to
St Joseph's Academy in Coral Gables.

139
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,172
Boyd... There's nothing on Boyd.

140
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,509
Yeah, he probably never saw
the inside of too many classrooms.

141
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,095
I was able to find out
something else about Cole.

142
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,138
- What?
- He was in the Marines.

143
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,641
He got bounced
on dishonourable discharge.

144
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,560
He beat up a superior officer
and put him in the hospital.

145
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,229
This is a dangerous guy, Dexter.

146
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,481
Do you remember the marks
I had on my back?

147
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,317
That was Cole.

148
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,321
- So be careful.
- Are you getting any rest?

149
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:19,285
I fall into a deep sleep
from 1:00 to 1: 15 every morning.

150
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,497
When this is over,
I expect to sleep for a year.

151
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,501
I'll talk to you later.

152
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,628
Mr Morgan. Cole Harmon.

153
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,298
I'm sure you remember me
from our visit to the station.

154
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,592
Mr Chase spotted you from the stage.
He's very interested in speaking with you.

155
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,178
He was wondering if you'd join him
in his suite for a few minutes.

156
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,722
Uh...

157
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,181
OK. When?

158
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,309
How about right now?

159
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,982
All the way to the end.

160
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,882
I'm disgusted, to tell you the truth. You
haven't been listening to a word I've said.

161
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,968
Call me back when you stop
being a piece of furniture.

162
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,638
Sorry. New client.

163
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,933
Good to see you again, Mr Morgan,
especially under better circumstances.

164
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,852
- Call me Dexter.
- Jordan.

165
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,480
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Uh...

166
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,231
No, thanks. I'm good.

167
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,400
- Think I know why you're here.
- You do?

168
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,779
You're searching for a way
to cope with your loss.

169
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,238
I know your history, Dexter.

170
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,699
I thought I recognised you
when we met at the station,

171
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,743
but it hit me later on.

172
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,870
Your wife was murdered.

173
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,164
- Yes.
- Are they any closer to catching Trinity?

174
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,250
Not that I'm aware of.

175
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,544
I followed that case very closely.

176
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,630
Trinity, a religious man,

177
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,340
a family, good life.

178
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,592
Yet he was working through such rage,

179
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,511
harbouring so many secrets.

180
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,680
I have to be honest.
He fascinated me on a deep level.

181
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,891
What else do Jordan and I
have in common?

182
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,936
I certainly don't mean to imply
any sympathy for him.

183
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,188
He's a monster, no question.

184
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,153
I can't imagine your frustration,
knowing he's out there, unpunished.

185
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,155
It hasn't been easy.

186
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,074
No doubt.

187
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,453
And now you're a single father,
which has its own set of challenges.

188
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,958
Why did you want to see me?

189
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:35,879
I've developed a theory
on how the primal self deals with tragedy.

190
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,966
I have to prepare for the next session,

191
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,926
but I am very interested
in what happened to you.

192
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:45,347
I would like to discuss your situation in
depth at another time if you're open to that.

193
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,892
- OK.
- OK.

194
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,229
By the way, have you made
any progress on Boyd Fowler?

195
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,356
I'm not really aware of all the details.

196
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,442
You should probably speak
to one of the detectives.

197
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,901
Of course.

198
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,070
I look forward to our next talk.

199
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,036
There's a little something in there
for Harrison.

200
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,419
Thanks.

201
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,222
- You wanted to see me?
- Close the door.

202
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,859
You know there's a lot of heat
coming down on us,

203
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,820
and the public's demanding blood,
our blood.

204
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,823
Matthews wants someone's head.

205
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,950
Sounds like Santa Muerte's catching on.

206
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,371
I'm putting Cira Manzon
on disciplinary leave.

207
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,833
- What?
- I need to put a face on it.

208
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,460
What's wrong with your face?

209
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,046
- Detective...
- You can't pin this on her.

210
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,342
- Her actions precipitated the shooting.
- She wasn't even supposed to be there.

211
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,178
- I tried to take her off, you wouldn't let me.
- That's your impression.

212
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,138
No, that's what happened.

213
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,433
Look, I was the detective in charge,

214
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,229
so if you want to fuck somebody over,
here's your scapegoat.

215
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,524
I know your instinct
is to take the fall for your team.

216
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,778
You were on my team.
In fact, you fuckin' took over my team,

217
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:26,031
and I had your back, cos your team,
my team, whatever, it's all the fuckin' same.

218
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,033
Cira's just starting out.

219
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,119
Her career will take the smallest hit.

220
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,996
She'll recover quickly.

221
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,457
If something like that
had happened to me back then,

222
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,709
I never would have made detective.

223
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,170
We were all there together.

224
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:44,424
So why can't we just hold tight
and weather the fuckin' storm together?

225
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,344
Fuckin' think about it.

226
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,029
- Does your printer ever work?
- Lu?

227
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,533
Owen.

228
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,079
- How are you?
- Um...

229
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,039
Um...

230
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,417
I bet you're tan.

231
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:22,212
The sun feels closer here, even though
I know it actually physically is not,

232
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,089
it feels like it's right there.

233
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,675
You're in Miami?

234
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,136
I got a sunburn just renting the car.

235
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,015
I came to see you.

236
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,516
You did?

237
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,602
Lu, I've respected your wishes.

238
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:40,230
Since the day of the wedding, I haven't
called, emailed, I haven't even texted.

239
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:47,112
It's like my life stopped that day
when you left, and I need to get unstuck.

240
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,407
I feel the way to do that
is to see you, face to face,

241
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:54,411
without 75 of our closest friends and family
staring at us.

242
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,247
Please, will you see me?

243
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,919
I...

244
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,963
- I can't tonight.
- Tomorrow.

245
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,302
Lu?

246
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,471
I'm staying at
the Blue Pelican Motel.

247
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,641
There's a café across the street.
Meet me there tomorrow at noon, OK?

248
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,601
OK, noon.

249
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,812
Hey.

250
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,482
- Hey.
- I got you some supper.

251
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,651
Hot and sour soup,
fried rice with tofu.

252
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,570
- That's what you like, right?
- Yeah, that's fine.

253
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,575
No, I'm not staying.

254
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,245
Oh, right. Harrison.

255
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,667
You're tired.

256
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:45,379
I spent the entire day
staring at that laptop,

257
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,131
and I got exactly nowhere.

258
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,843
Well, the good news is you won't be
on that computer tomorrow.

259
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,638
- I have something I need you to do.
- What?

260
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,181
- Shopping.
- What kind of shopping?

261
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:01,269
Supplies. We have to make a room
where Cole will be dispatched.

262
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,230
It has to be covered in plastic.

263
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,982
So does Cole.

264
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,609
To catch the blood.

265
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,030
I made a list.

266
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:16,743
Duct tape, 30 yards
of clear polyethylene sheeting.

267
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,746
And garbage bags, three mil, black.

268
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,167
- When are you gonna do it?
- Tomorrow.

269
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,169
I booked a room right next to Cole's.

270
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,921
You're gonna do it in the hotel?

271
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,923
No choice.

272
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,800
Jordan's next gig is in Sarasota.

273
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,803
He and Cole will be hitting the road
right after the seminar ends.

274
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,181
So...

275
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,893
...tomorrow night's the night.

276
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,063
There's a parking lot right on the corner
of Fourth and Bay.

277
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,983
Meet me there tomorrow at noon
and I'll pick up the supplies.

278
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,902
One o'clock would be better,

279
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,280
just so I have enough time to shop.

280
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,615
Sure.

281
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,576
What?

282
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,413
A few months ago,
I was shopping for a wedding dress,

283
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,665
and now I'm shopping for...

284
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,626
30 yards of polyethylene sheeting.

285
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:13,216
It's crazy, isn't it, how... quickly
you can get used to the supremely weird?

286
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,177
Tell me about it.

287
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,608
- Thanks for covering.
- No problem. Sonya just left.

288
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,654
Urgh. Jordan Chase.

289
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,491
I know you're hurting,
so I'll reserve judgment,

290
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,243
but I gotta draw the line somewhere.

291
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,496
It was free.

292
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,542
It can't hurt, can it?
Maybe I'll come away with something.

293
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,462
Yeah, a really ugly onesie.

294
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:54,257
I don't know. If it's working,
who am I to poop on your parade?

295
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,259
And your day?

296
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,764
I've got six mandatory sessions
with a shrink

297
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,642
coming at me because of Carlos Fuentes.

298
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,646
Feels like a big, fat
fucking waste of time too.

299
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:11,942
I mean, I'd kill that fucktard all over again.
I'd empty a fucking magazine in him.

300
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:19,157
OK. Maybe that's something
worth talking about.

301
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,289
I always thought if I landed a bullet
that it would bother me...

302
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,585
that it would...

303
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,840
it would be a burden
to take another life.

304
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,179
They don't issue guns to lab geeks,
so you have no idea what I'm talking about.

305
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,306
I can imagine.

306
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,353
I don't feel bad. Me, of all people.

307
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,939
I don't feel anything.

308
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,196
Maybe I've just run out.

309
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,033
Dad once told me that...

310
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,495
some people deserve to die.

311
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,334
You believe that?

312
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,504
You believe some people
deserve to die?

313
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,340
Some people don't deserve to live.

314
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,512
Trinity should be dead.
Not Rita, not Lundy.

315
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,103
Maybe the world is better off
without Carlos Fuentes.

316
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,903
I'd pretty much given up hope.

317
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,947
I figured I was destined
to go through life alone,

318
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,158
and then I started listening
to one of your CDs.

319
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,743
The Primal Self?

320
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,287
I started listening
in the car on the way to work.

321
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:51,374
Three weeks later I met my soul mate,
and now we have a baby on the way!

322
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,087
- Come on up here.
- Come on, honey!

323
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,140
Cole will be at his post
for the rest of the session.

324
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,683
That gives me an hour.

325
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,802
I'll have to do this in the dark.

326
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,721
Fourteen steps to the pillow.

327
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,557
Give him the needle,
and drag him to my room.

328
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,226
Sixty seconds tops.

329
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,359
Jordan's about to lose
his number-one fan.

330
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,418
- Sorry.
- Oh. No, no, it's me. Really.

331
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,548
- You look beautiful.
- I don't, really.

332
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,093
You do. You always do.

333
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,099
- Miami suits you.
- Huh.

334
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,351
You must love
all these Art Deco buildings.

335
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,812
Can't get enough of 'em.

336
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,483
Steph had her baby.

337
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,570
Oh, that's right.
She was due last month.

338
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,739
Yes. Meet Mavis.

339
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,576
Look at her.

340
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,244
Mavis?

341
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,372
Mark's grandmother. The name
came down to Mavis or Madison.

342
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,751
Madison? Your niece
could have been named after the city

343
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,295
where you and I did our Sunday beer runs.

344
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,422
Cooler heads prevailed. Mine.

345
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,258
How is Steph doing?

346
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:10,680
She's tired, glad to not be pregnant
any more, cries at commercials

347
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,433
and is transcendently happy.

348
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:19,147
Your parents miss you.
They'd like to know that you're safe.

349
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,400
You... can tell them.

350
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,945
Well, I'm thinking of not going back too.

351
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,156
- What?
- You were right.

352
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,992
We were trapped in our jobs,
trapped in that city.

353
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,204
We'd have been trapped in a life
we didn't want. It's time for that to change.

354
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,918
- Owen?
- Lu...

355
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,879
I bought these round-the-world tickets.
Broke the bank.

356
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,924
We can literally hop on
and hop off in any city.

357
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,592
I love you.

358
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,097
No matter what you do,
whoever you are,

359
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,140
I want to take this journey with you.

360
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,356
Have you met someone?

361
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:05,110
I've met a lot of people here,
but not like you're thinking.

362
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,238
I can't just leave.

363
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,241
Me showing up like this is sudden, I know.

364
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,536
We had five years.

365
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,663
Take a night to think it over.

366
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,543
I'm going either way,
but I'd rather go with you.

367
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:25,755
Meet me here tomorrow night
and tell me your decision.

368
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,594
God fucking damn it.

369
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,721
- What is it?
- Un-fucking-believable.

370
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,348
Lieutenant, will there be any other...

371
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,808
I don't know who your sources are,

372
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,311
but I can confirm that Detective Morgan
was in charge of the operation.

373
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,231
- Holy shit.
- She's blaming everything on me.

374
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,401
Is it true that Detective Morgan
has been placed on disciplinary leave?

375
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,488
As of today, she's being placed
on immediate suspension with pay,

376
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,240
pending the results of...

377
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,242
Whoa! Not the plasma.

378
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,577
Excuse me.

379
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,120
I thought we were actually friends.

380
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,247
Deb, wait.

381
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,041
I can't do it.

382
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,128
I can't let her throw me under the bus
and drive over me,

383
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,214
then back up a few fuckin' times
and drive off.

384
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,063
Oh.

385
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,901
Fuck! Shit! Fuck!

386
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,527
Didn't you see me driving up?

387
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,904
Didn't you see me backing out?

388
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,450
You know, there's a reason
why cars have rear-view mirrors, lady!

389
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,452
I mean, shit, look at that.

390
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:41,748
This here's fibreglass. Can't pound that out.
I'm gonna have to pull that whole panel off.

391
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,583
How do I know
it wasn't already there?

392
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,543
You just hit my car.

393
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,588
I was distracted.
Just let me give you some cash.

394
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,216
No cash! I don't want cash!

395
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:54,093
We'll do this on the up-and-up,
cos that's the kind of guy I am.

396
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,804
We just let the insurance dudes
hash this out.

397
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,514
You do have insurance, don't you?

398
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:02,143
- Yeah.
- Well, halle-fuckin'-lujah.

399
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:06,105
Now, let's just trade some info here
and get this sorted out.

400
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,319
Look, now, we can either
do this the right way,

401
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,072
or I can call up the police,
let Miami's finest handle it.

402
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,866
- It's your call.
- No. No, no, no. I...

403
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,461
The Jordan Chase
Experience seminar

404
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,838
will resume tomorrow
at 8:00am sharp.

405
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,423
Vendors are open tonight till 7:00pm.

406
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,634
How was your day?

407
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,803
I guess working for Jordan has its benefits.

408
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,641
- Hello?
- I'm here.

409
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:42,976
I'm on my way.

410
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,103
No, I mean, I'm here in the lobby.

411
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,613
- What are you doing here?
- I got into a car accident.

412
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,700
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

413
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:02,120
It was my fault.
Actually, no, it was Owen's fault.

414
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,707
Owen who?

415
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,501
My ex-fiancé.

416
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,670
He's in Miami.

417
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,172
Why?

418
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,758
He came to see me.

419
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,887
Don't worry, I didn't tell him
anything about anything.

420
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:22,724
He asked me to go away with him.

421
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,854
Just up and leave all this behind.

422
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,692
As if I could.

423
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,778
You could, you know.

424
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,658
Do you want me to go?

425
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,786
If you want to, go.

426
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,961
This is the only part of my life
that makes sense any more.

427
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,757
- What about Owen?
- He's leaving.

428
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,508
- When?
- Tomorrow.

429
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,473
Stay the night.

430
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,684
The seminar's out for the day, and Cole
could be anywhere. He could see you.

431
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,062
It's too risky to have you
walk through the lobby again.

432
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:15,234
If I stay... does that mean
you're not gonna kill Cole tonight?

433
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,363
No, it's still happening.

434
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,536
We're gonna prepare the room together.

435
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,021
This is all much easier with a partner.

436
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,032
But a partner in what?

437
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,455
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was planning to.

438
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,833
I have no idea
how the press got hold of it.

439
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,876
Maybe it was because
you fucking leaked it.

440
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,670
You'll be a desk jockey for a few weeks,

441
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,880
then your union rep
will have you reinstated.

442
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,425
This time next year,
all will have blown over.

443
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,678
It's just your word against mine
and everybody else that was there.

444
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,639
Some people don't agree with
your version of the events.

445
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,767
Who'd you get to lie for you?

446
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,519
Batista?

447
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,688
Batista's gonna back your fuckin' story?

448
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:37,191
- Do I have to go to Matthews with this?
- You watch yourself, Detective.

449
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,903
We wouldn't want your
reinstatement to be delayed.

450
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,030
God.

451
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:48,453
I was fucking happy for you
when you got married.

452
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:51,789
I thought that you being with Batista
might make you a nicer person.

453
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,461
I never expected you
to fuckin' eat him alive.

454
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,694
Cole's other victims.

455
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,030
Why did you put their pictures up?

456
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,492
Cole needs to see what he's done.

457
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,243
What do you get out of all this?

458
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,788
I like knowing that the men
who did this to you

459
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,749
won't do it to anyone else.

460
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,378
This isn't about me.

461
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,551
- You're standing here.
- Look at all this.

462
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,804
If you didn't know me,
you'd still be in this room.

463
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,142
Boyd wasn't your first.

464
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,980
You've been doing this a long time.

465
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:04,946
It's Cole.

466
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,741
We'll wait for him to go to sleep,

467
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,118
then you take off and I grab him.

468
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,620
What's that?

469
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,957
M-99. Animal tranquilliser.

470
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:20,836
Gives me a few hours to wrap his body
in plastic and secure him to this desk.

471
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,464
You're gonna kill him
while he's still out?

472
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,091
No, I'm gonna wake him up,

473
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,427
see if he'll give up the other two names
of the men in the pictures.

474
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,680
My knife can be very persuasive.

475
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,767
Stay here.

476
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,696
Tie my other arm!

477
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,282
Do it now!

478
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,033
Yes!

479
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,077
Oh. Oh.

480
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,706
Yes!

481
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,332
Oh, God!

482
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,221
No.

483
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,098
No!

484
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,816
No more! Please!

485
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,276
No!

486
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,118
Let me go! Let me out of here!

487
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,894
- What happened?
- You fell asleep.

488
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,646
What about Cole?

489
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:05,066
He's back at the seminar by now.

490
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:10,738
- The screamer spent the night.
- So you're not gonna kill him?

491
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,615
No, I am.

492
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,992
I've been thinking about it all night.

493
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,286
Cole makes his security rounds
at every session.

494
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,996
So...

495
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:23,626
I'll wait for him by the service elevator
and M-99 him there.

496
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,295
I would have rather grabbed him at night,
but I can make this work.

497
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,923
- And what about me?
- You'll wait until the session starts.

498
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,386
Everyone will be in the seminar.
You won't be spotted when you leave.

499
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,013
Just steer clear of the service elevator.

500
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,140
OK.

501
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,894
- I can't believe it.
- What?

502
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,147
I actually slept.

503
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,037
- Hey. Do you want to get up?
- No.

504
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,414
Do you want to go back to sleep?

505
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,582
- No.
- Do you want to just...

506
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,043
No, I don't want to do anything.
I just want to lie here.

507
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,546
It's Sunday. I'm allowed.

508
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,509
LaGuerta's an evil bitch.

509
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,053
No, she's not.

510
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,976
Maybe she is.

511
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,981
The best way to get back at her
is to do exactly what she says.

512
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:30,401
Go on leave, talk to your union rep,
get reinstated,

513
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,363
then come back
and kick as much ass as you possibly can.

514
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,411
No one, not even LaGuerta,

515
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,163
can deny that you're a great detective.

516
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,957
At the end of the day,
you'll be the one left standing.

517
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,461
- At the end of the day?
- Yeah, you know, when all is said and done.

518
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,223
Sounds like one very long day.

519
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,813
Hey.

520
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,815
- I smell coffee.
- Now's not a good time.

521
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,358
Well, it is for me.

522
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,155
- Hey, Debra Morgan.
- Liddy, right?

523
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,325
- Good memory. I like this one.
- This one?

524
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:23,412
You and I got something in common.
We've both been fucked over by LaGuerta.

525
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,624
Well, maybe we should make
matching T-shirts or something.

526
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,127
OK. Well, this one's going
for a fuckin' breakfast burrito.

527
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,254
I'll see you two later.

528
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,469
Call before you come over.
It's a common courtesy.

529
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,180
Don't you want to know about this girl
shacked up with Dexter Morgan?

530
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:45,518
I just staged a little meet and greet with her.
Old PI move.

531
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,687
- So you met her.
- Name, Lumen Pierce.

532
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,232
Lumen. Stupid fuckin' name.

533
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:52,942
From Minneapolis, Minnesota.

534
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,986
Supposed to be married three months ago,
picture in the paper and everything.

535
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,238
Just takes off.

536
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:03,160
Shows up here in Miami one week before
your boy's wife, Rita Morgan, is murdered.

537
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,622
- Now, what do you think of that?
- I don't know. Is that all you got?

538
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,167
- It's a hell of lot more than I had yesterday.
- Well, stay on it.

539
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,462
- I'd love to, but I am running out of loot.
- I just paid you last week.

540
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,674
And I just fucked up my car
getting this info for you, Quinn.

541
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,426
Now, this boy is dirty.
What you gonna do about it?

542
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:20,553
I'm not giving you any more.

543
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,222
You know, I thought you and me
had an understanding.

544
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:27,726
I mean, it'd be a shame if the skirt
you're boning finds out about all this.

545
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,898
- And how would that happen?
- I don't know.

546
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,733
Things go wrong every day.

547
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,694
Fuckin' motherfucker!

548
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,365
You two are starting
to sound more alike every day.

549
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,200
Must be love.

550
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,954
Tragedy.

551
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,041
Many of us here have experienced it
in one form or another.

552
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,919
The kind that leaves you wondering
if there's a reason to go on living.

553
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,424
For two days, you've heard me talking about
getting in touch with your primal self.

554
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,678
But how does the primal self
deal with loss?

555
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,265
Cole's starting his rounds. He'll reach
the service eleνator in five minutes.

556
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,892
In three minutes, so will I.

557
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:11,270
There's someone in this room
who is dealing with that very question.

558
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,480
Dexter Morgan.

559
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,443
Come and join me onstage, Dexter.

560
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,238
I know you weren't expecting this,
but it's important.

561
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,698
Please.

562
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,950
So much for slipping out quietly.

563
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,870
- Dexter! They want you, Dexter.
- Dexter, Dexter.

564
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,622
Dexter.

565
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,208
Dexter, Dexter.

566
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,420
Dexter, Dexter.

567
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,318
Dexter works with Miami Metro Homicide.

568
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,196
Recently, he lost his wife.

569
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,073
She was murdered...

570
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,909
...by the Trinity Killer.

571
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:12,498
The very person
that Dexter's department was hunting.

572
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,334
You were the one to find her,
your wife? Rita?

573
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,337
Yeah.

574
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,505
Yes.

575
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,716
I'm gonna ask you to do something,
and it's gonna be very difficult.

576
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,969
I want you to relive that moment.

577
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:31,308
According to the newspapers, you were
supposed to be going away on honeymoon?

578
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,438
Dexter.

579
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,148
Y-Yes.

580
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,275
Tell us about it.

581
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:47,032
Well, we postponed the honeymoon
because we had a new baby, a boy.

582
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,911
Keep going. Tell me how you found her.

583
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,956
Please.

584
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,170
I'd come home after work.

585
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,297
I remember
walking through the house.

586
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:07,636
I turned the corner and...

587
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,058
...it's like time actually slowed down...

588
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,478
...and then stopped.

589
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,066
It's just a series of pictures.

590
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,777
What'd you see?

591
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,489
I saw my son sitting in blood.

592
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,952
He was crying.

593
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,874
So much blood.

594
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:45,257
And she was there in the tub.
She'd bled out. Her eyes were still open.

595
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,635
I want you to tell me something, Dexter.
I want you to be very honest.

596
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:52,389
What did you feel in that moment?

597
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,391
We want to know.

598
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,315
It's difficult to put into words.

599
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,649
Everything...

600
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,028
...fell apart. I felt...

601
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,530
Shattered?

602
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,784
Yes.

603
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,452
When the primal self is shattered,

604
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,539
it reaches out in search of
what will make it whole again.

605
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,291
Do you feel that, Dexter?

606
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,752
That hunger inside you
to be whole again?

607
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:25,339
- I do.
- That hunger is your primal self.

608
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,050
You must open your heart
and listen to what it's saying.

609
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,136
- Many people after suffering a tragedy...
- Mr Harmon?

610
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,639
...spend the rest of their lives
as broken beings...

611
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,767
- Can you sign this, please?
- ... living in the past.

612
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:40,646
Your primal self is crying out to be whole.

613
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,440
What is it that will make you whole?

614
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,528
For some, it's a new job.
For others, the love of another person.

615
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,738
Your primal self will tell you,

616
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,741
but you have to be open
to hearing the message. Are you?

617
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,034
Yes.

618
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,372
Then you've just taken your first step
toward happiness.

619
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,677
Dexter.

620
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,657
You fuckin' bitch!

621
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,084
Not this time.

622
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,478
I'm gonna take this gag out of your mouth,

623
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:47,814
but if you make one sound I don't like,
I'm gonna cut your eyes out.

624
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,194
Blink, so I know you understand.

625
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,451
We know about Boyd

626
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,453
and Dan the Dentist.

627
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,205
And now you.

628
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:05,499
Who are the others?

629
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,293
The guy who held a watch up to my ear.

630
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:14,049
"Tick tick tick.
That's the sound of your life running out."

631
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,177
What are their names?

632
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,182
What did he say?

633
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,982
Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

634
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,778
Look at the women
whose lives you destroyed.

635
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,446
Look. Look.

636
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,082
Death was the only kindness
you showed them.

637
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,772
It's a shame you can only die once.

638
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:44,056
You said I'd done this before. That's true.

639
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,226
This is who I am.

640
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,862
When I was a child, my mother
was murdered in front of me, and it...

641
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,825
...shattered me.

642
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,664
I've done this ever since.

643
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,962
Because for the longest time,
it was the only way I could feel...

644
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,635
...unbroken.

645
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:29,559
And then Rita was killed
and none of this made sense any more.

646
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,611
Until now.

647
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:53,125
Miguel couldn't. My father couldn't.

648
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,586
Can anyone live with the truth
of what I am?

649
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,399
Is Lumen what will make me whole?

650
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,997
Moving in?

651
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,751
The Lieutenant said I should bring
some of my stuff into this department.

652
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,130
It was you.

653
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:43,633
LaGuerta asked you to back her story,
and of course you did.

654
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,972
Deb.

655
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,641
- Deb?
- Detective Morgan...

656
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:57,105
you're the youngest woman in Miami Metro
to ever make detective,

657
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,317
and I really admire you, like, a lot.

658
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,445
And I came here
hoping to learn from you.

659
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,783
What you did...

660
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,994
you would never learn from me.

661
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:16,291
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

662
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,268
Deb.

663
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:39,231
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to set the record straight.

664
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,109
I thought you were backing LaGuerta's story.

665
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:46,154
No, I didn't know what I was gonna do.

666
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,407
I was stuck between a rock and my wife,

667
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:52,702
but I decided I'm backing you.

668
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,871
Might not go over too well at home.

669
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,876
You're flesh and blood to me,
like my kid sister,

670
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:03,129
but better,
because I actually like you.

671
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,259
Damn.

672
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,386
It's OK.

673
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,806
Yeah.

674
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,266
It's OK.

675
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,494
Most people wait until the seminar is over
before checking out.

676
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,831
Uh... I lose my nanny in an hour.
I gotta get back to my son.

677
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,668
- Is everything OK?
- It's nothing important.

678
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,170
Just a little security glitch.

679
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,466
Like your chief of security's head
is in my luggage?

680
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:50,427
I want to thank you
for coming onstage.

681
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,679
It didn't seem like I had any choice.

682
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,265
I know it was sudden,
and you probably didn't appreciate it.

683
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,851
But you'll look back on it,
you'll realise it was worth it.

684
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:02,397
Don't forget what happened
here this weekend, Dexter.

685
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,858
- I won't.
- Act on what you've learned.

686
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,484
Don't let it slip away.

687
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,236
It's what I tell my clients.

688
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,529
Tick tick tick?

689
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,032
That's the sound of your life running out.

690
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,994
My primal instincts were right.
Jordan's one of them.

691
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,208
- Take it, Dexter.
- Oh, I will.

692
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:39,267
It's a law of physics
that elements want to unify.

693
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:58,536
Single cells in a Petri dish
thrash around until they coalesce.

694
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:11,216
And events in the universe
that once seemed random

695
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,678
are eventually revealed to have
an underlying connectedness.

696
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:17,764
Jordan Chase is one of them.
I'm sure of it.

697
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,933
"Tick tick tick."

698
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,852
But he wasn't in the photo.

699
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,313
Maybe he took the photo, I don't know.

700
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,526
We're gonna take down Jordan Chase?

701
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:38,034
First things first.

702
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,459
Just... let go?

703
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,730
Just let go.
