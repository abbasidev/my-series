1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,803
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:15,473
Cut him, and I'll blow your fucking head off.

3
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,517
Medic! I need a fucking medic!

4
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,977
We were wondering
if there's anything you can tell us

5
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:22,438
about the man who injured you.

6
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,691
I know where Carlos and his
brother have been hanging out -

7
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,526
at a local club
called The Mayan.

8
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,445
- You got your lead. Congrats.
- Yeah, we stake this place out,

9
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,782
they show up, and then we take
these Santa Muerta no-dicks down for good.

10
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,826
- Are you and Quinn...
- We're fuck buddies.

11
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,619
Don't bring him around
when Harrison's here.

12
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,874
- Would you like some coffee?
- That would be wonderful.

13
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,001
Son of a bitch.

14
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,256
- Hey, hey, hey! Sergeant!
- Angel, let him go. This is a sting!

15
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,926
IA needed my help
to bust a narcotics cop on the take,

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,221
and I said yes,
to close the books on your bar fight!

17
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:59,350
- Fuck those IA rats.
- And your boss.

18
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,811
That bitch put handcuffs on me.

19
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,563
I might have a job for you.

20
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,524
- You got a name?
- Dexter Morgan.

21
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,068
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me.

22
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,030
There were others.

23
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,575
What are you gonna do if you
actually find one of these guys?

24
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,785
- What you won't.
- You going to kill them?

25
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,329
You don't get to tell me
what to do.

26
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:22,999
What are you doing?

27
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,710
You were about to murder
the wrong man.

28
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,795
Go home.

29
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,840
OK. OK, OK, I'll go.

30
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:34,177
You're doing the right thing.
Your parents will be happy to see you.

31
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:35,303
Thank you.

32
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,681
Maybe this is one problem
I can check off the list.

33
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,937
Welcome to Miami.

34
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,857
I've always tried to keep
the different parts of my life separate.

35
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,822
Becoming a father
made that much more difficult.

36
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,868
And as a husband, I failed.

37
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,287
But I'm a very neat monster...

38
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,291
who won't make
the same mistake again.

39
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,508
I packed up Rita's wedding dress.
I thought Astor might want it someday.

40
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,975
Feels like it took you guys
months to move in...

41
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,603
Only a day to pack up.

42
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,230
The realtor suggested
we paint the walls white.

43
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,067
She wants to stage the house
Miami Chic.

44
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,569
No evidence that a family
ever lived here.

45
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,862
Or died here.

46
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,448
You have to disclose that,
don't you?

47
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,617
The hope is that a ridiculously low
listing price

48
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,203
will help a buyer see past that.

49
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,664
Any idea where you want to live?

50
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,252
I'm sorry. That was a stupid question.
You should take the apartment.

51
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,254
No. No, that's yours.

52
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,341
No, I insist. It's really always been yours.

53
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,095
- I'll move out.
- I thought you already did.

54
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,139
I didn't move in with Quinn.

55
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,600
Well, you're never around.

56
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,603
I'm at Quinn's, but I don't live there.

57
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,439
No clothes in any drawers.

58
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,693
There's no his-and-hers toothbrush action.

59
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,946
Quinn's place is all Quinn.

60
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,323
A vast, empty space?

61
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,082
I don't remember Rita in these.

62
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,543
Because they belong to Lumen.

63
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,294
Me either.

64
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,841
Lumen is home in Minneapolis,

65
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,510
another part of my life
packed away.

66
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,224
Life seems different now.

67
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,310
Manageable.

68
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,984
Everything in its right place.

69
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,649
Soon, Lance Robinson
will be on my table.

70
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,070
Lance trawls the internet,

71
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,865
engaging in casual encounters
with innocent men...

72
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,870
who never suspect those encounters
could turn deadly.

73
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,170
Four times Lance deliberately pushed
someone's fantasies too far.

74
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,717
He will be an easy kill,
just like old times.

75
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,763
Tonight's the night.

76
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,291
OK, people.
Let's go over our positions at Club Mayan.

77
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,170
Everybody be in place by 10.
Batista and I'll be in the van, as usual.

78
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,923
Quinn, you'll watch the door.
Cira...

79
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,052
- Yes, Chief?
- Don't let me stop you.

80
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,974
Officer Manzon, you'll be on the floor
watching foot traffic at the VIP room,

81
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,894
- in case the Fuentes brothers roll through.
- And what if they don't?

82
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,189
Then we'll work
the operation until they do.

83
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,692
You were face to face
with Carlos Fuentes, right?

84
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:05,734
Yes, sir.

85
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,570
Then that means
he knows that we're onto him.

86
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,114
Tell me why they would ever
return to this club.

87
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,366
The only reason the Fuentes brothers
are forcing people

88
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,620
to withdraw cash from the ATM,
is to pay for table service at this club.

89
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,791
We ran the dates of the ATM hold-ups
past the club managers.

90
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,252
And they confirmed
that on each of those nights,

91
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,462
the Fuentes brothers
showed up at Club Mayan,

92
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,298
and took over the VIP lounge.

93
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,885
So if the Fuentes brothers do show up
at this club, which is highly unlikely,

94
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,054
it means that someone is possibly
lying on the floor of their living room

95
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,140
without their head.

96
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,767
We're working
the only lead we have.

97
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,146
All you're doing is drinking and dancing
on the taxpayer's dime.

98
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,358
I would have expected
more from you, Morgan.

99
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,163
Chief.

100
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,665
We don't have
a lot of options here.

101
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,502
Without this operation, we're effectively stopping work on
this
case,

102
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,129
which we cannot do to this community.

103
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,423
Did you even know
this operation was happening?

104
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,342
Of course I knew. Why wouldn't I?

105
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,054
Well, it seems you've been spending
a lot of time lately with Internal Affairs

106
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,514
bailing your new husband
out of hot water.

107
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,433
Bravo, Mrs Batista.

108
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,102
I'm keeping my name.

109
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:26,106
And I think working Club Mayan is
a valid allocation of my squad's resources.

110
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,150
It is your squad, Lieutenant.

111
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,194
- How you manage it is up to you.
- Thank you.

112
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,238
But if another murder goes up on the board,

113
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,657
it's your ass on the line, not mine.

114
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,083
You have one more night at Club Mayan.
Make something happen.

115
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,044
Matthews doesn't have
much faith in us, does he?

116
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,672
Well, that fight you had at the bar
didn't help anything.

117
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,383
- He knows about the bar fight?
- Of course he knows.

118
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,469
A narcotics officer got suspended
because of that bar fight.

119
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,973
No. A narcotics officer got suspended
because of you.

120
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,558
- Me?
- You ran to IAD.

121
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,310
You cooked up the sting.

122
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,479
You basically got Stan Liddy fired.

123
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,065
And got all the charges
against you dropped.

124
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,358
I didn't ask for any of that.

125
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,860
I could have handled whatever
IAD had coming my way.

126
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,697
- Oh, so anything that happens is fine?
- When it happens to me, yes.

127
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,282
I can take care of myself.

128
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,534
But now we're married,
whatever happens to me, happens to you.

129
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,619
That's right. That's exactly right.

130
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,746
- We're married.
- Well, here's what's bothering me.

131
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,749
You weren't looking out for me
out of some sense of compassion.

132
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,793
You were taking care of yourself.

133
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,713
God forbid your name
should lose some of its shine.

134
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,010
- Get out of my office.
- Mm-hm.

135
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,204
- Hey.
- I thought you might want a debriefing

136
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,123
before we hit Club Mayan.

137
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,917
Um, sort of... not a good time.

138
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,130
Where's Quinn,
and what have you done with him?

139
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,549
I know, I know. Uh...

140
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,842
Just give me an hour.

141
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,596
- An hour.
- Yeah.

142
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,807
Who's naked
in your apartment?

143
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,476
No one is naked.

144
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,227
Then what?

145
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,356
- I'm such a fucking idiot.
- Debra, wait.

146
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,067
Come here.
Debra, come here.

147
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,572
Debra Morgan,
this is Stan Liddy.

148
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:43,327
Liddy had a run-in with IAD
and, uh, got suspended.

149
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,539
We're prepping him
for his union-rep meeting tomorrow.

150
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,791
Sorry.

151
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,710
All clothes are staying on.

152
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,296
- I'll just...
- Meet me there?

153
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,964
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

154
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,305
You are boning
our target's sister?

155
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,975
Just tell me what you found out
on Dexter Morgan.

156
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,144
Well...

157
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,147
your boy's squeaky clean on paper.

158
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,441
He's only been out
of the country once, to Paris.

159
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,612
Pays his bills on time,
keeps to himself.

160
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,865
I'll tell you, it's all too neat
and a little too phoney.

161
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,452
You see drug dealers
with the very same profiles all the time.

162
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,038
Ah. That's exactly
what I'm thinking.

163
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,665
I mean, what's he hiding?

164
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,334
Peekaboo.

165
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,800
"Bye-bye, Daddy."
Peekaboo!

166
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,804
Oh, thank you.

167
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,473
You're really very good with him.

168
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,517
I wish I didn't have
to work tonight.

169
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,894
The lab fell so far behind
while I was out.

170
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,522
Night's the only time I can ever
get anything done.

171
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,900
Well, I hope the lieutenant
appreciates your dedication.

172
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,319
I'm pretty sure she does.

173
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,322
Although tonight
will be dedicated to Lance.

174
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,411
So, you think about midnight, then?

175
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,121
I'll try to make it sooner.

176
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,123
Can you say,
"Bye-bye, Daddy"?

177
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,251
Die-die.

178
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,461
Did you hear that?

179
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,215
- He said, "Die-die."
- Don't be silly. He said, "Bye-bye."

180
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,092
Harrison's first word.

181
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,844
There's a good boy.

182
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,804
I hope so.

183
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,224
Die-die.

184
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,643
From the mouth of babes.

185
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:42,279
I rented an RV, placed an ad online
saying I was cruising down to The Keys,

186
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,072
and just like that...

187
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,576
my victim came to me.

188
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,498
You must be
ten inches of pure steel.

189
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,374
You betcha.

190
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,011
Compartmentalisation began
as an architectural theory -

191
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,139
divide buildings into sections
which can be closed off

192
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,808
to prevent a fire
from spreading.

193
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,687
Life can also be divided
into closed-off sections.

194
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,440
Makes everything much simpler.

195
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,241
Lumen Pierce.

196
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,333
Again?

197
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,591
This is the life
Harry wanted for me...

198
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,719
carefully divided.

199
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,097
Shh!

200
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,275
What the hell?

201
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,697
Dexter!

202
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,990
I...

203
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,700
I shot one of them.

204
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,536
I killed him.

205
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:16,415
I'm at the marina...
Bayshore, Biscayne or something?

206
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,085
- You're in Miami?
- I never left.

207
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,798
Oh, there's so much blood.

208
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,383
What do I do?

209
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,512
Hello? Hello?

210
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,472
Dexter, don't hang up on me!

211
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,766
Please, help me.

212
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,438
Don't move.
Don't do anything.

213
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:01,710
The M-99 will wear off in a few short hours.
Not much time to contain the situation...

214
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,755
Not much time...

215
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,923
to protect my simple life.

216
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,105
First, for good luck...
let me see your neck.

217
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,038
I fucking love my job.

218
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,957
Look, I'm gonna go take a lap
through the VIP.

219
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,630
- She's cute.
- Yeah, she's all right.

220
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,215
I could do you both.

221
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,138
That's the sixth girl
that's hit on him.

222
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,892
Let's focus on camera three.

223
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,937
That guy, is he hooked up
with the Fuentes brothers?

224
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:05,190
Hey, I'm gonna stay on Quinn.
He may need some backup.

225
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,651
He is supposed to be focusing
on the Fuentes brothers.

226
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,861
He's not supposed to be playing
with her fun bags.

227
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,073
Sounds like someone's jealous.

228
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,492
Why on God's green earth
would I be jealous?

229
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,497
Quinn's a good guy.

230
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,207
I'm not interested.

231
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:27,170
Out there on the dance floor,
shaking his tail feathers.

232
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,213
Really not interested.

233
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,508
Stay single as long as you can.

234
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,510
- Says the newlywed.
- Don't remind me.

235
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:37,305
You've been married for five minutes.
What happened to the honeymoon phase?

236
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,307
I blinked.

237
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,374
Show me where he is.

238
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,338
There was so much blood,
I had... I had to walk away.

239
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,135
The body's in here.

240
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,889
- Anybody see you?
- I don't think so.

241
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,016
- Oh, God, I hope not.
- You killed somebody.

242
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,769
- Because you wouldn't do it for me!
- But you call me to clean up after you.

243
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,813
- I didn't know what to do with the body!
- I don't believe this.

244
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,733
- Just go if you want to go.
- Go? I'm responsible for you.

245
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,485
Everything you do
leads right back to me.

246
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,112
I didn't think it would be
so hard to kill someone.

247
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,535
- Where is he?
- Here.

248
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,499
Oh, shit!

249
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,502
- He was right here.
- Are you sure?

250
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,338
- He was dead.
- Apparently not.

251
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,714
Don't get mad at me.

252
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,883
This isn't how I was planning
to spend my evening.

253
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,760
- Me neither.
- Would you do me a favour?

254
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,428
- What?
- Stop talking.

255
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,557
He's lost a lot of blood,
at least a pint.

256
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,229
One...

257
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,396
two.

258
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,692
Three...

259
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,902
four.

260
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,780
You're a terrible shot,
but you never shot a gun before.

261
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,782
You didn't anticipate
the kickback...

262
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:22,160
One of the many things you didn't anticipate.
Give me the gun.

263
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,458
You must have hit him once.

264
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,628
Where was the point of impact?

265
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,381
Where were you standing?

266
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,885
He was standing here.

267
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,138
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
I go down, you run away.

268
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,349
I get back up, and where do I go?

269
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,312
Here.

270
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,442
Come on!

271
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,868
How'd you even find this guy?

272
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,039
You can talk now.

273
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,001
The night that I was taken,
I had gone to a bar.

274
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,752
I thought that
they spotted me there,

275
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,796
so I went back to that same bar
night after night,

276
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,215
hoping that one of them
would walk through the door.

277
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,968
- I wore a disguise.
- Disguise?

278
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,803
A wig, so they wouldn't recognise me.

279
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,513
I know what a disguise is for.

280
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,225
So, you went to the bar,
you waited for one of them to show up.

281
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,852
Where? What bar?

282
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,062
Hurricane 26.

283
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,441
Hurricane 26 is all the way over
on Ocean Avenue.

284
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,818
How'd you get all the way out here?

285
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,570
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

286
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,280
So, go on.

287
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,032
Tonight one of them showed up.

288
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,451
He didn't know it was me,
so I... I flirted with him.

289
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,745
I asked him if he wanted
to go someplace else.

290
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,457
We got in the car, I pulled out my gun,
and I forced him to drive.

291
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,792
This place seemed deserted,
so we stopped,

292
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,878
- and I marched him inside.
- And you shot him.

293
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,714
No. I asked him for the names
of the other men.

294
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,508
He called me a cunt.
Then I shot him.

295
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,470
How'd you know
he was one of them?

296
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,139
I just... I just knew.

297
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,266
You recognise his face?

298
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,685
No. They kept me blindfolded
most of the time.

299
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,064
So how?

300
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,441
I felt it the minute
he walked in the door.

301
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,777
One of the guys
had this smell like...

302
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,155
old sweat or,
I don't know, chlorine.

303
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,451
When I got in the car with this guy,
there it was, the exact same stench.

304
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,995
You shot someone
based on a feeling and an odour.

305
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,914
I shot the right guy.

306
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,875
You were willing to shoot the wrong guy
under Tuttle Bridge.

307
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,752
This guy was one of them.

308
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,714
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

309
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,967
Did you check his wallet?

310
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,886
- No.
- Did you take his cell phone?

311
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,972
He could have already called
the police, you know.

312
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,182
- I'm new to this!
- You don't even know who you shot!

313
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,767
I shot one of the creeps
who raped me.

314
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,894
- You don't have any proof.
- I'm the proof!

315
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,313
My memory! My experience!

316
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,650
- Hardly the most reliable tools.
- Fuck you!

317
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,903
Fuck me?

318
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,240
Wow.

319
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,491
Just go.

320
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,869
I can find him on my own
and kill him.

321
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,663
Like you killed him
the first time?

322
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,627
I have no idea which direction he went,
if he turned right or...

323
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,010
Blood swipe.

324
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,429
He stopped here to catch his breath,

325
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,973
leaned against the post,
put his hand here.

326
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,852
The directionality of the blood
leads which way?

327
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,313
This way.

328
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,442
You sure know a lot about blood.

329
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,113
So, hypothetically,

330
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,866
an office romance is just
the worst idea ever.

331
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,951
Yeah, I would advise against it.

332
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,037
But, hypothetically...

333
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,540
I can see how you and Quinn
make a lot of sense.

334
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,502
So you would advise against it,
but it would make a lot of sense?

335
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,088
What can I say?
I'm a romantic at heart.

336
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,507
Then why don't you patch stuff up
with your wife?

337
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,509
- It's not that simple.
- It is that simple.

338
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,847
Get your head out of your ass,
and do something nice for her.

339
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,391
Buy her a card, some flowers.

340
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,977
- Get her a puppy.
- A puppy?

341
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,150
Batista.

342
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,485
Where?

343
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,363
Baywater Marina,

344
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,158
Warehouse 12.
I'll be right there.

345
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,494
- Possible homicide.
- I'll get it.

346
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,120
No, I'll go.
This is your baby.

347
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,789
We've been on this for weeks,

348
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,665
and had nothing but our asses
handed to us,

349
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,210
and if for some reason
the Fuentes brothers show up tonight,

350
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,921
then they've already seen my face,
so I'm useless.

351
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,882
And you won't have to see
Quinn hitting on other women.

352
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,344
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah. Good luck.

353
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,720
Yeah, you too.

354
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,108
Mmm. Who are you?

355
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,864
No dial tone.
He didn't call anybody.

356
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,742
Who even uses
a pay phone any more?

357
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,870
People who don't have cell phones.
We caught a break.

358
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,705
But he could have gone anywhere.

359
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,216
What are you doing?

360
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,136
- It's luminol.
- Luminol?

361
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,221
No relation.

362
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,975
The hydrogen peroxide
and sodium hydroxide

363
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,018
react with the iron
present in haemoglobin,

364
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,603
and exhibit a...

365
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,731
...blue glow. See?

366
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,942
Why do you have that
in your purse?

367
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,318
It's not a purse.

368
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,237
And I use this almost every day.

369
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,494
- What is it?
- Crime Scene.

370
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,497
"Crime Scene"?

371
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,584
Are you...

372
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,335
a police officer?

373
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,714
"Baywater Marina, Warehouse 12."
Isn't that...

374
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,012
...here?

375
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,059
Shit. Somebody did see you.

376
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,687
- Oh, fuck!
- No, we still have time.

377
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,190
Patrol can't move until Homicide
arrives on the scene.

378
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,567
That's at least 15 minutes from now.

379
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,277
How long have you been a cop?

380
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,738
- I'm not a cop.
- Well, what are you?

381
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,073
Complicated.

382
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,498
This way. Hurry up.

383
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:54,219
Running pumps the heart faster,
and more blood is spilled.

384
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,646
Look here, how the drops are pooling,

385
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,065
getting closer together.

386
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,108
- He's slowing down?
- Yeah.

387
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,819
This way.

388
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,376
This started out
as an ordinary day.

389
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,670
In one second, everything changed.

390
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,714
Lumen happened.

391
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,551
Why are you here in Miami?
You were getting on a plane to Minneapolis.

392
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:38,680
I tried to get on that plane.
I couldn't.

393
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,265
I had to stay.

394
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,644
The guy I shot tonight,
he would take these three fingers...

395
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,272
- You don't have to tell...
...and shove them in my mouth!

396
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,108
It tasted like metal.

397
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,695
He would keep them there
so I couldn't scream.

398
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:58,074
The other guys would just stuff
a dirty rag in my mouth,

399
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,659
but not this guy.

400
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,953
He liked to hold me down himself.

401
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,708
I saw everything.

402
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,880
How? You were blindfolded.

403
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,098
Is this your monster?

404
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,121
Pardon me,
but I couldn't help noticing

405
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,498
that you've been hanging out
with a fool.

406
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,750
Hmm.

407
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:53,629
- How do you know?
- Cos whoever stood you up... es un idiota.

408
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,715
I'm Angel.

409
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,802
- Yasmin.
- My favourite flower.

410
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,095
Ooh.

411
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,097
- No? OK.
- Mm-mm.

412
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,229
Do you want to get
out of here, Yasminita?

413
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,697
Yeah.

414
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,955
It hurts! Oh, my God!

415
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,957
Calm down.

416
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,709
God... OK.

417
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,172
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna inspect your wounds.

418
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,346
Yeah, one gunshot wound
penetrated the abdominal cavity.

419
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,808
Oh, God.

420
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,102
- You can't let me die.
- Come over here and hold this.

421
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,520
You're gonna save him?

422
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,355
I don't know who this man is.

423
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,816
My name's Dan. Dan Mendell.

424
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,777
This woman right here, she shot me.

425
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,863
- I have no idea why.
- You know exactly what you did to me!

426
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,907
I've never seen this woman
before in my life.

427
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,201
- You're a fucking liar!
- You're fucking crazy!

428
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,747
Look, you can't let me die.
I got a wife.

429
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,793
I got a daughter.
Please. Just look.

430
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,629
"Dan Mendell, DDS."
Kids' dentist.

431
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,340
- He's a rapist.
- I never did anything to you.

432
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,801
We met in a bar,
but she came on to me.

433
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,262
And then we get in the car,
she pulls a gun on me.

434
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,722
- You panicked.
- Because you were gonna shoot me.

435
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:30,059
- No, because you recognised me.
- I've never seen you before in my life.

436
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,438
- You know exactly who I am!
- She's crazy.

437
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:36,023
We got a mental situation
going on here.

438
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,401
- You, in the corner.
- You believe him?

439
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,778
She needs help. This woman needs help.

440
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,363
You're a piece of shit.
Full of shit!

441
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,823
Over there.

442
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,161
I have to take this call.
Stay there till I get back.

443
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,829
Don't leave me alone with her!

444
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,956
Do not move from this spot.

445
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,334
Help!

446
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,881
Everything OK?

447
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,799
Die-die.

448
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,676
Hi-hi, Harrison.

449
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,512
I know you're working, but I thought
you might want to take a break.

450
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,307
- It's wild hearing him talk.
- Isn't it?

451
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,350
I put him down,
and he was up two hours later

452
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,978
talking up a storm, weren't you?

453
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,732
♪ Flies in the buttermilk,

I'm afraid to ask, but...

462
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,882
You want me to stay
a few more hours?

463
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,302
I'll be home as soon as I can.
There's no place I'd rather be right now.

- Who are they?
- Get off of me!

467
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,651
- What are their names?
- I don't know what you're talking...

468
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,071
Huh?

469
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,158
He's a fucking liar!
He knows who they are!

470
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,119
Who are they?

471
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:15,831
- What are their names?
- You are ruining my life!

472
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,126
They ruined mine.

473
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,968
If we don't get help,
Dan the Dentist is going to expire.

474
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:30,388
I don't care.
It's what he deserves.

475
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:34,600
It's what they all deserve.

476
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,602
They should all get...

477
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,271
He's saying something.
He's talking to someone.

478
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,481
She fucking shot me.

479
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,941
My phone.

480
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,901
Can you hear me?

481
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,695
She shot me.

482
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,825
She's alive. You hear me?

483
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:56,581
That last fucking bitch is alive.

484
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,934
They're gonna find you...

485
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,770
you...

486
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,231
...cunt.

487
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,152
Die-die.

488
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:39,624
Lumen didn't witness her mother's murder,
but she was born in blood.

489
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,668
Like me.

490
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:47,590
Some experiences are so big
they change your DNA.

491
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,133
What now?

492
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,597
We clean up.
Homicide will be on us soon.

493
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,186
Hose this area down. Make sure everything
flows through the grate.

494
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,691
Where are you going?

495
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,903
To get my car.
We have to move this body.

496
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,328
About time.

497
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,498
Come on.

498
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,754
A hooker called in some gunshots,
but didn't actually see the shooter.

499
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,965
- Where's the body?
- Well, haven't found it yet.

500
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:31,884
Then what are we doing here?

501
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,969
Hey.

502
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,474
Blood.

503
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,813
Bullet holes.

504
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,148
Lots of blood.
A significant amount of blood.

505
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,527
Definitely some sort
of homicidal situation here.

506
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:53,447
A homicidal situation requires a body.
Why don't we let the EMTs handle it?

507
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,367
Your average person won't survive
this amount of blood loss.

508
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,082
There.

509
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,667
That blood trail there. See it?

510
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,877
Good chance that trail
ends at a dead body.

511
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,255
- Dexter's en route, but...
- I get it. We can't wait.

512
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,800
Will you two guys follow us in,
in case this bleeder's alive?

513
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,376
Whoa.

514
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,922
This dude is a half-litre from dead.

515
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,761
- Yeah?
- Hey, fuckwad, taking the scenic route?

516
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,680
Sorry. I was with Harrison.

517
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:03,225
He said his first words...
"Bye-bye."

518
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,936
- Yeah? That's sweet.
- Yeah, it was.

519
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,938
I remember your first words...

520
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,190
"Shoes."

521
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,567
You were very girly,
once upon a time.

522
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,779
That's funny, cos I always
remember my first words as being

523
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,239
- "Hurry the fuck up."
- Almost there.

524
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:21,410
Masuka and I tracked this dude's blood
to a pay phone inside a warehouse.

525
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,287
- You did?
- I think this way.

526
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,747
Yeah. We're gonna keep going.

527
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,957
- So find us.
- Will do.

528
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,387
You changed your clothes.

529
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,766
- Here. This is all I have.
- Thanks.

530
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,810
The police are close.
You have to get out of here.

531
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:49,688
Go to this address.
3319, Meadow Lane.

532
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,732
It's near Kendall.
Say it back to me.

533
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,276
3319, Meadow Lane,
near Kendall.

534
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:58,656
This'll get you in the front door.
Run six, seven blocks. Catch a cab.

535
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,492
Get cleaned up and wait for me.
I have it from here.

536
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,911
- You want me to go now?
- Yes.

537
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,413
No, I'm not leaving you.

538
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,749
Yes, you are.

539
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,710
I can help you move the body.

540
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,635
Who the hell is that?

541
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,555
Go, now. Go!

542
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,935
Compartmentalisation is a joke.

543
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,563
Fires rip through buildings
all the time

544
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,232
no matter how closed off
parts of them are.

545
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,651
Life is the same way.

546
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,113
It cannot be contained.

547
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,781
Fuck. Maybe we should
double back the way we came.

548
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,458
Is that?

549
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,003
Dexter's car.

550
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,510
Dexter.

551
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,722
You will not believe what I found.

552
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,609
What in the mother of fuck
went on in here?

553
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,153
I know exactly what happened.

554
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,282
Two words...
autoerotic mummification.

555
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,495
See, Mr Plastic Man...

556
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,414
shot Captain Bloody Underpants,

557
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,500
while Underpants
was in the choke.

558
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,504
Mr Plastic Man has hammocks
between Underpants' man chop...

559
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,923
Thanks to Masuka's keen expertise,

560
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,300
Debra will be able
to close this case.

561
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,512
Evidence will go into
a banker's box and be filed away,

562
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,557
eventually transferred
to a storage facility in Bradenton,

563
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,226
and that is where it will stay,

564
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,395
locked away forever in the dark.

565
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,568
If only everything
were that simple.

566
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,655
Thank you for the visual.

567
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,410
Asphyxiation heightens the high,
but it's not without its risks.

568
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:54,248
By the way, I wouldn't touch
the nozzle of that hose.

569
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,087
Anything to add?

570
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,798
The blood is consistent
with Masuka's theory.

571
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,427
If there's any follow-up,
I'd be happy to do it.

572
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,595
We're good here?

573
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:12,141
- You just landed.
- I have to relieve Sonya.

574
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,934
Yeah, we're good. Drive safe.

575
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,691
What a night.

576
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,612
You sure you want to do this?

577
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,115
I'm here, aren't I?

578
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,495
Angel?

579
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,584
This is Yasmin Aragon.

580
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,128
What is she doing on my couch?

581
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,631
Miss Aragon is friends
with Los Hermanos Fuentes.

582
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,138
She also has a boatload
of drug charges against her.

583
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,932
Seems like a trade is in order.

584
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,896
So are we gonna do this or not?

585
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,567
Give us a minute.

586
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,072
Excuse me.

587
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:22,211
I saw that she was wearing
a Santa Muerte necklace,

588
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,046
so I introduced myself.

589
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,466
If we agree to drop
her drug charges,

590
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,260
she thinks she can get
the Fuentes brothers in the club.

591
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,970
That is...

592
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,682
if you're willing to give us
another chance.

593
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:41,438
I'm... sorry about everything.

594
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,149
About losing my temper,
about what I said earlier.

595
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,526
You were right.

596
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,487
Say that again?

597
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,199
- You were right.
- I like the sound of that.

598
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:55,702
I did go to IAD because I didn't want
my husband disciplined.

599
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,705
I really like being married to you, Angel.

600
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:00,040
And I you.

601
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,834
It's something I never thought
would happen to me

602
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,586
because I've been so busy
making a name for myself,

603
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,713
and now I'm this close
to making captain.

604
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,799
And I would never
do anything to stop you.

605
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,926
Not on purpose, I know.

606
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,428
But get a stink on you...

607
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,349
- and I start to stink too.
- We'll stock up on deodorant.

608
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,438
Nice job bringing in the girl.

609
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:24,773
Yeah.

610
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,735
Better than a puppy?

611
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,281
I'll see you back at home.

612
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,421
Hello?

613
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,479
- Hey.
- Hey.

614
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,190
Last one.

615
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,649
Sorry.

616
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,444
You got glitter on your face.

617
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:11,904
Yeah...

618
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,572
hazard of the job.

619
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,575
I'm not sure it's in the job description

620
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,952
that you have to put your face
in Boobie McGee's tits.

621
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,289
Well, you know, the first rule
of working undercover is to blend in.

622
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,416
You disappeared.

623
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,794
- I did, didn't I?
- It's not funny.

624
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,799
Fuck. I...

625
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,554
I have feelings for you.

626
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,308
- You do?
- I tried not to.

627
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,855
I like you too.

628
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,023
Uh...

629
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,235
More than "like".

630
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,570
- You do?
- Yeah.

631
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,241
I mean, you're the one
who keeps putting the brakes on.

632
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,910
Well, what if I don't want
to do that any more?

633
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,745
That'd make me very happy.

634
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,960
If this is gonna end badly...

635
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,464
will you please just tell me now?

636
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,262
Morgan, I just said I want to be with you.

637
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,389
I mean, what more do you want?

638
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:25,143
Well, I mean,
sometimes you mumble,

639
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,646
and it's kind of hard
to understand you.

640
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,314
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

641
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,358
How's this?

642
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:48,041
I tried to send this woman
1,500 miles away,

643
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:52,045
and she boomeranged
back into the house I shared with Rita.

644
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,714
Lumen?

645
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,883
So much for keeping
the different parts of my life separate.

646
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,157
Sorry, I'll just be in here.

647
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,960
There are towels...
somewhere.

648
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,421
I found some in a box.

649
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:41,928
I also found this robe.
Is it OK if I borrow it?

650
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:43,388
Sure.

651
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,145
The tub's not draining.

652
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,940
Sometimes the thingy gets stuck.

653
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:07,079
Are you OK?
Do you need to sit down?

654
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,126
Yeah, for a minute.

655
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,301
I know you.

656
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,095
What you are...

657
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,971
deep down.

658
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:30,060
Aside from your police job,
and your... extracurricular activities.

659
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,730
You're a father.

660
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,818
I saw the pictures out there.

661
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,945
Three children?

662
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,159
The two oldest
are with their grandparents -

663
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,036
their dad's mom and dad.

664
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,124
You have a son?

665
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:54,376
Harrison.

666
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,339
He just started talking.

667
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,715
Today.

668
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,680
He's tremendous.

669
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:11,852
It's...

670
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,355
just the two of you?

671
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,444
And an Irish superhero nanny.

672
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,536
Never thought my life
would turn out like this.

673
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,669
I had imagined...

674
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,088
a totally different life
for myself too.

675
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,633
I always did everything
by the book, you know?

676
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,552
Go, go, go.

677
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,679
Never stopped to think.

678
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:52,517
There was high school,
and college, and graduate school...

679
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,728
Owen.

680
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,858
We were gonna get married at...

681
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,194
the house that I grew up in.

682
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:07,073
On my wedding day,
I... I tried on the dress,

683
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,244
and I looked out the window
at the backyard where the aisle was, and...

684
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,539
I saw everything
that that aisle was leading to.

685
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,043
Babies and...

686
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,545
matching dinnerware...

687
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,840
Sunday barbecues.

688
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,428
And I couldn't breathe.

689
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:31,431
I had to get out of there and...

690
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:33,850
find something...

691
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:37,854
...more.

692
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:49,032
Then everything happened, and...

693
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,370
I actually thought,

694
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,747
"This is what I get...

695
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,749
"for trying to...

696
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,086
"live my own life."

697
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,299
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

698
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,303
A little.

699
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,602
But tonight I felt this, like...

700
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:19,813
this...

701
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:22,732
peace.

702
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,195
And it's because he's dead.

703
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,038
And I know that it's not gonna last.

704
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,627
And when it wears off,
I'm gonna have to find the rest of them.

705
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:47,382
Because that's the only way
that I'll find that peace again.

706
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:56,016
I don't even have a name
for what I'm feeling.

707
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,560
I do.

708
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,395
The Dark Passenger.

709
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,898
I can't get revenge
for Rita's death,

710
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:07,444
but I can help Lumen
avenge what was done to her.

711
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,994
How many more were there?
