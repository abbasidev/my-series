1
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:14,305
So, how the hell was your date
with Rita last night?

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,264
Great.

3
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:17,266
I think I met the right woman for me.

4
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:20,687
She's perfect, because Rita
is as damaged as me.

5
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:25,858
I can't believe I found the one good,
truly decent man left on the planet.

6
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:30,196
- I have a dark side too.
- Somehow I doubt that.

7
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,283
I watched my mother die
when I was three.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,286
She was murdered in front of me.

9
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:40,498
You have your demons, but I know that
you don't have to be a slave to them.

10
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:41,749
I wish that were true.

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,420
I want to someday be content,
like everyone else.

12
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,505
- I want...
- A normal life.

13
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,757
- I wanna marry you.
- Yes!

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,718
You guys are my family.

15
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:55,179
Now I have a partner for life.
I'm content.

16
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,432
Maybe even happy.

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,269
I hope you're not taking
any of this seriously - the wife, the kids.

18
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,437
It's all great camouflage.

19
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,230
It's gotten more
complicated than that.

20
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,232
I'm pregnant.

21
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,276
You want to see him
come into the world.

22
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,196
- Yes. Raise him with Rita.
- I know.

23
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,574
I've never wanted anything
so much in my life.

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,035
Wanna know a secret?
Daddy kills people.

25
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,500
There's a monster walking around free.

26
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,795
I call him the Trinity Killer.
Kills in threes.

27
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,632
Trinity's a husband, a father.

28
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,342
He's... like me.

29
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,345
What kind of father
keeps blood slides in his shed?

30
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:40,892
If I don't figure out how to hide this,
I'm gonna lose my family.

31
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,728
Arthur's kept this up
for, what, 20 years?

32
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,022
My family may not last 20 minutes.

33
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,774
Arthur Mitchell.

34
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,858
Kyle Butler.

35
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:52,445
Only way it was gonna work
is if I jumped in with both feet.

36
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,405
Jump in with both feet, huh?

37
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,700
This is your new role model, Dex?

38
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,786
Get that axe from him.
Kill him now.

39
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,371
I still have things to learn from him.

40
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,957
You're juggling
too many people, Dexter.

41
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,960
Blood tech, husband, father,
serial killer.

42
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,879
Now Kyle Butler. Which one are you?

43
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,005
All of them.

44
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,340
Hello...

45
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,925
Dexter Morgan.

46
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,804
Hello, Arthur Mitchell.

47
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,850
Hey, sweetie.
The moon tonight is gonna be amazing.

48
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,853
So take a moment.
We love you. Bye.

49
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,951
Rita?

50
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,539
Born in blood. Both of us.

51
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,583
I thought I could change what I am,

52
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,044
keep my family safe.

53
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,089
But it doesn't matter what I do.

54
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,133
This is fate.

55
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,855
Sir, did you call this in?

56
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,735
Sir. What happened here?

57
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,158
I've watched 67 people die,

58
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,704
and at the moment of truth,
I looked into their eyes

59
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,789
and they knew and I knew

60
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,375
they got what they deserved.

61
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,294
But what if that's not
what happens?

62
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,006
If you don't get what you deserve?

63
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,717
If what you deserve
is a white picket fence

64
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,594
and your kids all around

65
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,472
and a husband who loves you?

66
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,975
What if the least you deserve
is a real human being

67
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,187
and what you get instead... is me?

68
00:05:56,148 --> 00:06:00,109
Sir. Sir, we're going to take
the child into safe custody now.

69
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,237
- Sir, hand me the child.
- What are you doing?

70
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,280
- Back off!
- Ma'am!

71
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,700
Miami Homicide. He is too.
I said back the fuck off!

72
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,618
What happened?

73
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,999
Jesus.

74
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,630
Rita's inside.

75
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,133
It was me.

76
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,976
Skin's wrinkled from hours
in the alkaline water.

77
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,811
Rigor mortis full-blown.

78
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,564
Epidermal mottling.

79
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,359
I imagined her naked plenty of times,
but never like this.

80
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,240
Single cut to the femoral artery.
We're looking at Trinity's MO here.

81
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,910
Did he ever kill a married woman
in a bathtub?

82
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,287
First time for everything.

83
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,331
Unfortunately for Dexter.

84
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,254
We're still waiting on the coroner
to move the body.

85
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,381
But overall lividity
puts time of death

86
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,427
somewhere between
eight and twelve hours... ago.

87
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,355
You OK?

88
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,657
Dexter came home to that.

89
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,868
He's gonna need our support here.

90
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,538
Obviously.

91
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,582
What do you want us
to do with him?

92
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,293
The first thing I want you to do
is pack up and get out of there.

93
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,338
- Well...
- What?

94
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,507
The FBI's here. Trinity is their case.

95
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,092
I already ceded jurisdiction.

96
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,885
What are you looking at him for?

97
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,513
It's what I was saying
on the way over.

98
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,724
Rita's one of ours. She's family.

99
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,852
We should be working
on this for Dexter.

100
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,062
Damn it, Angel, it's done!

101
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,189
Just do what I say.

102
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,151
She's stressed. We all are.

103
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,049
My father Harry
taught me a few simple rules.

104
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,428
Neνer hurt an innocent
and never make a scene.

105
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,558
Harry?

106
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,190
Where are you, now,
when I really need you?

107
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,570
When it's my wife in the body bag,
everybody's looking,

108
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,488
and it's the neighbour crying, not me?

109
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,918
Sir?

110
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,838
We're ready for you.

111
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:16,222
The first responders told me when they
went inside and found your wife

112
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,599
you said, "It was me."

113
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,518
You sure?

114
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,896
That's what was reported to me, yeah.

115
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,401
I don't know what I said. It could have
been anything. I'm very upset.

116
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,404
Of course you are.
Who wouldn't be?

117
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,075
Mr Morgan, before you came home
and found your wife,

118
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,618
where did you say you were again?

119
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,286
Dexter, take off your clothes,
then we're going home.

120
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,621
I was asking him a question.

121
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,414
He already said he came home
and he found her there.

122
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,833
If you wanna help,
why don't you find Trinity?

123
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,878
Or is doing something actually useful
not in your fucking job description?

124
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,255
Detective Morgan.

125
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,840
FBI?
Fucking Bunch of Idiots.

126
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,550
Stop.

127
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,220
Finish up here,
then take your brother home.

128
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,807
You wanna talk to Dexter,
schedule an appointment.

129
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,850
I'll do that.

130
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,577
He can sleep on the floor

131
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,622
until we can bring his crib
over from the house.

132
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,542
- It'll be safest, don't you think?
- Yeah.

133
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:31,046
I gotta tell you, Dexter,
don't say things like, "It was me."

134
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,215
People will misunderstand.

135
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,261
In fact, I don't understand.
What did you even mean?

136
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,187
Dexter.

137
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,275
This is Dexter Morgan.
3319 Meadow Lane.

138
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,693
What is your emergency?

139
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,030
I just got home and found
my wife dead in the bathtub.

140
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,617
- What is this?
- The 911 call Dexter made.

141
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,411
Listen.

142
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,581
I just got home and found
my wife dead in the bathtub.

143
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,125
- Did you say your wife is dead?
- Yes, I did.

144
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,044
She has an approximately
one-inch incision

145
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,047
midway up her right thigh,
dissecting the femoral artery.

146
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,966
All right. That's enough.
He obviously is in shock.

147
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,136
"Midway up her right thigh"?
"Dissecting her femoral artery"?

148
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,097
- Habit of precision.
- His wife just died.

149
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,266
He's submitting a lab report.

150
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,436
Seriously, the next-door neighbour,
the guy with the, you know, forehead?

151
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,147
He was more broken up about Rita
than Dexter was.

152
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,858
- So?
- So it's weird, that's all.

153
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,780
- What are we working on here?
- Not Rita.

154
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,909
It's Dexter's 911 call.

155
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,119
Did you hear me or not?

156
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,456
I said the case is with the FBI now.

157
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,128
You should have taken her
on a honeymoon.

158
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,344
You were right about one thing -

159
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,971
that neighbour Elliot
being all broken up about Rita.

160
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:07,434
I'm thinking now there's some things
I shouldn't have told Dexter.

161
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,021
What? What shouldn't you
have told him?

162
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,190
About a significant exchange of saliva

163
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,276
I witnessed at Thanksgiving.

164
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,113
- As in a kiss.
- Elliot and Rita?

165
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,241
Dude was totally
in love with her.

166
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,284
- And Dexter knew?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,662
If I'd known she was gonna...

168
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,667
I should have kept
my big mouth shut.

169
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,558
Could someone get that? Deb?

170
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,644
Damn it.

171
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,941
Hello.

172
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,985
Dexter, it's Maura.

173
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,195
Hello?

174
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,533
I'm sorry if I woke you,
but I have got two very excited kids here,

175
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,618
and Rita's not answering.

176
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,371
Yeah, there's something
you need to know.

177
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,706
OK. OK, OK.

178
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,959
But first somebody really
wants to talk with you.

179
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,712
Dexter!

180
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,298
Hey, Cody, you OK?

181
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:23,886
We've been having the best day.
I had cotton candy for breakfast.

182
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,262
That's great.

183
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,389
Here, give me the phone.
Gimme, gimme.

184
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,975
Hi, Dexter. Can I talk to Mom?

185
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,769
- Not now.
- Why not?

186
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,439
She's, uh...

187
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,191
She's in the shower.

188
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,194
Well, can you tell her we miss her?

189
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,363
We miss you too, Dexter,
and Harrison.

190
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,491
Here's my grandmother.

191
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:49,703
So, there was something
that you needed to tell me?

192
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,457
When you bring them home tonight, uh...

193
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:58,086
come to Deb's apartment
instead of the house, OK?

194
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:01,215
What happened,
did you miss your flight?

195
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:05,886
Something like that.
I'll explain when you get here.

196
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,810
You sure you don't want
to tell them about Rita?

197
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,398
I just want them to have
one more good day.

198
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,527
Look, I know this is really difficult...

199
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,865
but there are a lot of things that need
to happen before Rita can be buried.

200
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,705
I've been on the phone all morning with
a funeral director who does a lot of cops.

201
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,417
And he's willing to see us right away.

202
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,713
You willing to do that?

203
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,060
I'm sorry for your loss.

204
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,937
How does he do that?

205
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,231
My sincere condolences.

206
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,733
He sounds like he actually means it.

207
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,945
Thank you.

208
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:10,284
Would you like something
to drink? Coffee?

209
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,911
Water?

210
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,123
No. I'm fine.

211
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,423
There are Kleenexes here...

212
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,842
if you need them.

213
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,889
What we need to do now, Dexter...

214
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,850
May I call you that?

215
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,979
What we need to do now, Dexter,
is make some very important decisions

216
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,107
about how your wife Rita
will be remembered.

217
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,526
OK.

218
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,404
We like to start with the obituary.

219
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,448
It's a good way to let people
know about services

220
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,366
and where to send remembrances.

221
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,285
But most importantly,
it's a chance to express

222
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,412
your feelings about Rita
in your own words.

223
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,372
Excuse me.

224
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,047
I'll get you something for the paper.

225
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,215
What else do you need?

226
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,436
So this is how normal people do it.

227
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,606
No hefty bags. No diesel fumes.

228
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,238
This is what she would have wanted -

229
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,449
a grieving spouse...

230
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,161
for once doing what
a person's supposed to do.

231
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,890
- Dexter Morgan?
- Rita?

232
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,392
- Hi.
- Hi.

233
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,019
Sorry I'm late.

234
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,690
- That's no problem.
- There was traffic, of course.

235
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,153
I went to the wrong café.
I went to the one in town.

236
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,322
I didn't know there was
anything even out this far.

237
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,157
How did you find this place?

238
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,827
I, uh... tracked it down.

239
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,710
So, I... Your sister...

240
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,545
Debra's told me so much about you.

241
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,547
- Uh-oh.
- Oh.

242
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,507
Nothing bad, of course.

243
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,301
She omitted the fact
that I'm an axe murderer?

244
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,887
No. She said that you were a...

245
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,306
bloodstain pattern analyst.

246
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,267
Which I have no clue what that is.

247
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,437
Believe me, I barely do either,
and I do it 40 hours a week.

248
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,608
She seems nice, your sister.

249
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,778
You seem nice too.

250
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,573
Thank you.

251
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,244
So, um, what's good here?

252
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,373
There must be something special
to bring you all the way out this far.

253
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,419
I... I usually play it safe

254
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,838
and go with a Caesar salad.

255
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,257
But I don't see one on here.

256
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,469
You know, I think
I'm gonna get the special,

257
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,012
the mushroom ravioli.

258
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,805
Dexter?

259
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,769
- Do you know what you want?
- Yes, I do.

260
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,115
Dex.

261
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,951
What are you doing?

262
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,455
I was just thinking about Rita,
how much...

263
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,834
How much you miss her?

264
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,212
How much I lied to her,
from the very beginning.

265
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,180
Funeral's the day after tomorrow.

266
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,517
I chose an oak casket.
I hope that's all right.

267
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,353
White roses.
I think she'd like those.

268
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,314
They want to know
if there's a particular dress

269
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,358
you'd like her to be buried in.

270
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,277
Not really.

271
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,947
OK.

272
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,574
I'll find something.

273
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,246
Quinn called, and the FBI has released
the crime scene at your house,

274
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,582
so there are some things
I want to do there and...

275
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,253
I'm gonna drop you two off
at the apartment. Is that OK?

276
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,671
Yeah, that's fine.

277
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,926
You're worrying me.

278
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,748
I really didn't expect you to come.

279
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,710
We're partners. I'm here.

280
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,920
What are we looking for?

281
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,964
Nothing.

282
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,050
Trinity wouldn't leave
anything behind.

283
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,303
What are we doing, then?

284
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,646
I wanted to clean the place up.

285
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,317
Make sure Dexter
didn't see it like this.

286
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,361
The FBI left it this way.

287
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,989
They have people who'll do that.

288
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,755
This much blood,
usually you call Dexter.

289
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,969
How you holdin' up?

290
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,517
OK. I guess.

291
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,855
I mean, you know my brother.
It's a little hard to tell.

292
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,858
No, I mean you.
How are you holding up?

293
00:21:58,985 --> 00:21:59,985
Oh.

294
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,656
Fine.

295
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,159
Not used to having to be
the strong one, you know?

296
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,413
It's always been Dexter.

297
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,875
- And now...
- He's the strong one?

298
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,337
To me it's always seemed
the other way around.

299
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,886
Swear to God, I can't even
tell what he's thinking.

300
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,723
Sorry. I didn't mean
to make things worse.

301
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,976
It's OK.

302
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,858
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

303
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,589
Open the door! Come on!

304
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,216
Hurry, come on, open up! Dexter!

305
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,763
- Are you there?
- Open the door!

306
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,309
Dexter, you came back early!

307
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,228
Hey, guys. Did you have fun?

308
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,773
- It was awesome.
- We got you stuff.

309
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:25,403
- Perfect.
- There's one for Mom too.

310
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,578
Where is she?

311
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,622
She's not here.

312
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,250
Well, where is she?

313
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,002
Just... sit down.

314
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,755
I need to tell you something.

315
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,634
Dexter?

316
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,762
Is everything OK?

317
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,598
What's going on?
You're... You're freaking me out.

318
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,937
Something happened to your mom.

319
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,688
Something bad?

320
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,279
Yeah. Something bad.

321
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,824
Is she OK?

322
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,286
A man came into our house,

323
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,038
and your mother came home

324
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,748
and he killed her.

325
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,458
- What?
- She got killed?

326
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,127
- Somebody killed her?
- No, she's fine.

327
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,711
Dexter. What...

328
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:26,506
- You're kidding, right?
- I don't understand.

329
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,008
You said spend the day
at Disney World.

330
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,308
I'm sorry for your loss.

331
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,829
- Astor?
- Go away.

332
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,039
I mean it! Leave me alone!

333
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,584
Just listen to me.
Everything's gonna be OK.

334
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,837
It won't be. She's dead!

335
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,756
I know.

336
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,425
And it doesn't even matter to you.

337
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:15,763
- How can you say that?
- Cos it doesn't.

338
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,349
I can tell just by looking
you don't even care.

339
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,646
Where were you?

340
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,900
Where were you
when someone was killing her?

341
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,029
You should have been there
to protect her.

342
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,280
You're right.

343
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,116
- That was your job!
- I know.

344
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:41,247
I should have been there, and I wish
I could take it all back. I wish...

345
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,292
that none of this had ever happened
and your mom was still alive.

346
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,669
Wanna know what I wish?

347
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,882
That it was just my mom
and me and Cody and Harrison.

348
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,969
Cos we all would have been
so much better off if she hadn't met you!

349
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,473
I wish you were dead!

350
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,332
- Do you mind?
- What?

351
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,751
Look somewhere else.

352
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,891
What are you doing?

353
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,602
Jesus, Quinn, you can't
grab a sheet or something?

354
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,104
Sorry.

355
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,439
So, what are you doing?

356
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,483
Trying to find a dress for Rita.

357
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,985
You gonna bury her in one of those?

358
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,987
You got something better?

359
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,578
Great. I gotta go.
I gotta go home now.

360
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,999
You might wanna
put some pants on there.

361
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,128
You wanna talk about it,
or are you just gonna act weird?

362
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:13,172
- There's nothing to talk about.
- OK.

363
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,717
I mean, you show up here,

364
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,885
which I didn't even ask you to do, so...

365
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,762
Yeah. To help.

366
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,264
Is that what you call it?

367
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,182
Morgan.

368
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,200
Elliot?

369
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,870
- That's your name, right?
- Yeah.

370
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,748
Hi. Quinn. Metro Homicide.

371
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:47,957
Hey.

372
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,792
You have kids, I take it.

373
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,545
Yeah. They're with their mother.

374
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,214
We're divorced.

375
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:59,802
Plus, it just seemed better for them
to get away after what happened next door.

376
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:06,100
Um... you know, I already talked to the FBI.
I told them I didn't see anything.

377
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,852
What did you need?

378
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,855
How well did you know Rita?

379
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,983
I don't know, you know.
We were neighbours.

380
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,153
Yeah. I just couldn't help but notice

381
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,530
how torn up you were
about her the other night.

382
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,079
She was a friend, you know?
It was upsetting.

383
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,164
A friend.

384
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,834
I, uh, was told she might
have been more.

385
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,797
Christ. All right, look,
I don't know what you've heard,

386
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,840
but just so you understand
the actual facts,

387
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,051
all Rita and I ever did
was kiss... once.

388
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,677
That was it. It was nothing.

389
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,638
Her husband was never around.

390
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,518
Anyway, Dexter found out about
the indiscretion and, uh...

391
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,062
came over and punched me out.

392
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,606
Huh.

393
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,533
- Dexter.
- Shhh.

394
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,243
He's sleeping.

395
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,000
Brought some dresses
for you to look at.

396
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,007
Where are Astor and Cody?

397
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,885
At a hotel with their grandparents.

398
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,179
How'd it go talking with them?

399
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,475
Astor's upset.

400
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,145
They got me a hat.

401
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,397
She'll be OK.

402
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,776
I don't see how.
Her mother's dead because of me.

403
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,528
No, she's not.

404
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:44,532
She's dead because of Trinity.

405
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:47,743
I know you keep blaming yourself,
but you can't.

406
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,079
There's nothing you could
have done differently.

407
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:53,833
I could have killed Arthur Mitchell
the first chance I got.

408
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,877
You loved Rita.

409
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:00,756
You never would have let
anything hurt her.

410
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,592
She was lucky to have you.

411
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,553
She told me that all the time.

412
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,640
How lucky she felt
to have found you.

413
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,828
I was wondering what you were doing,
sitting here by yourself for so long.

414
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,455
Now I see.

415
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,334
I paid her to say that.

416
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,545
You did?

417
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,923
No, I was... just kidding.

418
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,591
Me too.

419
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:51,015
So what does a blood spatter analyst
do anyway?

420
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,685
Excuse me.

421
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,538
Is this yours?

422
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,414
What's the deal here?

423
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,720
I have to go.

424
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,472
Is everything OK?

425
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,975
It's a stomach bug.
It's going around the station.

426
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,393
I'm really sorry.

427
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,271
It was nice meeting you.

428
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,158
Lucky to have me.
I wouldn't say so.

429
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,245
She trusted me,
and now she's dead.

430
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,173
Like your sister says, I'm toxic.

431
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,469
You'd all be better off without me.

432
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:35,244
Delete the past. Leave nothing behind.

433
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,129
You're up early.

434
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,509
What are you doing over there
that's so important?

435
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,887
Getting rid of every trace of me.

436
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,139
- Nothing.
- Dexter...

437
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,982
Look, I know this is tough to talk about,
but the funeral's tomorrow,

438
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,693
and there's still a lot of stuff
you have to do.

439
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,362
Like sign the coroner's release.

440
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,405
I need to grab my tools.

441
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,199
And go over the guest list
one more time.

442
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,617
And torch the container.

443
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,285
And the eulogy, Dexter.

444
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,413
I can't do that for you.
That really has to come from you.

445
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,792
I need to top off my boat.
I'm low on fuel.

446
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,002
Yeah.

447
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,046
And the FBI interview,

448
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:31,550
or the debriefing or whatever they're
calling it - that's really important.

449
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,220
They're total dicks
for wanting to do it today,

450
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:38,391
but maybe you're better off just
going in there and getting it over with.

451
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,353
You sure you don't want me
to come with you?

452
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,607
No. I'm fine.

453
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,612
All right. I'm off.

454
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,867
I've been thinking about Harrison.

455
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,539
How he needs his mother.

456
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,834
Someone decent in his life.

457
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,878
You've done everything for me.

458
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,047
Not just now. My whole life.

459
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,049
But...

460
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,469
I need to ask you
this one more favour.

461
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,431
That that person be you.

462
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:21,684
That you...

463
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,062
love him...

464
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,399
as if he were your own.

465
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,072
He is my own.

466
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,869
And he has me in his life.
Of course he does.

467
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,416
But more importantly, he has you.

468
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,379
You're decent and good.

469
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,466
I'm not.

470
00:34:56,887 --> 00:35:01,515
You are.

471
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,094
What's her mood?

472
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,432
How would I know?

473
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:47,520
I don't know, there's this rumour floating
around the two of you are married.

474
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,774
Look, I just need to talk to her
about something.

475
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,401
I was wondering
if this is a good time.

476
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,446
Just remember...

477
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,990
she's the boss.

478
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,909
All right.

479
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,497
No. No further comment.

480
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,378
"Serial killer murders cop's wife."

481
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,256
The press won't let up.
They want all the gory details.

482
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,259
- So what do you tell them?
- Same thing I told you.

483
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,928
It's not our case.

484
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,680
So, what can I do for you?

485
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,975
There's, uh, something
I think you should know,

486
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,768
having to do with Rita.

487
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:30,938
OK.

488
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,482
And Elliot,
the next-door neighbour.

489
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,609
I was at the house with Debra...

490
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,445
...Detective Morgan,
cleaning up.

491
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,283
And this Elliot and I
struck up conversation.

492
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:46,996
Turns out he and Rita had like a...

493
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,581
mini-fling.

494
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,916
What's that mean exactly?

495
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,794
Well, nothing really happened.

496
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,881
But apparently,
Dexter found out about it.

497
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,634
Why are you telling me this?

498
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,470
What are you implying?

499
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:05,097
I'm not implying anything.

500
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,308
And what are you doing
interviewing witnesses?

501
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,101
I wasn't interviewing. I was there...

502
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,645
What, cleaning? Please.

503
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,316
Look, if this were anyone but Dexter,

504
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,860
we'd at least be thinking
like detectives.

505
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,988
Which means what?
What do you always say?

506
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:25,284
When the wife is dead,
90% of the time the husband did it.

507
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,373
LaGuerta.

508
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,294
Um... Hang on for a second.
I need to take this.

509
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,254
We'll finish later.

510
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,429
OK. Can you repeat that?

511
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,694
Yeah.

512
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,530
I just got a call from the FBI
about your brother's interview.

513
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,199
Don't tell me. What'd he say?

514
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,784
Nothing. He didn't show.

515
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,411
So now they're asking
for his personnel files.

516
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,874
God damn it.
I knew I should have gone with him.

517
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,959
Morgan?

518
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:16,710
I so did not fucking need this.

519
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,253
Yeah, you and me both.

520
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,423
I'm headed home now. I'll figure out what
happened, and I'll get him down there.

521
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,217
OK.

522
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,181
Dexter?

523
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,643
Who the fuck are you?

524
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,269
Excuse me?

525
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,605
Who the fuck are you?

526
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,566
10-A. Downstairs?

527
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,027
You're the sister, right?

528
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,780
- Yeah, I live here.
- Well, I'll be leaving, then.

529
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,448
He said you would know what to do.

530
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,367
He said what? Don't go.

531
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,703
Wait.

532
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,208
Dexter Morgan.

533
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,585
Please leave a message at the tone.

534
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,755
Guess who I just met.
The fucking cat lady from downstairs.

535
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,632
She was feeding ice cream to your son.

536
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,801
So, I don't know
where the fuck you are

537
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,095
or why you think you can
fucking run away from the FBI,

538
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:11,390
but you better get back here...

539
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,976
Fuck! Dexter, where are you?

540
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,190
Hope you don't mind
I chose that dress.

541
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,068
You were wearing it when...
we first met.

542
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,864
So I thought since I won't be
at the funeral,

543
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,783
since I don't deserve to be...

544
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,287
Kids'll be fine with Deb.

545
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:38,709
Way better off without me.
I think we agree about that.

546
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,589
I was never really
honest with you.

547
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,307
I'm a serial killer. That's what I am.

548
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,273
I know I led you to believe
I'm a human being, but I'm not.

549
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,358
That's a lie.

550
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,586
There are only a few things you really need
once you decide to moνe on,

551
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,797
what you'll require
wherever you land.

552
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,257
A fine suit of clothing...

553
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,434
the tools of your trade...

554
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:46,819
and some token of your past,
a reminder of who you really are.

555
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,410
Everything else...

556
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,040
you just don't need.

557
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,007
So, where are you, Harry?

558
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:13,804
Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

559
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,836
I've disappeared so many people.

560
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:49,548
My turn now...
to disappear myself.

561
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,149
Fucking FBI.

562
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,615
Damn it, Dexter, don't do this.

563
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,802
The sea breeze
has always brought me clarity.

564
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,805
It's hard to get enough oxygen on land.

565
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:42,184
It's hard to... breathe.

566
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:08,752
Oh.

567
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:15,676
Hey, you.

568
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,636
Hey... you.

569
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,680
It's Rita.

570
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,515
Yeah, I know.

571
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,433
I was just checking in.

572
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,727
Wanted to see if you were
feeling better.

573
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,771
Much better.

574
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,189
Glad to hear that.

575
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,441
The way you left
the restaurant so quickly,

576
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,320
I don't know, I felt maybe I...
said something to offend you.

577
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,781
No, you were fine.

578
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,367
Uh, very understanding.

579
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,956
I wasn't completely honest with you.

580
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:46,999
Um...

581
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,543
You didn't really get stuck in traffic?

582
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,382
I have two kids. Astor and Cody.

583
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,592
They're nine and seven.

584
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,554
I like kids.

585
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,098
You do?

586
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:06,101
Yeah, they're fun.
Besides, Deb already told me.

587
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:12,941
And my ex-husband and our... problems?
Did she tell you?

588
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,860
Yeah.

589
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,864
So, you know all about me.

590
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,700
I'd like to know more.

591
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,787
So...

592
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,750
So, maybe we should
get together again sometime.

593
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,796
I would like that. A lot.

594
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,214
A lot.

595
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:41,511
I know I should hang up right now,
but I just need to say it.

596
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:46,391
I don't know why exactly, but...

597
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,478
you make me feel good.

598
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,272
Like things could be different.

599
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,025
So do you.

600
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:59,154
Make me feel that way...
too, I mean.

601
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,614
Glad I called.

602
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,657
I don't know, I felt...

603
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:05,118
up in the air
the way things ended.

604
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:09,623
You know, like we never
said a proper goodbye, so...

605
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,084
Goodbye, Rita Bennett.

606
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,379
Goodbye, Dexter Morgan.

607
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,638
Goodbye.

608
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,267
I'm sorry.

609
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,435
Where's the key
to the fucking bathroom?

610
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:14,187
Or should I just dump out
on the floor?

611
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,027
What's your problem?

612
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,154
Nothing.

613
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,781
Fucking retard.

614
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,741
Get the fuck outta here!

615
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,536
He's right. I should keep moving.

616
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,464
Hey. Hey, hey.

617
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:43,884
I said...

618
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,927
what the fuck is your problem?

619
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,347
I've had a bad week.

620
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,933
My wife died, and it was my fault.

621
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,937
Well, I'm real sorry
for your fuckin' loss,

622
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,857
but your dead wife
can suck my dick.

623
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,658
I never meant to hurt her.

624
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:51,576
That's the first human thing
I've seen you do since she died, Dexter.

625
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,164
I thought you'd left me.

626
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,416
I'm here.

627
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:07,509
It's OK, son...

628
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,388
to show what you're feeling.

629
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,498
They're not better off without you.

630
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,709
You're not better off
without them.

631
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,671
You need to go back.

632
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,858
Deb says
she's sure he'll be here.

633
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:10,780
Better be. If we don't get going soon,
we'll be burying Rita by candlelight.

634
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,164
So you're not talking to me now?
Is that it?

635
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,417
I have been trying to talk to you.

636
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,214
You're right. You have.

637
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:33,094
I just need you to understand...

638
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,512
So, tell me.

639
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,182
I could have fought
for this case, but...

640
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,477
part of me didn't want to.

641
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:45,440
Rita... died.

642
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:50,278
She died, and it scared me.

643
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,907
We'd been married, what, ten hours?

644
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,036
Dexter was the witness
at our ceremony.

645
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,748
For all I know, he was there
with us while she was...

646
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,084
- being...
- I know.

647
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,005
Well, I didn't want
to be reminded of that.

648
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,175
I didn't want to investigate.

649
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,594
I just wanted...

650
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,597
I just wanted it to be our wedding day.

651
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,102
I don't like it, Angel.

652
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:25,230
I don't like the way this makes me feel.
I don't know what to do with any of it.

653
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,898
Maria.

654
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,068
What?

655
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,863
No one does.

656
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:46,292
What's more important
than his own wife's funeral?

657
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:48,420
People are getting restless.

658
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:52,424
Thank you for reporting in
with the obvious, Quinn.

659
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,802
Like I'm such a moron
that it's lost on me.

660
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,305
You ever given a eulogy?

661
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:00,306
No.

662
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:01,933
Well, I can't do it.

663
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,227
And those agents, those vultures,

664
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,813
are just waiting for him.

665
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:10,900
Look, there's something
you should probably know.

666
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,444
What?

667
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,572
It's not exactly
an easy thing to say.

668
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,450
The next-door neighbour Elliot,
I spoke to him the other day.

669
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,453
- What the fuck?
- I know I shouldn't have...

670
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,867
She had a big heart.

671
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:05,538
Big enough for both of us.

672
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,250
Had to be.

673
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,754
I wasn't even human...

674
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,510
when we first met.

675
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,971
I never expected that to change.

676
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:27,393
She reached out and found something
I didn't even know was there.

677
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,814
She never hurt anybody.

678
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:33,483
She was innocent.

679
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,696
And she died a brutal death and...

680
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,825
and I can't...

681
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,246
fix it.

682
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:56,756
But I know I have to try...

683
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:03,137
here in Miami with the people
who knew her

684
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,265
and who...

685
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,395
who cared about her.

686
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,899
And who loved her.

687
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,867
Like I did.
