1
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,888
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,390
I think I may have a lead on Kyle Butler.

3
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,351
I didn't know you people were working this.
The Mitchells are in a safe house.

4
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,727
I just want to show them a photo.

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,772
There is a great, big,
shit-ugly world out there, Jonah.

6
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,607
What do you want me to do?

7
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,276
- OK, we had sex.
- Was it good sex?

8
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,320
I've said all I'm going to say.

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,824
Lopez collapsed while on duty today.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,450
He's been hospitalized
with internal bleeding.

11
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:38,079
Batista could not only lose his job,
he could serve time.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,957
I know who purchased
the Santa Muerte icons.

13
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,209
- What'd you get?
- Two guys in their 30s.

14
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,379
Strong accents, possibly
recent immigrants from Venezuela.

15
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,841
They did this to him
because he started talking to me.

16
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,177
Boyd Fowler,
Division of Dead Animal Pickup.

17
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,513
Hobbies -
storing women in formaldehyde.

18
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,014
We'll do a shift together.

19
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,808
Tomorrow morning, eight sharp.

20
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:02,311
An old tourist welcome centre.
Totally isolated.

21
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,858
I wish you could see
the room I set up for you.

22
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,068
All the women you've killed.

23
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,195
You don't know what you're getting into.

24
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,246
Don't!

25
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,498
She saw everything.

26
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,333
She saw... me.

27
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,647
I'm not liking the trend here.

28
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,567
You rip a man apart
in a public bathroom...

29
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,777
No one saw.

30
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,988
You nearly botch Boyd's kill.

31
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,575
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Yeah.

32
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,994
And now you've got her.

33
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,413
What's the first rule of the code?

34
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,916
Never kill an innocent.

35
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,667
Don't get caught.

36
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,047
So what's your plan here?

37
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,841
Nurse her back to health
so she can go to the police?

38
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,844
She gives the cops enough to track
you down, then everything falls apart.

39
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,722
Harrison grows up visiting you
on death row.

40
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,732
Why are you doing this?

41
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:35,942
Because she's dying.

42
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,985
And you're a serial killer.

43
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,237
I'd think you could handle that.

44
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:44,742
You didn't do this to her, Dex.
She's not your responsibility.

45
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,745
Go home and take care of your son.

46
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,845
It's OK. Don't move.

47
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,602
Everything will be OK.

48
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,024
Don't! It's OK.
It's OK!

49
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,236
Calm down.

50
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,321
Stop fighting me.

51
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,159
I'm not here to hurt you. Stop!

52
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,945
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

53
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,795
- What?
- Jesus. What's your problem?

54
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,213
Sorry. It's the middle of the night.

55
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,090
In California, maybe.
What's wrong with you?

56
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,593
Nothing. I'm just... tired.

57
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,178
You are?

58
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,180
I just pulled an all-nighter
at a crime scene.

59
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,182
Totally fried and I've got jack shit.

60
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,809
So the babysitter's been there all night?

61
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,853
Masuka's trying.
He really is.

62
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,940
But the blood just doesn't talk to him
the way it does to you.

63
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,734
I really need your help on this.

64
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,863
- It's not a good time. I've got Harrison.
- What happened to the babysitter?

65
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,573
Probably getting ready to kill me.

66
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,325
Look, I know you're still on leave,

67
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,244
and you know I wouldn't ask
if it weren't important. Don't make me beg.

68
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,039
Deb, look, it's...

69
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:59,251
Maybe I can use the crime scene
to get an ID on sleeping beauty here.

70
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,880
- OK, I'll do it.
- You will?

71
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:09,011
Yeah. Of course.
You're my sister.

72
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,847
Where, uh...
Where should I go?

73
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,975
1132 Moredo. It's a botánica.

74
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,395
Just follow the fucking news vans.

75
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,148
You're the best, you know that?

76
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,360
Hello?

77
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,306
Dex, over here.

78
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,854
You're just in time, the coroner's
chomping at the bit to remove the body.

79
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,815
- It's a bit of a circus.
- You kidding me? It's Barnum and Bailey.

80
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,277
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're working on it!

81
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,945
- What's he saying?
- I have no idea.

82
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,115
But the general complaint is there are fewer
beheadings in the rich parts of Miami.

83
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,241
Beheadings?

84
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,287
Yeah.
And that's not even the fucked-up part.

85
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,419
- Dextrous.
- Vince.

86
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,965
Whoa. You weren't kidding
about the fucked-up part.

87
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,468
It was a potential witness.
And it's the second this week.

88
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,220
So what you got?

89
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,764
Uh, we're thinking, uh, machete.

90
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:39,685
- OK. What else?
- Just machete.

91
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,729
We've been up all night.
We're too tired to think.

92
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,856
That's why I called you.

93
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,527
So?

94
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,489
So the beheading obviously
went down here.

95
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,951
He was standing.

96
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,539
Whack one,
and the victim goes down.

97
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,665
Whack two.

98
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,501
Whack three.

99
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,005
And cervical vertebrae
are pretty much toast.

100
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,049
Separation complete.

101
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,260
- We have lift-off.
- That's what I've been saying.

102
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,179
Not really. Let him work.

103
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,349
- Eyes and tongue removed here.
- That tongue's in the ice chest.

104
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:22,102
- Do you want to see it?
- No, not really.

105
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:26,106
- Has anyone been smoking in here?
- It's 2010. Who smokes?

106
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,776
Uh... Machete man, I think.

107
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,578
A small cigar.
Highly unstable ash.

108
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,790
Short, torn tobacco leaves.
It's a cheap one.

109
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,084
Like a Tiparillo.

110
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,420
I'd look for that.

111
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,466
So machete and Tiparillo.

112
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,010
- Definitely styling.
- Fuck me in both ears.

113
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,682
OK, people, our killers left
through that door into the alley.

114
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,850
So let's sweep it for small cigar butts.

115
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,435
Watch your step, fellas.

116
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,853
Watch the ev.
Watch the ev!

117
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,523
Thank you. Watch the ev.

118
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,487
So...

119
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,407
that, uh, cigar ash stuff...

120
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,368
- Yeah?
- You learn that in grad school?

121
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:23,414
- Uh, Havana Room.
- Havana Room.

122
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,168
Oh, good to have you back.

123
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,546
You know, in a supporting role.

124
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,342
- Assisting... me.
- Yeah. Thanks.

125
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,760
I got to go.

126
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,804
Don't you want to see
if we find the cigar?

127
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,766
I just want to find out who that girl is
before the M99 wears off.

128
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,101
Absolutely.

129
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,478
I'll drop by the station later.

130
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,450
Well... he's up.

131
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,661
He's been up for hours.

132
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,373
I know. I missed you too.

133
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,751
I'm so sorry.
I know I'm late.

134
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,296
Late doesn't quite capture it.
It's been all night.

135
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,922
I know, it's just...

136
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,842
I killed a man in front of a witness
I just had to tranquilise

137
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,470
to keep her
from scratching my eyes out.

138
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,680
- What?
- I'll make it up to you.

139
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,475
- I don't think so.
- What's that mean?

140
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,811
It means I don't think this is a good fit
and I won't be returning.

141
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,481
It is. It is a good fit.
Harrison likes you.

142
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,860
And I really like him, which is what pains me
so much about this, but...

143
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,322
He needs a reliable parent.
Especially with his mother gone.

144
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,700
- I'm reliable.
- Well, I guess we use different dictionaries.

145
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,994
- It will never happen again.
- Do you think?

146
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,622
My mother told me
when I was just a little girl,

147
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:51,835
"Never lie to someone who trusts you.
Never trust someone who lies to you."

148
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,504
It's a shame, really.

149
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,632
We got off to such a good start.

150
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,181
I miss your mom.

151
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,855
I understand that,
but the bureau said no.

152
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,984
Even though the only clue
you have in the Trinity case is Kyle Butler,

153
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,694
and I might know who that is.

154
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:18,737
That's right.

155
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,739
- Ask again, Ray.
- There's no point.

156
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:22,825
I thought you had clout.

157
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,787
Not when it comes to doing an end run
on safe house procedures.

158
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,707
Look, offer still stands.
Give me the photo, I'll show it to the family.

159
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,044
I told you, I can't do that.
It's a sensitive situation.

160
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,548
- It's your call.
- Great. Thanks.

161
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,305
Here we go.

162
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,290
There's the safe house,
and there's Jonah Mitchell.

163
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,924
OK, we may have
finally caught a break

164
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,135
in the Santa Muerte case,
so listen up, people.

165
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,428
Detective Morgan.

166
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:28,682
OK, it's too soon to celebrate,
and most of us are too fucking tired anyway,

167
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,893
but we found this just outside

168
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,770
the back entrance of the botánica
where Fauzi was murdered.

169
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,941
- Is that a cigar butt?
- Very perceptive, Detective Quinn.

170
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:42,821
And may I thank you for getting your lazy ass
off the couch and joining us. So thank you.

171
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,032
It's a Tiparillo butt,
and we have reason to believe

172
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,493
it was handled
by one of the two assailants.

173
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,954
- So what are we talking about, DNA swab?
- Even better.

174
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:55,459
Oh. Uh...
There's a 3/4 partial thumbprint on the side,

175
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,920
and it has to be processed manually.
It's incomplete.

176
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,547
But we expect to hear back within a day.

177
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,886
And there's the man we have to thank for it -
my nephew, Harrison.

178
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,804
He lent us his dad.

179
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,225
- Look at those cheeks! May I?
- Sure.

180
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,102
- Oh! ¡Qué lindo!
- Gordito.

181
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,357
- You look like your mommy.
- Oh, and he's got daddy's eyes.

182
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,652
- And your penis size.
- No, it's bigger. It's much bigger.

183
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,450
Who would have thought?
Better than doughnuts.

184
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:37,543
Is this your idea of quality time,
using your son as cover?

185
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,088
He's enjoying it. They're enjoying it.
It's a win-win.

186
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,006
Besides, it's for a good cause.

187
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,843
I need to find out who this girl is
before she wakes up.

188
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,679
Which will be soon.

189
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,976
Damn it.

190
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,314
Come on, come on.

191
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:16,373
What are you doing now?
Stealing from a co-worker?

192
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,916
Borrowing.

193
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,795
You really think Vince Masuka won't notice
half his medicine cabinet is missing?

194
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,381
I don't care.
He's a hypochondriac.

195
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,508
She actually needs this stuff.

196
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,896
Lumen Ann Pierce, from Minnesota.

197
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,899
No warrants.
Not even a traffic violation.

198
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,652
Yeah, and no missing persons report either.

199
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,362
No one's looking for her.

200
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,616
- What are you saying? I should let her die?
- You can't just let her go.

201
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,997
This isn't some fairy tale
where she wakes up

202
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,333
and you get to be the handsome prince
who saved her.

203
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,084
If she wakes up, she'll call the police.

204
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,003
You think I don't know that?

205
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,257
How you doing?

206
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,446
- Hey, isn't it about time for his nap?
- Yeah.

207
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,698
I know the feeling.

208
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,535
You do? I flatlined hours ago.
I'm heading home to take a nap.

209
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,372
Hey, will you do me a favour
and take him with you?

210
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,457
I've got someone expecting me.

211
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,710
- What about the nanny?
- She needed a break.

212
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,878
After two days?

213
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,715
It would be a huge help.
And he's gonna go right to sleep.

214
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,802
He's way overdue for a nap.

215
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,555
All right. If you carry him to the car.
He's getting heavy.

216
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,892
Angel.

217
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,607
- What's this?
- An address.

218
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,484
I didn't want to give it to you
in front of everybody else.

219
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,735
It's a hospital.

220
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,197
That's where Sergeant Lopez ended up
after your little fight.

221
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,616
- You need to go apologise.
- No. No.

222
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,076
No.

223
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,703
He's the one that should
apologise to me.

224
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,541
He's the one who has a broken nose,
a broken rib, and a punctured lung.

225
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,583
Angel, porfavor...

226
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,961
I should have broken his jaw
for what he said about you.

227
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,796
I'm not going to argue with you.

228
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,508
Internal Affairs is coming by tomorrow,
and they need to know that it's over.

229
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:35,011
That there's no bad blood
between you, OK?

230
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,890
I'm not asking.

231
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,284
Sorry if I scared you before.

232
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,497
Maybe we can start again?

233
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,006
You probably have a headache.
The sedative does that.

234
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:16,636
I got you aspirin for it.
Also antibiotics.

235
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,307
You have a pretty serious fever.
They'll help bring that down.

236
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,727
I'm not trying to drug you.
They really are just antibiotics.

237
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,357
See?

238
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,870
You're dehydrated.
Can you drink?

239
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,460
Careful, careful, careful.

240
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,422
I'm not gonna hurt you.

241
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,385
Where am I?

242
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,766
A safe place.
Far from Boyd.

243
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,813
I'm... not taking anything.

244
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,862
What's your name?

245
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,245
Look, you really need to talk to me.

246
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,001
- Rachel.
- OK.

247
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,797
Rachel...

248
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,343
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just want to see you get better.

249
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,140
Why didn't you take me to the hospital?

250
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,560
You know why.

251
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,437
No, I don't.

252
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,023
Because you saw me...

253
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,443
in the house.

254
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,866
I didn't see anything.

255
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,577
We both know that's not true.

256
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,997
I would never tell anyone.

257
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,958
Please...

258
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,211
...let me go.
- I can't.

259
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,469
What are you gonna do with me?

260
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,140
Nothing.

261
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,810
Are you gonna sell me?

262
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,021
Sell you? No.

263
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,735
- Then what are you gonna do?
- Nothing. I'm not gonna do anything.

264
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,486
I'm not lying.

265
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:42,073
Look, you can't even think straight
with a fever like that.

266
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,868
You need to take these.

267
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,588
- No, no.
- Stay away from me!

268
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,173
I'm trying to help you!

269
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,884
- Let me out! Let me out!
- I can't do that!

270
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,138
No! Please! Let me go!
I can't! I can't!

271
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,223
I can't go through it again!

272
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,936
Just... kill me now!

273
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,730
Please!

274
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,029
Harry's right. I need a plan.

275
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,507
- How you doing, Lopez?
- How's it look like I'm doing?

276
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,634
Listen, the other night...

277
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,096
we both had a little too much to drink...

278
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,514
and, um...

279
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,476
...when you insulted my wife...

280
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,144
I just saw red.

281
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,189
I'm sorry.

282
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,778
I'm not the first guy to take a swing at you.

283
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:05,615
Are you really gonna bust my chops
with IA over this?

284
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,288
You know that line between a few
and a few too many?

285
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,707
All too well.

286
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,793
Yeah, well,
I had way too many that night.

287
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,546
And I should have held my temper,
but I didn't.

288
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,632
And I apologise. Lo siento.

289
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,928
I don't know what else to say.

290
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,390
So are we OK or what?

291
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,809
You're OK.

292
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,354
I'm in a fucking hospital.

293
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,156
No. We're OK.

294
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,700
I'm not gonna press charges, Batista.

295
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,577
Now get the fuck out of my room.

296
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,715
The babysitter doesn't trust me
because of the lies.

297
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,426
Lumen doesn't trust me
because of the truth.

298
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,681
There must be a name for that.

299
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,142
Oh, right - Dexter Morgan.

300
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,438
The problem is Lumen knows
way too much about me

301
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,232
and I know nothing about her.

302
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,027
Hm. An unpaid motel bill.

303
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,738
I was hoping for more,
but at least it's a place to start.

304
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:34,079
- Hey, how was your nap?
- What nap?

305
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,499
- He woke up the second we got back.
- Oh. Sorry.

306
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,626
Fix you something to eat?

307
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,420
I'm too tired to chew.

308
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,548
- Damn it, Dexter!
- What? What is it?

309
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,258
Nothing. It's just...

310
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,596
What is this?

311
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,182
It's a little toy keyboard.

312
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:58,394
No, I mean, why am I sitting on it?
Why are we living like this?

313
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,107
Between the baby stuff
and your stuff and my stuff -

314
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:06,277
which I can barely see anymore -
I feel like a fucking refugee.

315
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,988
I get it. I get it. OK.

316
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,202
You need some peace and quiet.

317
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,040
- We'll head out for a while.
- Where are you going?

318
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,833
- So what can I do for you?
- I'm not sure.

319
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,836
I think my wife, his mom...

320
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:08,548
might have left her luggage here,
Lumen Pierce.

321
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,176
Let's have a look-see.
Can you spell that, please?

322
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,970
Yeah, it's P-l-E-R-C-E.

323
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,640
The other name.
The weird one. No offence.

324
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,643
Lumen.
L-U-M-E-N.

325
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,647
Mm-hm.

326
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,316
I remember her.

327
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,611
Your wife prepaid two weeks.
It's been over a month.

328
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,864
Yeah, change of plans. We ended up
staying with friends in North Beach.

329
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,574
Well, she never checked out.

330
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,869
We sent her file to a collection agency.

331
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,414
Gee, it'd be a lot simpler
if you'd just let me take care of it.

332
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,541
Do you, by any chance,
still have her luggage?

333
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,627
Yeah, in storage.

334
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,379
I'd appreciate it. We both would.

335
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,215
Three-twenty and we're square.

336
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,468
OK.

337
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:02,101
Put your John Hancock here,
and I'll go fetch your wife's luggage.

338
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,895
Great.

339
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,275
Ten months' old
and you've had your first cigarette.

340
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,152
Sorry about that.

341
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,635
"Dear Lumen...

342
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:40,431
"I know it feels like the end of the world
right now, but it's not.

343
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,228
"I understand
why you felt you had to leave.

344
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:49,065
"And believe me,
you have nothing to be ashamed of.

345
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,693
"And as for your father,

346
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,070
"I know he said things he regrets,

347
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,822
"even though he'll never admit it.

348
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,827
"We miss you. We love you.

349
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:04,664
"Take all the time you need,
but then please come home.

350
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,418
"It's not a family without you.
Loνe Mom."

351
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,857
Dexter.

352
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,611
Sorry. I woke you up.
I was trying to be quiet.

353
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,535
You were gone a long time.
I was worried about you.

354
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,121
Just went for a little drive.

355
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,165
Sorry about before.

356
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,044
And in case you didn't know,

357
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,255
you and Harrison are
the most important people to me.

358
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,924
You're the only important people.

359
00:27:57,051 --> 00:28:01,346
You guys can stay here forever.
I don't care about the mess.

360
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,765
I'm the fucking slob in the family anyway.

361
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,521
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

362
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,275
I would love a beer.

363
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,798
Mr Morgan.

364
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,134
Please give us another chance.

365
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,055
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- I know I screwed up.

366
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,849
There's no need to apologise.
Harrison is a wonderful child,

367
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,852
and you will have no trouble
finding someone else to watch him.

368
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,313
I don't want someone else to watch him.
- Well, I'm flattered...

369
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,317
And I heard you -
about how you need to be able to trust me.

370
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,196
What I said was I don't trust you.

371
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,914
Look, there was an emergency.

372
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:14,210
A girl was badly hurt.
She was very near death.

373
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,837
I spent the night trying to help her,

374
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:20,091
and then I was called to a crime scene
by my sister. That's where I was.

375
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,592
Really.

376
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:27,473
And I'm here now
because we interviewed 30 people,

377
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,600
and you're the one...

378
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,145
who didn't scare me, basically.

379
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,689
You're the only one
I could trust Harrison to.

380
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:40,695
Well, you are holding him
a little bit like a football.

381
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,157
Now...

382
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,367
what do they call it?

383
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,577
A leap of faith.

384
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,664
I guess it's one on both our parts.

385
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,710
One more chance, Mr Morgan,
but that's it.

386
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,007
Look at this.

387
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,429
- Look at what?
- Notice anything missing?

388
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,680
How would I know?

389
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:12,310
Somebody's been dipping into my meds,
and methinks me knows who.

390
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:15,771
Yeah, Dexter was back here
alone yesterday.

391
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:19,192
- I don't know, maybe it was him.
- No motive, Detective.

392
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,195
You, on the other hand,
have been getting down and dirty

393
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,114
with the hottest potty mouth
in the South.

394
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,242
Now, I appreciate you taking
preventative measures

395
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:32,288
so as not to pass on whatever sick scurvy
you may carry on to her.

396
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,623
Hm.

397
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,922
I'm willing to share.
All you have to do is ask.

398
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,634
OK, I didn't take your meds.

399
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,514
And I'm not getting
down and dirty with Debra.

400
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,890
OK?

401
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,813
May I just say that I admire your chivalry?

402
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,983
It's a rare man who won't kiss and tell.

403
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,447
Make sure you get
the names and numbers...

404
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,826
- Get back to me when you finish.
- Mm-hm.

405
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,370
Excuse me.

406
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,082
McCourt.

407
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:21,379
Just wanted to let you know that
I paid Sergeant Lopez a visit yesterday.

408
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,173
- So I heard.
- I apologised, he accepted.

409
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,591
We're Jake. It's all good.

410
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,802
Hey, you put a cop in the hospital.

411
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:31,347
What happens now
is up to the department, not him.

412
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,724
Meaning what?

413
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,271
Fact is, it's assault and battery
against a fellow officer.

414
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,482
It's a few punches against
a drunken loudmouth.

415
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,694
- Good morning, Jim.
- Lieutenant.

416
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,071
You mean to tell me
you have nothing more important to do

417
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,406
than to investigate a bar fight?

418
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,783
How's the timeline coming
on the Santa Muerte case?

419
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,952
The timeline's just fine.

420
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,871
I'm due upstairs in 20 minutes,
so we should get going.

421
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:59,500
- Would you like some coffee?
- That would be wonderful.

422
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,881
- My husband's not wrong, you know.
- How's that?

423
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,217
Considering the fact
that the other officer involved...

424
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,927
The assault victim.

425
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,389
It was just a bar fight, Jim.

426
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:16,851
Now, you and I both know
they happen all the time.

427
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:24,025
- OK, I'm wondering what can end this.
- See, I'm more interested in what started it.

428
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:27,570
Because...
according to Sergeant Lopez's deposition,

429
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,780
he said, drunkenly,

430
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,492
that you give the best blowjob in Miami.

431
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,666
Is that part of the official record?

432
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,461
Should it be?

433
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,682
Hey, good news.

434
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:01,270
Masuka found a match on that partial print
we had from the cigar butt.

435
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:05,274
Or are you no longer interested
in solving homicides?

436
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,152
- Huh?
- Carlos Fuentes. You're gonna love this.

437
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,530
He's got a brother, Marco.
They live together, and I got the address.

438
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,240
Two of them.

439
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,909
Does that sound like
what we've been looking for,

440
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,702
or does that sound like
what we've been looking for?

441
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,413
I'll get a team together.
Let's get these guys.

442
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,791
Where's Quinn again?
Fucknose is gonna miss the party.

443
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,418
I have no idea. Who knows?

444
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,301
Fuck.

445
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,238
Hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

446
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,618
OK, go. Go, go, go, go.

447
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:07,503
Morgan, you, you, you,
the other end of the hall. You, upstairs.

448
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,509
- Freeze!
- No, no. We want Fuentes.

449
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:14,927
Let him go. Let him go.

450
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,303
Go!

451
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,779
Open up. Police.

452
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,536
Police. Policía.

453
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,291
Nobody move.

454
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,042
Holy shit.

455
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,797
We want these guys.

456
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,133
Fuentes. Fuentes.

457
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,551
Fuentes.

458
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,689
No habla.

459
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,384
Cut him and I'll blow your fucking head off.

460
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:39,512
You hear me?

461
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,013
Let him go.

462
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,724
- You let him go!
- Everybody clear? Report in.

463
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,392
Diaz, clear.

464
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,812
- Manzon, clear.
- Responder.

465
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:51,273
- Detective Morgan, you clear?
- Responder.

466
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,319
Yes, clear.

467
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,740
You stupid bitch.

468
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,576
Argh! Help!

469
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,331
Medic! I need a fucking medic!

470
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,989
Don't you dare let him die.

471
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,328
- You OK?
- Fine.

472
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,665
Fuck, I should have shot Fuentes
when I had the chance!

473
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,709
- And risk killing that kid?
- He might die anyway.

474
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,712
And he might live, thanks to you.
We nearly caught those fucks.

475
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,298
- You did good.
- You weren't there.

476
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,849
Lumen Ann Pierce, from Minnesota.

477
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:14,565
If I can get the crotchety judgmental
babysitter from Ireland to trust me...

478
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,317
I say, why not you?

479
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,753
Yah!

480
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:56,750
Stop! Stop! Help me!
Help! Help me!

481
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,629
Do you need a ride?

482
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,257
Yeah, what are you doing out here?

483
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,883
Hey, where are you going?

484
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,804
Man, she is fucked-up!

485
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,602
No! No!

486
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:16,937
- No! No!
- Lumen...

487
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,023
- No! No!
- Lumen. Lumen...

488
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,774
Lumen. Lumen.

489
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:23,944
Would you stop? Stop.

490
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,404
Would you stop!

491
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,947
Shh!

492
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,938
You know how close you came back there?

493
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,941
If she'd gotten in that car,
it would have been all over.

494
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,402
Where are we going?

495
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,072
Believe me, she will never trust you.

496
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,531
Where are you taking me?

497
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,911
First rule of the code - don't get caught.
And you're out of options now.

498
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,954
- Let me go.
- She's left you no choice.

499
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,456
Quiet.

500
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,278
Jonah?

501
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,823
Hey. Don't be afraid.
I'm a cop.

502
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,909
- Miami Metro.
- Do I know you?

503
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,787
I think I know who Kyle Butler is.

504
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,747
Do you recognise this man?

505
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,294
- Why do you want to know?
- Is this Kyle Butler?

506
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,005
- Hey, back away! Back away!
- I'm a cop. It's OK.

507
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,716
Keep your hands where I can
fuckin' see 'em, and shut the hell up.

508
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,844
Jonah, go to the car now.

509
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,137
Turn around.

510
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,808
Come on. Move.

511
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,897
- Please. Don't!
- Just move.

512
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,734
What are you gonna do?

513
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,371
- Look at this.
- No! No!

514
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,956
Look.

515
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:27,377
This is what happened
to the girls before you.

516
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,671
This is what was gonna happen to you.

517
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,091
Every one of these barrels
has a body in it.

518
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,554
Boyd preserved them in formaldehyde
so he could come and visit.

519
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,599
Do you understand?

520
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,976
I saved your life.

521
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:50,150
How do I know that
you didn't kill these girls?

522
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,031
You don't.

523
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:06,124
It's a leap of faith...
for both of us.

524
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,383
My wife was murdered...

525
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,802
brutally...

526
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,512
by someone like Boyd.

527
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,684
I don't want to see any more
innocent people die.

528
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,232
Here, you don't believe me?
Take it.

529
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,775
No.

530
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:39,032
Take it. It's yours.

531
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,427
Are you done?

532
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,950
I tell you to leave Trinity's family alone,

533
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,828
and instead...
you go behind my back.

534
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,331
And based on what? This?

535
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:30,208
A cut-and-paste sketch you think
resembles Dexter Morgan?

536
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,545
- The kid recognised him.
- He identified Dexter as Kyle Butler?

537
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,547
He didn't get a chance, but I could tell.

538
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:40,969
Oh, you could tell.
And did Jonah convey this ID to the FBI?

539
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,429
- No.
- Right.

540
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,598
Because it's bullshit.

541
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,018
You have your suspicions,
you come to me.

542
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:52,189
- I tried.
- And when I say no, Quinn, it's over!

543
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,653
You're on unpaid suspension
until further notice.

544
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,155
Suspension?

545
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,115
Just tell everyone you're
taking a few vacation days.

546
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,283
You kidding?

547
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,828
Am I fucking kidding?

548
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:11,541
You're lucky I don't terminate your ass.
And you know the one reason I don't?

549
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:15,420
Because there'd be a mandatory hearing,
and this whole embarrassment

550
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,089
would become a matter of record.

551
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:22,094
No one needs to hear
about your stupid theories.

552
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,221
It would tear this department apart.

553
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,142
- Understood?
- Sure.

554
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,313
He just lost his wife,
for Christ's sakes!

555
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,327
Hey, skeezey.

556
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,914
Where you been all day?

557
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,084
Very long, fucked-up story.

558
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,006
I heard about the raid.

559
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,925
Perp got away.

560
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,053
What I heard was
you saved someone's life.

561
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:14,438
I let you down.
I should've been there to back you up.

562
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,359
- Yeah, you should've.
- Yeah.

563
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,114
You OK?

564
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:29,411
I guess not, cos everybody
keeps asking me that.

565
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,625
I don't want to be alone tonight.

566
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,255
Deb, I'm...

567
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,426
no good for you.

568
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,971
I'm not looking for good right now.

569
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,112
Is that true?

570
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,157
What you said about your wife?

571
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,411
Yes.

572
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:20,337
How did it happen?

573
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,673
Knife.

574
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:34,726
Painful and cruel.

575
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,027
I'm sorry...

576
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:46,696
that I cut you.

577
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:52,285
I thought you were a monster, like Boyd.

578
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,624
I thought you were going to kill me.

579
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,169
Or worse.

580
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,883
I was locked up.

581
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,763
I don't know where,
or for how long.

582
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,143
All I know is that it was horrible.

583
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:24,192
And I thought...
it would never stop.

584
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,494
But it has stopped.
He's dead. It's over.

585
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,038
You can go home.

586
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,958
I don't think so.

587
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:42,586
You can.

588
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,633
I read your letter.
I know you have a family who loves you.

589
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,760
You should go home to them.

590
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,806
It's not that simple.

591
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,644
It is.

592
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,771
It really is.

593
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,282
Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me.

594
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,578
There were others.

595
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,964
It's not over.
