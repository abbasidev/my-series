1
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,552
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,223
- We are going to take it!
- Take it!

3
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,850
Cole Harmon,
Chase's Chief of Security -

4
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,977
torturer, rapist, killer.

5
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:22,480
It's time to tap into my primal self.

6
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:23,648
Why did you want to see me?

7
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,400
I am very interested
in what happened to you.

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,778
I would like to discuss your situation
in-depth at another time.

9
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,823
Our informant, Yasmin Aragon,
was shot and killed.

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,658
This is a fucking disaster!

11
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,202
If mistakes were made,
they most certainly were not mine.

12
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,580
I can confirm that Detective Morgan
was in charge of the operation.

13
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:43,376
As of today, she's being placed
on immediate suspension with pay.

14
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,253
It's just your word against mine.

15
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,339
Some people don't agree
with your version of the events.

16
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,383
Who did you get to lie for you?

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,677
It was you.

18
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,346
Don't you want to know about this girl
shacked up with Dexter Morgan?

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,349
Name - Lumen Pierce. Lumen.

20
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:04,522
Shows up here in Miami one week before
your boy's wife, Rita Morgan, is murdered.

21
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,192
You fuckin' bitch!

22
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,279
Who are the others?

23
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,865
The guy who held a watch
up to my ear.

24
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,618
"Tick-tick-tick.
That's the sound of your life running out."

25
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,166
It's what I tell my clients.

26
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,625
Tick-tick-tick?

27
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,627
That's the sound
of your life running out.

28
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,172
Jordan Chase is one of them.

29
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,299
We're gonna take down Jordan Chase?

30
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,254
On a good day, when I run,

31
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,548
the voices in my head get quieter

32
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:39,927
until it's just me, my breath
and my feet on the sand.

33
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,727
Pick up the pace, Dexter.

34
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,021
Today is not one of those days.

35
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,442
When I scheduled a private session
with Jordan Chase,

36
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,111
I wasn't looking for advice.
Just proof.

37
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,032
Evidence of exactly how
he was involved in Lumen's torture,

38
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,784
because the code requires certainty.

39
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,911
Faster, Dex.

40
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,121
I just wanted access to his office,

41
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,999
the inner sanctum
where I could find clues.

42
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,209
Instead, I'm stuck here,

43
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,295
running in place.

44
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,298
Look, I get it.
You're frustrated.

45
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,675
You feel like you're not getting
what you came here for.

46
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,510
Yeah, a bit.

47
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,679
Intense exercise works.

48
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,349
Tears down your defences,
brings out your feelings.

49
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,103
Well, I have the feeling that I'd be
more comfortable talking on a couch.

50
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,693
Trust me, this is the way
to build a new you.

51
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:45,076
At the seminar, we went over
how tragedy fractures us, right?

52
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,160
Yeah.

53
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,455
We're like Humpty Dumpty
and the big fall.

54
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:54,502
What I'm telling you now
is trauma is also opportunity.

55
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,213
Tragedy tears us apart, sure.

56
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,674
But it's your one chance
to recreate yourself.

57
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,551
You get to put yourself
back together again any way you want.

58
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,014
- OK.
- Don't be sceptical. I know it for a fact.

59
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,850
How? What happened to you?

60
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,727
You didn't come here to talk about me.

61
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,356
Something big must have happened
if it inspired your entire philosophy.

62
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:23,155
OK, I'll tell you where it started,
if you promise to keep it between us.

63
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,828
- Plato.
- What?

64
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,663
The notion of a fractured self.

65
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,832
It's from Plato's Symposium.
You ever read it?

66
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,418
Maybe in college.

67
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,628
But you don't remember it, right?
Most people don't.

68
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,047
But for me, it was a revelation.

69
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,133
It was exactly what I needed
at the time.

70
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,553
So... I took it.

71
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,055
I took Plato's idea
that we are fractured creatures,

72
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,349
trying to become whole,
and I ran with it.

73
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,144
Boom, a million copies sold.

74
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,109
So... now you know my secret.

75
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,236
You ready to tell me yours?

76
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,782
Over your dead body.

77
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,037
An hour on the treadmill,
and I came up empty. Not a clue.

78
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,873
Only upside is I got in
my cardio for the day.

79
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,292
Jordan is one tough nut to crack.

80
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,128
You're one tough nut to crack,
you know that, Dexter?

81
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,546
I wish he'd stop doing that.

82
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,175
We ran for an hour.
You didn't give up anything.

83
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,011
I know you're in killer shape,
but you can't outrun me forever.

84
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,347
You have to give me
something to work with.

85
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,476
Otherwise...
how can I help you?

86
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,895
Maybe you can't.

87
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,565
Or maybe you can.
Is that blood?

88
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,444
No pressure.

89
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,113
It can take several meetings
for us to have a real breakthrough.

90
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,907
But I do need your commitment.

91
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,493
I need to get my hands on that vial.

92
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:54,205
Otherwise,
we're just wasting our time.

93
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,166
I really think
I can help you, though.

94
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,417
I think so too.

95
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,753
When can I get in to see you again?

96
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,213
Check with my receptionist
on the way out,

97
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,590
I think I may have an opening
tomorrow morning.

98
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,647
Well, that was lucky.
10am tomorrow.

99
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,149
He doesn't have anything else
for the next two weeks.

100
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,111
- Perfect.
- See you tomorrow.

101
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,238
I didn't notice you last time.
You new here?

102
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,573
Just started three days ago.

103
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,534
I don't remember
so much security either.

104
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,870
Mr Chase says
he's beefing things up.

105
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:36,956
That's no surprise.

106
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:41,335
Lumen and I have been
knocking off his friends one by one.

107
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,588
How many security guards?

108
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,674
I don't know.
Maybe a dozen.

109
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,969
But you think that you can still
get to the blood necklace thing, right?

110
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,887
Yeah. While Jordan's in the shower.

111
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,182
- Won't he notice if it's missing?
- No, I'm not gonna swipe it.

112
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,226
I'm just gonna extract a sample.

113
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,311
I'll run it for DNA,
hopefully get an ID.

114
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,065
Run it for DNA.
God, I love that you can do that.

115
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,236
So whose blood do you think it is?
If it is blood.

116
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,071
Most likely a victim.

117
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,949
Whatever it is, it's important to him.
He's wearing it around his neck.

118
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,493
It's definitely some kind of trophy.

119
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,415
Are you there?

120
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,500
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

121
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,420
There's someone at the kitchen door.

122
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,714
They're trying to get in.

123
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,175
Go out the front door.
I'll be there in a few minutes.

124
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,928
Dexter, there's someone there too.

125
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,388
- Hide.
- Where?

126
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,016
In the bathroom.
I'll get there as fast as I can.

127
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,903
What's happening?

128
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,324
- They're inside.
- What?

129
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,291
They're coming!

130
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,668
Put the phone down.
Leave the line open.

131
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,069
- Jesus!
- Who the fuck are you?

132
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,528
Who the fuck are you?

133
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,281
Who the fuck is she?

134
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,659
You wanna try that again, Astor?

135
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,995
- Who is she?
- Her name is Lumen.

136
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,539
I mean who is she?
Why is she here?

137
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,292
She's... renting the house.

138
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,213
- You said the house was empty.
- Thought it was.

139
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,632
How was I supposed to know
he got a girlfriend so fast?

140
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,885
First of all, she's not my girlfriend.
She's a tenant, like I said.

141
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,679
Second of all, who are you?

142
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,723
I'm Olivia.
I live near her grandparents.

143
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,061
- Anyone wanna tell me how you got here?
- Taxi.

144
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,188
It's 215 miles.

145
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,150
From a bus station.

146
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,696
- Where'd you get the liquor?
- Does it matter?

147
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,823
Yeah, I'd say so.
You're 12.

148
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,825
You said you were 14!

149
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,536
Thanks a lot.

150
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,373
If you really wanna know,
we stole it from my house.

151
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,791
That's reassuring.

152
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,793
I think I need to sit down.

153
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,008
Do your parents know where you are?

154
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,385
My mom thinks I'm at Astor's.

155
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,430
And let me guess,
your grandparents think you're at Olivia's.

156
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:45,561
Don't call 'em. Please.
At least not until tomorrow.

157
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,064
They should really
stay the night and sober up.

158
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,358
Then I'll stay too.

159
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,902
With her?

160
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,821
Oh...

161
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,364
I think I'm gonna...

162
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,745
Here. Come with me.

163
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,039
I'll get you to bed, OK?

164
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,927
Quite a situation we have here.

165
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,722
Unless you have advice
on dealing with teenage girls,

166
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,931
I don't want to hear it.

167
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,476
My advice?
Get Astor out of here.

168
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,978
Tomorrow morning
you're collecting evidence

169
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,773
on a violent murderer you plan to kill.

170
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,650
You really want a hung-over
preteen in the middle of that?

171
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,861
- She came here.
- Drunk!

172
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,446
I can't just turn her away.

173
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,783
Dexter, there's a reason
serial killers don't have children.

174
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,828
You can't be killer and dad.
Haven't you learned anything?

175
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,705
Her mother is dead because of you.

176
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,666
Which is why I need to make things right
and be a good father.

177
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:54,338
A good father would get those girls
as far away as possible.

178
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,096
Harrison's still
at the apartment with Sonya.

179
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,681
I'm gonna go get him,
bring him back here.

180
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,112
Deb. You're gonna
break something. Relax.

181
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,323
You relax. You're not about to have
the worst meeting of your career.

182
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,992
It's a union rep.
He's on your side.

183
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,452
You know, just be professional

184
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,413
and don't freak out until you actually
know what's gonna happen.

185
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,748
I know what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna get fired.

186
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,376
No, you're not.
Even LaGuerta said this isn't gonna stick.

187
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,711
- I'm supposed to trust her?
- No.

188
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,464
But you can trust me.

189
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,758
Everything's gonna be OK.

190
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,636
You know why?
Cos you're gonna get your job back.

191
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,721
You got everyone
at the station on your side

192
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,765
and you got a boyfriend who loves you.

193
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,647
Seriously?
You're gonna drop that on me now?

194
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,858
It's just an expression.
It slipped out.

195
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,777
- I gotta go.
- Fine. Forget I said it.

196
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,786
- What?
- Good morning to you, too, sunshine.

197
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,872
- You alone?
- Yeah. What's up?

198
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,458
Your pecker.
Soon as you take a look at these snaps

199
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,793
I took of your boy Dexter Morgan

200
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,963
and his gal pal on some kind of
middle-of-the-night boat run.

201
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,591
- Wanna meet for a beer?
- It's 7am.

202
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,884
Beer is good anytime.

203
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,053
- Yeah. I gotta work.
- Then I'll come to you.

204
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,557
What'd I just say? I can't now!
I'll call you later.

205
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,621
You sure you wanna keep
your appointment with Jordan?

206
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,039
Well, I need to.

207
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,167
There's not gonna be
another chance to get the blood.

208
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,711
Besides, it's something
I actually know how to do.

209
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,467
You were a teenage girl, right?
How do I deal with Astor?

210
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,469
Try talking to her.

211
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,264
Last time I did that, she said she hated me
and moved to Orlando.

212
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,642
Well, now you get a second chance.

213
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,857
Share something with her...
What you did when you were her age.

214
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,567
I killed the neighbour's dog.

215
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,237
Well, don't tell her that.

216
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,285
- Seriously, what do I do?
- Just... cut her some slack.

217
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,954
All kids that age make mistakes.

218
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,748
Trust me, the hangover
will be punishment enough.

219
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,584
Is that your brother?

220
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,921
Harrison.

221
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,383
He doesn't even recognise me.

222
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:49,346
Well... you didn't look like a raccoon
last time he saw you.

223
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,938
Eat. It's hangover food,
it'll soak up the alcohol.

224
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,526
Talk to her.
Share something.

225
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:07,364
So I need to go
to a meeting in a few minutes.

226
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,785
But I was hoping after that
we could spend the day together,

227
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,163
cos we really should talk.

228
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,419
So is that OK?

229
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,588
Can Harrison come?

230
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,966
Sure. I'll call the baby-sitter,
tell her there's a change of plans.

231
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:40,981
Mama.

232
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,778
I have no idea why he said that.
I barely know him.

233
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,948
Stop lying, OK?
I'm not stupid.

234
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,534
She's not your mama.

235
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,746
- Your mama's dead.
- Astor.

236
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,291
I'll tell you this -
if you were the one who died,

237
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,003
I really doubt my mom would have
brought in a tenant so fast.

238
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,010
- I should go.
- I know.

239
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,346
It'll only be a couple hours.

240
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,139
I can handle it.

241
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,854
My family is pretty weird too.

242
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,445
Hey.

243
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,706
How'd it go with the union suit?

244
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,543
They're sticking me in the file room.
Till after my hearing.

245
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,712
You're not fired.
It's good news.

246
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,963
Yeah, it's great.

247
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,384
Except everybody still thinks
I'm responsible for that girl dying

248
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,720
and all those kids getting wounded
in that nightclub.

249
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:58,558
For the record, my report
backed your story 100 per cent.

250
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,479
Not that it mattered.
The brass backed my wife.

251
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,981
Matters to me.
Thank you.

252
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,363
Anybody needs a real fucking detective,
I'll be in the file room.

253
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,244
Detective Scapegoat
reporting for duty.

254
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,080
They said you'd be joining me.

255
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,207
Come on.
I can get you started.

256
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,711
Right over here.

257
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,839
So... how's it going
with that man of yours?

258
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,967
This morning,
out of the blue, he...

259
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,177
- told me he loved me.
- Oh!

260
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,847
- You say it back?
- No. I ran.

261
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,142
What? What's the problem?
You don't feel the same way?

262
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,935
No, the problem is that...

263
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,272
- I'm afraid I might.
- Oh.

264
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,315
What is this,
the barrel girls case?

265
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,402
- File it under creepy?
- Under closed cases.

266
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,571
Not read, honey. File.

267
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,116
That's what I get paid to do,
and for the next few weeks,

268
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,452
so do you.

269
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:14,176
- Good session.
- Another hour of running in place.

270
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,179
You seem more open.
You feel the difference?

271
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,388
Yeah.

272
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,808
I feel like I might...
take away something valuable this time.

273
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,144
Hmm. Good.

274
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,229
Well, I got to tell you.

275
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,609
I still feel like you're not being
completely honest with me.

276
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,070
Really?

277
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,072
About what?

278
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,158
About what you really want.

279
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,534
What I really want...

280
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,912
Just a drop.

281
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,414
A 30-gauge needle should
slide right in undetected.

282
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,419
He won't even notice it's missing.

283
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,463
What do you mean?

284
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,382
What you want out of life.

285
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,426
Whatever it is, you have to tell me

286
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,221
so that I can help you
construct a plan to get there.

287
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,641
I have a plan to get there.
Lumen and I follow this blood trail.

288
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,892
We take you out.

289
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,520
Believe it or not,
you're helping me already.

290
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,773
I hope so.
I really do.

291
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,491
Each of us...

292
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,577
deep down,
we know what we really want.

293
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,288
It's just a matter of actually doing it.

294
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,873
Yeah.

295
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,460
I gotta get back to work.

296
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,046
New evidence to process.

297
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,841
But, uh, thanks again for everything.

298
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,760
So when's our next appointment?

299
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,555
I'll check with the receptionist.

300
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,322
What did I tell you?

301
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:44,159
You're supposed to be filing things away,
not makin' a mess.

302
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,703
Wait, wait. I was reading that.

303
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,039
- Yeah, that's the problem.
- Just give me one more second.

304
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,338
Holy shit! Look at this.

305
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:00,508
- What am I lookin' at?
- DNA results. Multiple DNA results.

306
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,344
- The barrel girls case?
- Mm-hm.

307
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,722
We pinned this on one guy and...

308
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,350
looks like there are multiple perps.

309
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,977
I'm just gonna...

310
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,729
Tell me what you see.

311
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,440
DNA sequencing report,

312
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,151
partial sequences on three,
maybe four perps?

313
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,820
What case is this?

314
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,156
- Barrel girls.
- Didn't we...

315
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,368
- Didn't we pin this on one guy?
- Yes. Boyd Fowler.

316
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,330
But the coroner found trace DNA
on the girls that wasn't Boyd's.

317
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,792
There were partial sequences
from multiple people.

318
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,335
It's all in the file.

319
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,170
Why am I only hearing
about this now?

320
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,881
Because by the time
the final coroner report came through,

321
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,841
we'd already closed the case.

322
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,594
The only reason I came across this
was because I was filing it all away.

323
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,474
Look. This is Cole Harmon,
our original suspect.

324
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,394
Jordan Chase's security guy.
We let him go.

325
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,605
We got DNA samples on him.
Tell me what you see.

326
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,649
There are enough common markers

327
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,486
that Cole Harmon is looking pretty good
for the barrel girls' murders.

328
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,946
At the very least,
he can't be excluded.

329
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,408
What are you saying,
that Cole and Boyd did this together?

330
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:10,328
Yeah.
With maybe three or four others.

331
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,374
We gotta reopen this case.

332
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,710
I know.
But I can't tell LaGuerta.

333
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,837
I'm supposed to be on file clerk duty.

334
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,091
I... I'm not tellin' her.

335
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,927
This case was solved.

336
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,764
If I ask her to reopen it,
I may as well put my balls in a vice.

337
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,891
And not in a hot way either.

338
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,229
Well, that just leaves... me.

339
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,284
Hey. You're late.

340
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,536
Yeah. Tough morning.

341
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:56,750
Astor showed up on my doorstep last night,
drunk with a friend.

342
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,502
How old's the friend?

343
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,256
Just kidding.

344
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,721
What's that?
Blood sample?

345
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,515
Yes. It's a blood sample.

346
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,144
Top secret, huh? I get it.

347
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,898
So... what is it?
Blood alcohol for Astor?

348
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:24,903
She vomited all over the floor.
Further testing is kind of unnecessary.

349
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,822
- STD panel?
- Vince, she's 12.

350
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,658
I meant for you.

351
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,996
It's a homicide victim I'm supposed
to have processed already.

352
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,875
I made a mistake,
forgot to submit it, OK?

353
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,336
Morgan.

354
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,922
Dexter, the girls are gone.

355
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,007
- Gone where?
- I don't know. But they're missing.

356
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,343
They felt terrible,
and we didn't have any Advil in the house,

357
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,178
so I took Harrison to the store.

358
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,263
- You left them alone?
- I was trying to be nice.

359
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,681
When I got back, they were gone.

360
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,850
- Maybe they went for a walk.
- I don't think so.

361
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,104
The back door is wide open,
and their cellphones are still here.

362
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:04,317
Dexter, what 14-year-old girl
willingly leaves her cellphone behind?

363
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,695
- Don't move. I'll be right there.
- I'm so sorry.

364
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,002
- What's going on?
- I went to the neighbour's house...

365
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,463
- to see if he saw anything.
- What?

366
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,091
Hey. So I saw some guy
near the house.

367
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,552
Uh, light hair, average build,
mid-30s.

368
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,388
Like Cole and Boyd and Dan.

369
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,889
Oh, he had a white panel van.

370
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,851
And it was weird enough
I checked out the plate. N4B something.

371
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,728
- Why didn't you stop him?
- I didn't know the girls were in the house.

372
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,397
I didn't even know you had a tenant.

373
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,440
Just thought he was
a painter or something.

374
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,484
Which is why you thought
to check the license plate?

375
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,862
Well, no, that's just habit
from neighbourhood watch.

376
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,363
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

377
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,327
- What are you doing?
- Looking for signs of a break-in.

378
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,706
An abduction, that's what
we're thinking here, right?

379
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,207
Yeah. But it doesn't make any sense.

380
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,543
It does if someone
came looking for us.

381
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,378
Like one of Jordan's guys.

382
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,381
There's a reason you were worried last night
when you heard noises in the house.

383
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,383
But I overreacted.
It was nothing.

384
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,887
Only this time there was someone
lurking around the house.

385
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:18,308
I shouldn't have stolen that blood sample.
Not with the girls here.

386
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,272
We need to call the cops.

387
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,275
They'll just start asking questions.

388
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:31,112
And if it does have to do with Jordan,
they'll probably trace it all back to us.

389
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,620
- Metro.
- This is Dexter Morgan from Homicide.

390
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,623
I'd like to report
a probable child abduction.

391
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,792
It's a white panel van.
I have a partial plate.

392
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,926
We've issued a blanket APB on the van.
NCIC has started a file on the girls.

393
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,510
Until we get them back safely,

394
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:57,430
Detective Linker will be
our liaison to missing persons.

395
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,642
- Did you call Olivia's parents?
- I tried. I couldn't get ahold of them.

396
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,645
- What about Astor's grandparents?
- They hadn't heard from her.

397
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,772
I didn't tell them she was missing, though.

398
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,982
Didn't want to worry them... yet.

399
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,110
Most missing children are abducted
by someone the parents know.

400
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,530
- Is there anyone you can think of?
- No. Nobody.

401
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,283
You sure?
No one new?

402
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,912
Where were you, anyway,
when they were taken?

403
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,499
I can't lie about this.
Not with Astor's life on the line.

404
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,085
I was with Jordan Chase.

405
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:37,679
He... offered me some private sessions
to help deal with Rita's death.

406
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,100
What?

407
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,645
A lot of fucked up people
circling that guy, Dex.

408
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,649
A lot? Who?
Besides Boyd Fowler.

409
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,567
Well, his head of security for one.

410
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,820
I thought we cleared him.

411
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,699
- May have been premature.
- OK... what's going on?

412
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,243
The barrel girls case might
not be as closed as we thought.

413
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,370
Can we just find the van?

414
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,105
- Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

415
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,984
- Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
- On your knees! Hands on your head now!

416
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,902
Yeah, right there.

417
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,989
- Who is he?
- Name's Barry Kurt. No priors.

418
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,867
They found him
at a gas station on Coral.

419
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,747
- Where's Astor?
- Hey... easy!

420
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,290
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

421
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,125
- I'll kill you. You understand me?
- Get your hands off of me.

422
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,294
He's looking for the girls. Just like you.

423
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,714
- He's what?
- I'm Olivia's father.

424
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,883
Sort of, anyway.
I live with her mom.

425
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,512
I'm Astor's stepfather,
Dexter Morgan.

426
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,889
Yeah. You should try to calm down.

427
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,599
He thought something
happened to his daughter.

428
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,852
Something is gonna happen to them
when I find them.

429
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:11,481
Olivia broke into our liquor cabinet,
stole money from her mother, and took off.

430
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,775
We've got GPS tracking
on her mobile phone.

431
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,110
I followed it to your house,
but they weren't there.

432
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,446
I figured I'd gas up the van
and go back.

433
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:22,950
Next thing I know, I'm on my knees in cuffs,
like some loser on Cops.

434
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,954
- So where are they?
- Probably causing trouble somewhere.

435
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,998
Ever since Astor
moved down the block,

436
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,459
Olivia's been nothing
but a pain in the ass.

437
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,046
Morgan.

438
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,423
Is he always this violent?

439
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:43,221
They found the girls at Bayside.
They're holding them for shoplifting.

440
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,192
Astor?

441
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:01,697
Thank God. We had the whole department
looking for you. We were so worried.

442
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,825
You have no idea
what you put us through today.

443
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:04,951
I'm sorry.

444
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,787
What were you even thinking,
running off like that?

445
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,707
- Shoplifting? That figures.
- We didn't steal anything. I swear.

446
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,960
I just tried on a ring and forgot about it.

447
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,587
It was a mistake.
I gave it back.

448
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,383
I'm Detective Debra Morgan
from Miami Metro Homicide.

449
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,260
Mind if I take it from here?

450
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,054
Just make sure
I don't see these two again.

451
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,977
- Come on, we're going home.
- No!

452
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,855
- Now.
- My stuff's at Astor's. I need to go with her.

453
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,482
- You need to come with me.
- I don't want to.

454
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,401
Tell you what. Their stuff is at my house.

455
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,154
Why don't I take them there,
get them packed. We'll meet you in an hour.

456
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,073
You're gonna need to get your
van out of Impound anyway.

457
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,367
Which you're paying for,
by the way.

458
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,744
We'll meet you at the roadside café.
It's right near Impound.

459
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,080
Great.

460
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,877
Teenagers.
They can make you homicidal.

461
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,004
I know what you mean.

462
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,888
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

463
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,016
You wanna tell me what's going on
with you and Detective Morgan?

464
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,144
Nothing.
What do you mean?

465
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,980
Obviously you've been talking
about the barrel girls case.

466
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,734
We found some new evidence.

467
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,362
- You and Detective Morgan.
- She did. In the file room.

468
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,074
I was going to tell you.

469
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,204
- What?
- You really don't see what's going on?

470
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,499
I send her to the file room
with one assignment - file.

471
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,584
And then she magically
finds evidence

472
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,420
to reopen a case
she knows I personally closed.

473
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,173
Maria... it's DNA.

474
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,592
It's not like she made it up.

475
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:47,136
She's trying to get back at me.

476
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,681
We pinned this on Boyd Fowler.

477
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,975
I had five detectives
tell me he's the one.

478
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,521
And now I am telling you
that it's more complicated.

479
00:30:56,647 --> 00:31:00,274
- You need to reopen the case.
- I disagree.

480
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,902
Changing five names
on the murder board

481
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,446
from black to red
isn't gonna help this department.

482
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,407
The department? Or you?

483
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,998
What happened?

484
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,292
Uh, they were at Bayside.

485
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:22,004
- Oh. Thank God.
- Shoplifting.

486
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,467
You gonna introduce us?

487
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,846
That's the one I was telling you about.
His new girlfriend.

488
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,891
She's my tenant.

489
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,563
Lumen, this is my sister Debra.
Deb, Lumen.

490
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:44,735
- I didn't know he had a tenant.
- Didn't know he had a sister.

491
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,160
I'm gonna...

492
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,288
go check on the girls.

493
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,835
Seriously?

494
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:03,254
- That's your tenant?
- Yes.

495
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,009
Where's all her stuff?

496
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,012
She hasn't really moved in yet.

497
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,097
But you know her well enough
to trust her with your son.

498
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,641
It was an emergency.
I thought the girls had been taken.

499
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,768
Why are you keeping her a secret?

500
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,853
I'm not.

501
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,564
Really? Cos at the station we asked you
who you were spending your time with.

502
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,151
You didn't think to mention the hot blonde
that's living in your house?

503
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,278
Didn't seem... like it mattered.

504
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,822
Obviously, she didn't take the girls.

505
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,325
That's not the point.

506
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,784
I'm not judging you.

507
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,537
Believe me, I understand rebound
as much as anybody.

508
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,290
- But don't you think it's a little soon?
- I'm not on any rebound.

509
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,375
Come on. She's your tenant?

510
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,712
- Really?
- There's nothing going on.

511
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,548
Fine.

512
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,384
I give up.

513
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,179
I gotta get back to the station.

514
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,224
Deb knows about my partner in crime.

515
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,895
The whole station knows
I'm seeing Jordan Chase.

516
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,064
This is not my day.

517
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,107
Astor!

518
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,526
Just... stay cool.

519
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,654
No matter what.

520
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,628
You want to tell me
what's going on with you?

521
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,798
No. Cos nothing is going on with me.

522
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,092
Something is.

523
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,344
You're drinking,

524
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,553
shoplifting.

525
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,224
I already told you, we didn't steal anything.
And it wasn't me anyway.

526
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,893
You want to tell me why Barry thinks
you're the bad influence here?

527
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,270
- Cos he's an asshole.
- Stop.

528
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:49,151
This is not a good path
you're headed down here.

529
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,782
Look, just tell me what's wrong, OK?

530
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,326
I'm actually a good listener.

531
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,962
You want to know what's wrong?

532
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,630
My mom got murdered,

533
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,049
and you move her into our house
and tell me she's your tenant?

534
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,134
She is.

535
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,136
She's more. I can fucking tell.

536
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,346
Astor, you cannot
talk to me that way.

537
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,056
Oh.

538
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,767
I thought you said
you were this great listener.

539
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,398
I don't want to
talk about this any more.

540
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,734
Then we'll just sit here till you do.

541
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,080
- You ready to go home?
- Not really.

542
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,418
You know I ran away once, too.

543
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,545
I ditched out
on my own wedding.

544
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,298
I didn't run away.

545
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,845
Who did that to you?

546
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,142
The bruises on your stomach.

547
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:06,187
You don't know
what you're talking about.

548
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,566
Actually... I really do.

549
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,749
I think we have a problem.

550
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,503
Yeah, I'm in a battle of wills with my drunk,
shoplifting teenage stepdaughter,

551
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,379
and she's going to win.

552
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:35,382
Olivia has bruises
all over her stomach and back.

553
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,511
Someone's been hurting her.

554
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,805
She told you?

555
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,056
No, I saw.

556
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,642
Wait, you knew about this?

557
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:48,187
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad. I'm just...

558
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:52,316
I'm... I don't know what I am.

559
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,985
I'll be with Olivia.

560
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:01,325
Promise you won't say anything?
I don't want him to hurt her more.

561
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,451
Who?

562
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,204
Barry. Who do you think?
He is an asshole.

563
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,083
Does her mom know?

564
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,126
He only hits her
in places that don't show.

565
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,629
He gets all crazy over nothing.

566
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:17,007
He doesn't like her hair,
she's two minutes late.

567
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:22,263
I thought she'd be safe here,
but then there's Lumen,

568
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,850
and Barry showed up,
and we just... ran.

569
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,520
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Cos I didn't think you'd care.

570
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,900
Of course I care.

571
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,988
Even when we all lived here, you were
so busy out doing stuff all the time.

572
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,744
Olivia's my friend.

573
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,748
My only friend since Mom died.

574
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,751
I wanted to help her, and...

575
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,045
I didn't know what to do.

576
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,173
You did know what to do.
You came home.

577
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:07,141
I'm gonna take care of this. OK?

578
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,402
Everything OK with Astor?

579
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,864
Nothing turning 20 won't fix.
What'd LaGuerta say?

580
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,490
She's not gonna reopen the case.

581
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:27,328
She thinks that you have
some kind of vendetta against her.

582
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,580
- That's fucking ridiculous.
- Give her a day to cool off.

583
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,832
We'll try again tomorrow.

584
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,382
You're not gonna reopen the case?
Are you serious?

585
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,967
Come right in, Detective.

586
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:46,430
There are at least
five dead girls in barrels.

587
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,890
And now there's DNA evidence

588
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:51,894
saying that some of the people
that are responsible are still out there.

589
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,481
And you think that's about me
trying to get back at you?

590
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,734
Did you even read the file?

591
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,363
- There's fucking proof.
- Just watch your tone.

592
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,159
You know...

593
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,747
you throwing me under the bus
for the Fuentes brothers,

594
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,999
using your husband
as a chess piece,

595
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,503
putting Quinn on bogus vacation days
so that I don't have a fucking partner?

596
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,506
If that's all just some game to you,
I'll try to understand it.

597
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,050
But those girls are dead.

598
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:27,596
Don't you want to make sure
that that doesn't happen again?

599
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,975
I mean, what the fuck
are we doing here?

600
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,267
Enough!

601
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,855
- OK.
- OK what?

602
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,402
I'm reopening the case.

603
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:45,280
But you need to hear me, because
you have no idea what you're talking about.

604
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,994
I made the Fuentes situation go away.

605
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,578
I was trying to help Batista.

606
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:53,455
As far as Quinn goes,

607
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,542
he wasn't on vacation.
I suspended him.

608
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,005
To protect your brother.

609
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,514
Protect him from what?

610
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,768
You're so interested in the truth,

611
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,103
ask Quinn.

612
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,575
- Hey.
- Can I talk to you?

613
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,493
In private?

614
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,707
Look, if this is
about this morning...

615
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:40,169
Last month, when you told me
that you were taking some vacation days,

616
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,796
were you actually on suspension?

617
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,052
- Why? Who told you that?
- Were you?

618
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,681
- Did LaGuerta say something?
- She told me I should talk to you.

619
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:58,020
Did it have something
to do with my brother?

620
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,647
Yeah.

621
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,191
But it was nothing.

622
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,860
Then why did you lie?

623
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,532
I was investigating Rita's murder,

624
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,701
trying to help.

625
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,995
I had a lead on Kyle Butler.

626
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,749
I figured if we could find
the person who knew Trinity,

627
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:23,462
then maybe we could track down
the creep who killed your sister-in-law.

628
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:29,301
LaGuerta told me to back off,
leave it to the FBI.

629
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,845
When I didn't, she suspended me.

630
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,890
What was the lead?

631
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,310
Doesn't matter.
It didn't pan out.

632
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,772
LaGuerta told me
that she was protecting Dexter from you.

633
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,527
Why would she say that?

634
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:52,241
You remember those composite
sketches of Kyle Butler?

635
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,286
I got this crazy idea that...

636
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,413
maybe it was your brother.

637
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:05,337
Nothing came of it,
so I dropped it.

638
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,590
I'm an idiot, OK?

639
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,469
Yeah, you are.

640
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,722
Deb, I...

641
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,693
Shit.

642
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:48,088
What's this?
Where's Olivia?

643
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,715
I just wanted to...

644
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,342
speak to you first,
parent to parent.

645
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,262
Ah. You talked to Astor?

646
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,556
Yeah, I did.

647
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,977
Honestly, I'm not sure
what I should do.

648
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,520
I feel for you, man.

649
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,190
It's tough looking after
somebody else's kids.

650
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:09,318
Sometimes you just gotta
show 'em who's boss.

651
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,323
Is that what you do with Olivia,
show her who's boss?

652
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,118
What's that supposed to mean?

653
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,370
I know about Olivia's bruises,

654
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:24,374
how they're strategically placed
so they won't show.

655
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,004
I don't know
what you're talking about.

656
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,506
No?

657
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,134
Let me show you?

658
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,140
That's your solar plexus.

659
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,601
Right now, your diaphragm
is partially paralysed,

660
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,604
which is why you're having
trouble catching your breath.

661
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,981
What are you, man,
some kind of psycho?

662
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,609
Not today.
Just a concerned parent.

663
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,987
That's your liver.

664
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,823
The nice thing about the liver is,

665
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,451
if you hit it just right,
you get the vagus nerve,

666
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,828
which tentacles out
to the rest of your body.

667
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:06,333
Your brain short-circuits,
your body shuts down,

668
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,878
and you feel,
what's the word, terror?

669
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,589
Which is what Olivia felt
every time you hit her there

670
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,217
just so the bruises wouldn't show.

671
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,928
I want you to listen to me carefully.

672
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,097
Listen to me carefully,
because this is what you're gonna do.

673
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,140
You're gonna call Olivia's mother.

674
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,726
You're gonna tell her
you're sick of her fat ass,

675
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,104
you can't stand to look at it any more.

676
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,690
And you're gonna make her believe it,

677
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,733
because if you don't,
she may take you back one day

678
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,944
and let you near her kid or mine.

679
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,654
And I can't let that happen.

680
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:40,867
You're not even gonna swing by
to pick up your stuff.

681
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:43,662
You're just gonna leave. Tomorrow...

682
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:47,791
...when I drop Olivia off,
you will be gone.

683
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,796
If you ever come back,

684
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,923
believe me,
I won't go so easy next time.

685
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,887
By the way, that's your kidney.

686
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,272
- I can't believe it.
- I don't want to hear it, OK?

687
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,525
"This isn't your business, Dexter.
Don't get involved, Dexter.

688
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,652
"You put too much at risk, Dexter."

689
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,612
That's not what I was gonna say.

690
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:23,118
I'm proud of you.

691
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,872
You are?

692
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:31,835
You protected Astor,
put yourself out there for another person.

693
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,630
I had no idea you had that in you.

694
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,092
I underestimated you.

695
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:43,722
Assumed you were a monster
when you were capable...

696
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,849
of so much more.

697
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:52,647
If only I'd seen that, maybe I wouldn't
have led you down this path.

698
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:09,289
- Deb?
- Hi, honey.

699
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,965
Get the fuck out of my apartment.

700
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:21,968
I brought you a present.
Don't you want to see what it is?

701
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:24,471
Your boy Dexter Morgan
and his lady friend on his boat

702
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:28,809
at 3:00am in the morning,
and they are not fucking.

703
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,894
- What's in the bags?
- Something heavy.

704
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,980
I'm thinking narcotics,
maybe a body.

705
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:39,236
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, but that's beside the point.

706
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,155
Point is that when they came back,
those bags were gone.

707
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,699
So whatever they're hiding,
it's something big.

708
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,411
This was a bad idea.

709
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,957
Here. Consider this
your severance package.

710
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:53,750
We're done.

711
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,003
Really?

712
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:01,049
What? You think you can just pay me off
like I'm the corner whore?

713
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,052
I'm just saying, it's time to stop.

714
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,555
And I'm sayin' bullshit.

715
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,723
If this thing is as big as I think it is,

716
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,143
LaGuerta and all them
other douchebags in Homicide

717
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,811
are gonna be kissing my ass.

718
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,480
Back off, Liddy. I mean it.

719
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,733
I told you, don't fuck with me.

720
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,823
You know, I just think I may...
call up that sister.

721
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,200
Give her a ring,
see if she wants to get together,

722
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,370
have a drink, maybe talk about the brother.
What do you say?

723
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,873
Stay the fuck away from me!

724
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:36,376
And stay the fuck
away from Deb!

725
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,663
So you really did
change your mind.

726
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,373
I read the report.

727
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,502
Thank you.

728
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:20,754
Does this mean...

729
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:25,050
Stop sleeping on the couch.

730
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,429
We still got a long way to go

731
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,973
between the couch
and the bedroom, Maria.

732
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:43,026
So, what, now you're
not even talking to me?

733
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:50,116
Deb, look, I had an idiot theory
and I dropped it.

734
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,953
Yeah, because
LaGuerta suspended you.

735
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:55,747
No, because I was wrong.

736
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,333
Look, what I said yesterday is true.

737
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:01,169
I love you,
and I'm not taking it back.

738
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,965
You don't even know
what that means.

739
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,843
It means I'd never do
anything to hurt you. Ever.

740
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,972
I trusted you.

741
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:14,432
And while you were fucking me,
you were spreading shit about my brother

742
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,852
behind my back.
You think that's not hurting me?

743
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:19,563
Fuck you.

744
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:43,670
- You want us to come inside with you?
- No, I'll be OK.

745
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:47,090
I could barely understand my mom
on the phone with all the crying,

746
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:50,135
but she actually said
Barry did her a favour leaving.

747
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,556
He definitely did me a favour.
He told her she has a fat ass.

748
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,017
He is not coming back.

749
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,527
Thank you. Call you later.

750
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,678
Are you gonna tell
Grandma and Grandpa?

751
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:38,433
About you getting drunk in Miami
and shoplifting?

752
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,436
Nah, that's up to you.

753
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:45,482
We all have our secrets, right?

754
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,233
Thanks.

755
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,861
But if it ever happens again...

756
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,446
It won't.

757
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:56,034
- And if Barry ever shows up...
- I'll tell you, I promise.

758
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:05,669
- I'm proud of you.
- You are?

759
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:07,796
Yeah. You...

760
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,966
put yourself out there
for another person.

761
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,222
I want you to know something.

762
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,641
If Lumen's your girlfriend,
I want you to tell me.

763
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,560
OK.

764
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:25,730
- But she's not.
- She's not just your tenant, though.

765
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,233
She's a friend...

766
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,695
who's been through some really...

767
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,988
...really bad stuff.

768
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:37,575
I'm helping her deal with it.

769
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,371
Does it make you feel better?

770
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:44,457
- What do you mean?
- About Mom.

771
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,626
Being there for Lumen,

772
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:50,505
does it make you feel better
about what happened to Mom?

773
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,307
I love you.

774
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,186
You know that?

775
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:11,860
You should come in,
say hi to Cody.

776
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,905
It'll blow your cover,
about Miami.

777
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,086
Mama.

778
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:33,173
This is Mama?

779
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,758
Mama.

780
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,721
OK, bud.

781
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:47,187
Jordan Chase told me
to figure out what I want most.

782
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:49,856
The answer is simple -

783
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,442
to be a good dad.

784
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:57,739
But now that Astor's safe,
what I want most is Jordan on my table.

785
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,033
I need to get an ID on that blood.

786
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,870
- Hey.
- Hey.

787
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:07,999
- How was Orlando?
- Uh, it was pleasantly uneventful.

788
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,168
Astor's back
with her grandparents,

789
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,837
- Cody grew about a foot.
- Oh.

790
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,131
Glad to hear it.

791
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,467
Your blood results are in,
by the way.

792
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:31,606
So, did you get back an ID
on your homicide victim?

793
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,026
No.

794
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:38,196
- Then what's that?
- She's not a victim.

795
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,824
She's alive, boozing it up
in Coral Gables.

796
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,992
Two DUls in three years.

797
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,828
I guess I messed up.

798
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,038
If she's not a victim,
then who is she?

799
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,082
No worries.

800
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:53,294
When you mess up,
it makes me feel better about me.

801
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,811
- Dexter?
- No, it's Jordan Chase.

802
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:12,063
But I'm looking for Dexter.
Is he there?

803
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,067
He...

804
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,194
He's not available right now.

805
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,822
Can I leave a message?

806
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,408
Uh-huh.

807
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,328
Tell him I'm just checking in,

808
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:31,249
and I'd like him to schedule
another appointment as soon as possible.

809
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:36,087
OK. I will. Bye.

810
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,214
Hang on a second.

811
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,092
Tell Dexter one more thing.

812
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:47,515
- OK.
- Tell him time is of the essence.

813
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,351
Tick-tick-tick.

814
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:54,314
That's the sound of his life running out.

815
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,525
Could you be sure to tell him that?

816
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:01,988
Take care, Lumen.
