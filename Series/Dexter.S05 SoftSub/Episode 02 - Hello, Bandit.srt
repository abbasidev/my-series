1
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,387
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,225
Rita's inside. It was me.

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,144
FBI? Fucking Bunch of Idiots.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,147
You want to talk to Dexter,
schedule an appointment.

5
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,775
I'll do that.

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,069
If this were anyone but Dexter,

7
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,530
we'd at least be thinking
like detectives.

8
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:34,367
When the wife is dead,
90% of the time the husband did it.

9
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,122
What are you doing?

10
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,834
You wanna talk about it,
or are you just gonna act weird?

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,001
There's nothing to talk about.

12
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,670
All Rita and I ever did was kiss.

13
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,672
Dexter found out
about the indiscretion,

14
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,633
and came over and punched me out.

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,345
- Arthur Mitchell.
- Kyle Butler.

16
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,680
And what's his name?

17
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,557
Uh... Kyle Butler.

18
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:02,103
Something happened to your mom.

19
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,273
She's dead!
And it doesn't even matter to you!

20
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,774
I wish you were dead!

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,652
I just got a call from the FBI
about your brother's interview.

22
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,696
- Don't tell me. What'd he say?
- He didn't show.

23
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,406
I don't know where the fuck you are

24
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,491
or why you think you can
fucking run away from the FBI,

25
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,618
but you better get back here...

26
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,331
My wife died, and it was my fault.

27
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,585
Your dead wife can suck my dick.

28
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:33,217
That's the first human thing
I've seen you do since she died, Dexter.

29
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,428
They're not better off without you.

30
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,931
You're not better off without them.

31
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,976
You need to go back.

32
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,972
It's said there are seven stages of grief.

33
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,145
I suppose killing someone
with my bare hands in a men's room

34
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,856
was my way of working through
the anger stage.

35
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,611
Whatever the other six stages are...

36
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,325
I don't have time for them.

37
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,582
Cos now I'm a full-time dad.

38
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,503
Once the kids and I are back together,

39
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,089
it'll all be fine.

40
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,852
I can't believe we're all gonna
squish in here.

41
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,813
It's just temporary,
till we can get a new place.

42
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,690
Here.

43
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,194
He needs to be hosed off
or something.

44
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,820
Hey.

45
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,197
Welcome home.

46
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,949
This isn't our home.

47
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,242
And why do we need a new place, anyway?

48
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,578
I think starting in a new apartment
will be good for us.

49
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,331
Look, I found a place
practically on the beach.

50
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,750
Or another one right next to a park.

51
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,418
But, until then, Astor,

52
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,629
you get to share the bed with me.

53
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,839
And, Dex, you're on the couch.

54
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,926
Cody, you're on the cot.

55
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,387
Time for you both to get to bed -
school tomorrow.

56
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,263
How can I go to school?

57
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,975
I don't even have any of my things.

58
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,686
Make a list.
I'll go by the house tomorrow.

59
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,270
I want to go with you.

60
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,524
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why?

61
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,277
Well... because of what happened
to your mother there.

62
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,614
I know what happened to my mom.
She was murdered.

63
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,249
Don't forget, 9am tomorrow.

64
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,334
FBI interview.

65
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,341
One final loose end to tie up
before putting all this behind me.

66
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,016
At the time of your wife's death,
you were...

67
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,018
I already told you.
I was on my boat.

68
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,394
Right.

69
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,813
Just seemed odd.

70
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,815
You do a lot of night boating, Mr Morgan?

71
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,316
Sometimes. It's more peaceful.

72
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,694
- And you were by yourself?
- Yes, I was alone.

73
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,822
There are security cameras at the marina.
You can see me leaving and returning.

74
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,198
We've seen the footage, Mr Morgan.

75
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,492
The problem is,
according to the coroner's report,

76
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,120
your wife was killed several hours
before you got on the boat.

77
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,538
Is that what this is about?

78
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,540
Are you fucking serious?

79
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:19,170
Suggesting I have anything to do
with my wife's death...

80
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,589
that I'd slice her artery,
let her bleed out in the bathroom...

81
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,676
Mr Morgan, we know that you
were at Arthur Mitchell's house.

82
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,265
At the time of your wife's death,

83
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,477
you were part of the team
that raided Arthur Mitchell's house.

84
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,190
Right, of course.

85
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,525
We know you didn't kill your wife.

86
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,696
We're just looking for a reason why
Arthur Mitchell might have targeted her.

87
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,661
Because he's a serial killer?

88
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,297
How'd it go?

89
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,965
Fine.

90
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,135
I'm just glad it's over,
and I can move on.

91
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,637
We miss you, brother.

92
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,971
Yeah?

93
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,349
How's handling the department
all by yourself?

94
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,017
Ah, it's a breeze.

95
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,853
- I'll be back in a few days.
- Oh, no, you won't.

96
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,899
You're taking at least another week.
You need to spend time with your family.

97
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,192
Thanks.

98
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,235
Excuse me.

99
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,487
Anything you need, Dexter, just ask.

100
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,447
I will.

101
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,574
See you tonight.

102
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,035
Oh! Grandparents stopping by too.

103
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,957
They're all staying at your place?

104
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,001
Yeah. It's crowded.

105
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,254
But it's temporary.
He just doesn't want the kids

106
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,215
- staying at the house where their mom...
- Right.

107
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,008
So, we all good here?

108
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,426
Yeah, he's airtight.

109
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,011
But otherwise, we got jack shit.

110
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,513
Arthur Mitchell disappeared.

111
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,182
The only lead we have now
is this Kyle Butler.

112
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,520
We had a murder victim by that name
a few weeks back.

113
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,730
Well, our guy's alive,
as far as we know.

114
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,774
Unfortunately,
he's disappeared as well.

115
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,903
We're gonna have a sketch artist meet
with the family, and get a composite of him.

116
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,282
- I'd appreciate it if you'd keep me posted.
- Will do.

117
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,162
Hey...

118
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,084
Maria, your mail.

119
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,776
So, Dexter Morgan,
let's get you a moving van.

120
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,778
Aren't you a cute kid, huh?

121
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:53,449
- Huh?
- He's not actually talking yet.

122
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,952
Here's your 18-footer.
What's his name?

123
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,330
- Harrison.
- 14-footer.

124
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,081
It's a family name?

125
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,589
Blood.

126
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,341
Er... Sort of.

127
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,760
So, what kind of stuff you moving?

128
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,222
Just, uh, furniture, clothes,
a dresser, maybe.

129
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,808
Plenty of reasons for blood to be there. Someone cut
himself moνing...

130
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:24,104
If that's all we're talking about, save yourself
some money, go with the 10-footer.

131
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,817
I can't let myself think about this.

132
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,111
I've just got to move the kids.

133
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,575
Actually, I think I'll go with the 14-footer.

134
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,786
OK, let's, uh, write you up.

135
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,559
We're gonna get a much better place.

136
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,854
What do you think,
closer to the park or the beach?

137
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,984
Hello? Dexter?

138
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,152
No annoying neighbours.

139
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:17,283
- Hey, Dex. Brought your mail.
- Thanks.

140
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,210
Wow. Look at Harrison.

141
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,713
Boy, he's just getting bigger every day.

142
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,634
Hey, look, Dex, you know,
we haven't had a chance to talk,

143
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,219
but I wanted to let you know

144
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,222
how sorry I am about everything.

145
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,265
Thanks.

146
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:45,894
- Have they caught the Trinity Killer yet or...
- No.

147
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,855
Man, if I could just get my hands on him.

148
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,565
I can only imagine.

149
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,692
Hey, listen,
I know we've had our differences,

150
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,777
but, you know, I'm a single dad.

151
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,281
- I know the ropes, so if you need any help...
- No, I'm good.

152
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,782
Cos you gotta give up a lot.

153
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,410
I mean, I actually had
a pretty decent career going,

154
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,329
but I had to turn down
some major job offers

155
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,332
so I could just work at home
and just be there for those kids.

156
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,208
Good for you.

157
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,253
I mean, forget about any free time.

158
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,755
Or any life of your own, really.

159
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,715
I mean, you just...
you have to be there.

160
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,676
Right? Every morning. Every evening.
Every weekend.

161
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,554
You ready to do that, Dex, for the kids?

162
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,101
Yes, Elliot, I'm ready to do that.
For the kids.

163
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,854
Whoa, whoa!

164
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,981
- Here, let me...
- No. I got it.

165
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,027
But you know what? It works out.
It really does, you know?

166
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,781
I mean, you have to give up your life and all,
but you know what?

167
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,409
You just... You live for those kids,
and it's satisfying.

168
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,915
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

169
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,091
I'll be a good father.
Everyone makes sacrifices.

170
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,009
I can too.

171
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,486
Focus on the kids.

172
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,824
Wow. I didn't know you were
gonna bring so much.

173
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,909
You can just put that...

174
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,370
- Right there is great.
- I emptied the refrigerator.

175
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,539
Someone left another cake at the door.

176
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,000
I just ate a whole tuna casserole
to make room in the apartment.

177
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,129
Cody, this is a good job for you.
Wanna help me unload the food?

178
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,672
OK.

179
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,344
Wow.
You sure do have a lot of beer, Aunt Deb.

180
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,890
People just keep bringing it.

181
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,644
This is all you brought?

182
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,356
Well, we're a little short on space.

183
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,985
You didn't even bring the right clothes.
This is my reject stuff.

184
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,319
I can't wear any of this to school.

185
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,322
Astor, come on.
No one's gonna notice you.

186
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,829
Honey, would you hold the baby?

187
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,123
- Come here.
- Cody.

188
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:15,335
Why don't you help us
carry the last load in? Hm?

189
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,672
I like it here. It's like camping.

190
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,092
Exactly.

191
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,052
Boys are easier.

192
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,772
It doesn't matter how much
I loνe my children,

193
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,150
I'm still a creature of the night.

194
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,160
Can't sleep either?

195
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,832
The blood probably means nothing.

196
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,045
Someone cut their finger while moving.

197
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,592
But I won't be able to put it out of my mind
until I know for sure.

198
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,355
Someone did a quick cleanup job
but forgot to wash the door.

199
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,359
Yeah, it's pretty. I know.

200
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,696
But not the story it tells.

201
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:33,747
Once upon a time, an evil green ogre
left a circular spatter at three feet high,

202
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,042
consistent with blunt-force trauma...

203
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:40,379
which seems to indicate
the handsome young prince

204
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,589
was hit while on his knees,

205
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,424
at least two or three times.

206
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,139
Or the princess was on her knees.

207
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,267
Small hands.

208
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,810
Female.

209
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,286
I thought the kids were
your number-one responsibility.

210
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,413
- They are.
- But here you are...

211
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,081
in the middle of the night.

212
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,958
It's not that simple.

213
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,585
It never is.

214
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,588
It's like when you get on a plane.

215
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,923
They tell you
if the oxygen masks come down

216
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,759
to put yours on first
before helping the kids.

217
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,721
I have to take care of my own needs too.

218
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,557
Otherwise, I risk spinning out of control.

219
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,851
And that's not good for anyone.

220
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,813
I'm not just saying this for the sake
of the kids, Dex, but for you.

221
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,357
They're not only your responsibility.

222
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,776
They're your salvation.

223
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,994
I have to give him a bottle.

224
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,806
No reason a truck rental agency

225
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,476
would put any serious safeguards
on their records.

226
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:24,483
The truck was most recently rented
to Boyd Fowler.

227
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:29,237
Boyd seems to have listed his address
as the Department of Sanitation.

228
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,906
No home address.

229
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,660
Miami-Dade County
Department of Sanitation,

230
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,287
Division of Dead Animal Pickup,

231
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,665
meaning the blood belongs to an animal.

232
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,297
But what about those little handprints?

233
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,564
Two lines.

234
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,191
Human.

235
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,003
Well, well, well.
What do we got here?

236
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,797
Raccoon.

237
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,008
- You call this in?
- Yeah, I did.

238
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,345
I was driving down the road,
and... I saw it.

239
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,847
Kind of creeps me out.

240
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,474
You're probably used to
seeing dead things, though, huh?

241
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,476
Can't say I ever get used to it.

242
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,563
I don't usually come this way, but I'm
in the middle of moving to a new place.

243
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,606
It's a hassle, huh? Moving?

244
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,191
- I wouldn't know.
- No?

245
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,652
Lived in the same house for over 20 years.

246
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,696
So why did you rent a moving van?

247
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,656
Hello there, bandit.

248
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,704
- This don't look right.
- What do you mean?

249
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,832
Usually, you find a dead animal in the road,
it means he was hit by a car.

250
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,501
But there's no tyre marks
or blood on the asphalt.

251
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,296
This raccoon was killed someplace else
and dropped here.

252
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,173
He's CSl-ing me.

253
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,389
He's got defensive wounds on his paws.

254
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,099
Little guy put up quite a struggle.

255
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,529
All righty, then.

256
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,954
He's definitely peculiar.

257
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,125
But I guess the best and brightest
don't typically get into dead animal pickup.

258
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,969
Just so you know, OK?

259
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,096
What do we got?

260
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,973
We got a female victim.

261
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,100
- Part of a female victim.
- Part?

262
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,686
- We got a head.
- Just a head?

263
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,688
Yeah. Decapitation.

264
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,732
Probably some kind of drug killing.

265
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,317
Nice.

266
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,407
Let me ask you a question,
hypothetical.

267
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,035
- Say a newly married person...
- Mm-hm?

268
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,704
...accidentally discovers
that his or her new spouse

269
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,998
has a savings account with a lot of money.

270
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,043
Is that something
that one should expect to share?

271
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,004
Fuck, no. That's your money.

272
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,174
You tell the lieutenant
to keep her fuckin' hands off it.

273
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,846
- Take me to the head.
- All right.

274
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,938
She was still alive
when they cut her head off.

275
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,732
Excision of eyes and tongue
was done postmortem.

276
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,276
That's considerate of them.

277
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,612
You were right. It's just a head.

278
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,198
Unless they buried her standing up.

279
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,704
What are you doing?

280
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,914
Just trying to help.
You're looking a little ragged.

281
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,750
I'm exhausted. There are five people
in my tiny apartment.

282
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,879
I shared a bed with Astor last night,
and she kicked me all night long.

283
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:17,132
You know, you're welcome
to crash at my place, if you want.

284
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,009
No, thanks, Detective.

285
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,468
OK.

286
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,600
- It looks like Santa Muerte.
- What?

287
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,145
Santa Muerte, the cult.
"Saint Death."

288
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,522
Yeah, I know what it is,
but why do you say that?

289
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,692
Well, the missing eyes and tongue
were meant to send a message.

290
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,570
You didn't see anything,
you're not gonna say anything.

291
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:39,905
Who are you?

292
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,365
Officer Manzon, Cira.

293
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,452
The golden candles mean money.
The icons, I don't know.

294
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,496
There are so many now,
you might need an expert on it.

295
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:52,000
- And you know all this because...
- It's my neighbourhood.

296
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,670
And if it is Santa Muerte,
they used a machete on her.

297
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,213
OK, well, we'll keep that in mind.

298
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,842
But this park is a local drug hangout,
and drug cartels like to cut heads off,

299
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,054
- so we might follow that lead.
- Of course.

300
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,597
Hey.

301
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:09,267
We found the body on the other end
of the park, under some bushes, no ID.

302
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,146
Gotta canvass the neighbourhood,
start asking questions.

303
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,190
No one will talk. They're too afraid.

304
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,317
Well, we still ask, Officer.

305
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,075
"Helping Your Children Cope With Grief."

306
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,287
"Grandpa's Gone To Heaven."

307
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,208
"Saying Goodbye To Fluffy."

308
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,087
But nothing on
"Mommy bled out in a bathtub."

309
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,435
Boyd Fowler, you have a prison record.

310
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,437
Assault with a deadly weapon.

311
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,065
18 months at Okeechobee.

312
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,319
You said you lived in a house,

313
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,489
but there are no mortgage records
in your name.

314
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,993
In the same house for over 20 years.

315
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,123
You inherited it...
from your parents...

316
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,209
Rich and Elsie Fowler in Opa-Locka.

317
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,217
Hey. How was your day?

318
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,262
A whole afternoon getting
doors shut in my face.

319
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,805
Sorry.

320
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,890
You?

321
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,601
OK.

322
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,312
We finished LaGuerta's
cacerola de camarones

323
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,023
and Masuka's chocolate lava cake,

324
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,525
and Astor told me she hated living here.

325
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,361
They're both asleep in the bed.

326
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,573
Looking at apartments.

327
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,992
So it's everything as usual.

328
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,247
They're seeing
their grief counsellor tomorrow.

329
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,374
Maybe that'll help.

330
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:01,421
- Still, even after...
- What?

331
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:05,425
You're gonna be a single dad
raising three kids.

332
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,885
Gonna be hard.

333
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,596
Rita was a great mom.

334
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,639
There's nothing I can do
to make up for that.

335
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:13,975
But I'm gonna have to try.

336
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,022
Well, I'll be here.

337
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,317
You can count on me.

338
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,320
The kids'll be OK.

339
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,413
I know that place.
It's near the station.

340
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,500
They have an open house tomorrow.
Maybe I'll check it out for you.

341
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,043
Great.

342
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,962
You want the couch tonight?

343
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,881
No, you take it.

344
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,371
- Hey.
- Hi.

345
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,664
Glad you called.

346
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,416
- Hey, fuck puddle. What are you doing?
- Just giving you a kiss hello.

347
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:22,127
I came over here to sleep,

348
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,796
not to have your fat little
sausage fingers all over me.

349
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,553
There's no room for me at my own place.

350
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,806
Unless I want to curl up inside
a fuckin' toaster oven.

351
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,686
I'm trying so hard to be a good sister.

352
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:43,148
Fuck knows,
Dexter's always been the best brother, but...

353
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,608
it is fucking exhausting.

354
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,734
I'm sure.

355
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,278
Well, look...

356
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:52,323
you're, uh, welcome to stay here
for as long as you want,

357
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,992
whenever you want.

358
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:57,287
And I promise to keep my
fat little sausage fingers off you.

359
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,830
You better.

360
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,623
- How's your brother?
- You know.

361
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,334
I heard the FBI interview went well.
That must be a load off.

362
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,378
Why would that be a load off?

363
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,629
Nothing. Never mind.

364
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,132
They're looking for someone
named Kyle Butler

365
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,633
who's a friend of Arthur Mitchell's.

366
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,386
They think if they can find him,
then he can lead them to Mitchell.

367
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,513
- But they can't find him?
- Well, not yet.

368
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,266
They're having sketches done.
They're trying to get a positive ID.

369
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:21,019
Kyle Butler.
Why does that name sound so familiar?

370
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,730
Well, that's the weird thing.
We worked that case, remember?

371
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,064
A dead Kyle Butler.

372
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,026
Right, he got his head smashed in.
Went unsolved.

373
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,905
- Any connection?
- I don't know.

374
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,325
I'm sure the FBI will
find a way to fuck it up.

375
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,785
Will you get the lights?

376
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,913
Yes, ma'am.

377
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:48,046
What do you want to do for the next batch?
Mickey Mouse? Silver dollar?

378
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,215
- Great big ones?
- Triangles.

379
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:51,966
A challenge.

380
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,262
Dexter's making triangle pancakes.

381
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,932
Actually, they're more freeform.

382
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,560
- Wanna set the table for us?
- Sure.

383
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,273
They're just blobs.

384
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,733
How dare you?

385
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,115
Triangles.

386
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,250
I counted too many plates.

387
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,544
Mom's not here.

388
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,630
- That's OK.
- No, it's not.

389
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,132
- She should be here.
- I'm sorry.

390
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,302
- That doesn't make a difference.
- Astor, I'm doing the best I can here.

391
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,680
Let's just sit down
and have some breakfast.

392
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,098
I don't want to!

393
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,267
- I wanna go back home!
- Astor...

394
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,143
- Stop it!
- Yeah, just stop it!

395
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,189
Both of you, just stop fighting all the time!
I hate it!

396
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:03,705
While they're seeing the grief counsellor,
I'll be getting my own kind of therapy.

397
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,878
So, is this, uh...

398
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,755
something we should talk about?

399
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,425
Whatever's going on between us?

400
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,094
- No.
- We have sex one day, and then...

401
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,680
I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of person
who would ever have sex with you.

402
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,849
- I don't know what we're doing.
- We're not doing anything.

403
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,518
We never did do anything.
We never will do anything.

404
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,894
- So we never had sex?
- Exactly.

405
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:29,147
That's really weird.
Cos I remember...

406
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,441
I gotta go now. I'm gonna go.

407
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,412
- How's it going?
- I hate this shit.

408
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,419
This is Dexter's job.

409
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,254
Blood. It's gross.

410
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,424
Well, whoever cut the head off

411
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,551
used the same weapon to cut
the eyes and the tongue out.

412
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,595
But I can't find anything that fits.

413
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,638
I've tried two swords, three knives.

414
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,724
Try the machete.

415
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,646
Yeah.

416
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,204
Huh!

417
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,331
I think we have a match.

418
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,834
I'll send somebody over there right away.

419
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,211
OK, yeah.

420
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,345
How's it going in there?

421
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,348
Masuka said he really likes
working with the blood.

422
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,308
He hopes he can get
more assignments like this.

423
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,269
I'll keep that in mind.
Let me ask you a question.

424
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:51,312
If you were married,

425
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,023
and you found out that the person
you were married to

426
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,901
had a secret bank account
with a lot of money,

427
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,361
do you think that person
should share it?

428
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,447
Jesus, Angel. Just because you married her
doesn't mean you own her.

429
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,616
It's her money. End of story.

430
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,370
Well, you got a dead body waiting for you.

431
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:18,339
Oh! Fuck me.
Why couldn't he have just hanged himself,

432
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,008
took some pills,
stuck his head in the oven?

433
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,969
People are so rude. Excuse me.

434
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,805
- You again.
- It's my neighbourhood.

435
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,932
You were right about the machete.

436
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,559
Good, I guess.

437
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,439
- So, what do we have here?
- Well, golly gee, Deb,

438
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,315
I think we got a shotgun wound
to the head.

439
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,609
Approximately 24 hours ago.

440
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,528
Make sure you swab the gun.

441
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,572
- And check his hands for GSR.
- I got it, I got it.

442
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,032
I'm just checking.
Dexter usually works cases like this.

443
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:46,075
Do we have an ID?

444
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,286
According to this, Francisco Alfaro.

445
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,413
Hey, can we roll him over?

446
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:58,087
Oh! Looks like his face has changed a little
since his driver's license picture was taken.

447
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,800
Looks like him.

448
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,804
- Hey... check out the girl.
- What?

449
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,807
Look at her.
Imagine she has no eyes and no tongue.

450
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,476
- Holy shit.
- It's her, isn't it?

451
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:14,896
Those are the exact same earrings.
We've got our head.

452
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:18,149
Bingo.
Looks like we've got a murder-suicide here.

453
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,110
- How you figure?
- Guy gets pissed at his wife,

454
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,821
cuts her head off,
leaves it in the park for everyone to see

455
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,115
and comes home,
blows his head off.

456
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,160
Masuka, we've got some brain goo
on the ceiling you need to photograph.

457
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,953
Fuck me up the goat ass.

458
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,499
What about all that
Santa Muerte stuff, then?

459
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,876
Yeah.
There is no Santa Muerte stuff.

460
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,669
That's what I'm saying.
There was at the park.

461
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,881
There was missing eyes and a tongue
and the gold candles and the icons.

462
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,175
- There's none of that here.
- No.

463
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,512
What do you think?

464
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:50,389
- I think you're right.
- Who's she?

465
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,563
Hey... when is Dexter coming back?

466
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,364
Boyd Fowler works the seven to four shift,

467
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,533
which gives me time
to check out his house,

468
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,827
see if there's anything
that'll put him on my table.

469
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,331
Let me guess.

470
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:19,293
This is you putting on
your oxygen mask first.

471
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,172
Being on the hunt keeps me sharp.
Focused.

472
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,133
Thus, the better killer I am,
the better father.

473
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,041
So he takes his work home with him.
No crime in that.

474
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,972
A man of simple taste.

475
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,227
Looks like my grandmother's house.

476
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,900
A loaded handgun.
A no-no for a convicted felon.

477
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,445
But even so, not much to go on.

478
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,365
Boyd, you are very boring.

479
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:37,913
Shit.

480
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,500
Boyd comes home for lunch.

481
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,213
OK, that's interesting.

482
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,640
Do you want
to have control of your life?

483
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,518
You have that power.

484
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,647
You just have to learn how to use it.

485
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:05,107
You can make up all the excuses you want.

486
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,526
You're too tired.

487
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,528
Who keeps their attic door locked?

488
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:13,407
Too old. Too fat.

489
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,702
Too stupid.
You know, I've heard them all.

490
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,247
Chicken noodle, chicken noodle,
chicken noodle. Where's the tomato?

491
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,958
- But if you want something, take it!
- Take it!

492
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,671
You want that job?

493
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,964
- Well, then, take it!
- Well, then, take it!

494
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,425
It's entirely up to you.

495
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,011
The world does not...

496
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,847
You want that nice house
on the beach?

497
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,891
- Take it!
- Take it!

498
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,603
The world does not put limitations
on what you can have.

499
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,397
But if you want something...

500
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,606
- Take it!
- Take it!

501
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,441
You have that power.

502
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,985
I can see having
an old girlfriend's lock of hair...

503
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,198
but identified only by a number?

504
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:57,493
We are our own worst enemy.

505
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,161
Make no mistake about it.

506
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,955
But with a few simple steps,

507
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,834
I can teach you how to take control
of your life.

508
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,210
Take it!

509
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,962
All I'm saying...

510
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:11,257
if a woman pissed me off enough,
yeah, I'd wanna cut her head off.

511
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,508
Well, that's great to hear.

512
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,593
No, I'm not saying I would do it.

513
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,097
But I understand the impulse.
What are we doing here?

514
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,516
I told Dexter I'd check this place out for him.

515
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,187
Oh! Come in, come in.

516
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,439
- Hey.
- Hi!

517
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,526
We've just painted and installed
new flooring throughout the house.

518
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,194
- Looks great.
- Ooh!

519
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,821
Lots of young couples
in the neighbourhood.

520
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,824
And the elementary school
is about three blocks away.

521
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,910
I'm sure you'd be very happy here.

522
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:43,539
- Oh, it's not for us, we...
- I think we'd be very happy here too.

523
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,332
Thank you.

524
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:47,752
Well, I have to get a few things
out of my car.

525
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:50,713
But if you have any questions,
I'll just be right outside.

526
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,214
Thank you.

527
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,386
- It's a nice kitchen.
- Uh-huh.

528
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,764
- Decent appliances.
- Uh-huh!

529
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,808
Oh, look at this.

530
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,894
Great bedroom. Check it out.

531
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,771
Don't.

532
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:10,274
Oh! Wow.

533
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,319
Comfy bed.

534
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,737
Feel it.

535
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,365
- Get off the bed.
- What do you say? A little nap time?

536
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:20,326
- I'm leaving.
- What did I do?

537
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:24,079
I've got to drop you off at the station,
then pick up my brother's kids.

538
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,878
How desperate am I,
to follow Boyd to the middle of nowhere

539
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,798
when all I've got is a bit of blood
and a lock of hair?

540
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,644
But with nothing else to go on...

541
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,872
It's a rule of nature.

542
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,667
Leave some old bedsprings
out in the middle of nowhere,

543
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,961
and soon it'll be joined by a refrigerator,

544
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,839
couch, car engine.

545
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,009
And now, a barrel,
most likely holding dead animals.

546
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,012
Too lazy to drive it back to the incinerator,
I suppose.

547
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,976
- Hey, Deb.
- Do you have the kids?

548
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,769
Harrison's with Bill and Maura

549
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,730
and Astor and Cody are with you?

550
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,608
- Shit!
- What's going on?

551
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,652
Did you drop them off at school
this morning?

552
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,573
Yeah, they were seeing the counsellor first,
then going to their regular classes.

553
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,909
I just went to pick them up, and the woman
said that they never went to class.

554
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,371
So I called the apartment,
and there's no answer.

555
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,581
Well, where are they?

556
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,125
That's my question, big brother.
Where would they go?

557
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,836
Same place Astor
keeps saying she wants to go.

558
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,383
Astor.

559
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,053
Cody.

560
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,273
Hey.

561
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,194
How'd you guys get here?

562
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,863
We walked.

563
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,324
Don't be mad, Dexter.

564
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:28,621
They wanted to see where it happened.
Where they lost their mother.

565
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,706
I'm not mad.

566
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,168
Astor, I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you.

567
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,587
I should have brought you back here,
like you asked.

568
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:42,051
If you want to move back here, we will.
We'll find a way to make it work.

569
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,886
No, we won't.

570
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:51,769
Astor, I'm sorry.

571
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,480
You keep saying that,
but I don't care.

572
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:55,981
You ruined everything.

573
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,150
We'd gotten used to it.
It wasn't that bad!

574
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,070
- Used to what?
- To the way things were!

575
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,821
Before you! Without a dad!

576
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,198
Oh.

577
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,575
And then you come along
and become a part of the family,

578
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,912
and we thought that everything
was gonna be good forever.

579
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,123
You made us think that!

580
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,335
And it's not true.

581
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,921
Things got worse.

582
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:22,967
Now, every time I look at you I get so angry, because it was
all just a lie!

583
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:28,514
It's not Dexter's fault.

584
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,268
I thought coming here would help.

585
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,396
But that was stupid.

586
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,691
No, I understand.

587
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:42,611
It looks exactly the same as before.

588
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,366
Yeah, it does.

589
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,661
You can't even tell what happened.

590
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,206
But I know my mom died there.

591
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,083
And things will never be the same.

592
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,836
- I miss her so much.
- I do too.

593
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,631
We all do.

594
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,341
I don't want to live with you.

595
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,301
I want to live with Grandma and Grandpa.

596
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,887
I want to go back with them tonight.
Right now!

597
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:29,616
Hey. I'm heading out.
You want to grab a bite somewhere?

598
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,452
No. Why would I wanna do that?

599
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:32,995
All right.

600
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,293
Hey, Lieutenant.

601
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,628
Deb told me about
the Kyle Butler sketches.

602
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:44,048
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
how useful they'll be.

603
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:47,843
The mother and two children
all gave very different versions.

604
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,931
It's their biggest lead.
Seems to be going nowhere.

605
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,641
Do you mind if I keep a copy of these?

606
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:56,477
No, I got plenty.

607
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,902
Angel.

608
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,529
Let me ask you a question.

609
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:12,951
Can you tell me why you kept
this much money a secret from me?

610
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,999
It was never a secret.
That's my retirement fund.

611
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,251
Now that we're married,
aren't we supposed to share everything?

612
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,961
I don't think we ever discussed that.

613
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,006
Maybe we have different ideas
about what a marriage should be.

614
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,510
Because I always pictured
you and I at 80 years old,

615
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,929
walking down the beach,
hand in hand.

616
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,349
I like to picture that as well, Angel.

617
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,267
I love you.

618
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,187
But I think maybe I have more of a...

619
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,314
- practical side than you do.
- What does that mean?

620
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,318
I mean I've worked my entire career
to save up, to protect myself,

621
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,529
and you live every day like it's a party.

622
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,989
It's one of the things I like about you,

623
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:54,368
but it also means that you spend money
faster than you even make it.

624
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,411
- OK.
- And it's, I'm...

625
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,372
OK, I get it.

626
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,874
I don't mean to hurt your feelings.

627
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,752
No, I'm fine. I'm irresponsible.

628
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,171
- Oh, Maria.
- Everyone knows that.

629
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,888
Hey, everyone! Drinks on me. Tonight.

630
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,224
Yeah!

631
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,601
Angel.

632
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:23,730
Hey.

633
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,279
So, everyone's home safe?

634
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,406
Yeah, they're all inside.

635
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,787
You think they're finally settling in?

636
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,082
They're packing.

637
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,921
- What do you mean?
- Astor and Cody are leaving.

638
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,093
Soon as their grandparents get here,
they're going back to Orlando with them.

639
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,182
Dex, I'm so sorry.

640
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,936
For how long?

641
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,605
I don't know.

642
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:08,901
- Well, maybe if I talk to Astor...
- I already tried.

643
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,655
- And Cody wants to go too?
- No, he wants to stay.

644
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:18,368
It got very upsetting.

645
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,287
What did you say?

646
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,584
I reminded him that you and I are brother and sister,
just like him and Astor,

647
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:30,047
and that it's...
important that they never split up.

648
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,721
All the shit we've been through.

649
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:41,683
I never would have
made it through without you.

650
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,190
That's what I tried to tell him.

651
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,860
Did it help?

652
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,111
Not really.

653
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,783
I really was trying...

654
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,161
to make it work.

655
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:05,999
- In my own way.
- Yeah, I know you were.

656
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,049
I guess it's time to face reality.

657
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,402
Reality.

658
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,159
- Quinn.
- OK, we had sex.

659
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,162
Was it good sex?

660
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,082
I've said all I'm gonna say.

661
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,167
Are we gonna have more sex?

662
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:52,337
- Goodbye.
- Come on. Help me out here.

663
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,257
I'm hanging up now.

664
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:16,194
If she wants to live her life stashing away
all her little pennies, that's her problem.

665
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:19,906
I can't do anything about that. You know?

666
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,161
- You want another drink?
- You buying, right?

667
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,747
Bartender, a Cuervo silver.

668
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,916
You know how much money she's got?
It's sick.

669
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:32,794
Did she tell me?
Did she tell me?

670
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,129
Cheers.

671
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,258
Angel.

672
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,722
It true you married Maria LaGuerta?

673
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,933
I did indeed.

674
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,354
You got yourself a little sugar mama.

675
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,149
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

676
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:58,070
I remember when she was first starting out.
Such a fine piece of ass.

677
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,614
I think you need to get the hell out of here.

678
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,077
You fuck!

679
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,392
If they need anything,
just let me know. I'll send it.

680
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:30,018
We will. Thank you.

681
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,608
I lost my innocence at such an early age,

682
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,985
and it left a very damaging mark.

683
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:45,117
Can't I stay with you, Dexter?

684
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:49,413
For now, you need to go
with your grandparents.

685
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:53,417
Don't worry, we'll still see each other
all the time. Orlando's not so far.

686
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:56,420
Yes, it is.

687
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:59,214
Any shrink could tell you
that's why I've always liked children.

688
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,092
Because they connect me
to what I can never get back.

689
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:06,012
I don't want to go, Dexter.

690
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,308
I don't want you to go.

691
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,405
Astor...

692
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:26,032
What?

693
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:33,415
Your mother loved you more
than you could ever imagine.

694
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,334
And I...

695
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,675
Me too.

696
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:14,331
Cody and Astor showed me
that I can still care about something.

697
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,376
That makes letting them go
all that much harder.

698
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,644
And it's losing them
that makes me realise

699
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,606
there must be some small part
of that innocent child still inside me.

700
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,491
Because, just like Astor,

701
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:53,245
I was foolish enough to think
that things would always be good.

702
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:55,247
But they're not.

703
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,676
They're worse.

704
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,437
Much worse.

705
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:23,567
Normally, having a target
would make me feel good,

706
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:26,403
give me direction, a sense of purpose.

707
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:27,904
But now...

708
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,911
it means nothing.

709
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,707
And I don't know what's
going to make me feel better.

710
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,876
Should we go home?

711
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,380
Give me a minute.
