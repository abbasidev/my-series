1
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,929
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,098
You were face to face
with Carlos Fuentes, right?

3
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,476
So that means he knows
that we're onto him.

4
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,436
Tell me why they would ever
return to this club.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:24,023
You have one more night at Club Mayan.
Make something happen.

6
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,694
This is Yasmin Aragon.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,779
If we agree to drop
her drug charges,

8
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,824
she thinks she can get
the Fuentes brothers in the club.

9
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,327
- Hey.
- I thought you might want a debriefing

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,538
before we hit Club Mayan.

11
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,374
Um... It's sort of... not a good time.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,834
This is Stan Liddy.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,586
You are boning
our target's sister?

14
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,172
Just tell me what you found out
on Dexter Morgan.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,425
You fucked everything up, Boyd.

16
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,635
Boyd Fowler. Hobbies -

17
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,929
- self-improvement...
- Take it!

18
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,432
...and storing women
in formaldehyde.

19
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,767
Every one of these barrels
has a body in it.

20
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,354
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me. There were others.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,065
I shot one of them.
Dexter, what do I do?

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,069
That last fucking bitch is alive.

23
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,321
They're gonna find you.

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,075
Some experiences are so big,
they change your DNA.

25
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,827
I'm gonna have to find
the rest of them,

26
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,329
because that's the only way
that I can feel this peace again.

27
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,875
I can't get revenge
for Rita's death,

28
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,295
but I can help Lumen avenge
what was done to her.

29
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,088
How many more were there?

30
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,001
It's been over a month
since I freed Lumen from Boyd's,

31
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,420
but she's still
reliving it every day.

32
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,964
Hey. I brought food.

33
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,842
Oh.

34
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,223
- Have you eaten?
- I ate this morning.

35
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,392
Well, now it's night.

36
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,395
Eat some more.

37
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,940
You're very... controlling.

38
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,483
I need to be.

39
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,365
So, what else?

40
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,744
Details would help.

41
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,498
Besides the ones
that we've already...

42
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,460
taken care of...

43
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,880
- there was Watch Guy.
- "Watch Guy"?

44
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,091
I would be tied to a chair...

45
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,177
blindfolded.

46
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,220
Sometimes I didn't even know
if he was there,

47
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,265
until I'd hear this watch by my ear.

48
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,770
And then he'd lean in
and whisper...

49
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,356
"Tick tick tick.

50
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,026
"That's the sound of your life
running out."

51
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,322
OK. Anyone else?

52
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,242
Suit and tie.

53
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,956
He'd take off his jacket
and fold it...

54
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,000
very carefully,
and then lay it on a chair,

55
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,461
like he didn't want to mess it up.

56
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,801
The Suit Guy, I'd know.
He always took the blindfold off.

57
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,805
I guess he thought
I'd be dead soon.

58
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,808
He was wrong.

59
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,053
Los barriles.

60
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,388
Sí?

61
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,369
So, what do we do now?
How do we find them?

62
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,371
I'm not sure "we"
is the operating word here.

63
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,916
What are you talking about?
We're doing this together.

64
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,962
Lumen, what I do, I do alone.
I don't need a partner.

65
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,883
- I said I'd help you, but...
- Fine. Forget it.

66
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,303
- "Forget it"?
- There's no point to it, then.

67
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,138
You want these men
brought to justice?

68
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,433
Yeah, and I can't go
to the cops because of you.

69
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,188
So you're gonna have to be
a little flexible here.

70
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,483
I want to be a part of this.

71
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,780
We'll see.

72
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,423
Gracias.

73
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,192
I need to get home to Harrison.

74
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,362
Right.

75
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,239
The other part of your life.

76
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:33,035
There is no other part to Lumen's life.
This is all she has.

77
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,956
Even so, I can't bring her
into my world.

78
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,542
There's no place for her.

79
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,419
Dexter?

80
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,509
Thank you.

81
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,013
I feel like I'm dropping off
my prom date...

82
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,851
except this is my house,
and my wife is dead,

83
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,228
and I have no idea
where Lumen fits into my world,

84
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,980
and this is all so weird...

85
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,235
...exactly like my prom.

86
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,874
Our level of national debt
is unsustainable.

87
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,460
I want you to fight against
a dystopian society

88
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,379
where independent producers

89
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,549
are weighed down
by parasitic non-producers,

90
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,303
a Democratic President
and a Democratic Congress.

91
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,561
You're just in time.

92
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,488
Hey, good night, buddy.

93
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,408
Saint Brigid,
circle us with your light,

94
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,453
so that no darkness
shall overcome our world.

95
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,247
Sleep well, little one.

96
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,419
That's either a saint, or the most
boring action figure I've ever seen.

97
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,171
Is that yours?

98
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,924
It's Saint Brigid.

99
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,596
To watch over you
while you sleep.

100
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,438
- Good night.
- Good night.

101
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,993
He doesn't need Saint Brigid.

102
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,205
He has Father Dexter.

103
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,755
Why are you up so early?

104
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,674
Gym.

105
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,512
But how about it, you know?

106
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,889
I mean, we don't have
to live here.

107
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,558
We could get a new place, together.

108
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,315
Morgan.

109
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,319
I'm Homicide.
I don't do traffic accidents.

110
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,908
Whoa, uh... Text me the address.

111
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,619
- What's up?
- Dead people.

112
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,955
You're gonna get the same call.
We're all getting called in.

113
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,873
Why didn't you tell them I'm here?

114
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,001
Because I'm not here.

115
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,462
Basically, nobody knows
we're seeing each other.

116
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,464
I just want to keep it that way.

117
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,467
Wow, baby.
You say the sweetest things.

118
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,804
Can we at least drive in together?

119
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,266
Yeah, and then we'll go to Disney World,
and we'll ride all the roller coasters,

120
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,476
and we'll hold hands!

121
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,064
I don't even know
what that means.

122
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,954
Whatever it is... it's big.

123
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,757
- Dexter.
- Hey, Sergeant. What have we got?

124
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,218
- You haven't been listening to the news?
- Uh...

125
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,804
Weather channel.
High-pressure system coming in.

126
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,975
What have we got?

127
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,608
We got her,

128
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,068
and her...

129
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,363
and her, and her...

130
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,405
and her.

131
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,158
The girls in the barrels -
how could this be?

132
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,078
Someone tried to move them.

133
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,830
Where's the driver?

134
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,208
That's what we're trying to figure out.
He took off.

135
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,170
Go do your thing.

136
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,715
It's the blood guy,
but we got no blood.

137
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,260
- We don't know what we've got.
- Yeah, what is this gunk?

138
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,971
It's formalin -
liquid formaldehyde.

139
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:06,100
- Why?
- An embalming agent.

140
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,103
Because it was only applied topically,
the internal organs of the cadavers

141
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,731
continued to putrefy and leak
out of the various bodily orifices,

142
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,359
becoming congealed once they
came in contact with the formalin.

143
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,821
That's what's on your shoe -
congealed organ.

144
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,283
What kind of sick fuck
are we dealing with?

145
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,035
I'm just the blood guy.

146
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,414
We've got five victims,
all female, all blonde,

147
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,166
all between the ages
of 20 and 35, I'm guessing.

148
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,128
They're covered in bruises,
contusions, whip marks.

149
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,047
Looks like they went through
some special kind of hell.

150
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,843
We'll get fingerprints off them
once we get 'em to the ME's office.

151
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,261
I heard the driver took off.

152
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,389
Yeah, we've got the guy that hit him.
He was drunk off his freaking ass.

153
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,724
He said he saw some guy
jump out and start running,

154
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,852
but that's as detailed
as his description gets -

155
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,145
"Some guy."

156
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,605
That means he's still mine to find.

157
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,029
Or Vince Masuka's.

158
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,490
Hey.

159
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,033
Hey, Dex.

160
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,162
That's some pretty crazy shit, huh?

161
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,080
Yeah, crazy shit.
What do you got?

162
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,790
Uh...

163
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,420
One men's suit jacket, size 40.

164
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,923
Did you fold it,
or was it already like that?

165
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,717
I bagged it as I found it.

166
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,138
- I also got fingerprints galore...
- Excellent.

167
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,308
Except for the steering wheel.
Somebody gave it a quick wipe.

168
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:33,395
I'll get the vehicle back to the lab,
and we'll give it a more thorough going-over.

169
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,897
Right.

170
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,779
So much for keeping
my lives separate.

171
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,371
Yeah, what's up?

172
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,165
What you doing, boy?
Sleeping late?

173
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,959
Your buddy, Dexter Morgan -
you asked me to keep an eye on him.

174
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,669
Yeah? And?

175
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,588
Well, he's got some cutie
up at his house.

176
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,340
He even took down
the "for sale" sign.

177
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,761
- What's this girl look like?
- Blonde, average height, late 20s.

178
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,221
Slim, pretty?

179
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,764
That'd be her.

180
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,225
- Find out who she is.
- You betcha.

181
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,938
- What are you doing here?
- I saw the news.

182
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,690
- I knew what it was. I had to come.
- No, you didn't have to come.

183
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,776
Dexter, I was supposed
to be one of those girls.

184
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,738
Look, it's not safe for you here.
They could be watching.

185
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,740
What is this?

186
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,202
- What does it mean?
- It means they're on the run.

187
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,662
You need to go.

188
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,133
Will you give me...
Thank you.

189
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,519
Shit a brick
and fuck me with it -

190
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,897
you're never gonna guess
who this truck is registered to.

191
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,399
Jordan Chase.

192
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,404
Jordan Chase
is a very smart guy.

193
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,199
His first book made me realise

194
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,910
how I'd been putting all these
limitations on myself.

195
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,372
I mean, I've listened to all his CDs.

196
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,124
So did Boyd Fowler.

197
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,793
You think Jordan could have been
driving that truck?

198
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,546
What? No way.

199
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,965
First off, that jacket is nice,

200
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,842
but not that nice.

201
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,136
Jordan wears nothing but the best.

202
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,138
That's part of his thing.

203
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,766
"If you think you deserve something,
then take it."

204
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:44,151
I've lifted two dozen fingerprints, and they all
seem to belong to the same person.

205
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,112
And whoever they belong to,

206
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,406
he's not in the AFIS database.

207
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,741
Dead end.

208
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,120
Ooh... a hair.

209
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,587
And another one.

210
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,176
It's not often I'm in competition
with my own people,

211
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,553
but getting the identity
of the driver of the truck,

212
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,347
and getting to him before they do

213
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,724
is the only way I can give Lumen
what I promised.

214
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,939
All I get is a fucking computer.

215
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,318
I can order Jordan Chase books,
I can order Jordan Chase CDs,

216
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,612
but I can't talk to an actual person.

217
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,698
Jordan Chase is a really
popular man, you know?

218
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,826
He travels the world giving his
little touchy-feely seminars.

219
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,205
- He's probably not even in Miami right now.
- I've left messages all over.

220
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,499
If I don't hear back soon,
I'm gonna kick their door in.

221
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,335
What about you? Anything?

222
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,713
Yeah, we've ID'd two of the girls
off their fingerprints.

223
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,840
One was a schoolteacher
from Wisconsin.

224
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,218
She came out here on vacation
two years ago -

225
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,386
never heard from again.

226
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,555
The other one worked on
a cruise ship that was docked here.

227
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,432
She disappeared
just over a year ago.

228
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,101
Wow.

229
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,269
Yeah, these were good girls,
you know?

230
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,647
One was 26, one was 29.

231
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,190
Nothing on the other three?

232
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,151
No, I'm going through
the missing-person databases,

233
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,569
put their photographs out there.

234
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,613
- DNA?
- It's being run now.

235
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,700
Looking for direct hits
and familial hits.

236
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:18,537
Listen, I heard about
this two-bedroom place on Brickell -

237
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,205
upper unit, right on the water.

238
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,083
- Thought we could take a look.
- This is not a workplace conversation,

239
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,584
so please just shut up.

240
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,712
All I'm saying is,
is this place is going fast.

241
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,714
Listen, please - just not here.

242
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,965
You two.

243
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,592
Now.

244
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,639
Shit.

245
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,059
Think she knows about us?

246
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,861
- Is this about...
- The Santa Muerte case.

247
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,571
Oh.

248
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,533
- I thought that was dead.
- Well, now it's alive, barely.

249
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,871
Yasmin Aragon, the associate
of the Fuentes brothers

250
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,914
that Sergeant Batista identified,

251
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,502
has assured us that she will bring Carlos
and Marco into Club Mayan tomorrow night.

252
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,421
- So we're on?
- We are on.

253
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,840
I am personally overseeing
this operation.

254
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,384
We can't risk word leaking out
to the Fuentes,

255
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,136
so it's strictly on a need-to-know basis.

256
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,264
Rather than flooding
the club with police personnel,

257
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,267
we will be performing
a small surgical operation.

258
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,228
We will take the brothers into custody
before they get into the club.

259
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,398
Detective Morgan,
you'll be with me in the surveillance van.

260
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,441
Detective Quinn,

261
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,360
we're gonna post you inside the door
of the club with Officer Manzon.

262
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,906
I will be roving, placing myself
wherever I believe most effective.

263
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,326
If we're gonna take them outside,
shouldn't we be outside?

264
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,496
In order not to stand out
like sore thumbs,

265
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,332
we will continue with the posts
we've already established.

266
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,460
Thank you, Detectives Morgan and Quinn.
That'll be all.

267
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,758
Maria, let me make myself very clear.

268
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:01,139
You've wasted more than enough
time and money on this case already.

269
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,600
You're supposed to be
a master manipulator of the press,

270
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,520
but you haven't even been able to do that.
Every day I pick up the paper,

271
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,314
read another story
about how we're not doing our job.

272
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,817
Get it right this time,

273
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:15,278
or we're gonna have an interesting
conversation about your future.

274
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,537
Where are we with Jordan Chase?

275
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,416
I've got Quinn on it.

276
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,711
We've made numerous calls
to his organisation,

277
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,131
but we haven't been able
to reach him personally just yet.

278
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,967
He could be playing hard to get.

279
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,761
In that case, we'll pay
his office a visit to see if...

280
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,888
Probably won't be necessary.

281
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,687
Jordan Chase.

282
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,397
Hi.

283
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,652
Holy shit, that's him.

284
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,070
Nice to meet you.

285
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,072
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

286
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,286
Mr Chase? Oh, Mr Chase...

287
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,453
- Stand back.
- I, um...

288
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,373
I took one of your seminars
at the Beach Club a while back.

289
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,792
Sure. In Palmetto Bay.

290
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,295
- You remember?
- Of course I do.

291
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,673
You have to excuse Cole here.
He, uh, keeps the crazies away.

292
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,842
Why don't you let me
get a picture of you two?

293
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,678
Oh, yeah.
Excellent. OK.

294
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,556
All right, smile.

295
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,394
Oh. One more.

296
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,729
Got it.

297
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,647
Jordan Chase.

298
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,026
- Dexter Morgan.
- Nice to meet you.

299
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,611
Nice watch.

300
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,739
Oh, uh, my dad gave it to me
when I was a teenager.

301
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,992
It's water-resistant to 100 metres.

302
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,745
I have no idea why I would ever need that,
but it sure looks nice.

303
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,371
If that's the watch that Lumen heard,

304
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,958
I'll make sure it accompanies you
to the bottom of the Atlantic.

305
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,253
Mr Chase.

306
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,756
You must be the person
in charge around here.

307
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,341
I was in Jacksonville,

308
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,344
got an early call from Cole here,
my head of security,

309
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,596
saying one of our trucks
had been stolen out of our lot,

310
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:08,558
and that it just might be the one
we'd all been watching on the news.

311
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,519
- I flew back as soon as I could.
- I see.

312
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,773
We found an article
of clothing in the vehicle.

313
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,442
My jacket.
It's my personal vehicle.

314
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,819
I always leave my things inside.

315
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,655
- And the keys?
- The keys?

316
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,907
Yeah, we found the keys
in the ignition.

317
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,077
There are a lot of ways
to steal a car.

318
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,329
Most thieves don't have
the actual key.

319
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,458
I leave a spare set of keys
on a hook inside our office.

320
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,837
All my guys know where to find them,
in case they need the truck.

321
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,675
Honestly, they're just sitting there.
Anyone could have grabbed them.

322
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,678
And you're Head of Security?

323
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,681
Yeah, Cole. I might have to
tighten things up a bit.

324
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,682
Mm?

325
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:54,980
I want to make it very clear that the Miami
Police Department has my full cooperation.

326
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:58,191
My organisation
is completely open to you.

327
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,694
This is a horrible, horrible tragedy.

328
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,114
Please, anything I can do
to help facilitate its resolution...

329
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,699
Well, thank you, Mr Chase.

330
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:10,412
First, we're gonna need fingerprints
and hair samples from all your employees,

331
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,871
starting with Cole.

332
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,083
Absolutely. And if I could ask one favour?

333
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:20,130
I'd appreciate it if my name and organisation
wasn't released to the press.

334
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,717
Being connected to this in any way
would be a PR nightmare.

335
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,677
I'm sure you understand.

336
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,097
As long as we have your continued
cooperation, that shouldn't be a problem.

337
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:34,769
Sociopaths can't feel psychic pain,
but they can feel physical pain.

338
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,812
Ow.

339
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,397
Sorry.

340
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,487
What do you think about Cole?

341
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:46,906
"It wasn't me,

342
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,910
"someone stole my vehicle."

343
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,872
The oldest excuse in the book.

344
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:58,460
Still, it does happen.
And Mr Chase is very high-profile,

345
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,253
well respected.

346
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,506
It's hard to imagine
someone like him, or his people,

347
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,259
would be involved in something like this.

348
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,977
I took a few hairs
from the headrest of the truck as well.

349
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:20,356
If someone else was driving,
he'd have left some evidence behind.

350
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,858
And?

351
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,611
Cole's hair matches the hair
on the jacket and the headrest.

352
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,655
- Fingerprints?
- They're all Cole's, even on the ignition key.

353
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,825
I think he's just become
the focus of our investigation.

354
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,078
- And Jordan?
- His alibi holds up.

355
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,871
He was in Jacksonville.

356
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,415
So for now,
we got our eyes on Cole.

357
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,146
- Lumen?
- Dexter...

358
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,316
you need to announce yourself.
I don't know who's coming in.

359
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,569
But it's OK to have packages
delivered here?

360
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,699
I need things.

361
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:15,203
You said not to leave the house.

362
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,043
And what are you gonna
do with that?

363
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,589
It's just a flashlight.

364
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,010
You have a way
of bending the rules.

365
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,142
What's going on with the case?

366
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,354
Do you know this man?

367
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,068
Oh, my God.

368
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,987
That's him.

369
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,407
That's the guy
who folded his jacket.

370
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,909
- How did you find him?
- He found us.

371
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,913
His name's Cole Harmon.
He's Jordan Chase's head of security.

372
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,879
What about him?

373
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,881
No, I...

374
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,593
I mean, that guy's clearly a freak,
but I don't know him.

375
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,928
No, not the bald guy.
The guy beside him.

376
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,889
- Jordan Chase.
- Oh.

377
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,186
- No, I don't know him either.
- You sure?

378
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,688
I told you, I didn't see
most of their faces.

379
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,277
- Who is he?
- He's some sort of motivational speaker.

380
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,282
This guy...
I definitely know.

381
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,993
What next?

382
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,412
Well, there's a problem -
the homicide team is on this.

383
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,873
They'll probably arrest him
within the next few days,

384
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:46,127
and once that happens, Cole will never see
the outside of a prison cell again.

385
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,004
What about the other guys?

386
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,132
In order to save his own skin,
he'll probably turn them in.

387
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,804
It's only a matter of time before they're all
in the hands of the police.

388
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:07,190
But this is Florida. We execute here.
These men will be brought to justice.

389
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,945
You can walk away from all of this now,
put it behind you.

390
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,156
You can go on with your life.

391
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,116
No.

392
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,660
That's not what I want.

393
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,913
I promise you,
the police will take care of it.

394
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,208
No, I don't want the police
to take care of it. I...

395
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,960
I want to take care of it.

396
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,296
I know how she feels.
It's not so different from me.

397
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:37,178
- How much coffee are you drinking?
- A lot.

398
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,722
I have to stay awake.
What if they come for me at night?

399
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,475
She's stressed, on edge -

400
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,312
the way I feel when I've gone too long
without putting someone on my table.

401
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,607
- You said you'd help me.
- I did.

402
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,278
I just don't know that helping you
kill someone is actually helping you.

403
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:57,407
This is all I think about.

404
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,202
Don't back out now.

405
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,123
This is important to me.

406
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:10,378
Truth is, I actually want to help her...

407
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,134
for some very complicated reasons.

408
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:23,474
If we want Cole for ourselves,
I have to derail the police investigation,

409
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,019
which means giving them
another suspect.

410
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,478
Who?

411
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,481
The man who actually killed
all those girls.

412
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,860
Boyd Fowler.

413
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,717
Here, put these on.

414
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,846
First thing we have to do
is remove any evidence

415
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,348
that you were ever here
at Boyd's house.

416
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,434
If the police find
your fingerprints or...

417
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,480
anything that ties you
to this place,

418
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,983
they're gonna want to know
what your relationship to Boyd Fowler is.

419
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,902
How you got here.

420
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,364
How you got out.

421
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,868
That's where you first found me.

422
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,747
We need to go up.

423
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,960
You OK?

424
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,255
I'll be with you.

425
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,774
Oh, God.

426
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,362
You OK? We can leave.

427
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,156
No.

428
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:08,079
He kept me tied up...
over there.

429
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,460
I don't know
how long I was here.

430
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,840
Maybe a couple days.

431
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,634
All I know is that he brought me
here to kill me.

432
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,554
I'm guessing that was his job.

433
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,017
He was the finisher.

434
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,858
The last day,
I chewed on that rope for hours.

435
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,610
I was finally able to slip it off.

436
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,780
That's when I went downstairs,
and I saw you...

437
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:46,993
Do what I did.

438
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,389
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

439
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,393
I just need something of Boyd's
to plant in the truck from the accident.

440
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:17,899
His wallet.

441
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,984
How did you know
that was there?

442
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,486
I put it there.

443
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,530
Hold the fucking phone,
everyone!

444
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,034
I was giving Cole's truck
another quick once-over,

445
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,621
and I found something that our
blind-as-fucking-bats lab geeks missed.

446
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,539
What have you got?

447
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,041
A wallet.

448
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,586
He probably had it sitting on the console,
and then it went flying when he got hit.

449
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,796
- I found it under the seat.
- Cole's wallet?

450
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,757
No, that's just it.
It's not Cole's.

451
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,717
Whose is it?

452
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,095
Boyd Fowler's.

453
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,972
Who the fuck is Boyd Fowler?

454
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,770
I'm going upstairs.

455
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,067
Check it out.

456
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:05,071
There are locks of hair in here,
numbered one through twelve.

457
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,907
Twelve? Jesus.

458
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:13,329
Well, I'll run DNA on all the hair samples,
and match it to the victims.

459
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,580
The guy that did this...

460
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,499
Died exactly
where you're standing.

461
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,626
Hey.

462
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,045
In here.

463
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,096
The same exact barrel
the girls were in.

464
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,973
Jesus. What'd he do with these?

465
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,893
The preliminary medical examiner's report
said all the girls were electrocuted.

466
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:40,481
We're gonna need Forensics in the attic.
I think he kept the girls up there.

467
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,484
It looks like Boyd Fowler
has become our primary focus.

468
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,575
Do you know this man?

469
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,539
- No.
- Well, he knows you.

470
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,624
He has all your books
and CDs in his house.

471
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,338
Uh... I've sold over
a million copies of my book,

472
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,299
almost as many CDs.

473
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,260
I'm just trying to figure out
how he came to be driving your truck.

474
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,390
- Well, I'm sorry, but...
- I know him.

475
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:18,185
Boyd Fowler.
He was one of your stalkers.

476
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,732
And how come
I'm just now hearing this?

477
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,234
No reason to tell you about
every nut that passes through.

478
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,279
He never seemed
like a serious threat.

479
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,324
He took a few seminars a while back,
and then started showing up at our office

480
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,326
asking for Mr Chase.

481
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,453
I had to escort him off the premises
a few times.

482
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:39,624
He was clearly a bit off, but, uh...
he never struck me as dangerous.

483
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,791
He's dangerous.

484
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,465
He'd been in and out
of our offices enough times.

485
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,258
Probably saw
where I put the keys.

486
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,594
When's the last time
you had contact with him?

487
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,182
Haven't seen him for a while.
Couple of months, maybe.

488
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,434
Any idea where he might be?

489
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,977
No.

490
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,649
We have a warrant for his arrest.

491
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:09,111
I suggest that you be
especially cautious, Mr Chase,

492
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,239
because if he has a thing for you,
you could be in danger.

493
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:13,741
Noted.

494
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,826
Now, if you have
any contact with him,

495
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,204
please get in touch
with us immediately.

496
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,831
This guy... is very bad news.

497
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,084
I will.

498
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,504
Thank you for coming in.
I appreciate it.

499
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,405
You finally did something right.

500
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,241
Steering the cops toward Boyd -
very smart.

501
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,078
It wasn't me.

502
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,129
Daddy's going
to Boca Raton tonight.

503
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,801
Cos that's where Cole Harmon lives.

504
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,178
He's a bad man.

505
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,932
I'm gonna try to find out

506
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,727
who the rest
of his bad-man friends are.

507
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,937
You want that?

508
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,898
Hi.

509
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,735
There's my angel.

510
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,112
Let me just set my things down.

511
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,284
Wonder how much longer
I'm gonna be able to talk to you like this.

512
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,661
Soon you're gonna start
to understand me.

513
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,458
Harrison clearly loves
his Saint Brigid.

514
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,585
He put it with his favourite toys.

515
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,337
- I put that in the toy box.
- Sorry?

516
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,506
It's just a statue of a lady
who died a long time ago.

517
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,426
She doesn't protect anybody,
or anything.

518
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,430
I should get to work.
Here. Go to Sonya.

519
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,687
It's just this can be
a very dark world at times,

520
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,106
and since dear Brigid
has always been a comfort to me,

521
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,066
I thought Harrison
might feel the same.

522
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:13,903
I hope for his sake,
you'd reconsider.

523
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,490
Sure.

524
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,200
Bye, buddy.

525
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:25,122
So, uh... What are you
wearing tonight?

526
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,374
To the big stakeout? Um...

527
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,627
A diaper, probably.

528
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,881
I'll have to sit in that van
with Batista for hours.

529
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,301
Will you please not wear
that awful shirt

530
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,554
with the patterns all over it?
It really makes me dizzy.

531
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,724
No, I, uh... only wore that as a joke.

532
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,975
Oh.

533
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,102
Hey, uh, I got to go.
I'll see you later tonight.

534
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,270
OK.

535
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,240
Hey.

536
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,075
Well, look at you,
pretty as a picture.

537
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,537
I only got a few minutes,
so what do you got for me?

538
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,206
I don't work for free, Quinn.

539
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:11,168
- Well, I just gave you 500 bucks.
- And I told you about the girl.

540
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,920
But if you want to find out who she is,

541
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,215
where she's from, and what she's doing
in that damn house,

542
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,635
I might have to employ
some methods just a little bit...

543
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,595
unorthodox.

544
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,889
And for that,
you're gonna have to pay.

545
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,726
- I don't know.
- I know you got the cash.

546
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,020
Yeah, it's not that.

547
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,816
It's the pussy.

548
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,361
Now, looky here, stud,
if you're backing off this thing

549
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,196
cos you're porking
that guy's sister,

550
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:43,284
I'd say you've got
your priorities as a cop all wrong.

551
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,788
I'm a little embarrassed for you.

552
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,915
I'll give you another five.

553
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,712
That'll work.

554
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:07,182
You don't have to do anything with this, OK?
You can just talk normally.

555
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,642
What do I have to do?

556
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,562
We're gonna walk you through the club,
so that our team can get a visual on you,

557
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,356
and then you're just gonna wait
by the door.

558
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,484
The second you see the Fuentes brothers,
you walk up to them,

559
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,987
and you engage in conversation
outside of the club,

560
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,572
until we move in and take 'em.

561
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,366
- What am I supposed to say?
- Tell 'em how hot they look.

562
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,579
You really don't have to worry
about anything. We're gonna be right there.

563
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,873
I'm gonna make sure
we're all in contact.

564
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,334
This is Sergeant Batista.
Is everybody getting this?

565
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,669
- Loud and clear.
- I can hear you.

566
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,129
Looks like we're all in place.

567
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,308
OK.

568
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,064
You'll do great.

569
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,671
They're already here.

570
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,006
Say again?

571
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,218
I said, they're already here,
sitting at the VIP table.

572
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,888
OK, how'd that happen?
I thought we had all the doors covered.

573
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,682
I don't know.

574
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,976
I heard there's a secret door
from the club next door,

575
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,352
but I've never seen it.

576
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,400
OK, this is a change of plans.

577
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,694
Yasmin, go sit with them.

578
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,904
We're gonna sit tight
until they leave.

579
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,573
Once they step outside the club,
we take them.

580
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,409
Let's make sure we find
that secret door,

581
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,327
and deploy a team there as well.
Everyone got that?

582
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,662
- Got it.
- Got it.

583
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,089
We've been here for over an hour.

584
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,133
I know.

585
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:09,263
Well, you said there's a seminar in Naples.
Don't you think he's there?

586
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,724
Probably.

587
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,600
So, what are you waiting for?

588
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,482
That.

589
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,693
The neighbour to go to bed.

590
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,486
I'm going in.

591
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,739
No, you're staying here.

592
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,407
What? No.

593
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,242
Yes. It's too dangerous.

594
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,286
I have no idea
what's inside there.

595
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:35,664
I'm gonna have my hands full
without watching over you.

596
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,751
Fine.

597
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,879
Well, you can...
be the lookout.

598
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,175
It's so great working with you.

599
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,553
If you see anything, call me.

600
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,652
We are starting to look a little obvious.
I am gonna go get us a club soda.

601
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:06,904
All right, yeah.

602
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,799
Oye, mami.

603
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,928
Ven aquí.

604
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,890
- He's calling me over.
- No, keep moving. Ignore him.

605
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,811
This is Lieutenant LaGuerta.
Officer Manzon, go to him, make nice,

606
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,729
and try to get him
to step outside the club.

607
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,440
Lieutenant, no. This is a problem.
These guys are dangerous.

608
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,942
Stand down, Morgan.

609
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,487
She's in charge.
Nothing we can do.

610
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,388
Police! Drop that fucking gun!

611
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:16,807
Holy fucking shit!

612
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,853
Move, move, move!

613
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,734
Stop right there. Down on the ground.
Police! Drop the gun!

614
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:30,028
- Back away!
- Drop the gun now!

615
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,363
Oh, you again.

616
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,242
You should walk away before this one
gets more than just a little cut.

617
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,702
Drop the gun right now.

618
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,162
Please!

619
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,135
You OK?

620
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,304
Yeah.

621
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,973
It's OK. Come here.

622
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,259
Cole as a teenager.

623
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,142
Who the fuck are you?

624
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,687
No fucking way!

625
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,481
Who are you, motherfucker?

626
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:59,034
We have to go
before he sees our faces.

627
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,913
Holy shit!
I can't believe that just happened!

628
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,375
- What made you come inside?
- I thought I saw a shadow.

629
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,293
And that made you come
crashing through a window?

630
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,128
I know. I know. I just had a feeling.

631
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,089
It was some sort
of lizard-brain thing.

632
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,924
She's starting to sound like me.

633
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,762
- That's Cole.
- And Boyd.

634
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:22,474
- And Dan the Dentist.
- It's them from, like, 15 years ago.

635
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,184
Do you recognise any of the others?

636
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,520
No, just those three.

637
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,234
- What does this mean?
- I don't know.

638
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,028
They've known each other
since they were kids.

639
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,782
Oh, my God, Dexter. This is huge.
We just have to figure out who they are.

640
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,795
So, what do we do next?

641
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,133
What?

642
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:58,719
You said "we".

643
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,143
Put on your seat belt.

644
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,948
This is a fucking disaster.

645
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,742
Carlos Fuentes
was shot and killed.

646
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:24,703
Our informant, Yasmin Aragon,
was shot and killed,

647
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,539
- as well as another innocent bystander.
- Son of a bitch...

648
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,084
At this point, we don't know if it's by
our gunfire, or that of the two brothers.

649
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,504
Additionally, three other
bystanders were wounded.

650
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,882
I want a full report by 8:00am.

651
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:46,266
I know it looks bad - and it is bad.

652
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,935
But we are going to get through this,
I promise you.

653
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,231
In the heat of battle...

654
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,026
all cops make occasional
mistakes in judgment.

655
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,194
Excuse me?

656
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,573
If mistakes were made,
they most certainly were not mine.

657
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,603
He was so relaxed and happy,
I couldn't bear to move.

658
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,816
And I have to admit,
he feels quite good.

659
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:39,361
He's always so happy
in her arms.

660
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,833
Partners come to us
in various ways,

661
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,502
bound together
for many different reasons.

662
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,295
But for any partnership to work,

663
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:00,215
you must not only accept
this person into your life,

664
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,676
but accept her for who she is.

665
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,533
Saint Brigid...

666
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,287
circle us with your light,

667
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:34,666
so that no darkness
shall overcome our world.

668
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,382
- Hey.
- Hey.

669
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,887
- Hi.
- Hi!

670
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,724
- Harrison, this is Lumen.
- Hi.

671
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,810
Oh, my goodness. Hello.

672
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,321
Sometimes partners find us,

673
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,198
and as much as we try
to push them away,

674
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,284
they work their way
into our lives regardless,

675
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:12,412
until we finally realise
how much we need them.
