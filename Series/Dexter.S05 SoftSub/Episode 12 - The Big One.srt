1
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,136
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:16,182
When the wife is dead, 90 per cent
of the time the husband did it.

3
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,392
Boyd Fowler.

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:21,270
Hobbies - self-improνement
and storing women in formaldehyde.

5
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,484
She saw everything.

6
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,113
This is what happened
to the girls before you.

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,700
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me. There were others.

8
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:37,328
That last fucking bitch is alive.

9
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,582
Someone tried to move the girls
in the barrels.

10
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,877
- Where's the driver?
- He took off.

11
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,838
That means he's still mine to find.

12
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,257
You believe some people deserve to die?

13
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,926
Some people don't deserve to live.

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,095
His name's Cole Harmon.

15
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:59,726
If this is gonna end badly,
will you please just tell me now?

16
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,603
- I might have a job for you.
- And what would that be?

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,023
Looking into someone. Dexter Morgan.

18
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,695
As far as Quinn goes, I suspended him.
To protect your brother.

19
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,739
I trusted you.

20
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,449
And while you were fucking me

21
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,368
you were spreading shit
about my brother behind my back.

22
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,036
Fuck you.

23
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:22,415
You're backing off this thing
cos you're porking that guy's sister.

24
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,625
- Your blood results are in.
- Emily Birch.

25
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,294
She's not a victim. She's alive.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,797
It was almost 20 years ago.
He was Eugene Greer.

27
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,758
That's Jordan Chase?

28
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,135
With Lumen, I'm someone different.

29
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,888
In her eyes... I'm not a monster at all.

30
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,724
- I'm glad you didn't touch any of them.
- Why is that?

31
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,810
Because this DNA test will clear you
and leave you all to me.

32
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,729
We may have a vigilante on our hands.

33
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,647
One of the barrel girls escaped

34
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,817
and now she's after the men
that abducted her.

35
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,446
Maybe she had help.
A husband, boyfriend...

36
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,908
Argh!

37
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,203
You're gonna give me a full confession.

38
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,830
Liddy!

39
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,253
Liddy, it's Quinn.
You're really starting to fuckin' piss me off.

40
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,839
You said you wouldn't kill her.

41
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,052
Lumen!

42
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,638
Is this the only kind of love I'll ever find?

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,974
The kind that ends in blood?

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,392
Where are you?

45
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,718
You've been in this situation before, Dexter,

46
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,262
and I don't need to tell you how it ended,
with Rita dead.

47
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,765
I haven't forgotten.

48
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,808
Those aren't gonna do you
a lot of good without Jordan.

49
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,852
- I'll find him.
- How?

50
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,105
All the girls were raped and tortured
at the same location.

51
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,733
I'm pretty sure
that's where he's taking Lumen.

52
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,569
Pretty sure.
That sounds like an assumption.

53
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,405
It's more than that. Jordan's like me.

54
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,532
He needs his routine.

55
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,329
Deb put together a file
with all of Jordan's real-estate holdings.

56
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,580
It has to be one of them.

57
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,209
- Another assumption, Dexter?
- It's all I have to go on.

58
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,337
Lumen sees me for what I really am,

59
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,423
and she hasn't turned away from me,
she hasn't turned against me.

60
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,093
She's someone I could share my life with.

61
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,844
I will not let her die.

62
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,932
- Surprise!
- Dexter!

63
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,725
What are you guys doing here?

64
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,227
It was Astor's idea.

65
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,939
I thought we'd come surprise you and have
Harrison's birthday party here in Miami.

66
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,192
- Are you surprised?
- Boy, am I!

67
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,611
I've been telling him all morning
he's gonna see his father.

68
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,865
- He couldn't sleep, he was so excited.
- So happy to see his dad.

69
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,995
Don't worry, we're not moving in. We're
staying at the Econo Lodge down the street.

70
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:33,040
- Do you want to have breakfast with us?
- Yeah, come on, Dex!

71
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,169
I wish I could, but there's a situation
at work. I really have to go.

72
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:41,298
Oh, well, Astor and Cody had something
they wanted to ask you.

73
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,010
Can we do it later?
I just don't have time right now.

74
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:48,848
All I heard on the trip was Dexter,
Dexter, Dexter. It'll just take a minute.

75
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,476
What is it?

76
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,603
We want to stay with you for the summer.

77
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,441
Can we please, Dex?
We really, really miss you.

78
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,277
Sure you can.

79
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,032
I really miss you guys too.

80
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,831
Chase's private jet was fuelled
and sitting on the runway.

81
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,750
His pilot was all dressed up
with nowhere to go

82
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,002
because Chase never showed up
at the airport.

83
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,337
- You checked his home?
- And his office.

84
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,339
I think he knows we're onto him.

85
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,967
Probably holed up somewhere
or he's on the run.

86
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,429
I want to put out an APB,
throw out the net, see if we snag him.

87
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,015
We'll need an arrest warrant for that,
and no judge would grant it.

88
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,850
- We don't have enough evidence.
- We gotta try.

89
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,353
We can't just let that fucker
slip through our fingers.

90
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,481
We could issue a stake and notify.

91
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,150
Locate him, put him
under 24-hour surveillance

92
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,569
until we've got enough to bust him.

93
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,613
That's fucking great.

94
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,952
Where were you last night?

95
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,997
I had a couple things crash down on me.

96
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,584
I heard about Chase.
The fucker vanished?

97
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,753
Yeah, but LaGuerta just OK'd
a stake and notify.

98
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,589
Do you think your vigilantes in love
got to him?

99
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,843
Killing Jordan Chase
is not the same as killing Boyd Fowler.

100
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,971
This guy doesn't take a piss
without bodyguards holding his dick.

101
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,141
- So it's still a race.
- A race?

102
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,143
To see which couple gets to him first.

103
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,313
Us or the vigilantes.
Assuming they're a couple.

104
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,191
Assuming we're a couple.

105
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,903
I can't assume anything right now.

106
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,739
I'm gonna go review the rape DVDs.

107
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,951
- What for?
- In case we missed anything.

108
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,036
Or something can get us Jordan.

109
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,805
Hello, Dexter. Nice to hear from you.

110
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,142
Whatever you're thinking of doing,
it's not necessary.

111
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,353
- We can work something out.
- Nice try.

112
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,815
- What do you mean?
- The unemotional approach.

113
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,901
But it's not working for you.
You're stressed. I can hear it in your voice.

114
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:10,030
- She really means a lot to you, doesn't she?
- Yes.

115
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,492
It must be terrible,
going through this again.

116
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,162
Losing your wife, the woman you loved.

117
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,788
And now Lumen.

118
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,790
It's...

119
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,711
I imagine it seems to you
like some kind of terrible curse.

120
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,256
Think whatever you want.
Just listen to me.

121
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,883
I'll turn myself over to you.

122
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,469
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm afraid I must decline.

123
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,389
- Then tell me what you want.
- I have what I want.

124
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,726
And the longer I stay on the phone,
the better your chances of finding me.

125
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,061
- So this conversation's over.
- Jordan.

126
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,022
Tick-tick-tick, Dexter.

127
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,566
That's the sound
of Lumen's life running out.

128
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,985
So Lumen's still alive.

129
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,659
Let me out!

130
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,341
¡Oye! ¿Fruta?

131
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,052
Shit.

132
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,271
Jordan Chase!

133
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,490
Come on, come on.

134
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,245
¡Oye!

135
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,329
¿Qué coño es eso?

136
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,887
Jordan's real-estate holdings.
Lumen has to be at one of them.

137
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,389
Hey.

138
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,019
- Hey.
- Please! Stop!

139
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,980
- Any luck on Jordan?
- No, not really.

140
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,691
Except for that. You see that?

141
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,903
You see how Cole keeps looking off
at somebody behind the camera?

142
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,032
- You're right.
- He's not the only one, either.

143
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,533
In all these videos, these bastards,

144
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:04,079
they keep looking off as if to get approval
or instruction or something.

145
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,458
- You think they're looking at Jordan?
- Who else would it be?

146
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:12,212
It's what this guy does for a living. He tells
people what to do, how to live their lives.

147
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:17,092
I know it's not any evidence or anything,
but he's there, he's there, I can feel it.

148
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,682
- You shouldn't look at those any more.
- I have to fuckin' look at these things.

149
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,478
I understand what these women
went through. Part of it, at least.

150
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,025
I know what it is to be taken
by some sick bastard...

151
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,235
She can't even say his name.

152
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,237
Rudy. My brother.

153
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,698
...to know you're gonna die.

154
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:44,161
Is this what I do?
Curse everyone around me?

155
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,373
I have to work. If Jordan gets away with this
I can't live with myself.

156
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,750
I know.

157
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,430
Commercial real estate.

158
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,100
Strip mall. Condos.

159
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,227
Parking garages.

160
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,896
Would you keep a hostage
in any of those places for two weeks?

161
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,190
Where? Next to the doughnut shop?

162
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:18,737
It's all too exposed.
Jordan must own other properties.

163
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,448
- It's right in front of you.
- What?

164
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,452
Remember your target,
where he came from, who he was.

165
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,997
Jordan wasn't always Jordan Chase.

166
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,387
Office of County Records.

167
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,848
This is Dexter Morgan
with Miami Metro Homicide.

168
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,933
I need a property records check.

169
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,102
- Name?
- Eugene Greer.

170
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,689
- Spell it.
- G-R-E-E-R.

171
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,232
Check back with me tomorrow morning.

172
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,151
No, this is an emergency.
I need it right away.

173
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,986
There's no right away in this equation.

174
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,613
I got a pile of shit ahead of me
and they're all emergencies.

175
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,491
This isn't some developer
who's about to miss a filing deadline.

176
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,370
A woman's life is on the line.
If you don't do this now, she will die

177
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,665
and you could have done something
to stop it. Understand me? This can't wait.

178
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,834
Everyone, I need your attention.

179
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,628
Hello?

180
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:21,425
Yeah. OK. I got your number. I'll get back
to you as soon as I have something.

181
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,593
Thanks.

182
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,095
We're rolling out to Bayfront Park.

183
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,931
We have an officer down. Stan Liddy.

184
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,686
- Liddy?
- Yes. He's dead.

185
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,188
What do we know, Lieutenant?

186
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:38,192
A pedestrian spotted blood coming
out of a parked van, called it in.

187
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,360
Unis found Liddy's body inside.

188
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,531
Morgan, Quinn, you're running point
on this, so take whoever you need.

189
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,450
Anyone but me.

190
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:50,162
Dexter, grab your kit.
There's a lot of blood.

191
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,497
OK, that's all, people.

192
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,291
Our crime scene's right across the bay
so we're taking the boat.

193
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,460
Grab your gear and load up.

194
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,838
Dex. Blood.

195
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,636
Come on. The sooner we get this cleaned
up, the sooner I can get back on Chase.

196
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,273
Sorry. You can't rest here.

197
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,526
I know you're tired,
but it's just a little further.

198
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,605
Jordan's had Lumen for 12 hours.

199
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,524
Each second
I'm stuck on this slow boat

200
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,236
going to my own crime scene
takes her farther away from me.

201
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,156
Fate is hardly lending a hand.

202
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,124
You OK?

203
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,672
I know you and Liddy were friends.

204
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:10,510
I helped him with a couple of things
but I wouldn't say he was an actual friend.

205
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,722
It's just that you looked a little pale
when we left the station.

206
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,807
I'm fine.

207
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,185
You have any idea what
might have happened to him?

208
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,522
Not a clue.
What about you?

209
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,941
Any theories?

210
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,194
I haven't examined the crime scene.

211
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,863
Wild guess?

212
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:34,284
I heard Liddy was kind of shady.
Maybe something came back to bite him.

213
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,204
It's possible, I guess.

214
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,225
Lieutenant, there's something
you really need to see.

215
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,893
Holy shit.

216
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,605
Someone really did a number on him.

217
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,068
- Did you bring your full kit, Dex?
- Yep.

218
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,570
And all my kill tools.

219
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,955
Hey, if you're not up to this,
I can handle it.

220
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,002
- What is it?
- I don't know how to say it.

221
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,757
- Say what?
- Quinn, come with me, please.

222
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,972
- What's going on?
- It's OK, Deb.

223
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,642
You have a homicide to work, Detective.
Get to it.

224
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,695
Looks like the van was rigged
with surveillance equipment.

225
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,238
What the hell was Liddy watching?

226
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,157
- Me.
- No way to tell.

227
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:58,285
- Everything's been stripped clean.
- The killer covering his tracks.

228
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,997
Seems to me we find out
who Liddy was spying on, we find our killer.

229
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,543
The unis found Liddy's cellphone.

230
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,337
The last five calls he made
were all to you.

231
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,214
Want to tell me what that's about?

232
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,094
The man had demons, Lieutenant.

233
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,015
Your firing him didn't help. He just needed
someone to hear him out.

234
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,767
I was the only friend he had left.

235
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,853
OK, but he must have
kept calling you for a reason.

236
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,606
- What was it?
- I didn't pick up.

237
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:31,485
Then he would have left messages.
I need to hear them.

238
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,740
Detective...

239
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,621
That looks like blood.

240
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,591
Quinn, you'd better start talking to me.

241
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,053
I don't think I should say anything else.

242
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,930
Not until I speak to a lawyer.

243
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,682
A lawyer?

244
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,018
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

245
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,903
You can talk to your lawyer
back at the station.

246
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,446
Officer.

247
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,033
Escort Detective Quinn
back to Metro Homicide.

248
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,665
- Dexter?
- Well, there's no castoff.

249
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,252
We're looking at a single thrust,
expertly applied.

250
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,837
Good to see I did something right.

251
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,296
Passive blood pooling.

252
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,843
I guess he was probably held down
as the knife went in.

253
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,344
Died instantly.

254
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,850
- So the killer knew what he was doing.
- Sure felt like it at the time.

255
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,526
- Any idea what that's all about?
- None.

256
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,575
Are you finished?

257
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,537
Yeah, I got to catch a ride
back to the lab, run some tests.

258
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,122
OK.

259
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,542
Am I the only one who's
interested in this goddamn murder?

260
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,169
- Hello?
- I got a hit.

261
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,673
There's one property
belonging to a Eugene Greer.

262
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,260
It's listed as a River Jordan Camp
for Boys and Girls.

263
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,930
- River Jordan?
- It went bankrupt, like, 20 years ago.

264
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,640
A camp.

265
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,853
Jordan took Lumen back
to where it all started with Emily.

266
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,606
- You still there?
- Yeah. You have an address?

267
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,151
1530 Muralia Road.

268
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,445
- Thanks.
- Any time.

269
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,078
Where's Quinn going?

270
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,039
- The station.
- Why?

271
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:52,459
It looks like he may be
involved in Liddy's murder.

272
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,920
- That's crazy.
- I know. It is.

273
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,339
- But he requested an attorney.
- An attorney?

274
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,759
Has Quinn said anything to you about Liddy,
anything I should know about?

275
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,219
No. Nothing.

276
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,930
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No.

277
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,515
You're gonna stay here and do your job.

278
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,309
I hope I'm wrong about Quinn,

279
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,897
but right now we need to process the scene
and find out what really happened.

280
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,054
You remember this place?

281
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,683
Should feel like home.

282
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,406
Well, don't worry.
It'll all come back to you.

283
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,495
- What are you gonna do to me?
- What do you think?

284
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,499
What choice have you left me?

285
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,293
The two of you. Hm?

286
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,631
I spoke with Dexter on the phone.

287
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,511
I let him know that you're alive...

288
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,638
in need.

289
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,350
I motivated him.

290
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,644
Hm!

291
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,897
Now, will he come for you?

292
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,488
You know best, but I believe he will.

293
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,577
And then what?

294
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,373
We'll be joyously reunited.

295
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,751
The three of us.

296
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,683
Hm!

297
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,186
Mm.

298
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,774
You've changed since I saw you here
last time. You know that?

299
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:26,321
You... You've got this look in your eye.

300
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,035
Did you learn that from him?

301
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,466
Well?

302
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,139
- I thought you just liked to watch.
- Well, maybe I'm changing.

303
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,433
Like you.

304
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,749
Oh, God!

305
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:28,091
- Where's Quinn?
- Interrogation room.

306
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,801
Waiting for his attorney.

307
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,679
- Did he say anything?
- No.

308
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,348
It's not getting any better for him.

309
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,475
What does that mean?

310
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,022
His name's on the requisition forms

311
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:46,860
for the surveillance equipment
we found in Liddy's van.

312
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,404
What about the fingerprints
we lifted off the van?

313
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,823
Aside from Liddy's they're all Quinn's.

314
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,951
- I want to talk to him.
- Feel free to try.

315
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,078
He won't speak to any of us.

316
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,721
You shouldn't be here, Deb.

317
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,850
- LaGuerta says you asked for a lawyer.
- That's right.

318
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:22,937
Before your lawyer gets here, why don't you
tell me what the fuck is going on?

319
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,524
I think I'd better just keep my mouth shut.

320
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,195
I'm not asking you as a detective.

321
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,242
I'm asking you as someone you live with,
someone that you said you loved.

322
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,623
I think I deserve to know
what the fuck is going on.

323
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,253
All I can tell you
is that I didn't kill Liddy.

324
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,798
- But you were there.
- It's not what it looks like.

325
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:54,010
- It looks like you did it.
- I know.

326
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,306
If you didn't kill Liddy, who did?

327
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,437
I can't say anything else. I'm sorry.

328
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,522
Don't say you're sorry.

329
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,151
Just tell me the fucking truth.

330
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,240
You should go work on finding Jordan.

331
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,805
Jordan Chase was goading you
on the phone,

332
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,723
trying to get you to make a mistake.

333
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,642
- He'll be waiting for you.
- I know.

334
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,852
You need to stay alert, pay attention.

335
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,646
You don't know what he's planning for you.

336
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,273
Same thing I'm planning for him.

337
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,149
Yeah, but on his home turf.

338
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:53,111
Don't underestimate your adversary,
Dexter, not again.

339
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,530
Could you just trust me for once?

340
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,115
Shit!

341
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,792
Surprise.

342
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,926
Get up.

343
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:11,230
- Hey. You OK?
- Yeah. Fine.

344
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,234
- You look tired.
- Thanks.

345
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,613
Look, like I said,

346
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,658
we'll know more after Dexter
tests the blood on Quinn's shoe.

347
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:25,953
In the meantime, have some faith.

348
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,706
Faith?

349
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,251
Whatever you call it.
Don't assume the worst.

350
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,601
- Detective Morgan?
- Yeah.

351
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,437
Sorry for intruding.
It's from your stake and notify.

352
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,606
- Should I put it on your desk?
- What is it?

353
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,858
Someone said
they spotted Jordan Chase.

354
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,071
- A street vendor?
- Yeah, up by Muralia Road.

355
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:04,033
He thought he heard noises coming from
the trunk. That's why he called it in.

356
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,993
I know, sounds unlikely.

357
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,704
Yeah. Maybe I'll check it out. Thanks.

358
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,693
It was inevitable that this would happen.

359
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,113
Two broken people

360
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:45,908
going through intense shared experience
against a common enemy.

361
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,119
I do it in my seminars all the time.

362
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:52,081
It produces a sense of deep, deep bonding.

363
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:57,253
I'm sure you feel like you actually
have something, even... love,

364
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,546
doesn't it?

365
00:29:58,672 --> 00:29:59,672
Let her go.

366
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,259
You lost your wife, Rita.
You blamed yourself, sure.

367
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:08,681
And you thought what? That you could
make up for that by helping her?

368
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,393
- No.
- Well, then, what were you thinking?

369
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,270
That you could be a hero?

370
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:21,486
Hm. You can't save one thing
to make up for another, Dexter.

371
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,489
It's not the way the world works.

372
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,328
Wow.

373
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,793
I look at these, and...

374
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,631
I can't help but think that you
have a kind of greatness in you.

375
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:45,301
Then I look at you,
and you're no different

376
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,803
than the idiots
that show up at my seminars.

377
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,014
Totally lost.

378
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,646
I'm gonna put you out of your misery.

379
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,110
Both of you.

380
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,295
You fucking,
motherfucking...

381
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:38,688
Era él, el hombre en la televisión.
Jordan Chase. Estaba esperando las luces.

382
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:42,233
- He was waiting for the traffic light?
- Sí.

383
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:48,030
And what about the noise in the trunk?
I fuckin' swear I'm taking Spanish after this.

384
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,908
The sound in the... uh...

385
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,326
uh... trunko?

386
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:56,664
Oh, sí, tiene algo en el maletero.
¡Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

387
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,624
- Bang, bang, bang! From the trunk?
- Sí.

388
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,751
Which... Which way did... Uh...

389
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,503
¿Don... Donde fue?

390
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,714
What's down that way?

391
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,468
- ¿Qué?
- Nada mucho, un campamento.

392
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,429
A campamento?

393
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,431
- A camp?
- Sí, camp.

394
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,766
Thank you.

395
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,143
Uh... Gracias.

396
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,154
You'll want to be awake for this.

397
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,576
What do you call it?
Being present in the moment?

398
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,703
So you were listening? Mm?

399
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:39,832
I heard the words, but to be honest...

400
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:44,086
...you have to consider the source.

401
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,308
You should be the one to do it.

402
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,479
Is that OK with you?

403
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,482
He's yours.

404
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,901
Oh!

405
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,152
Please!

406
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:14,867
You're acting like there's some polite way
to do this, some-some etiquette.

407
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:20,581
Killing is killing, Dexter.
Let's at least be honest about that.

408
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,459
You're being honest, Eugene?

409
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,880
You think that's an insult?
It's a compliment.

410
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,633
It's a reminder of how far I've come.

411
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,134
And how far is that?

412
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,554
You're right back where you started,
only this time you're strapped to a table.

413
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,099
- I'm transformed.
- You will be soon.

414
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:41,268
Not just me. You, Lumen...

415
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,399
You don't get to use my name.

416
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:53,698
Really? If we're not on a first-name basis,
the three of us, then who is?

417
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,032
Look at you.

418
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,035
You're transformed too.
You're beautiful.

419
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,370
And you know what?

420
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,832
If you hadn't met me, you would
never have known you had it in you.

421
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,793
- I wouldn't have had it in me...
- Well, now you do!

422
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,211
Shut up!

423
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,678
It's truly amazing.
You should thank me.

424
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,972
That's not what's gonna happen.

425
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:21,225
I watched you so carefully
the last time you were here.

426
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,519
You used to just cower and cry!

427
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,026
That's not just for me.
That's for everyone that you hurt.

428
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,780
Even Emily. Do you hear me?

429
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,950
Do you hear me?!

430
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,761
I'm sorry. I know that's not
how you're supposed to do it.

431
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,767
Well, he was right about that part.
There is no polite way.

432
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,380
Maybe we should just
leave the body here.

433
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,800
We don't want a murder investigation.

434
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,261
We want closure.

435
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,931
So he just vanishes like the others?

436
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,476
Jordan's car is outside.
We'll use it to move the body.

437
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,145
Then maybe a month from now

438
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,273
we'll tip off Miami Metro
about this place.

439
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,860
Everyone will know what he's done.

440
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,241
Don't move.

441
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,993
Don't fucking move.

442
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,164
Whatever's in your arms, drop it now.

443
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,418
Both of you.

444
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,765
I know who you are.

445
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,520
Number 13.

446
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,315
And I know what they did to you.

447
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,443
I've seen the tapes.

448
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,571
I watched them over and over.

449
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,286
It's a miracle you survived.

450
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,664
A fucking miracle.

451
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:37,379
And you, whoever you are,
you know that too.

452
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:47,640
I said, don't fucking move!

453
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,688
Maybe it's true
some people deserve to die,

454
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,652
but I'm a cop, and I don't
make that fucking decision.

455
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,656
So I'm gonna call this in.

456
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,620
In an hour, this place
will be swarming with police.

457
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,921
If I were you, I'd be gone by then.

458
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,222
I don't know what you did or didn't do.

459
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,142
And for some reason you're not saying.

460
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,770
But I'm not judging.

461
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:23,193
I can't judge. Not any more.

462
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,407
What do you mean?

463
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,325
Did something happen?

464
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,997
Yes.

465
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,918
A lot, actually.
A lot that I don't understand.

466
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,758
You know how LaGuerta keeps
saying everything's complicated?

467
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,095
I'm starting to believe her.

468
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:55,601
- I'm glad you're here.
- Are you?

469
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,229
More than you know.

470
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,941
I'll be here, no matter what happens.

471
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,761
Did you ever think we'd get here?

472
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,934
- You didn't?
- Not really, no.

473
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,354
I mean, for a while there I wasn't sure.

474
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,234
It's like what your sister said.

475
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,612
It's a miracle.

476
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,073
It's a fucking miracle.

477
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,092
Home?

478
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,822
I thought you'd be getting ready
for Harrison's birthday.

479
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,908
LaGuerta said this couldn't wait.

480
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:01,203
She also said
you broke the barrel girls case.

481
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,621
I didn't break it.

482
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:07,209
I found the place
where they shot the DVDs,

483
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,795
this camp where everything happened.

484
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,799
Jordan's missing, though.
Just like the rest of them.

485
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,176
Think it was your vigilantes?

486
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,305
Maybe.

487
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:24,142
At least then we'd know he was dead.

488
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,271
That's just a crazy theory.

489
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,653
What about that?

490
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,572
The blood on Quinn's shoe,
is it Liddy's?

491
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,035
I haven't run it yet.

492
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,663
Do you think it is?

493
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,791
I don't know.

494
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,755
You think you know someone...

495
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:58,510
and then it turns out you don't.

496
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,974
You think someone's a good cop
and then they...

497
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,603
do something.

498
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:15,819
I don't know. All I'm saying is...
nothing is as simple as it seems.

499
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,990
You're right about that.

500
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,701
Tell me as soon as you know.

501
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,888
I know already.

502
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,312
Hey, you're up.

503
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:55,192
I bought some stuff for pancakes.

504
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:59,821
You don't know this about me, but I'm
actually kind of a breakfast connoisseur.

505
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,743
The party's today. Harrison's birthday.

506
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,037
You'll get to meet Cody, finally.

507
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,498
Actually, you'll get to meet a lot of people.

508
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,833
Everybody from the station.

509
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,670
Oh, and the kids want to spend
the whole summer here,

510
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:19,216
so we should probably talk about that.

511
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:28,183
What? What is it?

512
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,773
I didn't sleep at all last night.

513
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,528
First I was wondering
what was happening to me,

514
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:45,075
and then I was...
wondering how I could possibly tell you.

515
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,244
Tell me what?

516
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,166
I have to leave.

517
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,422
- What?
- Today.

518
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,969
- You can't.
- I have to.

519
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,392
When I saw Jordan Chase's body
disappearing into the ocean, I...

520
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,103
Something happened.

521
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,939
And...

522
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:18,984
all night I was trying to figure out...

523
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,153
what was happening,

524
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,282
and I tried to hold on to it.

525
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,579
But... this morning I...

526
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,250
I could tell it was gone.

527
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,755
I don't feel it any more.

528
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,676
The need.

529
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,181
Her dark passenger. It's vanished.

530
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,226
Say something.

531
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,771
Please?

532
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,569
Anything. Just...
Just talk to me.

533
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,408
Don't go. You can't.

534
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,952
I don't want to.

535
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,331
Then don't. Stay here.

536
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:19,002
I can't do it any more,
what we've been doing.

537
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,171
You don't have to.

538
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:24,508
But you do. Right?

539
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,179
We both know that.

540
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,603
It's who you are.

541
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,054
You're right.

542
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,019
About everything, you're right.

543
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,360
We're not the same.

544
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,574
I'm so sorry.

545
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,868
Don't be.

546
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,833
Don't be sorry your darkness is gone.

547
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,425
I'll carry it for you.

548
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,928
Always.

549
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,435
I'll keep it with mine.

550
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,962
Happy birthday, Harrison.

551
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,225
Happy anniversary.

552
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:44,105
Thank you.
Only it's not our anniversary.

553
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:49,694
I saw you. With Deb. Trying so hard.

554
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,823
It makes me want to do the same.

555
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,286
Want to give it another shot?
Go back to the beginning?

556
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,413
Yes.

557
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,334
Yes.

558
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,643
Dexterous!

559
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:27,482
So, Dex, be honest with me.

560
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:30,485
Is it weird to bring a date
to a first birthday party?

561
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:35,448
No, Vince. I'm glad you brought her.

562
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,952
Oh, no, I didn't mean me.
I meant your sister.

563
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:47,585
There she is! The detective
who solved the barrel girls case.

564
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,469
Thank you.

565
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,266
- For what?
- The blood work.

566
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,935
Just doing my job.

567
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,689
Yeah, well, that was
the one thing hanging me up.

568
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,232
I owe you one.

569
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,195
I'm gonna go get a drink.

570
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,412
You could have told me sooner
that the blood work cleared him.

571
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:26,708
Channels. LaGuerta wanted
to give you the good news.

572
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,923
- You don't like Quinn much.
- I don't like Quinn at all.

573
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:38,052
But I want you to be happy.

574
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,473
I am. I'm happy.

575
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,934
You must be too.

576
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,438
Now that this is all over, I mean.

577
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:56,488
They make it look so easy...

578
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:04,621
connecting with another human being.

579
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,878
It's like no-one told them
it's the hardest thing in the world.

580
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:54,587
Where is she?

581
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,758
Your tenant
who was staying at the house.

582
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,679
She left.

583
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:04,514
I'm sorry.

584
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,309
Did you do it?

585
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,979
What you wanted to do?

586
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,273
You said she needed your help.

587
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,358
Did you help her?

588
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,196
Yeah. I think I did.

589
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:23,366
And did it work?

590
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,870
Did it make you feel better?

591
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:28,830
About what happened to Mom?

592
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:32,333
You can't do one thing
to make up for another.

593
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,003
That's what Jordan Chase says.

594
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:38,089
But he's wrong,
because we do that all the time.

595
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,927
That is the way the world works.
We try to make things right.

596
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,306
Even me.

597
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,268
Come on, everybody,
it's time for the cake.

598
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,436
Dexter.

599
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,193
Are you ready?

600
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,946
Lumen said I gave her
her life back,

601
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,282
a reversal of my usual role.

602
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:07,160
Well, the fact is,
she gave me mine back too.

603
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:11,581
And I'm left not with what she took from me,
but with what she brought.

604
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:16,461
Eyes that saw me, finally,
for who I really am.

605
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:21,049
And this certainty that nothing,
nothing is set in stone.

606
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,468
Not even darkness.

607
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,721
While she was here,
she made me think,

608
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:30,475
for the briefest moment, that I might even
have a chance to be human.

609
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,102
Make a wish. Make a wish.

610
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,648
One, two...

611
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,441
Make a wish.

612
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,986
But wishes, of course, are for children.

613
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,530
...three!
