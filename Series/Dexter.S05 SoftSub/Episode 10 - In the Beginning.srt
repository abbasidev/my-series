1
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,511
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,846
I need to get my hands on that vial.

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,848
I'm just gonna extract a sample.

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,393
I'll run it for DNA. Hopefully get an ID.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,228
So, whose blood do you think it is?

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,231
- Your blood results are in.
- Emily Birch.

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,066
She's not a victim. She's alive.

8
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,568
Boozing it up in Coral Gables.

9
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:31,489
The Barrel Girls case, there are
partial sequences from multiple people.

10
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:36,160
- Cole and Boyd did this together?
- With maybe three or four others.

11
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,913
As far as Quinn goes,
he wasn't on vacation.

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,166
I suspended him.
To protect your brother.

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,544
I trusted you.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,962
And while you were fucking me,

15
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,798
you were spreading shit
about my brother behind my back.

16
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,174
Fuck you.

17
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,220
Cole as a teenager.

18
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,105
Your boy Dexter Morgan and his girlfriend
on his boat at 3:00am.

19
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,023
- What's in the bags?
- Something heavy.

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,984
I'm thinking narcotics. Maybe a body.

21
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,777
It's time to stop.

22
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,113
Stay the fuck away from Deb!

23
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,406
Dexter?

24
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,451
No, it's Jordan Chase.
Can I leave a message?

25
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,287
Tick-tick-tick.

26
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,583
That's the sound of his life running out.

27
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,460
Take care, Lumen.

28
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,912
They say that history repeats itself,

29
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,790
but I will never put my family
in danger again.

30
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,959
Now that Jordan Chase knows
Lumen and I are onto him,

31
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,627
I need to plan for the worst.

32
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,632
Yeah, I think that's the last of it.

33
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,677
I put the grandparents' address
in the navigational system.

34
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,554
And I have the print-out you gave me.

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,306
And Harrison
is going to have such a good time

36
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,642
with his big sister and big brother
in Orlando.

37
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,772
I'm getting Harrison out of Miami
and Lumen out of that house.

38
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,317
Dexter.

39
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,070
I haven't been apart from him
since Rita died.

40
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,406
Nothing is going to happen to Harrison.

41
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,914
Love you.

42
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,376
Call me as soon as you get there.

43
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,587
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Dexter.

44
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,264
Lumen.

45
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,853
Come on. We'll be safe here.
Jordan doesn't know about this place.

46
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,980
He thinks we're at the house.

47
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,659
What the fuck are you up to now?

48
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,751
We can't wait any more.
We need to take out Jordan.

49
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,586
That might be difficult.

50
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,339
He's surrounded at all times
by four bodyguards,

51
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,549
except when he's on stage
in front of 200 people.

52
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,302
- I think we should start with the others.
- We don't even know who they are.

53
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,554
No. But she can help us.

54
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,976
Is that her? The one whose blood
Jordan wears around his neck?

55
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,727
Yeah. Emily Birch.

56
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,355
She looks like me
and the girls in the barrels.

57
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,482
But older.

58
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:21,445
She's the same age
as Jordan, and Cole and Boyd.

59
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,739
I think she was the first victim.

60
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,117
How is she still alive?

61
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,868
I don't know. I hope she can tell us.

62
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,913
- We're gonna talk to her today?
- I'll come back at lunchtime.

63
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,748
We'll go then.

64
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,130
Stay inside. Don't open the door.

65
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,841
- I won't.
- To anyone.

66
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,810
OK, by now you're all aware

67
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,855
that new evidence has been found
in the Barrel Girls case,

68
00:05:55,981 --> 00:06:00,067
which this department
is again pursuing as a top priority.

69
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,736
Our initial conclusion that Boyd Fowler

70
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,363
was solely responsible
for these crimes was wrong.

71
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,823
It now appears that he had help.

72
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,825
And the day began with such promise.

73
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,369
Vince, can you take us through the DNA?

74
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,876
New evidence "has been found"?
Like, maybe the evidence discovered itself.

75
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,462
I'm just glad to be back.
It beats the fucking file room.

76
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,631
DNA reports from the Coroner's Office
point to multiple perps.

77
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,300
- Do we have any names?
- No.

78
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,386
What we have are partial sequences
from very seriously degraded DNA.

79
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,056
But the evidence confirms
what we knew about Boyd Fowler.

80
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,641
And it also points with a high probability

81
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,311
to Cole Harmon,
Jordan Chase's head of security.

82
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,438
As you know, Cole Harmon
was our original suspect in the case.

83
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,440
Until I pointed them toward Boyd Fowler.

84
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,400
He is now our main target again.

85
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,236
A target you'll never hit.
He's already buried at sea.

86
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,072
- Morgan.
- Yeah.

87
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:49,366
Debra. Take Quinn
and bring in Cole Harmon.

88
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,912
Start at his office. In the meantime,
I'm getting search warrants for his house.

89
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,122
- You should have them within the hour.
- Fuck yeah.

90
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,124
That's it.

91
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,463
Hey, congrats.
Looks like your filing days are over.

92
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,841
Yeah, at least until
LaGuerta's mood changes.

93
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,389
Angel.

94
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,102
So, you got Morgan back.

95
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,896
Yeah. Thanks for that.

96
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,691
- It's what you wanted.
- She earned it.

97
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,277
- So...
- I'll keep you posted on the case.

98
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,879
- May I help you?
- Miami Metro Homicide.

99
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,006
We're looking for Cole Harmon.

100
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,136
Mr Harmon hasn't worked here
in more than two weeks.

101
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,055
What?

102
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,474
You should probably talk to Mr Chase.

103
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,184
Are you fucking kidding me?

104
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,229
Your head of security disappears
and you don't think it's worth reporting?

105
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,730
It seemed like an internal matter.

106
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,526
Cole Harmon is wanted for the rape
and murder of at least five women.

107
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,527
Hold on a second.

108
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,489
Detective Batista told me and Mr Harmon
that you'd made a mistake,

109
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,367
that some animal pickup officer
was your sole suspect.

110
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,286
He's not any more.

111
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,205
- And I was supposed to divine that?
- Do you know where he is or not?

112
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,125
Detective Morgan, I don't know
where this aggression is coming from

113
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,878
or why it's directed at me,
but a word of caution.

114
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,464
Aggression can be a powerful motivator,
but it can also cloud your percep...

115
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,801
Save your bullshit for your seminars
and answer my question.

116
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,513
I have no idea where Cole is.
He told me he needed some personal time.

117
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,350
Your head of security says he needs
some time off and you just say OK?

118
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,811
I have been nothing but cooperative
with your department.

119
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,232
But that was predicated on a certain amount
of discretion on your part, and respect.

120
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,527
Now you barge into my place of business,
hurling insinuations.

121
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,905
No one is insinuating anything.

122
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:55,451
Look, if you hear from Cole,
give us a call, OK?

123
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,370
From now on, any contact between us
will be through my attorney.

124
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,497
He'll be hearing from us.

125
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,085
Is there some reason
you needed to antagonise him like that?

126
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,378
Yes.

127
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,215
Girls are being raped,
tortured and stuffed into barrels.

128
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,926
Two rapist killers
are directly connected to him.

129
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,136
What are the odds
he knows absolutely nothing about it?

130
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,222
- Small.
- Yes.

131
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,182
Small, Quinn. That was my point.

132
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,601
I understand that. I'm on your side, OK?

133
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,357
The search warrants
have probably come through.

134
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,817
Let's go fuck up Cole Harmon's living room.

135
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,462
- Emily Birch?
- Yes.

136
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,964
Who are you?

137
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,883
We're trying to track down some information
on Jordan Chase.

138
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,719
The Jordan Chase?

139
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,846
We understand that you know him.

140
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,766
Do I look like the kind of person
that knows Jordan Chase?

141
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,019
Well, he knows who you are.

142
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,646
How?

143
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,564
Do you mind if I show you a photo?

144
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,570
- I think you need to go.
- Maybe you know some of these people.

145
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,031
- No.
- Could you at least just look at it?

146
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,575
I told you. I don't know who any of those
people are and I want you to go.

147
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,703
Emily...

148
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,416
That went well.

149
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,963
Did you see how she reacted to that photo?
She definitely knows who they are.

150
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,716
You'd think she'd want to talk to us.

151
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:39,430
I don't know. Security bars, DUIs.
She's got a lot of defences in place.

152
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,391
There's got to be a way
to get her to give us those names.

153
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,105
Deb needs me on a search warrant

154
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,232
at Cole Harmon's house.

155
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,236
I'll drop you back at the apartment first.

156
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,505
- I don't see any blood.
- You think we'd call you here for nothing?

157
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,470
Kid gloves, OK? That's gonna tell us
which scumbag friends he's been talking to.

158
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:24,058
Unless there's such a thing as red mould,
this sure as shit looks like blood.

159
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:29,313
Cole Harmon's blood.
Left there when Lumen hit him to save me.

160
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,281
- It's definitely blood.
- Blood that's been cleaned up.

161
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,532
You don't miss a thing.

162
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,117
Unfortunately.

163
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,120
There's something fucked up
about this whole situation.

164
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,332
Cole's car is still in the driveway.
It's not like he got up and ran.

165
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,543
It's like he disappeared,
or he got disappeared.

166
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:56,298
Rush that blood work. I want to know if it's
Cole's and if someone did a number on him.

167
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,803
Deb. Deb, you got to take a look at this.

168
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,607
Please.

169
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,073
Come on!

170
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,411
DVDs. They were in that lockbox.

171
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,790
No! No!

172
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,335
They videotaped themselves
torturing these women.

173
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,506
13 discs. They're all numbered.

174
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:41,176
Lumen was the last victim.
That would make her number 13.

175
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,887
Turn it off.

176
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:08,412
Despite having considered myself
a monster for as long as I can remember,

177
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,080
it still comes as a shock

178
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:14,168
when I'm confronted with the depth of evil
that exists in this world.

179
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,925
Did the blood work go out?

180
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,928
- An hour ago.
- And?

181
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,139
Deb, the results won't come back
for at least a day.

182
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,558
Oh, fuck. But you'll let me know?

183
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,979
Right.

184
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,567
I need to take a breath, you know?

185
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,527
Whew.

186
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,113
It's hard. There is some
seriously fucked-up shit in there.

187
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:47,826
And if Debra gets eyes on Lumen's DVD,
she'll know everything. It will all unravel.

188
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:52,039
Deb, Cole Harmon's emails
and phone records are up.

189
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,957
- You want to go through them?
- Fuck yes.

190
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,084
Let's see who he's been talking to.

191
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,149
No, no, no, no.
Chain of custody, chain of custody.

192
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,818
Your sister's new mantra.

193
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,905
Last time someone came in here,
she nearly killed me,

194
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,617
which, frankly, would be better than
going through another one of these DVDs.

195
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:34,331
Each one, same creepy place,
same creepy shit.

196
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,795
Notice anything about them?

197
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,756
They all look like Lumen.

198
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,591
No, not really.

199
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,261
Well, they could be sisters.

200
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,138
All 13 of them.

201
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:53,725
- Which is weird. I mean, 13.
- Why?

202
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:58,564
You were at Boyd Fowler's house
when we went through it, right?

203
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,357
Yep.

204
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,484
Remember those locks of hair?

205
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:07,739
There were 12.
So, there should be 12 victims.

206
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,034
- But there are 13 discs.
- Huh.

207
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,744
He's nearly there.

208
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,871
Yeah, that is weird.

209
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,668
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dex!
Whoa! Back, back, back!

210
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:20,961
- Dude!
- Sorry.

211
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,965
You've got to be more careful, man! This is
all we got to nail these fucking assholes.

212
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,259
I know. I'm sorry.

213
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,511
I'll just... I'll leave.

214
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,019
I've been trying to get a handle
on this Emily Birch and there's nothing.

215
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,731
She graduates high school in 1992
and then it's just a big blank.

216
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,899
Except for those DUIs that you found.

217
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,072
What?

218
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:54,328
They found this in the search at Cole's.

219
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,750
The men who hurt you,
they made DVDs of everything they did.

220
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,507
13. Is that me?

221
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,606
- Did everyone watch it?
- No.

222
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,317
I managed to get it out of evidence in time.

223
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,155
Did you... Did you watch it?

224
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,658
Only enough to make sure
I had the right one.

225
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,914
Are you sure you want to keep it?

226
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,041
Number 13.

227
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,628
That's what I was to them.

228
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,768
It must've been hard for you to get that.

229
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,276
I know that you risk your life

230
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,570
every day that you're with me.

231
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,908
You've been my only way through this.

232
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,289
Well, I guess...

233
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,252
...we both met each other at the right time.

234
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,807
No! No! No!

235
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,601
No! No! Let me out of here!

236
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,855
No! No! No!

237
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,023
No! No! Let me go!

238
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,110
Yeah!

239
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,488
- No!
- Yes!

240
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,450
Get me out of here! No! No! No!

241
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,881
The DVDs. Lumen watching at home.

242
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,008
Deb watching here.

243
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,845
Both wanting some sort of resolution.

244
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,848
But I can only help one.

245
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,399
Watching these DVDs,
watching it actually happen,

246
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,902
is worse than any fucking crime scene.

247
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,488
What these women went through,

248
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,532
I don't know, maybe it's a fucking blessing
that they're dead.

249
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,203
No one could go through something like this
and have a life again.

250
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,256
People may be stronger than you think.

251
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,842
Believe me, on this one, you're wrong.

252
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,887
There's no coming back
from something like this.

253
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,604
- Where's 13?
- Disc 13, it was damaged.

254
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,942
I was actually grateful
I didn't have to watch another one of these.

255
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,862
Have you been here all night?

256
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,908
Yeah. And I think it was worth it
cos I think I'm starting to figure it out.

257
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,661
I went through Cole Harmon's contacts.

258
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:29,417
And do you remember that weird
plastic-wrap murder a few weeks back?

259
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,962
Those two guys at the warehouse.

260
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,172
Yeah, one of them was a dentist.

261
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,092
A kids' dentist. Dan Mendell.

262
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,679
Well, it turns out he and Cole are buddies.

263
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,473
They fucking poke each other
on Facebook.

264
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,560
And you see that ring on the DVD?

265
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:51,773
It matches photos
taken at the warehouse crime scene.

266
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,651
So, I think he's one of these guys.

267
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,029
So, Dan the dentist is dead.
He was shot to death.

268
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,491
Looks like somebody attacked
Cole Harmon in his house.

269
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,869
And Boyd Fowler's disappeared.

270
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,414
This is a group of guys that like to get
together and they like to do this for fun.

271
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,669
So, what else do they have in common?
They're all missing.

272
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,629
But they're not on the run, I can tell you that.

273
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,131
Not one of them bought a plane ticket,

274
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:19,926
or emptied their bank account
or used a fucking credit card.

275
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,639
- Someone is taking these guys out.
- Who?

276
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,727
Well, at first I thought
they were turning on each other.

277
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:33,189
Then I thought, "That doesn't make sense.
Why would they do that after all this time?"

278
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:38,403
So, I started asking myself,
"Who would want to take these guys out?"

279
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,450
And you know the first person
that came to mind?

280
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,077
Me.

281
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,121
You?

282
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,918
Someone who knows
what these cocksuckers have been up to

283
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,837
and wants to give them what they deserve.

284
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,341
So, what are you saying?
There's a vigilante out there?

285
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,093
Yeah, I think that's what I'm saying. Yes.

286
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,311
This is what happened to me.

287
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,356
No! No! Let me out of here!

288
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,398
No!

289
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,275
Is it also what happened to you?

290
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,319
No! Let me go!

291
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,157
There were 13 of us after you.

292
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,911
I didn't know.

293
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,415
I didn't know there was anybody else
until you knocked on my door.

294
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,669
I'm the only one who survived.

295
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,046
Oh, my God.

296
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:45,345
Emily, I need you to tell me
what happened to you.

297
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,474
Can you do that?

298
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:59,901
It was almost 20 years ago
during the summer at camp.

299
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,864
I was a CIT, counsellor in training,

300
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,285
a year older than them.

301
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,872
They were just...

302
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,043
...like everybody else.

303
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,297
Except Jordan.

304
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,883
Only, he wasn't called Jordan then.

305
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,053
He was Eugene Greer.

306
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,808
That's Jordan Chase?

307
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,812
When he was Eugene Greer.

308
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,481
I felt sorry for him.

309
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,567
Became his friend, you know?

310
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,320
We would take these walks,
and one day we were walking

311
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,364
and I blacked out.

312
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,285
He must have drugged me or something.

313
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,246
They drugged me too.

314
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:59,294
I woke up in a cabin.
My clothes were off.

315
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,297
And I was tied to a bunk.

316
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,677
Eugene started in...

317
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,847
So, he attacked you.

318
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,934
No. Eugene never touched me.

319
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,773
But he got those guys going.
He talked them into it.

320
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,942
Told them to seize their desires.

321
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,071
And... And...

322
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,364
they did.

323
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,284
And I was watching Gene's face.

324
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,080
The look that came over his face,

325
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,082
it was just a flash.

326
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:42,087
But it's the same look
he has all the time now.

327
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,465
And I got dressed.

328
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,551
And they made me...

329
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,055
...take their picture.

330
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,100
This photo.

331
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,520
So, this is Cole.

332
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,606
And that's Dan.

333
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,691
And that's Boyd.

334
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,278
And Jordan.

335
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,366
Who is this one?

336
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,994
Alex.

337
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,039
Alex Tilden.

338
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,999
He's the fifth.

339
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,010
Can I help you?

340
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,221
Yeah. You got a pen?

341
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,307
Sure.

342
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:41,813
Just, uh, leaving a note for Joey.
I'm an old friend. Thank you.

343
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,069
You're... You're Harry's kid, right?

344
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,363
- Blood guy.
- That's right.

345
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,533
And your sister, Detective Morgan...

346
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,662
Usually it's the boy child
ends up doing the police work, not the girl.

347
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:00,373
But here you are in the geek squad.

348
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,667
Yeah. Blood spatter suited me more.

349
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:06,629
- You like the blood, huh?
- I like catching bad guys.

350
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,965
That's cute.

351
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,014
Dexter.

352
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,308
Yeah, I'll be right down.

353
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:23,521
- Got to go.
- So long... Dexter.

354
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,250
Hey, beautiful, I got to pick up
a few things for a stake-out.

355
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,544
It's for Detective Quinn.
You see his name there.

356
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,422
Let's see.
Surveillance cameras, wireless mics,

357
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,342
and a portable wireless recorder monitor.

358
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,510
- Yep.
- Be right back.

359
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,512
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

360
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,559
So, Emily never told anyone.

361
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,394
She said she was afraid
of her father.

362
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,855
He hated her friends.
He hated the way she dressed.

363
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,690
She was afraid he would blame her.

364
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,693
That's probably the reason
Jordan let her live.

365
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,154
Listening to her talk, I could just see it.

366
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,741
Jordan's whole philosophy,
transforming your life, blah blah blah.

367
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,910
It all came from destroying hers.

368
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,621
That moment turned Jordan into a monster.

369
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,040
My guess, he already was a monster.

370
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,878
You weren't supposed to see her alone. You
were supposed to stay in the apartment.

371
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,589
- I tried. I couldn't.
- It's not safe.

372
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,759
You understand that, right?

373
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,851
Did Emily name the other one in the photo?

374
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,982
Yes.

375
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,237
What?

376
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,364
I want to be the one to do this.

377
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,161
It's one thing to watch it.
It's another thing to actually do it.

378
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,622
- I know.
- It will change you.

379
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,958
I'm already changed.

380
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,137
What's the last guy's name?

381
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,391
I'm Alex Tilden. How can I help you?

382
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:26,269
Detective Quinn. Morgan. Metro Homicide.

383
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:30,064
Homicide? OK. What's going on?

384
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,735
Well, we're investigating a recent series
of murders. You may have read about it.

385
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,696
A number of girls were killed
and stored in barrels.

386
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,991
Yeah. Yeah, I saw it on the news.
It's pretty shocking.

387
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,617
What does it have to do with me?

388
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,245
Cole Harmon is a suspect in our case.

389
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,414
Your name turned up
on a list of acquaintances.

390
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,166
We're talking to everyone on the list.

391
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,335
Ye... Uh, yeah.
Well, sure. Yeah, I know Cole.

392
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,920
You two talk on the phone a lot?

393
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,465
We're in a fantasy football league together.

394
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,051
I was trying to get him
to give up a player all season.

395
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,761
Have you heard from him lately?

396
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,054
No. No.

397
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,516
- What's going on here?
- Do you know any of Cole's friends?

398
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,271
- Dan Mendell? He's a kids' dentist.
- I don't have kids.

399
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,732
- Do you know him?
- No.

400
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,026
Boyd Fowler. That name ring a bell?

401
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:18,029
No. I don't know either of those men.

402
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,866
You want to tell me what this is all about?

403
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,037
Then, unless I'm in some sort of trouble,
I need to get back to work.

404
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,831
I have a closing in 15 minutes
I should prepare for.

405
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,209
One more name. Jordan Chase.

406
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,713
Jordan Chase Jordan Chase?
He's messed up in this?

407
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,049
- Do you know him?
- I never met him.

408
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,593
You know, I've always wanted to.

409
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:45,556
Well, if you, uh, do hear from Cole,
give us a call, OK?

410
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,558
I'll do that.

411
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,685
Thank you.

412
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,819
"If you do hear from Cole, give us a call"?

413
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,948
Might be hard for him to get cell reception
from six feet underground.

414
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:05,952
You really think a vigilante's
killing off these people one by one?

415
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:10,790
Anyone who knows what these guys were
up to would do something pretty extreme.

416
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,042
Watch the tapes again. You'll get it.

417
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,592
- I'm not dressed right.
- No, you're fine.

418
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,512
But I did get you something.

419
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:25,972
Oh.

420
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,524
They're just like yours.

421
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,945
Try them on.

422
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,879
From now on, we have to be especially
careful not to leave anything behind.

423
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,006
No fingerprints, no evidence.

424
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,925
Nothing that points back to us.

425
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,971
You sure we have enough time
to get it all done?

426
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,851
Yes, if we move now.
His bank closes at 7:00.

427
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,979
We have to be in and out of his house
before he gets back.

428
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:40,004
I'm used to hunting on my own,
and here we are, hunting as a pair.

429
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,718
Looks like Alex believes in karma.

430
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,438
And it's all become so...

431
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,565
natural.

432
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,411
- Should we take it?
- No. He'll know someone was here.

433
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,623
This is just a fact-finding mission.

434
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,459
I think we know what the facts are.

435
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:22,547
There's a way to do this.
It protects you.

436
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,759
It protects both of us.

437
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,391
One of these days,
you've got to teach me how to do that.

438
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,860
13 pieces ofjewellery. 13 trophies.

439
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,369
My grandparents gave me this
when I graduated from high school.

440
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,455
I was wearing it the night they took me.

441
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,749
This is mine.

442
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,876
Let me.

443
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:15,558
How do you choose the...
what do you call it, the place?

444
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,685
The kill room.

445
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:24,817
We need someplace
inconspicuous and secure.

446
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,072
Like this?

447
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,746
Maybe it's true that pairs
survive better in the wild.

448
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,796
It's not easy talking to a stranger.

449
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,467
But I did it anyway.

450
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,178
For you.

451
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:57,016
You told her everything,
about what happened at the camp?

452
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:01,354
It was hard, but yeah.

453
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,733
You told her about Alex?

454
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,696
I told her the truth, like you said.

455
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,200
Even though I didn't want to.

456
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,413
Are you in trouble, Jordan?

457
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:29,173
The girl you talked to was making waves.

458
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,680
But everything's fine now, thanks to you.

459
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,935
She was pretty, the girl.

460
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:47,525
Emily. No one could ever take your place.
You know that, right?

461
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:55,199
We have a bond
that no one can ever break.

462
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,496
You made me what I am today.

463
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,736
Do you know
how special you are to me?

464
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,209
Eugene Greer has arrived.

465
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,588
Oh. The parade's here.

466
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,506
Four bodyguards? That's it?

467
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:02,308
Detectives, I'd like you to meet
my friend and attorney, Stuart Frank.

468
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:07,688
How do you do? You've requested a DNA
sample from my client. I'd like to know why.

469
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,025
There was unidentified male DNA
found on the Barrel Girl victims.

470
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,444
We want to clear Mr Chase as a suspect.

471
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,404
Why on earth
is he even considered a suspect?

472
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,281
Because the DNA we have identified

473
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,700
belongs to men directly connected
to your client.

474
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,535
Cole Harmon is your head of security.

475
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,412
Boyd Fowler is a devoted fan.

476
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,539
We found your books
and tapes in his home.

477
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,792
That proves exactly nothing.

478
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,169
A million people
have connections with my client.

479
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,963
I assume the two men
you're talking about drive cars.

480
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,050
Are you going to start
interrogating automobile CEOs?

481
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,011
Detective Morgan,
I've helped a lot of people over the years.

482
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,013
Many of them were broken individuals

483
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,182
going through very difficult periods
in their lives.

484
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,184
Is that what you call this?

485
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,562
Someone who's going through
"a very difficult period" in their life?

486
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,944
If Mr Chase knew anything about this,
he would have informed the police.

487
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,447
Now, unless you're working your way toward
some more reasonable line of inquiry,

488
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,490
we're done here.

489
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:04,954
No, we're not. I want to do anything I can
to help you find the people who did that.

490
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,664
If you want my DNA, you're welcome to it.

491
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,999
- Jordan.
- It's OK, Stu.

492
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,836
I know it's your duty to be suspicious.

493
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,213
But I swear,
no one is more disturbed than I am

494
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,842
that people I've helped could be
responsible for something like this.

495
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,927
So, how does this work?

496
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,763
It's just a cheek swab.
It won't take but a second.

497
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,891
- You don't have to do this.
- Dexter will help you.

498
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,744
Have a seat.

499
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,920
I was hoping we'd have
a chance to speak again.

500
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,464
- We don't have anything to talk about.
- Oh, I beg to differ.

501
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,091
I think we have a lot to discuss.

502
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,468
After all, you are a client.

503
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:05,014
Former.
Your programme didn't work for me.

504
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,851
Regardless, when I see someone
on a self-destructive path,

505
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,020
I can't just stay silent.

506
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,065
Often, people get involved
with someone who is toxic to them,

507
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,984
unstable and dangerous.

508
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,527
Bad things happen.

509
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,446
Open.

510
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,662
You're just now putting your life
back together after a terrible tragedy.

511
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,875
I implore you, don't invite another one.

512
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,294
For yourself
or for what's left of your family.

513
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,966
You know,
I'm glad you didn't touch any of them.

514
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,177
Really? Why is that?

515
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:47,306
Because this DNA test will clear you
and leave you all to me.

516
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,224
And to her.

517
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,101
Your time is up.

518
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,941
There you go. You're done.

519
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,903
Thank you, Dexter.

520
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,115
I'm here for you. Don't forget that.

521
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,159
And soon, I'll be there for you.

522
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,994
I appreciate it.

523
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,427
What else did Jordan say?

524
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,554
That you were toxic

525
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,516
and dangerous,

526
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,477
and that I was on a self-destructive path.

527
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,855
That sounds like a threat.

528
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,110
He was trying to make me doubt...

529
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,738
...you.

530
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,324
What do you think?

531
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,703
Uh...

532
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,247
You look...

533
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:57,251
- I look stupid, don't I?
- No, no, no.

534
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:59,962
You can tell me the truth.

535
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,382
You look...

536
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:07,636
...perfect.
- Really?

537
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,686
Look at those.

538
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,983
These are beautiful.

539
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,903
- May I?
- Sure.

540
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,378
The other way.

541
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,963
Oh.

542
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,181
Just... be careful.

543
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,306
Oh, my goodness.

544
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,103
I'm thinking maybe I should
leave town for a while,

545
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,105
take some sick days,
get the hell out of here.

546
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,608
No. The police could come back
with more questions about Cole.

547
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,819
If you're suddenly gone,
it might look suspicious.

548
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,529
Well, at least I'll fucking be alive!

549
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:52,950
Alex, you need to calm down.
I've taken steps to resolve the situation.

550
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,035
What steps? What are you talking about?

551
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,496
- I'm on top of it.
- No, not so far, you're not.

552
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,499
I am. And I need you to trust me.

553
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,084
I do trust you. You know that.

554
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,169
Good. Now, listen to me.

555
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,339
It's very important that you keep acting
like everything's normal.

556
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,341
You're not gonna leave town.

557
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,678
You're gonna maintain your regular routine,
to the letter.

558
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:16,431
Do you understand? Alex?

559
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,851
Tell me you understand what I've said.

560
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:24,356
- I understand.
- Now go home like you always do.

561
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:29,778
Have a vodka tonic. Watch TV.
I'll call you as soon as I know more.

562
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,198
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

563
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,993
OK.

564
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,670
Right on schedule.

565
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,687
Detective Morgan, please?

566
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,067
- Morgan.
- Detective, it's Jordan Chase.

567
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,238
How can I help you?

568
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,866
My lawyer doesn't know
I'm making this call.

569
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:19,286
- OK.
- But those images you showed me,

570
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:25,542
I haven't been able to get them
out of my head. They're very disturbing.

571
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,087
They are.

572
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:33,217
I just want you to know, I've always
considered myself a friend of the police.

573
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:38,889
Well, uh, thank you, friend.
What... What is this about?

574
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:44,728
A strange call came into my office
from an Alex Tilden.

575
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,774
Alex Tilden called you?
What did he want?

576
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,817
I didn't speak to him myself,

577
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,987
but my secretary said
that he was looking for Cole Harmon.

578
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:57,324
She said he sounded panicked,

579
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,410
that he wanted to speak to Cole
about a flight he needed to arrange.

580
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,995
A flight to where?

581
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:07,960
That's all I know. It's not much, I realise,
but I hope it can be useful.

582
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:11,213
Thank you, Mr Chase.

583
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:20,555
Saddle up. It looks like
our fantasy footballer's leaving town.

584
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,446
No! No! Let me out of here!

585
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,865
No! No! No!

586
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,993
No! Stop! No!

587
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,579
Let me go!

588
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,456
Oh, my God.

589
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,088
Help!

590
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,857
Who are you?

591
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,372
What's that?

592
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,499
What... Aagh!

593
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,722
It's for her.

594
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,600
- Who?
- I think you know.

595
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,729
I mean, what's her name?

596
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,607
Now you want to know her name?

597
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,783
Look, you really have this all wrong.

598
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,118
Save it for her.

599
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:10,791
- What's the address?
- Alex Tilden, 3040. That's 3048.

600
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,459
Here it is.

601
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,588
And he's home.

602
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,991
I look different, don't I?

603
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,870
Without my hands tied behind my back.

604
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,876
But you recognise me.

605
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,586
I can tell.

606
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,388
- I ne... I never wanted to do any of it.
- Really?

607
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,932
It wasn't... It wasn't me.

608
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,144
It was Jordan. It's all Jordan.

609
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,479
You know...

610
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,522
He has this way.

611
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,902
Of getting inside your head, getting you
in touch with your primal nature?

612
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,570
He made me do things
I never would have done.

613
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:07,449
No, you made me do things

614
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,951
I never would have done. Ever.

615
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,120
Ever!

616
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,001
What do you people want?
I can give you Jordan Chase.

617
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:22,506
- We've got Jordan Chase.
- Well, what do you want?

618
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,591
Everybody wants something.

619
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,927
I mean, that's what brought us

620
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:30,555
to this fucking unfortunate situation.
Am I right?

621
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:36,228
I'm a banker. I can get money, lots of it.
We can work this out.

622
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:40,315
So, tell me, what's this gonna cost?
Just give me a number.

623
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,613
13.

624
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,741
No. I...

625
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,417
There's a first time for everything.

626
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,795
A first step. A first word.

627
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:05,048
A first kiss. A first kill.

628
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,009
Somehow you know when the time is right.

629
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,762
Aim for the heart.

630
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,346
Are you OK?

631
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:55,724
Yes.

632
00:48:56,726 --> 00:49:00,604
We should lock down the airports
in case he tries to flee.

633
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,564
He's not going anywhere.

634
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:08,445
Look at this. Looks like a partial footprint.

635
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,367
It looks small. Maybe a woman's.

636
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,289
And she was just here.

637
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,461
Remember at Boyd's house,

638
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:27,047
that fucking hair book,
it had 12 pieces in it?

639
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,841
But there are 13 DVDs.

640
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,136
One of them didn't get their hair taken.

641
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,930
So, what are you saying exactly?

642
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:39,017
Well, what if one of them
escaped somehow

643
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:43,480
and after everything they'd done,
they've come back to get even?

644
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:46,191
What if the vigilante is one of their victims?

645
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,792
Harry tried to mould me into the image
of the monster he thought I was.

646
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:18,098
He told me to flee human connection,
so that became a way of life for me.

647
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,654
But with Lumen...

648
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,867
...I'm someone different.

649
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,290
In her eyes...

650
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,338
...I'm not a monster at all.
