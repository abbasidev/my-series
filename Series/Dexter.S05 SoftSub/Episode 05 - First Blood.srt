1
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:11,594
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,513
- What'd you get?
- Two guys in their 30s.

3
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,684
Strong accents, possibly
recent immigrants from Venezuela.

4
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,353
Masuka found a match
on the print we had from the cigar butt -

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,105
Carlos Fuentes.

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,982
He's got a brother, Marco,
and I got the address.

7
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,819
Cut him, and I'll blow your fucking head off.

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,571
Medic! I need a fucking medic!

9
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:32,907
Don't you dare let him die.

10
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,910
I apologised. He accepted.

11
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,286
It's assault and battery.

12
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,707
Batista could not only lose his job,
he could serve time.

13
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,334
According to
Sergeant Lopez's deposition,

14
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:46,003
you give the best blowjob in Miami.

15
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,465
Do you recognise this man?

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,842
Jonah, is this Kyle Butler?

17
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,510
Back away! Back away!

18
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,971
You're on unpaid suspension
until further notice.

19
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,055
Suspension?

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,725
Just tell everyone you're
taking a few vacation days.

21
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,268
I don't want to be alone tonight.

22
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,562
I'm no good for you.

23
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,397
I'm not looking for good right now.

24
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,109
I just want to find out who that girl is
before the M99 wears off.

25
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,237
Lumen Ann Pierce.

26
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,532
- Why didn't you take me to the hospital?
- Because you saw me.

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,995
- I didn't see anything.
- We both know that's not true.

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,330
Every one of these barrels
has a body in it.

29
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,500
- Look at this.
- No.

30
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,711
This is what happened
to the girls before you.

31
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,713
This is what
was going to happen to you.

32
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,298
I saved your life.

33
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,052
I was locked up.
And I thought it would never stop.

34
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:38,097
But it has stopped.
He's dead. It's over.

35
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,266
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me.

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,103
There were others.

37
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,388
We all have something to hide,

38
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,267
some dark place inside us
we don't want the world to see.

39
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,439
So we pretend everything's OK...

40
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,067
wrapping ourselves in rainbows.

41
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,696
And maybe that's all for the best,

42
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,408
because some of these places
are darker than others.

43
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,702
- Whoo!
- Carefully.

44
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,664
I want to believe that smile.

45
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,208
That watching your mother die
hasn't changed you,

46
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,085
the way watching mine changed me.

47
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,880
Gently falling.

48
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,468
Sweetheart!

49
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,428
Sweetheart, what is it?

50
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,222
Oh! It's OK. It's OK!

51
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,434
He's got a scratch. Looks like someone
was playing a little rough.

52
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,228
That's a little too familiar.

53
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,855
- Let's get a Band-Aid on him.
- OK.

54
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,482
That's it for today!

55
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,610
But I use a scalpel.

56
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,612
All you have are your fingers.

57
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,240
Wiped clean. Not even a year old,
you're already destroying evidence.

58
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,704
And having to flee the scene of the crime.

59
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,831
Oh! It's OK.

60
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,233
Every time you see me,
you look disappointed,

61
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,402
like you were hoping
to find an empty table.

62
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,654
Guilty.

63
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,865
I still think you need
to consider my advice.

64
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,827
Leave town?

65
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,622
Go home to people who care about you.

66
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,499
I told you why I can't do that.

67
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,335
If you stay in Miami,
you'll never get past this.

68
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,631
If you had something
horrible happen to you,

69
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:44,218
could you just forget about it
and move on?

70
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,682
I would want to.

71
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,684
What if you couldn't?

72
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:03,696
If you really want to help me get past this,
help me find those guys and kill them.

73
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,118
I saw you kill Boyd.

74
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,661
You knew what you were doing.

75
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,746
Usual?

76
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,789
Thanks.

77
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,547
Going after those men
won't help you get past this.

78
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,257
It'll only make it worse.

79
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,509
How could it get worse?

80
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:29,722
It'll open up something inside you
you don't want to know is there.

81
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,057
Trust me.

82
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,684
Trust you?

83
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,811
I don't even know your last name.

84
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,813
The less you know about me,
the better.

85
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,691
- Better for who?
- For the both of us.

86
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,196
If you're not gonna help me,
why do you keep coming back here?

87
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,949
I'm trying to help you.

88
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,923
Minneapolis.

89
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,092
Yeah, I used some miles.

90
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,593
Wow.

91
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,139
You really want to get rid of me,
don't you?

92
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,687
I want you to get on with your life.

93
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,361
Lumen...

94
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,324
She took the ticket.

95
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,494
Maybe this is one problem
I can check off the list.

96
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,041
And maybe it'll snow this week.

97
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,090
Where's the fire?

98
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,384
Got to get my ass in gear,
or I'm gonna be late.

99
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,766
I could take that ass back to bed.

100
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,811
What part of "late" don't you understand?

101
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,024
I mean, at least let me
make you breakfast or something.

102
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,443
I have no time.
I've got to meet Batista at the hospital.

103
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,612
We're interviewing that kid
Fuentes sliced open.

104
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,531
Good luck with that.

105
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,535
"Good luck with that"? Fuentes has killed three people. I'm
running down leads,

106
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,996
and you're sitting around in your
boxer shorts watching TV all day.

107
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,957
Is that why you're, like, all,
"Let me get the fuck out of here."

108
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,168
- Cos I'm taking a few days off?
- Just drop it.

109
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,003
This wasn't even my call.

110
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,630
LaGuerta said I had too many days.
I had to use 'em or lose 'em.

111
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,716
- That's bullshit.
- No argument here.

112
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,303
I gotta go.

113
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,645
Quinn's my partner.
He should be here, not you. No offence.

114
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,647
What do you want me to do?
He put in for his time.

115
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,900
No, he told me he was forced
to take his leave.

116
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,736
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Exactly. So will you talk to LaGuerta...

117
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,904
- Shit.
- What?

118
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,448
- It's the mother. What is she doing?
- She's coming this way.

119
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,116
Fuck me so bad.
What am I supposed to say?

120
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,327
"I'm sorry. It's my fault your son
got his throat slit"?

121
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,953
No, let me do the talking.

122
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,050
De nada, de nada.

123
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,597
If it's OK with you, we'd like to ask
your son some questions.

124
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,855
- Sí.
- Yes.

125
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,149
Gracias.

126
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,324
- Jandro, how you feeling?
- ¿Cómo te sientes?

127
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,910
- Poquito mejor.
- A little better.

128
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,913
Bueno. We were wondering
if there's anything you can tell us

129
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,415
about the man who... injured you.

130
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,796
Uh...

131
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,682
He's seen him around,
but he didn't know who he was.

132
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,814
I asked if he had heard anything
about Fuentes around the neighbourhood.

133
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,900
Does he remember anything about that day,
anything Fuentes said or did?

134
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,110
Anything at all?

135
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,373
He doesn't remember anything else.
He was really scared.

136
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,459
Fuentes said he was going to kill him.

137
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,255
OK. Gracias.

138
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,301
Uh...

139
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,515
He had a mark on his hand.

140
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,642
- A small one.
- Like a tattoo?

141
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,644
Sí, como un tatuaje.

142
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,814
Can you draw it for us?

143
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,160
Lumen needs to stay away
from the darkness.

144
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,996
I, on the other hand,
always need names for my table,

145
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,083
and there are few people more deserving
than Boyd Fowler's accomplices.

146
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,544
Nothing in Boyd's arrest record
even hints he had help.

147
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,171
Zero to go on.

148
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,465
I'll have to look elsewhere.

149
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,719
Yours.

150
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,680
Thanks. You didn't have to do that.

151
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,517
No, it really is yours.
You left it on the hood of your car.

152
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,186
Oh.

153
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,812
My head's in 50 places.

154
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,357
Masuka didn't even begin
to keep up the caseload.

155
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,318
Well, good luck getting
the midget porn off your hard drive.

156
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,362
He might have shown it to me.

157
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,657
How was Mommy And Me?
Harrison break any hearts?

158
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,285
No, but he drew his first blood.

159
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,579
I think his little black book
still has a few blank pages.

160
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,332
- Well, not for long.
- He missed you this morning.

161
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,210
He's used to having his Aunt Deb
feed him his mango oatmeal.

162
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,087
Yeah, sorry.

163
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,214
You didn't come home last night.

164
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,343
No, it was late,
and I didn't want to wake you.

165
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,638
- I just crashed at a friend's house.
- Oh. What friend?

166
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,349
What, are you Mom now?

167
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,642
You want to do lunch?

168
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,977
I think I'm gonna be dining on backlog.

169
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,813
And paying a visit to Boyd's house.

170
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:15,401
Hm. All right, well,
I'll bring you something back. Bye.

171
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,245
Wait a second.

172
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,163
What?

173
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,750
Give me your opinion as a female.

174
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,795
- As a female?
- As a woman, you know?

175
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,256
McCourt.

176
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,801
- What about him?
- Do you find him attractive?

177
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,261
Do you?

178
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,973
I mean, would you ever?

179
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,226
I would rather put a campfire out
with my face.

180
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,062
OK?

181
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,480
I checked in with Cira.

182
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,732
She's gonna stay
on the ATM video surveillance

183
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,652
- while I track down the tattoo.
- Let me see that again.

184
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,197
See, it still looks like a UFO to me.

185
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,782
- Who the fuck knows, right?
- Yeah.

186
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,452
- We need to talk to an expert.
- An expert, huh?

187
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,744
Mm-hm.

188
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:18,213
The dragon lady represents
the dualities of my inner warrior.

189
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,966
Or your inner idiot.

190
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,262
Hey! If you can't muster up the appropriate respect, I'm
dropping the curtain.

191
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,264
When did you get this?

192
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,641
I've been adding to it over time,

193
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:33,896
but the main work started
about two years ago.

194
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,314
I was having a bit of a crisis,

195
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,566
and this was my way
of working through it.

196
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,861
- Viagra probably would have been cheaper.
- This was a crisis of the soul, Morgan.

197
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,779
Don't you have to have a soul
before it could be in crisis?

198
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:46,200
- Point is, you know a little about this world.
- I know a little.

199
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,578
The person you want to talk to
is my body artist, Michael Angelo.

200
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,165
- You're kidding. Michelangelo?
- Two words. Michael Angelo.

201
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,333
And, yes, I'm serious.

202
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,587
If your tattoo were done by anyone local,
Michael Angelo will know.

203
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,589
You can lower the curtain.

204
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:10,682
From the outside,
a normal home is indistinguishable

205
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,436
from the home of a monster
who puts women in barrels.

206
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,944
But step inside...

207
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:29,159
There must be something around here
that will point me to Boyd's accomplices.

208
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,124
Somebody's been here.

209
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,127
Oh, great.

210
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,921
Blood.

211
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,518
They were going through Boyd's files.

212
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,031
Whoever Boyd was working with
must have panicked,

213
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,325
tried to cover up any trace
of their existence.

214
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,371
Amateurs.

215
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:27,175
Here he is, freshly bathed,
clean as a whistle...

216
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,510
and ready for bed.

217
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,721
- Thanks.
- I'm gonna get going.

218
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,598
Cheque's on the counter.

219
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,434
Sonya, can I ask you a question?

220
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,311
Sure.

221
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:42,232
Have you ever noticed Harrison being... aggressive?

222
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,026
Aggressive?
What do you mean?

223
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,153
Scratching, stuff like that.

224
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,071
No.

225
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,657
He's a very gentle child, really.
Why?

226
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,910
There might have been an incident
at one of the Mommy And Me classes.

227
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,954
Can't be sure it was Harrison or not.

228
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,289
He's a little boy.

229
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,792
My little brother used to bite people.
Bloody little cannibal.

230
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,961
Now he's a vegetarian,
works for Greenpeace.

231
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,672
Well, that's comforting.

232
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,343
Not to worry.
You've got a little angel on your hands.

233
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,677
Nothing can change that.

234
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,680
- See you tomorrow morning.
- Night.

235
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,147
No match for Daddy
in the criminal database.

236
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,735
You're absolutely right. Maybe he drives.

237
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,487
Let's check the DMV.

238
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,868
Minnesota.

239
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,372
Lumen Ann Pierce.

240
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,959
She broke into Boyd's house.

241
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,254
She beat me to it.

242
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,012
Oh, my God.

243
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,443
Dexter, this seem like the product
of a stable mind?

244
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,700
A closet was the only place
she felt safe from them.

245
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,786
She's remade it here.

246
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,166
- Dexter, are you listening to me?
- Yes, I'm listening.

247
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,044
She's not a killer. She's not you.
She's coming undone.

248
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,801
What's that now?

249
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,388
This is the letter she took
from Boyd Fowler's house.

250
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,767
From his ex-cellmate, Robert Brunner.

251
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,854
"I'm getting paroled next week.
Need a place to 'sleap'."

252
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,773
S-L-E-A-P.

253
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,317
She's found a target.

254
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,402
You don't know what she's planning.

255
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,113
I know this isn't gonna end well.

256
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,616
She keeps going this way,
she's gonna get herself killed

257
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,535
or thrown in jail, and you're
gonna be right there with her.

258
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,246
Dex, she's gonna bring you down.

259
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,225
I know what you're doing.

260
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,605
- Having breakfast?
- You're looking for the men who hurt you.

261
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,690
So...

262
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,359
What, you're spying on me now?

263
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,612
What are you gonna do
if you actually find one of these guys?

264
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,532
Maybe...

265
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,409
- what you won't.
- Are you gonna kill them? Is that it?

266
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,578
I'm sorry.

267
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,289
You don't get to tell me what to do.

268
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,210
I asked for your help.
You turned me down.

269
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,295
For your own good.

270
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,800
Look...

271
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,928
You saved my life.
I'm grateful for that.

272
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,472
But what I need from you right now
is to leave me alone.

273
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,225
- Lumen...
- Don't touch me!

274
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:05,370
These men put five women in barrels.
They're not gonna want to be found.

275
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,038
Please...

276
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,833
stop this before it's too late.

277
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,767
She's not going to stop
until she finds Brunner.

278
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,238
- My favourite colour.
- Help you, Sergeant?

279
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,116
Morgan has been all over me
the last two days about Quinn.

280
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,828
- What about Quinn?
- The vacation he's being forced to take.

281
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,247
She's feeling shorthanded
without her partner.

282
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:53,668
- To tell you the truth, we need him.
- Well, it's the union.

283
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,211
Not my call.

284
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,464
That all?

285
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,676
Is there anything I need to know
about my case with IA?

286
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,888
Mm-mm.

287
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,351
Is there anything I need to know
about anything else?

288
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,566
I'm sorry, Angel, but I gotta go.

289
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,401
Sure.

290
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,819
I'll see you tonight?

291
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,947
Yeah... Um...
I might be late.

292
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,407
OK, so I'll let you know.

293
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,284
OK?

294
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,162
Hope you didn't have to dig too deep.

295
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,916
Only eight boxes, but I always remember
to lift with my back.

296
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,585
Well, here's the guy you asked for -
Robert Brunner.

297
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,505
- Nuh-uh-uh! Like we agreed.
- Right.

298
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,757
- Hm.
- There you go.

299
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,386
Aw. Oh! That face!

300
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,306
Abduction, torture, rape.

301
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,018
He's so big. Is he a year yet?

302
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,270
- Ten months.
- He's beautiful.

303
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,938
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

304
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:40,233
Seven years for sexual assault.
Out in three for good behaviour.

305
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,194
Mm. Good behaviour.
You ever seen scars like that?

306
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,779
Yes. On Lumen.

307
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,322
And he's out now.

308
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,158
Thank you, State of Florida.

309
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,535
Looks like she stumbled
on to the right guy.

310
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,121
It says he's living under Tuttle Bridge.
Is this current?

311
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,874
Mm-hm.
Sex offenders can't live anywhere near kids.

312
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,625
Tuttle's the only place they can go.

313
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,878
- Can I keep this?
- Well, that depends, now.

314
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,130
You gonna bring this little cutie by
to see me?

315
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,631
- Will do.
- OK.

316
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,553
Tuttle Bridge is the perfect place
for Brunner to hide in the dark,

317
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,057
but not from me.
I've got to get to him before she does.

318
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,145
Yo, what's up?

319
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,402
Tramp stamp.
I think I'm in love.

320
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,530
She's into needles.
Why don't you show her your dick?

321
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,533
That's disgusting.

322
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,827
You are so judgmental, Morgan.
I mean, come on.

323
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,455
We all have our own ways
of expressing ourselves.

324
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,291
I have my ink,
and you have your...

325
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,627
man-boots.

326
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:41,920
Yeah?

327
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,465
Well, expect my man-boots up your ass
if you're wasting my time, OK?

328
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,883
Vincent?

329
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,302
Now, what can I do you for?

330
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,765
- That's Michael Angelo?
- The one and only.

331
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,850
- M, how are you?
- Come here.

332
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,686
- Good to see you.
- Always good to see you.

333
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,856
M, this is the detective
I was telling you about - Detective Morgan.

334
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,860
- Enchantée.
- Right.

335
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,780
You mind taking a look
at something for us?

336
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,782
Any friend of Sugar's
is a friend of mine.

337
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,951
"Sugar"?

338
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,619
OK.

339
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,958
We interviewed this kid who saw this
on the hand of a suspect we're looking for.

340
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,376
Any idea what it means?

341
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,420
Crude, simplistic, but...

342
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,256
it's definitely an eye.

343
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,882
Look.

344
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,552
The similarity.

345
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,305
- See?
- And that would mean?

346
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,433
Eyes symbolise the third eye in our minds,

347
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,102
like the god Horus

348
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,645
and also...

349
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,274
just like...

350
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,443
the back of a dollar bill.

351
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,575
Hm.
Have you ever done something like this?

352
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,702
Well, if I had,
I would have remembered it.

353
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,329
Anything else you can tell us?
We're kinda desperate here.

354
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:02,167
Without it in front of me,
that's the best I can do.

355
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,335
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK.

356
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,088
M, thank you so much, anyways.

357
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,007
Always for you.

358
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,758
And you...

359
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,762
You come see me anytime, OK?

360
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,098
OK, thank you.

361
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,142
- OK.
- OK, bye.

362
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,643
Bye.

363
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,271
- I'll be in soon.
- Bye.

364
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,689
Hey, I think she likes you.

365
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,150
Don't ever speak about this.

366
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:31,946
Since we're already here, why don't you
get Quinn's name put on your...

367
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,282
- Hey, I have a gun.
- I'll just wait in the car.

368
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,451
OK.

369
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,584
- Hello?
- Cira, it's me.

370
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,879
- Any luck?
- Just a steaming pile of fuck-all.

371
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,172
Please tell me you have something.

372
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,467
I've gone through most of the bank's
ATM footage. Eight names and counting.

373
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,968
They're all freaking out about something

374
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,095
while they're withdrawing
maximum amounts from their accounts,

375
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,014
just like our first Santa Muerte vics.

376
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,893
I want addresses for all eight names
and any others you can find.

377
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:06,064
I'll pick you up on my way to work tomorrow,
and we'll check 'em out, OK?

378
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,281
Poor Julia Tuttle.

379
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,659
The Mother of Miami.

380
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,079
They named this bridge after her
in her honour.

381
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,874
Now it's crawling with paedophiles
and sex offenders.

382
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,213
So much for honour.

383
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:53,569
Japan's total area is slightly smaller than the US
State of Montana...

384
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,947
You mind if I watch?

385
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,993
The kid fuckers stay over by the tracks.

386
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,536
That's not why I'm here.

387
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,121
And why is that?

388
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:06,040
A stuck-up little co-ed and I
had a legal disagreement

389
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,793
concerning the meaning
of the word "consent".

390
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,755
Take a load off.

391
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,051
Appreciate it, brother.

392
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,932
Where'd you do your time?

393
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,060
Okeechobee.

394
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,939
My last stretch was in that shithole.
Rough place.

395
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,984
Yeah.

396
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,654
Told everyone I was in for armed robbery
to keep a target off my back.

397
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,118
- You from Miami?
- Used to be.

398
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,995
Guy I bunked with
lives down here now.

399
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,414
Thought I'd let him show me the town
and have some fun.

400
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,875
Did that fun include Lumen?

401
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,711
That is until my parole officer,
the cunt, started giving me shit

402
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,796
about staying with someone
from the joint.

403
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,467
- Wound up here.
- Hmm.

404
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,677
- Beats a cell.
- Barely.

405
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,930
Once my parole is done,
fuck Florida.

406
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,185
I'm going north.

407
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,270
Get me some of that farm-fresh pussy.

408
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,192
- You ever tap that?
- Can't say I have.

409
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,071
A couple weeks ago...

410
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:22,950
I had this hot, little blonde
on all fours.

411
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,952
A few of us did.

412
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,372
Believe me,
that bitch got every fucking inch

413
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,041
- of my motherfucking...
- That's enough.

414
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,090
This room was meant for Boyd,
not his cellmate.

415
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,175
They were co-workers, partners.

416
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,511
- Basically the same.
- You're sure?

417
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,805
I need to kill him...

418
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,392
so Lumen doesn't have to.
I don't want her down that road.

419
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,895
- Think about what you're doing.
- I am.

420
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,522
- He's a sex offender...
- I know.

421
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:53,689
...on parole.

422
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,443
- What are you saying?
- Think!

423
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,780
Are you listening?

424
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,414
OK.

425
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,083
He's wearing an ankle bracelet.
It couldn't have been him.

426
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,168
She had the wrong guy.

427
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:24,887
I was ready to kill him.

428
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,682
I was ready to kill him!

429
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,397
Robert Brunner isn't
one of the men who hurt her.

430
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:40,987
Harry's right.

431
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:44,157
I have to convince Lumen to do
what I never could -

432
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,284
to move on.

433
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,456
You're home early.

434
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,126
- Where's Sonya?
- I sent her home.

435
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,587
She said you were gonna
be working late.

436
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:01,299
- Hope you don't mind, I grabbed a beer.
- What's he doing here?

437
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,176
He wanted to...

438
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,761
borrow...

439
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,973
- a book.
- He reads?

440
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,603
- Yeah, he does.
- Here.

441
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,813
Thanks.

442
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,523
Little vacation reading.

443
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,609
Quinn was just leaving.

444
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,195
What she said.

445
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,450
I will call you in the morning, Joseph.

446
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:31,579
Oh. OK, Debra.

447
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,376
Kinda warm for gloves.

448
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,465
- Good night.
- Thanks for the book.

449
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,974
What was that about?

450
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,393
It's late, so I'll take the couch.

451
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,062
Are you and Quinn?

452
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,777
We're fuck buddies. That's it.

453
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,489
You need Quinn for that?

454
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,117
I know it's insane. I know it's...

455
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,787
wrong for a fuck-ton of reas...

456
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,289
Will you please stop looking
at me like that?

457
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,415
It's your life, Deb.

458
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,794
Just don't bring him around
when Harrison's here.

459
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,797
- What's that supposed to mean?
- He's at an impressionable age.

460
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:27,218
- We don't know what might rub off on him.
- What will rub off on him?

461
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,720
- Just keep Quinn away from my son.
- Fine.

462
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,931
You know, you're wrong about Quinn.
He's...

463
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,809
not that bad.

464
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,855
Hey.

465
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,983
Sorry. Long day.

466
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,361
Dinner's in the oven.

467
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,573
You mind if I, um, hop in the shower first?

468
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,248
You never called.

469
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,501
Yeah, I know.
I just lost track of time.

470
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,629
Why so late?

471
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,967
Budgets are due
at the end of the month, so...

472
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,136
I'm gonna...

473
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,097
- I'll set the table.
- Thanks.

474
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,472
She's not there.
You just missed her.

475
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,850
- Did my wife say where she was going?
- You two still not seeing eye to eye?

476
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,519
Look, I really need to find her.
It's important.

477
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,480
She was asking about Tuttle Bridge.

478
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:06,108
I told her that is the last place
she wants to be.

479
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,299
What the fuck, asshole?

480
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,968
Nice. Where you going, baby?

481
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,850
What are you doing?

482
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,605
- I'm taking you out of here.
- Give me the gun.

483
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,440
- No.
- Give it to me!

484
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,568
You have no idea
what those animals did to me.

485
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,736
Passing me around.

486
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,905
I couldn't move.
I couldn't stop them.

487
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,573
- It wasn't Brunner.
- It was.

488
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,325
He was Boyd's cellmate.

489
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,828
He raped three women!
He tortured them, just like he did to me.

490
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:24,663
- That's impossible.
- You weren't there!

491
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:25,873
Just listen to me.

492
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,459
He's wearing an ankle bracelet
as part of his parole.

493
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,420
If he leaves this place, it gets reported.
I checked.

494
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,298
He was here the whole time
you were taken.

495
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,763
Robert Brunner's never seen you before.
He's never touched you.

496
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,640
He never hurt you.

497
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,392
You were about to murder the wrong man.

498
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,565
Oh, fuck.

499
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,362
You see?
This is where it leads.

500
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,990
But it's not too late.
There's still no blood on your hands.

501
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,582
I just...
I just want to feel better.

502
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,835
I want all this to go away.

503
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,129
It will.

504
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,215
I don't see how it can.

505
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,843
Go home.

506
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,679
Back to your family.

507
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,348
If you don't put this behind you,

508
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,518
I swear what you're feeling now
will only get worse.

509
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,856
Oh...

510
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,487
OK. OK, OK, I'll go.

511
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,823
OK.

512
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,661
Next one on our ATM list.

513
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:49,707
0-for-fucking-5,
that's how I like to start my fucking day.

514
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:55,588
You want to make a bet why this one
was taking a wad of cash out of the ATM?

515
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,756
Gambling, hookers, drugs?

516
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,925
You're very cynical.

517
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,845
It's called being a detective.
And blow me.

518
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,806
You have to put positive energy
out into the universe.

519
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,768
Right. Blow you.

520
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,733
You smell that?

521
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,452
Holy shit.

522
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,209
- Little help here? Anytime you're ready.
- Yeah.

523
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,245
This is Detective Morgan
requesting CSI and body transport

524
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,916
at 2075 Ocean Way
for a possible double homicide.

525
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,463
And you need to tell Masuka and Dexter
that they need to bring a bug kit...

526
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,215
and some fucking crackers.

527
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,844
You good?

528
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,467
You son of a bitch.

529
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,928
- Angel!
- Sergeant, you're making a big mistake!

530
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,015
The only mistake I made was not kicking your ass when you
first laid eyes on my wife.

531
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,183
Angel, let him go! This is a sting!

532
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,187
Let him go!

533
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,401
- You're wearing a wire?
- No shit.

534
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,945
You idiot.
What would have happened

535
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,531
- if he barged in here a half-hour ago?
- I know.

536
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,784
Just give us a minute, Jim.

537
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,579
You just don't learn, do you, Batista?

538
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:39,960
Have you completely lost your mind?

539
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:42,337
- I thought...
- What? That I was fucking him?

540
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:46,091
What am I supposed to think?
You barely talk to me.

541
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,427
The late nights, the sneaking around.

542
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,972
How'd you find us?

543
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,308
Wait. You...

544
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,351
I don't even want to know.

545
00:39:56,478 --> 00:40:01,815
IA needed my help to bust a narcotics cop on the take, and
I
said yes.

546
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,444
Why?
To close the books on your bar fight!

547
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,781
So I don't want to hear about
sneaking around and late nights!

548
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,702
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you trust me?

549
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,579
Maria, I...

550
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,251
Morgan needs us on site -
double homicide.

551
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,338
- My car's outside.
- I'll ride with Patrol.

552
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,015
Fuck me.

553
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,601
Come on, Liddy.

554
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,445
Lieutenant, any comment?

555
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,489
- Not now.
- Lieutenant LaGuerta...

556
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,033
It's like the fucking
food chain in action in there.

557
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,119
Flies - the blowflies
are attracted by the smell

558
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,746
and they lay eggs, and the beetles,
they're drawn by the larvae,

559
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:59,498
- and they burrow into every orifice...
- I get it.

560
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,416
What do we know?

561
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,419
The vics' names
are Daniel and Awilda Ortiz.

562
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:08,507
ATM footage showed Daniel trying to make a maximum
withdrawal about 4 weeks ago.

563
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,261
Officer Manzon and I show up
to interview him, and we find the bodies.

564
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,179
The remains have already
started to mummify,

565
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,140
but the wounds are consistent
with a machete.

566
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,183
I can make sure
when I get them back to the lab.

567
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,103
- We like the Fuentes brothers for this.
- Only weird thing is,

568
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,273
we can't find any Santa Claus Muerte
mumbo jumbo bullshit.

569
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:27,818
We might be looking
at the Fuentes brothers' first victims.

570
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,446
The defensive wounds and heavy smearing
suggest our killers were still inexperienced.

571
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,031
Beheading requires skill.

572
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,909
So we got their goddamn
training wheels kill?

573
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,328
Means we're back to fucking square one.

574
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,956
A little downwind, please.

575
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,835
Oh, yeah. That's never coming out.
I liked this shirt, too.

576
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,837
I'll get a jacket out of my car.

577
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,755
All right.

578
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,819
It was never a tattoo.
It was a stamp...

579
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:12,446
from a nightclub.

580
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,407
It was a fucking nightclub!

581
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,536
It's a nightclub!

582
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:22,831
- What's gotten into her?
- Find out, Sergeant.

583
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,750
I'm gonna go deal with the press.

584
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,168
Nice to have you back, Dexter.

585
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,712
Good to be back, Lieutenant.

586
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,884
Reports on my desk, first thing.

587
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,305
Ah, all together once again.

588
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,767
One big happy family.
Eh, Dexerino?

589
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,534
Yeah.

590
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,132
- You don't have to wait.
- I don't mind.

591
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,762
I can pay you back for the ticket.
I'll send you some money.

592
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,223
Except...

593
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,267
I still don't know who to send it to.

594
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,356
Dexter Morgan.

595
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,859
And it's not necessary.

596
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,736
The ticket.

597
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,827
I came to Miami for a fresh start.

598
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,289
- Somewhere warm.
- You're doing the right thing.

599
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,624
Your parents will be...

600
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,793
happy to see you.

601
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,838
I tried to call them, but I...

602
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,339
I couldn't.

603
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,926
What would I say?

604
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,096
Just give it some time.

605
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,477
I can't tell them what happened to me.

606
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:11,565
I can't tell anyone.

607
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,694
You're the only one who knows.

608
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,785
You have my number.
Call me if you need to talk about it.

609
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,043
- I should...
- Oh, yeah.

610
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,381
Thank you.

611
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,435
You're welcome.

612
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:01,239
Go ahead, put it through.
And your bags.

613
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:10,290
Make sure everything's out of your pockets.
Jewellery, belts.

614
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,840
Step to the mat, ma'am.

615
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:21,635
- Is there a problem?
- I can't let you through to your gate

616
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,012
unless you consent to a hand search.

617
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,976
Lift your arms.

618
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,062
I need you to stay still.

619
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,067
Spread your legs.

620
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,794
- Are you home?
- Uh...

621
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,838
- Not quite.
- Are you at a bar?

622
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:43,049
I had to gas up the car.
My fault O'Malley's is on the way?

623
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,052
- So ask me how my day was.
- How was your day?

624
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,929
It was better than yours, slacker,

625
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:50,765
cos I know where Carlos and his brother
have been hanging out.

626
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,935
- At a local club called the Mayan.
- You got your lead. Congrats.

627
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,854
We stake this place out,
they show up,

628
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,482
then we take these Santa Muerte
no-dicks down for good.

629
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,484
How about I get steaks and beer
and we celebrate?

630
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:05,280
There's nothing to celebrate just yet,
but I have a good feeling about this one.

631
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,950
- Now get your ass moving, I'm starving.
- On my way.

632
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,204
Thanks for the Cuervo, Stud.

633
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,832
No problem.
I heard what happened.

634
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,420
Fuck those IA rats.

635
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:23,089
And your boss.

636
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,760
She's the reason I'm here.
Unpaid leave.

637
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:30,013
Why? For doing my fucking job.

638
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,682
That bitch put handcuffs on me,

639
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,061
then that no-nuts McCourt
parades me around that station

640
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,854
like I'm a goddamn carnival prize.

641
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,940
Well, they can both go fuck the dog.

642
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:43,068
They think I'm gonna cop a plea,
they're both cracking walnuts up their ass.

643
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:45,654
I'm gonna fight this thing
to my last damn dime.

644
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:50,158
You need some extra cash
for those lawyers...

645
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,538
- I might have a job for you.
- Really?

646
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,123
- What would that be?
- Looking into someone.

647
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,125
- Who?
- Guy I work with.

648
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,128
- Interested?
- I don't know if I should be,

649
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,506
considering who's sitting
in front of me making the offer.

650
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,217
What are you talking about?
Have I ever fucked you over?

651
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:11,054
No, but LaGuerta just taught me
there's always a first time.

652
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,639
Look, Quinn...

653
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,599
you fuck with the bull...

654
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,768
you get the horn.

655
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,938
- You understand?
- Yeah. Do you?

656
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,825
- You got a name?
- Dexter Morgan.

657
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,702
Dexter.

658
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,871
What the fuck kind of name is Dexter?

659
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,755
Rainbows are an illusion -

660
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,883
refracted light to make us think
something's there

661
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,510
when it's really not.

662
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,512
Is there darkness in Harrison?

663
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:56,641
Or is it just my own fear
being reflected back?

664
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:02,689
I just know he's the one who scratched Teddy. He was right
next to him.

665
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,317
Did you read about
what happened to his mother?

666
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,277
That boy will never be the same.

667
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,363
There's nothing wrong with my son.

668
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,707
I'm sorry for ever thinking
the worst, Harrison.

669
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:23,960
You'll always be my son.

670
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:27,505
Whatever we have to face,
we'll face together, OK?

671
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,967
Ow!

672
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:36,222
Hello, ma'am. Where you headed
this afternoon? You need a cab?

673
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,026
Welcome to Miami.
