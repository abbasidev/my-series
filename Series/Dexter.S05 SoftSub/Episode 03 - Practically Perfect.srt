1
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,721
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,392
My wife died and it was my fault.

3
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,478
Your dead wife can suck my dick.

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,400
That's the first human thing
I've seen you do since she died, Dexter.

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,404
I don't want to live with you.

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,364
I want to live with Grandma and Grandpa.

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,950
FBI? Fucking Bunch of Idiots.

8
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,868
We know you didn't
kill your wife.

9
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,454
We're just looking for a reason
why Arthur Mitchell might have targeted her.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,622
We all good here?

11
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,291
The only lead we have now
is this Kyle Butler.

12
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,669
It looks like Santa Muerte, the cult.

13
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,672
- Who are you?
- Officer Manzon, Cira.

14
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,716
We have sex one day, and then...

15
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,385
I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of person
who would ever have sex with you.

16
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,138
- OK, we had sex.
- Was it good sex?

17
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,098
I've said all I'm gonna say.

18
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:01,185
You're welcome to stay here for
as long as you want, whenever you want.

19
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,229
I heard the FBI interview went well.

20
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,565
They're looking for someone
named Kyle Butler.

21
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,317
He's a friend of Arthur Mitchell's.
They're having sketches done.

22
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:11,279
The Mitchell family
all gave very different versions.

23
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,864
Do you mind if I keep a copy of these?

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,284
You married Maria LaGuerta?
Such a fine piece of ass.

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,869
You fuck!

26
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,914
Boyd Fowler.

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,167
You're probably used to
seeing dead things though, huh?

28
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,002
Can't say I ever get used to it.

29
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,174
You want that nice house
on the beach.

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,216
Take it!

31
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,927
I can see having
an old girlfriend's lock of hair...

32
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,180
but identified by only a number?

33
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,848
I'm just trying to get to the truth.

34
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,641
However long that takes is up to you.

35
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,727
I'm telling you the truth.
I'm not lying.

36
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,979
First you said you didn't do drugs,
and then you said you did.

37
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,982
I said I might have tried some
at a Tri Delt party once.

38
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,735
You might have?
What the fuck does that even mean?

39
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,154
You did or you didn't.
You can't kind of do blow.

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,948
But that was six years ago in college.

41
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,825
And I'm supposed to believe
you're not on anything now?

42
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,202
- I'm totally clean.
- Then why are you so nervous?

43
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,122
Because I wasn't expecting
on getting these kinds of questions.

44
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,207
I mean, you sound like a cop.

45
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,961
I am a cop.
I work for Miami Metro Homicide.

46
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,756
Look, I don't know what's going on here.

47
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,716
I came for a nanny job.

48
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,303
I'm not, like,
planning to kill the president.

49
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,265
Harrison needs a nanny
and Deb insisted on running point.

50
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,144
The way it's going,
only Mary Poppins would make the cut.

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,857
I don't care what doctors say. I think it's
important for children to eat a lot of cheese.

52
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,654
Well, if a child's choking,

53
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,365
I just do what my mama always did.

54
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,241
You get ahold of it by the legs

55
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,744
and you give it a little knuckle-slap.

56
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,375
No, I've never had martial-arts training,

57
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,543
but I can scream real loud.

58
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:02,969
I have a nursing degree

59
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,973
with an emphasis
on infant-toddler growth and development.

60
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,432
Why not work at a hospital?

61
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,018
Well, I did,
but there were budget cuts,

62
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,979
and my ward was downsized.

63
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,398
I live alone.
I don't need a big salary.

64
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,859
So a nanny position would work
very well for me.

65
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,533
He's tired.

66
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,785
May I?

67
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,331
- I don't bite.
- OK.

68
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,958
Hi.

69
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,668
Oh.

70
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,921
What a little prince you are.

71
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,632
Mmm.

72
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,137
♪ Bye, baby Bunting

73
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,348
♪ Daddy's gone a-hunting

74
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,894
♪ Gone to find a rabbit skin

75
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,939
♪ To wrap the baby Bunting in ♪

76
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,819
And then there was Sonya.
Practically perfect in every way.

77
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,864
Well, you have my number.
I'll look forward to your call.

78
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,741
Again, my condolences for your loss.

79
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,617
Thanks. We'll be in touch.

80
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,036
Bye, prince Harry.

81
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,750
She's the one.

82
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,169
Are you sure you don't want
to keep looking, Dex?

83
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,838
I just don't want to lose her.

84
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,965
Prince Harry likes her.

85
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,552
- Ditto me.
- Then call her.

86
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,474
Don't forget, you and Harrison...

87
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,392
Crisis counsellor.
I won't forget.

88
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,811
Love you, bro.

89
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,692
Me too.

90
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,871
Emptiness wasn't always a problem.

91
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,248
I used to cherish it.

92
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,126
But now it feels like
something to overcome.

93
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,964
Emptiness is all she has left.

94
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,763
Boyd Fowler. Department of Sanitation.

95
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,890
Division of Dead Animal Pickup.

96
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,354
Hobbies - self-improνement
and storing women in formaldehyde.

97
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,607
I don't know if killing you
will fill the void,

98
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,984
but it's a place to start.

99
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,284
- What's this?
- ATM surveillance video.

100
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,121
The bank sent it over.
This is our shotgun guy.

101
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,705
- Francisco Alfaro?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,833
It's what he looked like
when he had a face.

103
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,835
When was this taken?

104
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,046
Two hours before he killed his wife
and blew his own head off.

105
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,965
Trying to get cash,

106
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,217
but he keeps putting in
the wrong PIN number.

107
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,762
- 0371. His wife's birthday.
- Ouch.

108
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,931
Good thing she's dead.

109
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,433
He never would have
lived that down.

110
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,646
What the hell happened to you guys?

111
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,523
Battle scars.

112
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,694
We had to get ghetto on some dirt-bag
at the club last night.

113
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,488
- You guys got in a bar fight?
- It's not worth talking about.

114
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,740
True warriors are humble men.

115
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,326
Oh, please.
You got a reason to be humble.

116
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,829
You got fucked up
running the other way.

117
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,373
You're confusing cowardice
with a tactical retreat.

118
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,457
Hermano, back me up here.

119
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,877
You backed up just fine on your own.

120
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,004
OK, let's focus on the case, people.

121
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,507
- Remember why we're getting paid.
- OK. I'll go first.

122
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,801
Guy offs his wife,
wants to skip the country.

123
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,929
Needs cash, but he's so wigged out,
he can't remember the PIN.

124
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,764
Gives up, goes home, kills himself.

125
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:40,060
Only problem with that theory is
Alfaro doesn't have a motive to kill his wife.

126
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,104
- Maybe he's just sick of her.
- Oh, yeah, he got sick of her?

127
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,898
Got sick of her,
so he cut off her head

128
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,066
and put it in a park
and put candles all around it?

129
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,361
Yeah. Have you watched the video?
Cos he's a little fucking crazy.

130
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,947
Crazy does not explain why he doesn't
have a drop of blood on his clothes.

131
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,324
Why don't you think
about that for a second?

132
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,826
How do you cut somebody's head off
and not get a drop of blood on you?

133
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,036
What'd he do? Wear a bib?

134
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,831
As much fun as this is,
we're not gonna hash this out in the room.

135
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,791
I would like to re-canvass
the neighbourhood

136
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,668
where Mrs Alfaro's body was found.

137
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,838
There are a lot of houses facing that park.
Somebody's bound to talk.

138
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,633
- Start today.
- And I think Batista should be there.

139
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,594
Hispanic neighbourhood.
Hispanic cop.

140
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,471
Might raise the comfort level,
loosen tongues.

141
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,765
I get it. OK.

142
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,018
The rest of you, stay with the case.
Work your leads.

143
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,562
- Thanks.
- Beautiful.

144
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,357
Angel?

145
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,776
Just how big was this fight?

146
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,862
Like I told you this morning,
it was a disagreement that got out of hand.

147
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,156
Too much booze.
Too much testosterone.

148
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,532
Espérate.

149
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,284
Uh...

150
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,122
You punched another cop.
I mean, qué pasó?

151
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,042
- What started it?
- We hashed it out.

152
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,794
Hombre a hombre.

153
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,129
It's settled.

154
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,886
Pretty sure his appetite's
about the same.

155
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,973
He's always been
kind of a messy eater.

156
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,599
It's hard to tell.

157
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,269
- His sleeping pattern?
- Same.

158
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,023
Unfortunately, he cries
about three times a night,

159
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,068
on a good night.

160
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:15,072
So you're not surprised
that he's acting pretty much normal?

161
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,907
No.

162
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,035
You and Harrison suffered
a terrible tragedy.

163
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,912
It's no getting around that,

164
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,707
but there is something
to be thankful for.

165
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,167
- Thankful?
- Yes.

166
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:32,548
Harrison's cognitive abilities
are really just developing.

167
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,845
So you're saying he might not be
affected by what he saw?

168
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,264
There's just simply no chance
that he was able

169
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,182
to comprehend what was happening.

170
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,815
I saw something pretty traumatic
when I was three.

171
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,068
Harrison's only ten months.

172
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,196
It affected me a lot.

173
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,160
You don't have any idea.

174
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,829
I've seen a lot of children.

175
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,248
We'll keep an eye on Harrison, but...

176
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,710
I really think your son
is gonna be perfectly fine.

177
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,843
Ooh.

178
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,888
He wants his head back.

179
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,057
Ahh.

180
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,184
Children Harrison's age can exhibit

181
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,354
what might seem like violent behaviour,

182
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,272
but they're just releasing energy.

183
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,566
It's important not to read into it.

184
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,818
I'll try not to.

185
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,156
The most important thing
you can do right now,

186
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,325
is take care of yourself.

187
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,952
Find some time
to release your own energy.

188
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,830
Do something for Dexter.

189
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,293
Dexter will.

190
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,006
I have nothing to say.
I didn't see no one.

191
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,843
Well, if you remember anything,
or if you hear anything...

192
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,472
Yes, mm-hm. I call you.
Córrele, mi hija.

193
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,267
We're never gonna hear from her.

194
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,770
All this no talking
is fucking frustrating.

195
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,230
Yeah.

196
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,190
You know what's frustrating?

197
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,943
Nine days, 13 hours.

198
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,487
- What?
- Since we, you know?

199
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,030
- Just...
- You're counting?

200
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,116
I can't help it.
I have an internal clock.

201
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,159
Well, unplug it.

202
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,121
I'm just saying, at this point,
we might as well be married.

203
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,124
Shit on my face.
You ever use words like "we" and "married"

204
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,042
in the same fucking sentence again...

205
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,504
Another case of temporary blindness.
Anything?

206
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,423
These people are all afraid of something.

207
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,341
Yeah, I'm getting that too.

208
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,801
Maybe they just
don't want to get involved.

209
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,177
No, I think it's more than that.

210
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,012
If the killer's dead, what are they afraid of?

211
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,431
I thought I could make some headway,

212
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,225
but the reality is,
this is a Venezuelan neighbourhood.

213
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,935
- So?
- I'm Cuban.

214
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,106
- Officer Manzon's from this neighbourhood.
- Manzon?

215
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,191
She's a uniform,
but she might be worth bringing in.

216
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,235
She thinks these are
about religious murders.

217
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,279
"Santa Mierda."

218
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,405
Ha!

219
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,699
That's Santa Muerte.

220
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,618
It's "Saint Death",
not "Saint Shit".

221
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,415
And Manzon might be onto something.
Might explain why no one's talking.

222
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,292
Shut up.

223
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,356
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Dexter.

224
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,399
Hi.

225
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,735
Yeah, I don't know if I mentioned,
but for his nap,

226
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:43,780
Harrison likes the puppy blanket
just touching his face.

227
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,574
It's on your checklist.

228
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,286
Uh, item eight
under "sleep preferences".

229
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,539
OK, good. How's he doing?

230
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,083
We just read
The Very Hungry Caterpillar,

231
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,002
for the seventh time.

232
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,964
Don't worry. He usually gets sick of it
around the 20th read.

233
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,345
I gotta go.

234
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,432
Yeah, you call me
if there's anything.

235
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,726
Thought he'd never spot me.

236
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,400
Some coinkidink, huh?

237
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,152
You find any more dead animals?

238
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,988
Looks like you're working on something.

239
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,074
Tastes a lot better than it looks.

240
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,410
Have a seat.

241
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,668
- Boyd Fowler.
- Daryl Tucker.

242
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,256
You work around here?

243
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,466
I just love the arabica.

244
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,765
Actually, I'm between jobs.
Hence the want ads.

245
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,770
- What kind of work you looking for?
- Oh, not choosy.

246
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,606
Whatever pays
and gets me out of the house.

247
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,111
- You like what you do?
- I love it.

248
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,073
Probably wouldn't think so,
driving around, picking up dead animals.

249
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,201
Ah, beats working in a cubicle.

250
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,537
You get out in the fresh air.

251
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,706
Well, I guess most of the time it's fresh.

252
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,126
It's not boring.

253
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,670
Never know what's
around the next bend.

254
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,797
Full of surprises.

255
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,011
You know...

256
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,555
If you're interested,
we might have an opening at animal pickup.

257
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:35,434
- Really?
- Yeah, there ain't exactly a line either.

258
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,105
You should take a ride with me.
See if you like it.

259
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,317
You got to be OK
around dead things though.

260
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,612
I don't think that's a problem.

261
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,447
Great.

262
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,906
Tomorrow morning, eight sharp.

263
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:53,493
I would have settled
for your work schedule,

264
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,704
but this could be better.

265
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,957
Only 24 hours to get ready.

266
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,461
Boyd's patrol route.

267
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,839
Need to find a place
where we can spend some quality time.

268
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,676
There.

269
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,271
An old tourist welcome centre.

270
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,817
Not very welcoming now.

271
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,376
Totally isolated.

272
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,754
Thank you, City of Miami.

273
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,340
You're gonna kill him in daylight?

274
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,175
Doesn't matter out this far.

275
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,345
It's still very risky.
What if someone comes by?

276
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,598
That could also happen at night.

277
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,267
But it's a lot less likely.

278
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,854
You have to do this right, Dexter.

279
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,940
It's important.

280
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,566
It's your first kill since...

281
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,610
You don't have to tell me
how much I need this.

282
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,821
That's the problem.

283
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:11,905
What?

284
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,990
This kill won't put everything right.

285
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,284
It won't bring Rita back.

286
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,328
It might bring me back.

287
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,956
If you make it mean so much,
you'll only invite mistakes.

288
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,792
I won't make any mistakes.
I'm following the code.

289
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,627
Are you gonna help me or not?

290
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,713
I only want to help you, Dex.

291
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,134
This is a big room.

292
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,261
I hope you brought enough plastic.

293
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,601
It feels good
getting the details right.

294
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,773
It's more than just
preparing a kill room.

295
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,171
It's like I'm putting
my life back in order.

296
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,636
And it's almost enough.

297
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,017
Almost.

298
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,606
If anyone knows
about these murders, it's Fauzi.

299
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,983
He knows everybody
in this neighbourhood.

300
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,279
You really grew up around here?

301
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,198
You make it sound
like a disability.

302
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,493
I'm asking a question.
I'm not about to burn a cross.

303
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,039
I used to ride my bike around this block.
There was this mean dog that lived there.

304
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,708
I mean, I used to pray to Saint Anthony
to make me invisible.

305
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,959
I never got bit.

306
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,045
You think prayer was the reason?

307
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,087
Yeah.

308
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,632
That and some
homemade pepper spray.

309
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,063
¿Podemos hablar con Fauzi?

310
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,189
¿Por qué razón?

311
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,942
Policía. Es importante. Por favor.

312
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,778
Un momento.

313
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,660
I was surprised you called.

314
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,287
Thought you didn't believe
what I said at the crime scene.

315
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,248
Who says I do?

316
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,542
At this point,
I can't rule anything out.

317
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,961
Well, bringing me in
was the best move, Detective.

318
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,088
You won't be sorry.

319
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,401
Me llamo Manzon. Es el Detective Morgan.

320
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,697
Ask him if he's heard
of the deaths of Mr and Mrs Alfaro.

321
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,037
Sí. Qué cosa tan terrible.

322
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,666
This was found
at the crime scene.

323
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:12,752
Did he sell it to Mr Alfaro?

324
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,058
He says Alfaro was a strict Catholic.

325
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,519
Came into the store now and then
to buy some things,

326
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,479
but he wouldn't have been
caught dead back here.

327
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:33,106
Did he sell it to anyone else?

328
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,533
He says he doesn't keep track
of who buys what,

329
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,577
and he doesn't even believe in this shit.

330
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,621
Is that why he has the tattoo?

331
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:52,000
I got drunk one night,
woke up, it was there.

332
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,710
You tell me.

333
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,883
- ¿Te llamas Manzon?
- Sí. Cira.

334
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,843
Ah, coño.

335
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,511
Eres la hija de Andrés.

336
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,347
Hey, hey. We're doing great in English.

337
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:09,476
You live in Miami.
Why you no learn Spanish?

338
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,938
Because me too busy
making a living.

339
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,191
Is there anything else
you can tell us?

340
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,610
Anything that will help us
with this case?

341
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,570
Yo no sé nada.

342
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,325
Fauzi's holding back.

343
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,993
I should have talked
to him by myself.

344
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,120
Might have been in a more sharing mood
with someone he knows.

345
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,538
Oh, yeah?
Maybe he would have said nothing,

346
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,707
like everyone else
in this neighbourhood.

347
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,420
Hey, I know you're up against it,

348
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,673
but you might just want
to take a breath.

349
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,262
Why don't we give him the night
to stew over this

350
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,807
and then you come
visit him tomorrow alone?

351
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,850
Fine.

352
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:16,793
Sonya?

353
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,382
Where are they?

354
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,762
Hi, this is Sonya.
Leave a message.

355
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,639
Yeah, it's Dexter.
I just got back and you're not here,

356
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,392
and not answering your cell.
Call me now.

357
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,895
Can't help but think the worst.
Harrison's been stolen.

358
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,940
I shouldn't have left him
with a stranger.

359
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,109
Rita would have never allowed it.

360
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,157
Hi. Finally fallen asleep.

361
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,745
Where were you?

362
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,748
Well, he was keyed up after
his Yo Gabba Gabba! Videos.

363
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,833
I thought some fresh air
would make him drowsy.

364
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,252
It worked.

365
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,380
- You didn't answer your cell.
- Well, I had my hands full.

366
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:07,302
Oh, I left a note on the fridge.

367
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,180
Oh, I didn't mean to worry you.

368
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,432
No, it's fine. I'm just...

369
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,894
I'm not used to checking
the fridge for notes.

370
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,438
Just messages
from other serial killers.

371
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,443
- Oh, I feel terrible.
- Don't. You were just doing your job.

372
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,113
Hey, I'm lucky to have you.

373
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,573
We both are.

374
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,085
Oh! A little courtesy, please.

375
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,254
Thanks.

376
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,926
You hitting the club tonight?

377
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,762
No. Home.

378
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,099
Oh, good. Cos I won't be there
to watch your back.

379
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,476
There could be wingmen out there
looking to settle the score.

380
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,686
Just drop it.

381
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:02,315
With all due respect,
this man is a knight in shining armour.

382
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,776
You should be polishing his lance.

383
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,694
Excuse me?

384
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,074
I meant that metaphorically.

385
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,244
Not... how it sounded.

386
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,207
Good night.

387
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:29,884
OK, I want to know exactly
what happened at the bar.

388
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,888
I told you it's settled, tesoro.

389
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,310
I'm not asking as your wife.

390
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,982
Vince and I were having drinks,
keeping to ourselves.

391
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,526
And then out of the blue,
Sergeant Lopez starts talking shit.

392
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,195
- What shit?
- You know... shit.

393
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,240
- He was out of line.
- Specifics.

394
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,957
He asked if you and I were married.

395
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,377
Then he said you were
a fine piece of ass.

396
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,090
- And you were my sugar mama.
- Sugar mama?

397
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,051
Yeah, cos you're my boss
and your paycheck has more zeros.

398
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,512
- Does that really bother you?
- A little.

399
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,015
Do you know any guys
it wouldn't bother?

400
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,851
- So you hit him?
- No, there's more.

401
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,562
- More?
- You wanted to know everything.

402
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,109
He then said you gave
the best blowjobs in Miami.

403
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,074
And then I hit him.

404
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,202
And he's lucky that's all I did.

405
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:49,214
Angel, I'm a woman
in a position of power.

406
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,883
Some men have trouble
dealing with that,

407
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:55,220
- so they spread garbage around.
- I know. I know.

408
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,557
And I'm trying to work through it.

409
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,146
Could you work through it
without the bar fights?

410
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,066
I'll keep the bar fights
at a minimum.

411
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,407
He sleeping?

412
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,534
Like a baby.

413
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,123
How was work?

414
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,876
Dire.

415
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,796
I've been saddled with this uniform
on a homicide case,

416
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,590
and she's driving me
ape-ass crazy.

417
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,596
- How's the nanny?
- Aside from a little message hiccup...

418
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:42,392
It was totally my fault.
She did great.

419
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,602
I wonder why she left Ireland.

420
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,356
- Maybe she's running from something.
- I don't know, Deb.

421
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,358
Maybe you better check Interpol.

422
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,154
What about you?
What'd you do today?

423
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:58,074
Not much. Cody called.

424
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,869
He wanted me to send
my recipe for pancakes.

425
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,914
How are they?

426
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,375
Cody sounds...

427
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,377
happier.

428
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,380
Astor wouldn't come to the phone.

429
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,842
She'll come around, Dex.

430
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,638
Well, other than that,
I ran some errands.

431
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,889
That's good.

432
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,143
Get back in your routine.

433
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,895
When you lose someone close,
routine can be a ladder

434
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,732
that can help you climb back
into some kind of normalcy.

435
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:39,282
- Where'd you hear that?
- I am capable of independent thought.

436
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,078
Oprah.

437
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,414
I watched her
when I was laid up.

438
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,249
That's good.

439
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,002
Keep getting better, Dex.

440
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,713
I'll try.

441
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,927
Yeah, I'd like to report
a dead animal.

442
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,140
Uh, County Road five,
mile marker 31.

443
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,686
I'm not sure.
I think it was a gator.

444
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,813
It was long and scaly.

445
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,983
Yeah. Thank you.

446
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:20,073
It's on Boyd's circuit,
so he'll get the call.

447
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,824
When he does,
Boyd will take a little nap

448
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,744
and wake up
in the tourist welcome centre.

449
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,413
But he won't be collecting
any brochures.

450
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,085
Wasn't sure you'd be here.

451
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,753
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

452
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,797
Hey, I'm a safety guy.

453
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,591
Right.

454
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,511
Never be too safe.

455
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:46,307
- Where we off to first?
- Dead cat on Lindgren. Boring.

456
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,101
Pretty neighbourhood though.

457
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:52,271
Lot of trophy wives
out jogging at this hour.

458
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,148
There's a bonus.

459
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,485
You have to embrace the now.
Every second you waste

460
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,405
is one more second
you'll never get back.

461
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:01,823
Ever hear this guy?

462
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,783
When I was searching your house.

463
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,328
Changed my life.
Really helped me see what's important.

464
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,331
Do the same for you.

465
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,583
Ease you through that divorce.

466
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,253
Divorce?

467
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,462
Ring dent.

468
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,341
I didn't want Boyd
to know that part of my life.

469
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,885
For a roadkill janitor,
he doesn't miss much.

470
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,887
Hope it's not a touchy subject.

471
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,890
No, it just didn't work out.

472
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,269
If you need help moving on,
listen to these CDs.

473
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,981
- Take it.
- Take it now.

474
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,108
That's the main idea.

475
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:40,862
- Take it now?
- There's more to it than that,

476
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,864
but it really makes a difference.

477
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,618
Of course, you got to know
what it is you want to take.

478
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,289
What is it you want, Daryl?

479
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,420
That's kind of
a hard question to answer.

480
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,172
Yes, it is.

481
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:02,884
But I really think it's what
we're on this earth to find out.

482
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,868
Justin Bieber.

483
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,831
Not that I know who that is.

484
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,173
I know who purchased
the Santa Muerte icons,

485
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,217
and it wasn't our dead husband.

486
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,636
- Fauzi talked?
- I was right. He was holding back.

487
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,597
- What'd you get?
- No names, but a description.

488
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,766
Two guys in their 30s,
strong accents,

489
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,268
possibly recent immigrants
from Venezuela.

490
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,187
Criminal types.
Those were his words.

491
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,105
And big into Santa Muerte.

492
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,778
What if Alfaro isn't freaked out
because he just murdered his wife?

493
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,657
What if he's freaked out
because someone's got his wife?

494
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,700
And they'll kill her
unless he pays cash.

495
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,869
This isn't drug related.

496
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,664
Maybe she was fucking
held hostage for ransom.

497
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,958
You think Fauzi spilled
everything he knows?

498
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,335
He's been asking around.
Thinks he can dig up some more.

499
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,712
Well, let's fucking find out.

500
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,007
Sometimes it gets so hot,

501
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,469
these things actually start frying.
And you got to...

502
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,764
you got to scrape 'em off
like diner food.

503
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,267
Two hours
and no call about my gator.

504
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,019
They must have sent someone else.

505
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,981
God almighty.
That stink gets in your soul.

506
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,441
Which means this kill is dead.

507
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,944
Man, you got a nose of steel.

508
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,029
You're made for this job.

509
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,116
Now I'm stuck with Boyd.

510
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,955
So much for getting my life back.

511
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,299
It's almost lunch time.

512
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,217
I usually eat at home by myself,

513
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,137
but there's a Chinese place
not too far.

514
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,222
Hang on.

515
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,643
Boyd.

516
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,021
Maybe the universe
is showing mercy on me.

517
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,897
What's the location?

518
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,943
- I'm on it.
- What's up?

519
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,362
Dead gator out on County five.

520
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,406
First promising thing all day.

521
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,783
But if you're starving,
we can push it till after lunch.

522
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,910
- I'm good.
- Then let's rumble.

523
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,793
Gator runs can be hairy.
You got to be on your toes.

524
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,673
- Hairy how?
- Can't always tell if they're really dead.

525
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,093
- Yikes.
- Don't worry. Like I said...

526
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,387
I'm a safety guy.

527
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,933
Must be at lunch.

528
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:20,623
Hello?

529
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,256
Shit.

530
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,426
Detective.

531
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:36,430
Call it in.

532
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,183
Do it.

533
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,352
This is Officer Manzon.

534
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,836
Mile marker should be
right around here.

535
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,548
Be careful.
Sucker could be anywhere.

536
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,675
You really don't want to step on it.

537
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,719
Finally...

538
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:18,889
it's right.

539
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,775
Shit.

540
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:51,797
Where am I?

541
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,425
On your way to County Medical.

542
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,720
- You know what city you're in?
- Miami.

543
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,847
What day is it?

544
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,475
Wednesday.
What happened to me?

545
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:06,562
A motorist spotted you
lying on the side of the road, called 911.

546
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:10,483
Seems this guy
shot you with a tranq dart.

547
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,651
Boys have an argument
or something?

548
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,238
No. No.

549
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,824
Went off by accident.

550
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,952
Crazy asshole, you were
supposed to shoot the gator.

551
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:26,499
You got in my way,
you fucking numbskull.

552
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,252
So what's your excuse?
Why were you unconscious?

553
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,379
They must not have found
my needle.

554
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,802
I guess I was just so upset
that I passed out.

555
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,720
There's one piece of good luck.

556
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,680
I really need to get back to my truck.

557
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,391
Yeah, sorry. I can't let you jump
out of a moving ambulance.

558
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,394
We'll be there soon.
Need to get you both checked over.

559
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,738
Got him.

560
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,617
Dropping it.

561
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,245
Let's go.

562
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,163
Let's go on three.

563
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,794
Trauma two.

564
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,441
Chart.

565
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,527
I'm Dr Lorre.

566
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,697
I understand you suffered
a loss of consciousness.

567
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,867
- That's what I'm told.
- That ever happen before?

568
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,952
Um... First time.

569
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,288
You have any history
of headaches, dizziness,

570
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,914
- blurred vision?
- Uh-uh.

571
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,584
- Hypoglycaemia?
- Not that I know of.

572
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,712
OK. We're gonna run a chem profile

573
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,798
and check your glucose levels
for possible dehydration.

574
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:01,552
We'll follow up with a tox screen.
See if anything's in your system.

575
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,681
I'll be right back to draw your blood.
Just lie still.

576
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,152
He's in there, OK.

577
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,655
Just give him aspirin.
No painkillers.

578
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,573
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I didn't know about his addiction.

579
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,618
Well, you got to check
the patient's records here, he's...

580
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,579
Fifth time he's been in the ER this year.
This is his fifth accident.

581
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,706
- It won't happen again.
- All right.

582
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,135
Another head?

583
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,055
And I was in such a good mood.

584
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,437
It's my fault. I got him killed.

585
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,148
Fuck that.
You didn't cut his head off.

586
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,485
They did this because
he started talking to me.

587
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,614
If I hadn't come back here,
Fauzi would still be alive.

588
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,241
It was my call.

589
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,034
We're in this together.

590
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,954
And we're closer to catching him
because of you, OK?

591
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,081
You did good.

592
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,291
Looks like...

593
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:59,962
the same treatment
as our other... head case.

594
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,718
Eyes and tongue
have been excised.

595
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,137
Damn, don't people just shoot
each other any more?

596
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,850
Excuse me a sec.

597
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,479
Hey, thanks for calling me back.

598
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,024
No prob.
Sorry it took so long.

599
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,900
We're up to our necks
on this Trinity thing.

600
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,528
Yeah, that's what I want
to talk to you about.

601
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,447
I think I may have a lead on Kyle Butler.

602
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:27,948
Kyle Butler?

603
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,576
Yeah, you know, the guy who was
hanging around with Arthur Mitchell?

604
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,785
Yeah, I know who he is.

605
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,954
Just didn't know you people
were working this.

606
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,707
I'm sort of, uh...
flying off the record.

607
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,125
Listen.

608
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,461
Is there any chance I could talk
to the Mitchell family?

609
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,422
The Mitchells are in a safe house.
First stop before witness protection.

610
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,883
Just want to show them a photo.
Take five minutes.

611
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,136
Give me the photo.
I'll show it to them.

612
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,805
Ah, it's too sensitive.

613
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,516
If I'm wrong,
it could mean my ass.

614
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,896
Come on...
Ray, as a friend.

615
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,400
- I'll see what I can do, but no promises.
- Thanks.

616
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,152
Let me know.

617
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,585
Take it.

618
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,420
- Now, before you can take anything...
- What the fuck?

619
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:08,048
...you have to know what it is you want.

620
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:11,051
May sound easy,
but you can't know what you want

621
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,678
unless you know yourself.

622
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:16,098
But if you want something,
there's only one option.

623
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,266
Take it.

624
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,020
You want that promotion?
Well, then, take it.

625
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,815
You want that new car,
that house?

626
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,608
Take it.

627
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,698
That could have gone smoother.

628
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,828
Could have also gone worse.

629
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,038
Least he's down.

630
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,051
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Dexter.

631
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,179
Wanted to tell you that I'm gonna be

632
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:56,889
- a little later than I expected.
- It's no problem.

633
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,891
My sister should
be there any minute though.

634
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,351
Actually, she phoned too.
She's tied up at work.

635
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,519
Oh.

636
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,563
It's OK. I don't mind staying late.

637
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,107
I... I like watching him sleep.

638
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,358
You're a lifesaver.

639
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,985
I was gonna call you.

640
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,320
Is everything OK?

641
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,322
He took his first step.

642
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,908
At least I think it was his first.

643
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,410
- He did?
- It was only one step,

644
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,747
but you could tell
he was really proud of himself.

645
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,917
That's amazing.

646
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,669
I managed to get a shot for you.
Check your email.

647
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,923
Thanks. I'll call you
when I'm on my way home.

648
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,683
My son is walking...

649
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:45,187
like a normal little boy.

650
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,823
I'm on my way there right now.
Just start trolling for eyewitnesses.

651
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,952
Maybe we'll catch a break.
Maybe someone saw something, OK?

652
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,453
- Lieutenant LaGuerta?
- Yes?

653
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,996
Jim McCourt,
Internal Affairs.

654
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,250
I wonder if I could have
a word with you in private.

655
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:08,335
Of course.

656
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:16,134
So... what's this about?

657
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,220
Well, this is really a courtesy call.

658
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,097
We're about to launch
a formal investigation

659
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:24,268
into one of your detectives,
a... Angel Batista.

660
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,353
I understand he's your husband.

661
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,021
Yes. Yes, he is.

662
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,399
Apparently, he had
a physical altercation

663
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,568
with one of his fellow officers.
A Sergeant Lopez.

664
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:36,530
I was under the impression
the matter was settled.

665
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:39,283
Far from it.
Lopez collapsed while on duty today.

666
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:42,536
He's been hospitalised
with internal bleeding.

667
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:43,578
My God.

668
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:48,000
We believe that he'll pull through,
but he's filed charges.

669
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,002
Something else
you should be aware of -

670
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:53,213
we have two eyewitnesses
who claim that they saw Batista

671
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,382
kick Sergeant Lopez
while on the ground.

672
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:59,761
Now, if that is true,
that is assault with a deadly weapon.

673
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,888
And he could not only
lose his job...

674
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,309
he could serve time.

675
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,628
Had to borrow this from you.
I hope you don't mind.

676
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,341
What the hell?

677
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:40,260
Normally,
I bring my own plastic, but...

678
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,430
I had to...

679
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,849
improvise.

680
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,935
Let me the fuck out of here.

681
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:50,729
I bet you've heard that before,

682
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:54,191
"let me out of here",
from all the women you've killed.

683
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,283
I wish you could see
the room I set up for you.

684
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,621
Mmm. But you fucked
everything up, Boyd.

685
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,671
All those pictures I took
of the women you killed.

686
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:20,217
It's a shame you'll never get to see them.

687
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,974
I'll just have to paint
a word-picture for you instead.

688
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,020
They were young.

689
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:35,440
Just starting their lives.

690
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,109
Now they're floating in formaldehyde

691
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,904
and stuffed into barrels
strewn around a swamp.

692
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,115
Who the hell are you?

693
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:50,122
Just a fellow traveller,
who also likes to pick up dead animals.

694
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,915
I did 'em a favour.

695
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:58,046
They were all suffering
and I put 'em out of their misery.

696
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,715
Yeah, you'll be doing
one more favour tonight.

697
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,719
What are you talking about?

698
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,390
I've recently suffered a loss.

699
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,725
My wife...

700
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,562
was murdered by someone like you.

701
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,566
Someone like me.

702
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,485
It turned my life upside down.

703
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,404
Why is it my problem?

704
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,740
Because you're the start
of my healing process.

705
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,412
I knew you were fucked up
the minute I laid eyes on you.

706
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,207
I was fucked up long before that.

707
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,293
You don't know
what you're getting into.

708
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,088
Remember in the truck
you asked me what I want?

709
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,425
I want my wife back.

710
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,306
But this will have to do.

711
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,823
No church bells.
No hallelujah chorus.

712
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,950
Nothing feels different.

713
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,412
If anything, I'm emptier.

714
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,311
It's OK. I'm not gonna hurt you.

715
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,691
It's OK. Here.

716
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,904
No, don't. Don't.

717
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,656
Stop. No.

718
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,249
She saw everything.

719
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,380
She saw... me.
