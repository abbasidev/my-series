you "How's work?" and you said "Fine,"

00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,312
you were having your own private
little joke on me?

What's going on?

5
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,442
I went to Blockbuster
today to rent "Cinderella Man"

- and guess what?
- Is it still a classic?

7

that our son... the liar...

8

had been fired three weeks ago.

gets thrown out anyway.

was very clear.

about the environment.

Did that ever occur to you?
"Wallace and Gromit,"

17
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,266
I mean, that weighed like 50 lbs. How
many trees gave their lives for that?

18
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,851

I do there's something wrong.

it costs at a decent club in New York?

31

It's $500 for a bottle of Cristal,
and it's a two-bottle minimum.

when he flipped over the car?

Is she there, drinking champagne
with you... in her wheelchair?

00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,655

That's right, Ton', you go.
You don't know nothin'.

682
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,717
You were right. They kill a made guy,

Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.
You go to this address.

You ask for
a Mr. Caravalho.

696
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:59,125
- I just got off the phone with him.
- At 7:00 in the morning?!

697
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,460
- For what?
- You're gonna be working construction.

698

- What?
- Ferrying cement in a wheelbarrow.

699

- Yeah.

have to leave your friend

when I go back to school.

with that all the time.

keep searching online.

tomorrow morning,

I'm gonna take away your car.

take away your clothes.

And then I'm gonna
take away your room

717
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,852
and then I'm gonna take away your
mother's cooking.

718
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,396
And pretty soon you're gonna
be out in the fucking street.

720
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,040
It might get a little drafty
driving down there tomorrow.

721
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,209
But I will have this fucking
thing towed out of here

722

into fucking Brillo pads.
