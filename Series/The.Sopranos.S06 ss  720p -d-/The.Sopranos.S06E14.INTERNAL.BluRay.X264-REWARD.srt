...at an ASCO conference in Georgia.

176
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,912
- Good man.
- But?

177
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:14,042
Actually, very few people know this,
but he really can't walk on water.

178
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,796
What was his prognosis?

179
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,714
Three months.

180
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,759
- With the treatment you've had?
- What do you mean?

181
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,055
You got a window
of one to three years.

182
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,057
What about the metastasis?

183
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,144
Two rounds of Paraplatin,
docetaxel and Platinol...

184
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,813
...concurrent with radiation?

185
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,398
Come on, any cancer inside you
has slowed to a crawl.

186
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,486
Why is he so fucking negative?

187
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,406
We tell the patient three months,
he lives a year, who looks like a hero?

188
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,413
I'll see you around, John.
You take it easy. Hang in there.

189
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,425
Oh, fuck me.

190
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,306
Tony, morning.

191
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,518
You got a sec?

192
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,192
As I told you, my partner and I are with
the Joint Terror Task Force now.

193
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,446
You're around Port Newark
often enough.

194
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,741
We're concerned about what might come
through there from the Middle East.

195
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,535
Yeah, and?

196
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,787
Let's talk terror funding.

197
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,456
Most of it comes about
through illegal enterprise.

198
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,501
Our pitch is this, and it's the same
we gave Christopher Moltisanti.

199
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,295
Maybe he never mentioned it.

200
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,506
If you or any of your people
ever heard of anything going down...

201
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,300
...Middle Easterners, Pakistanis...

202
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,469
...you'd be helping us a lot
if you let us know.

203
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,307
I think there's a word for that.

204
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,810
Your daughter takes
premed classes in New York.

205
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,978
She use the tunnels?

206
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,697
Just something to keep in mind.

207
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,663
That's the last time
I'm going down for the paper.

208
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,041
You tell that fucking Polack
to get here early...

209
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,043
...and bring up the paper with her...

210
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,629
...or she can go clean
somebody else's fucking toilets.

211
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,714
What happened?

212
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,092
It's too dangerous.
Has been for years.

213
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,935
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention?

Welcome to the premiere of Cleaver...

215
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,026
...the story of a young man
who goes to pieces...

216
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,861
...then manages to find himself again.

(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

218
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,074
In all seriousness, however...

219
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,534
...I'd like to say a few words.

220
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,038
Much like a child,
a film has many parents.

221
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,749
That is to say, many individuals...

222
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,918
...who act like parents...

223
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,128
...or that by aversion...

224
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,965
...the film is their baby.

225
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,050
I, as an executive producer...

226
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,885
...am one of those individuals.

227
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,638
Two more examples
are here with me tonight.

228
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,058
Ladies and gentlemen,
my co-EP, Christopher Moltisanti...

229
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,353
...and our director, Morgan Yam.

230
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,733
Yeah. Hey.

231
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,071
I know you're all psyched
to see the movie...

232
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,073
...so I'm not gonna give
a big speech here.

233
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,075
I just wanna give a shout-out...

234
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,285
...to the man who, without him...

235
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,330
...this whole thing would be impossible.
Where is he?

236
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,417
Anthony Soprano, everybody.

237
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,585
- Hey!
- All right, Ton.

238
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,006
Once he came onboard,
the whole thing fell together.

239
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,842
And all the other investors too.

240
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,013
Plus my wife, Kelli,
and our new baby. I love you guys.

241
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:01,019

00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,965
...the last 10, 12 years,
that's been a dysfunctional family.

343
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,469
And as Jerry said earlier,
there are several viable candidates.

344
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,804
Well, viable, I don't know.

345
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,140
You had Phil Leotardo
as the logical successor, but...

346
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,643
You also have
Gerardo "Gerry" Torciano...

347
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,480
...also Faustino "Doc" Santoro,
who I believe is the frontrunner.

348
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,733
- Then...
- Surprised you haven't mentioned...

349
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,195
...Carmine Lupertazzi, Jr.
I was about to before you interrupted.

350
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,115
In fact, if you take a look
at my book, in chapter 14...

351
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,785
This Santoro thing,
I called it a year ago.

352
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,497
Hey.

353
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,167
Thank you for coming, Anthony.

354
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,003
I know it's a long trip.

355
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,673
What, and miss a chance
to see Missouri?

356
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,186
So how's Ginny today?

357
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,231
She went with Allegra
to buy some stuff for the kitchenette.

358
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,358
Good, clear her mind.

359
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,863
Reason I asked you here today,
she's a bright kid, your sister...

360
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,197
...but business...

361
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:16,036
My life insurance,
I wanna put her on a monthly stipend.

362
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,873
Probably a good idea.

363
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,542
Not all the doctors agree...

364
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:27,256
...but if I do only have a few months,
I wanna take care of all this now.

365
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,301
Wait a second.
Which doctor doesn't agree?

366
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,553
Feldman, the guy I told you about.

367
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,222
- The wife murderer?
- He's still a doctor, Anthony.

368
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,559
He was a highly-respected oncologist.

369
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,729
- I know, but, John...
- He reviewed my case.

370
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,523
He says I could hang on for years.

371
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,280
You're right.
He still has the knowledge.

372
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,492
I mean, O.J.'s no less
of a running back, right?

373
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,831
Let me ask you something,
Anthony.

374
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,711
How will I be remembered?

375
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,508
A wonderful husband.

376
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,926
A loving father.

377
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:16,013
- On the street though, I mean.
- From what I know, you were well-liked.

378
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,974
Respected across the board,
despite the allocution even.

379
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,519
God knows guys have actually
named names...

380
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:25,439
...for a hell of a lot less than what
you were looking at. The only nega...

381
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,487
What?

382
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,950
Well, when Carmine died
and you took over...

383
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,118
...people felt you changed...

384
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,622
...became a little trigger-happy, maybe?

385
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,831
A hothead.

386
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,299
God forbid any of them
would find themselves in that position.

387
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,387
It's a thankless job.

388
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,866
- What are you, hung-over?
- What? I had two glasses of wine.

389
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,160
Why are you so pissy?

390
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,540
- The portrayal of that guy in the movie.
- What guy?

391
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,875
- The boss, Tony.
- What about him?

392
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,672
- It was based on you.
- Yeah, I know, you said, the yelling.

393
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,009
- No, it wasn't just the yelling.
- Imitation's a form of flattery.

394
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,012
- You think that was flattering?
- It was okay.

395
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,557
- He's a tough prick, that Baldwin.
- What about the girlfriend?

396
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,517
- What girlfriend?
- The cleaver guy.

397
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,688
The lead character.
His entire motive for revenge.

398
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,189
I don't know.
You lost me, Carm.

399
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:53,193
Sally Boy, the boss,
he fucked the guy's fiancée.

400
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,407
The thing with Adriana?

401
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,409
I told you it never fucking happened.

402
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,745
Well, apparently,
your nephew feels otherwise.

403
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,914
Ro pointed it out to me. If she saw it,
that means other people did.

404
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:10,377
- It's a movie. It's fictional.
- It's a revenge fantasy, Tony...

405
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,006
...which ends with the boss's head
split open by a meat cleaver.

406
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,015
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

407
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,896
Oh, there he is.
Good time last night?

408
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,106
Yeah, it was all right.
How about you?

409
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,610
Well, Gab had fucking nightmares.

410
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,198
- Club soda, hon.
- Sure.

411
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,617
So, what did you think
of the movie?

412
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,787
You know, Chrissy's the last person
I would have confused with Marty...

413
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,748
...but I gotta say, it wasn't bad.

414
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,753
- Is he around?
- Chrissy? No.

415
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,547
He don't come around here
no more, you know that.

416
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,805
That Baldwin was pretty good, huh?

417
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,688
He was a mean fuck.
I'll give him that.

418
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,483
And that girl that played
the fiancée, she was hot.

419
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,944
You know, the one he was fucking.

420
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,748
It's weird how it works,
the creative process.

421
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,376
I'm watching that movie
Edward Scissorhands, when:

422
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,961
All of a sudden, it hits me.

423
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,631
What if instead of a pair of scissors,
it's a meat cleaver instead?

424
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,801
A couple of years later,
you got a movie.

425
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,096
Originally, I thought a ball-peen hammer,
but a cleaver's better.

426
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,560
I tell you, it's like I'm living
somebody else's life.

427
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,814
You're just not comfortable
with success yet. I know. It's scary.

428
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,234
Feel the fear and do it anyway.

429
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,654
- Without chemicals either.
- (CUPS CLINK) Yeah.

430
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,492
So Kelli, the baby.

431
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,328
Good, fucking great.

432
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,832
She's a doll.
She cries a lot though.

433
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,002
The baby, not Kelli.

434
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,673
I hope you're taking the time
to reflect on all this.

435
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:24,344
- Savor the good stuff.
- Yeah. No, I am.

436
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,935
There's my other sober buddy.

437
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,022
- Is that an FBI guy?
- Your tax dollars at work.

438
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,611
- Does he follow you around all the time?
- They drop in and out. It's fun.

439
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,201
Look, seriously, think where you were
just three months ago.

440
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,370
You came into that meeting, you were
so fucked up you could barely talk.

441
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,289
And that woman friend
was even worse.

442
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,919
I've been trying to do what you said,
hold back a little...

443
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,671
...steer clear of old habits,
same people.

444
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,883
Must be hard though,
given your lifestyle.

445
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,928
They already misinterpret
I don't wanna hang around so much.

446
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,471
Fucking Paulie especially.

447
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,724
Have you explained how hard it is
to be around alcohol?

448
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,977
- How familiar surroundings set it off?
- They don't give a fuck.

449
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,906
"But he's fucking my wife, Carmine.
I want him dead," Jimmy says.

450
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:31,578
"He will be," he said, "but not
just right now. He earns too much."

451
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:35,374
Eight years later,
Jimmy gets a call one day.

452
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:39,211
"Remember that guy we were talking
about who was fucking your wife?

453
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,754
He can go."

454
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,174
The guy wasn't making him
money no more.

455
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,009
And that was Carmine Lupertazzi.

456
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,304
- Holy fucking shit.
- Yeah.

457
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,807
There you are. We went...

458
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,725
John, what the hell are you doing?

459
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,770
- What?
- You're smoking.

460
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,147
- So?
- Daddy, you're on oxygen.

461
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,986
Hey, Warren, pardon me, I'm sorry.

462
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,326
- Just calm down, all right?
- Calm down? I don't fucking believe you.

463
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,788
(SIGHS)
What do I got to lose, Gin?

464
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,165
- What's the difference?
- You told me Dr. Feldman...

465
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,626
...doesn't agree with the others.
Yeah, well...

466
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,713
- Miracles do happen, John.
- Not to this family they don't.

467
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,214
You know,
it's that kind of attitude...

468
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,675
...that probably brought this on
in the first place.

469
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,261
You gonna start with that again?

470
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,848
What about all these six-year-olds
with leukemia?

471
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,350
What's that from,
all their negative thinking?

472
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,103
(COUGHING)

473
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,539
All due respect, he's a great guy, Doc,
but boss material?

474
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,167
The important thing
is we all work together...

475
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,002
...whoever winds up in the driver's seat.

476
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,212
Yeah, Phil, though, I'll never get it.

477
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,798
The man was my mentor.
It was right there for the taking.

478
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,051
His heart, Gerry.
What was he gonna do?

479
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,261
That's my point though,
what you just said.

480
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,640
Johnny goes away,
it's Phil's turn in the driver's seat...

481
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,099
...and his heart gives out.

482
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,436
- Right.
- His heart.

483
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,648
- I know. What?
- It's a metaphor.

484
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,691
He lost his balls is what I'm saying.

485
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,485
Just say it then.

486
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,363
- Walt fucking Whitman over here.
- I'll tell you later, okay?

487
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,366
- Ladies.
- Hey.

488
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,368
- Am I right?
- How you doing?

489
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,244
Should we get some more wine?

490
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,288
This fucking waiter on sabbatical?

491
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,416
What's the name of that Sangiovese
we had at Quattro Gatti?

492
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,251
The night your...
(SOUND DROPS OUT)

493
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,801
(SCREAMING)

494
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,057
Come on.

495
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,065
Let's go.

496
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:18,161
Yeah, give me five dimes apiece
on St. Louis...

497
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,579
...Minnesota and Baltimore.

498
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,925
I would have invited you to play,
but we already had our fourth.

499
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,302
You're not happy.

500
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,638
Let's order.

501
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,851
- What can I get you?
- Seared ahi, mixed greens...

502
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,896
...and an iced tea, please.
Philly cheesesteak.

503
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,900
You know what? Give me
an Arnold Palmer instead of the iced tea.

504
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,611
I always enjoy those,
but it never occurs to me to order one.

505
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,282
What the fuck, Carmine?
This family of yours.

506
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,952
Fucking senile Doc Santoro
uses one of my guys as a diversion?

507
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,413
Sil could have got hurt.

508
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,248
Doc showed a lack of respect.

509
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,881
This fucking leadership, boy.

510
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,134
Step up, Carmine.
Get your hands around this thing.

511
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,219
You know you got the support.

512
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,685
You never thought
you'd mutter those words, did you?

513
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,979
What do you want me to say?

514
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:31,568
I hear you, Tony, and I'm flattered.
But boss? I don't think so.

515
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,529
Especially now that Doc
has cemented his position.

516
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:38,408
Phil was bad enough in the top spot,
but him I could have lived with.

517
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,243
Here you go.

518
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,667
There was a time
I was obsessed with being in charge.

519
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,711
- You remember?
- Right, so do it.

520
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,217
One night around then,
I had this dream.

521
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,345
It's my pop's 100th birthday,
even though he'd been dead for years.

522
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,514
The whole family's there.
Grandkids, everybody.

523
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:05,685
He's wearing one of these
gold paper crowns, like at Burger King.

524
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:11,650
Anyway, I give him his present,
this mellifluous box, ribbons...

525
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,693
He opens it up, then looks at me.

526
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,197
This gaze of absolute disappointment.

527
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,616
There's nothing in the box.

528
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,870
So he hands it back to me.
"Go fill it up," he says.

529
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:28,083
- "Come back when I'm 200."
- So go for it, Carmine.

530
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,168
Fulfill that part of yourself.

531
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,049
We have this ritual
at my house for years.

532
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,717
Our kids are in boarding school.

533
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:41,638
Every night I come home from work,
I strip down, jump naked in the pool.

534
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,684
Nicole brings me a Scotch and water.
We sit, relax a little, talk.

535
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,728
I go up to bed, the air conditioning.

536
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,065
She brings me
a light dinner on a tray.

537
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:57,320
One night, during all that fighting
with John, I come home, I'm exhausted.

538
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,115
So tired, so tense,
I skip the pool.

539
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,243
I go right upstairs, flop on the bed.

540
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,371
Nicole comes up with a drink.

541
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,250
She says, "Darling,
I think it's time you took a rest."

542
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,419
I say, "I'm gonna.
We're gonna take a vacation."

543
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,588
She says, "That's not what I meant.

544
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:21,469
I don't wanna be the wealthiest widow
on Long Island. I want you to quit now."

545
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,473
I'm not ashamed to say
that she made me cry.

546
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,392
That wonderful, loving woman.

547
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,107
That dream with my father,
the empty box...

548
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,360
...it wasn't about being boss.

549
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,321
It was about being happy.

550
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,790
Warren, hi.

551
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,835
Hi, hon. How's he doing?

552
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,838
Listen, I've been meaning
to talk to you about the smoking.

553
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,299
John shared with me
how upset you were.

554
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,178
Psychologically, when a person's
told they're dying...

555
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,222
...it's the ultimate loss of control.

556
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,976
- To hear him wheeze like that...
- I know. It doesn't make any sense.

557
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,562
I do know he's a leader.

558
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:19,402
I suspect his smoking, on some level,
is an attempt to die as he lived...

559
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,488
...in total control.

560
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,865
Years ago, I asked him
to stop for me and the kids.

561
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:27,619
I lost 27 pounds.
He couldn't quit smoking?

562
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,750
I gotta go.

563
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,758
Goodbye, Caitlin.
I'll see you soon, muffin.

564
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,344
Oh, my God.
I love these little hands.

565
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,263
Thanks so much for watching her.

566
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,724
You'd think we're planning
a coronation instead of a christening.

567
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,894
- We all set?
- You know what? I'd better pee.

568
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,982
Oh, goody, I get to keep holding you.

569
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,740
So how you doing? Tony said
you got an offer on the house you built.

570
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,200
Two, actually, yes.

571
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,536
Ivana Trump.

572
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,418
You know, I gotta be honest.
I am very disappointed at what you did.

573
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,712
- What are you talking about?
- Your movie.

574
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,089
The boss sleeping
with the other guy's fiancée?

575
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,632
What?

576
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,718
Like that wasn't based
on Tony and Ade?

577
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,096
What? No.
Carmela, I didn't even write it.

578
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:32,017
"Story by Christopher Moltisanti." Isn't
that what it said up there on the screen?

579
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,853
Yeah, but that's just
for the Writers Guild health insurance.

580
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:38,148
- Oh, really?
- Come on, you can't be serious.

581
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,567
She's an Oriental, for chrissake.

582
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:46,489
- Have you heard from Ade lately?
- No. Why would I hear from her?

583
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:50,243
- Would it be so surprising?
- She left me for some other guy.

584
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:54,622
Is it any wonder? Her poor mother
is so upset, she's practically delusional.

585
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,916
She's convinced herself
that Ade is dead.

586
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,085
Her mother's an alky. You know that.

587
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,755
Yeah, regardless, Christopher.

588
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,299
You're my cousin,
and I love you, Carmela...

589
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,343
...but I don't like
what you're inferring here...

590
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,846
...either with the movie
or with how I treated Adriana.

591
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,182
Kelli comes out,
tell her I went to smoke.

592
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,941
There's my pal. How you doing?

593
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:26,863
Billy Bathgate. They had it in the library.
I thought of you.

594
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,326
I don't know if you heard,
but Gerry Torciano...

595
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,536
...he was hit last week in Brooklyn.

596
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,789
- Who?
- Gerry Torciano.

597
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:40,126
It was all over the news.
They whacked him in some restaurant.

598
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,630
Did you know him?

599
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,966
Yeah.

600
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,512
I don't know. Good guy.

601
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,973
It's hard to breathe.

602
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,820
I'll talk to Gupte...

603
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:10,865
...see if I can get him
to up the Beclovent.

604
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,577
I'm dying, aren't I?

605
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,421
It's not good. I won't lie to you.

606
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,048
The aggressiveness surprises me.

607
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,929
I gotta concur with Rosen.

608
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,190
I appreciate everything
you've done, Warren.

609
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:51,406
- (DOORBELL RINGING)
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

610
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,704
- Who is it?
- You don't answer your phone?

611
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,623
I shut the ringer.
It's the middle of the night.

612
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,791
Honey, what's wrong?

613
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,211
Nothing, sweetie,
it's fine. Go back to sleep.

614
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,088
It ain't fine.
We got a problem.

615
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,924
The whole sequence
with Sally Boy banging the fiancée...

616
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,635
...you gotta tell Tony
that was your idea.

617
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,430
- It wasn't my idea.
- What are you, fucking stupid now?

618
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,807
He probably thinks
I put it in to embarrass him.

619
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,435
- Why did you put it in there?
- It was an idea.

620
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,937
I don't know. Who knows
where they fucking come from?

621
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:26,191
Isaac Newton invented gravity because
some asshole hit him with an apple.

622
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,776
It's bad enough that I don't get credit
for my own ideas.

623
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,445
Now I'm supposed
to take responsibility...

624
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,572
...for some shit
that's gonna get me in trouble?

625
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,991
Fuck that, man.

626
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,413
Humanitas Award.
What's that?

627
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,624
Humanitas.
From the Paulist brothers...

628
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,460
...for writing themes
of socially redeeming...

629
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,757
Look out the window. You see
a fucking Hollywood sign out there?

630
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,800
Maybe you talk
to your agent like that...

631
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,470
...but don't ever get fucking
snippy on me again.

632
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,235
The fucking scary thing was
I didn't know what happened...

633
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,945
...till after the shot was fired.

634
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,155
It was fucking weird.

635
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,117
- Tony, hey. Gentlemen.
- Hey, how are you?

636
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,036
T.J. Hooker.

637
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:25,124
J.T., actually, but...
I'm looking for Chris.

638
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,793
I'm supposed to meet him.

639
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,920
What, here?

640
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,467
The thing is, he left me a message,
but this fucking Verizon is...

641
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,844
- Mind if I wait?
- Yeah, sit down.

642
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,640
- Diet Coke, please.
- You got it.

643
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,939
- So, what did you think of Cleaver?
- Oh, it's good. You know...

644
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,482
Congratulations.

645
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,318
I hope we're gonna see
some money soon.

646
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,821
Yeah.

647
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,827
As a writer, you can never tell,
you know? You come up with an idea...

648
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,539
...you don't know how the audience will
respond. Just because I like something...

649
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,666
...I think of,
doesn't mean anyone else will.

650
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,376
Well, that's the challenge, huh?

651
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:12,964
It is challenging sometimes,
inventing characters, how they interact.

652
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,843
The boss, Sally Boy, for example,
his whole persona...

653
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,014
...I stole that from Broderick Crawford
in Born Yesterday.

654
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,682
What's that?

655
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,060
Garson Kanin, 1950. It's terrific.

656
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,813
William Holden falls in love
with Crawford's girlfriend...

657
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,064
...played by Judy Holliday.

658
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:33,109
- The black girl, the singer.
- No, that's Billie Holiday.

659
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,738
Although Judy's character
in the movie is named Billie too...

660
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,573
...so I can see why you're confused.

661
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,618
I never seen it.
Why would I be confused?

662
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,540
Anyway, the Sally Boy character
is based on Crawford.

663
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,584
Sort of a big, burly guy.

664
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:53,379
The love triangle, the cuckolding
of Michael, sleeping with the fiancée...

665
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:57,967
...very similar
to the Holden-Holliday dynamic.

666
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,055
So the whole thing was your idea.

667
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,932
With apologies to Garson Kanin.

668
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,395
- What happened to your head?
- What?

669
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,567
Cabinet.

670
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:25,078
If I see Chrissy,
I'll tell him you were looking for him.

671
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,926
Now listen to me, you two heels.
I mean business.

672
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,012
I got too much at stake here.
You got something that belongs to me.

673
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,599
If you wanna get out of here alive, give it
back. Now, I'm no blowhard. Tell him.

674
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,269
He's no blowhard.
He's had people killed before.

675
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,271
Was about six years ago,
there was this...

676
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,608
Shut up! You ain't gonna be
telling nobody nothing pretty soon.

677
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,114
This is the image of me
he leaves to the world.

678
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,287
I remember when he was born,
I would hold him in my arms.

679
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,501
An adorable kid too.

680
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,044
Big eyes.

681
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:19,173
You always talk about him
more like a son.

682
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:23,177
Well, in some ways he was,
especially after his dad died.

683
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,139
He was little.
I used to give him rides.

684
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:29,434
I'd put him in the basket
of the butcher bike...

685
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,686
...and pedal him around...

686
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,564
...back when Satriale's
made deliveries.

687
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,775
I reminded him of that recently.

688
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,154
- He didn't remember.
- But you do.

689
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,156
We had fun.

690
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,120
All those memories, and for what?

691
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,873
All I am to him is some asshole bully.

692
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,173
You're hurt.

693
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,432
His dad, Dickie...

694
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,268
...was like my me to him.

695
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:16,647
- A mentor.
- Yeah, but more than that...

696
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,649
...a friend...

697
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,693
...a fucking guy
you could look up to.

698
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:24,655
And the hope is,
that you pass that shit down...

699
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,785
...the respect and the love.

700
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:36,417
And all I did for this fucking kid,
and he fucking hates me so much.

701
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,253
I'm sure on some level
he loves you too.

702
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,091
Yeah? Take that home.
Judge for yourself.

703
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,427
Last five minutes
should answer that question.

704
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,221
I'm not going to do that.

705
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,182
- Not a horror fan?
- It's what you think that matters.

706
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:57,146
I think he fucking despises me.
It's pretty obvious.

707
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,815
Wants to see me dead.

708
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,241
Without invalidating your feelings...

709
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,160
...is it possible that on some level...

710
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,287
...you're reading into all this?

711
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,338
I've been coming here for years.

712
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:26,133
I know too much
about the subconscious now.

713
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,439
Look, sweetie...

714
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,609
...they're nice and clean
like you like them.

715
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,444
Mommy, he can't really hear you.

716
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,573
They're right here by the bed.

717
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,624
- My...
- What, baby? Your what?

718
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,626
You want more morphine, Daddy?

719
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:08,217
- Mother.
- Grandma? What, Daddy?

720
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,719
Is he hallucinating?

721
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,555
- She's here.
- I don't know. He could be.

722
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,141
Sometimes they see
people who've passed.

723
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,685
John, look at me, baby.

724
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,025
John.

725
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:36,078
You want a cigarette, baby? John.

726
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,259
You can't do that
when you're on my fucking team?

727
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,012
Hey, Ton,
Anthony Infante to see you.

728
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,348
Send him in.

729
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,517
There he is. X-ray specs.

730
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,437
- How's John?
- That's why I'm here, Tony.

731
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,189
John passed away late this morning.

732
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,027
- Oh, fuck, you're kidding me.
- Shit.

733
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,196
I only wish.

734
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:19,622
He was a great guy, John.
Sorry for your loss.

735
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,250
Thanks.
Honestly, though, it was for the best.

736
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,301
What are you gonna do?

737
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,054
I beat cancer,
but it took him out.

738
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,057
Ride the painted pony,
let the spinning wheel glide.

739
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,813
John Sacrimoni, a buon' anima.

740
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,065
A buon' anima, Johnny Sack.

741
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,203
We're here to celebrate
what would have been my brother's...

742
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:02,707
...your uncle's, 47th birthday.
Blow it out for him.

743
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,666
(BLOWING)

744
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,544
(CHEERING)

745
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,506
Right here at this bar, this seat...

746
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,259
...was Uncle Billy's favorite place
in the whole world.

747
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,637
- More than Shea Stadium?
- More than Shea Stadium.

748
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,598
He'd sit with his friends
and tell stories about his family...

749
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:23,269
...who he loved more than anything
and was so very proud of.

750
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,610
From now on,
his ashes will be right here...

751
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,780
...so when his friends come to visit,
he can see them.

752
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,324
- Can he see us now?
- Yeah.

753
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,786
- Who knows who is Leonardo da Vinci?
- I do.

754
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,456
- Matty.
- Yeah, he wrote The Da Vinci Code.

755
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,041
- No.
- Another man wrote that...

756
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,376
...but it's a hideous,
sacrilegious book.

757
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,173
- Annabella.
- He was a painter of the Mona Lisa.

758
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,843
Very good. He was not only a painter,
he did medical drawings...

759
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,054
...and he designed a tank
for the army.

760
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,975
Leonardo was a great Italian, and that
was our name originally, Leonardo.

761
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,395
But many years ago, when my grandpa
came over from Sicily...

762
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,482
...they changed it at Ellis Island
to Leotardo.

763
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,150
What did they do that for?

764
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,403
Because they're stupid,
that's why, and jealous.

765
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,364
They disrespected
a proud Italian heritage...

766
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:21,202
...and named us
after a ballet costume.

767
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,829
- Marissa.
- That's for modern.

768
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:27,500
- In ballet, you wear tutus.
- It doesn't make a difference.

769
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:33,380
- That's right, it doesn't.
- Can we have cake now?

770
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:07,832
How you doing, Phil? You okay?

771
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:13,003
Forty-seven. He was a fucking kid.

772
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,298
Me, I'm an old man.

773
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,721
I'd like to do it over.
Boy, let me tell you.

774
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,724
I fucking compromised everything.

775
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,893
No, what are you talking about?

776
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,397
Twenty years inside,
not a fucking peep.

777
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,857
For what?

778
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:37,236
To protect the likes
of Rusty fucking Millio, Doc Santoro?

779
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,906
You were a man, Phil.
That's saying a lot nowadays.

780
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:53,127
That cocksucking piece of shit,
Tony Soprano's cousin...

781
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,921
I can't even say his name.

782
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,967
Murdered Billie.
And what did I do about it?

783
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,930
My weakness.

784
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,309
Sometimes I think
it's in my DNA.

785
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,770
My family took shit from the medigans
the minute we got off the boat.

786
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,106
Come on. What the fuck
are you talking about?

787
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,775
Leotardo.

788
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,652
That's my fucking legacy.

789
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,120
No more, Butchie.

790
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,915
No more of this.

791
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,334
(MUSIC PLAYING)
