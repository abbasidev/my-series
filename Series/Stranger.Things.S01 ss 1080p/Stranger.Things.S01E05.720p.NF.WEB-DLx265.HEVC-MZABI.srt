1
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,064
Thanks.

2
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,741
No.

3
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,831
Hands up. Hands up!

4
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

5
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,502
Forgot all the cameras, bub?

6
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,463
Look, Dr. Brenner asked
for me specifically. Okay?

7
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,673
How else do you think
I got in here?

8
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,592
What's your name again?

9
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,386
It's Jim Hopper.

10
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,179
Chief Jim Hopper.

11
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,140
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper-

12
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,184
<i>Come again?</i>

13
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,441
Hey...

14
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,026
you mind if I borrow this one?

15
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,414
Drink.

16
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,790
It'll calm your nerves.

17
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,127
Help you think straight, yeah?

18
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,759
I don't know what to do.

19
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,595
I know. I know.

20
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,265
This whole time...

21
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,604
I... I could... I could feel him.

22
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,980
He was...

23
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,067
He was so close.
He was... he was right there.

24
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,903
I knew he was alive.

25
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:37,783
Our hands...
our hands were almost touching.

26
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,869
Now it's like I... uh...

27
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,165
God, it's like
I can't feel him anymore.

28
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,294
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

29
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,421
Like how everybody is looking at me.

30
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,423
- Like I'm out of my damn mind.
- Hey.

31
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,386
You're not gonna like this,

32
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,098
but I think you need to seriously consider
the possibility that all this...

33
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,476
It's in your head.

34
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,980
- You remember your Aunt Darlene?
- No.

35
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,025
No, this is not that.

36
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,318
I mean, when something like this happens,

37
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,446
your mind makes up stuff
for you to cope, you know?

38
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,950
I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral
tomorrow for our little boy

39
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,952
and you're saying his body is fake.

40
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,496
He's in the wall.

41
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,165
I mean, how do you explain that?

42
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,586
It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.

43
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,382
At least go talk to a shrink or...

44
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,510
- What about Pastor Charles or someone-
- I don't- Well, they can't help.

45
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,470
Joyce, you just told me...

46
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,806
that Will is gone.

47
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,853
What else is there to do?

48
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,399
Hey.

49
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,165
Will?

50
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,625
Will?

51
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,296
Will?

52
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,466
Will?

53
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,280
What was Will saying?

54
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,574
Like home... Like home...

55
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,452
but dark?

56
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,788
And empty.

57
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,335
Empty and cold.
Wait, did he say cold?

58
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,505
I don't know.
The stupid radio kept going in and out.

59
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,006
It's like riddles in the dark.

60
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,966
Like home.
Like his house?

61
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,301
Or maybe like Hawkins.

62
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,928
Upside down.

63
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,263
- What'd she say?
- Upside down.

64
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,890
- What?
- Upside down.

65
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,770
When El showed us where Will was,
she flipped the board over, remember?

66
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,814
Upside down.

67
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,524
Dark. Empty.

68
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,943
Do you understand what he's talking about?

69
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,945
- No.
- Guys, come on, think about it.

70
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,073
When El took us to find Will,
she took us to his house, right?

71
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,950
Yeah.
And he wasn't there.

72
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,743
But what if he was there?

73
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,787
What if we just couldn't see him?

74
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,831
What if he was on the other side?

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,085
What if this is Hawkins and...

76
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,754
this is where Will is?

77
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,464
The Upside Down.

78
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,258
Like the Vale of Shadows.

79
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,636
Will?

80
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,223
Will?

81
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,602
Will?

82
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,287
I see him! Hey! Stop!

83
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,253
"The Vale of Shadows

84
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:22,591
is a dimension that is a dark reflection
or echo of our world.

85
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,641
<i>It is a place of decay and death. "</i>

86
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,059
Will?

87
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:37,022
"A plane out of phase.
A place of monsters.

88
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,860
It is right next to you,
and you don't even see it. "

89
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,321
Will?

90
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,490
Will?

91
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,576
An alternate dimension.

92
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,495
But... how... how do we get there?

93
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,622
You cast Shadow Walk.

94
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,998
In real life, dummy.

95
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,083
We can't shadow walk, but...

96
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,461
maybe she can.

97
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,923
Do you know how we get there?
To the Upside Down?

98
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,678
Oh, my God!

99
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,569
What the hell?

100
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,197
Hey!

101
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,282
Hey! Hey!

102
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,528
Hey, kid.

103
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,405
What's going on?

104
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:36,576
Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight.
On the couch.

105
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,703
Yeah, I'm here
as long as you need me, okay?

106
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,580
How are you holding up?

107
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,335
What happened?

108
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,045
- Don't worry about that.
- Mom...

109
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,757
that thing you saw before,
did it come back?

110
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,551
Jonathan, that's enough.

111
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,055
Can we talk?

112
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,306
Alone?

113
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,351
- You need to leave.
- Look, I know you're upset.

114
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,019
We all are.

115
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,190
But you need to listen to me.
Your mother is sick. Really sick.

116
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,775
Yeah. Well, you being here,

117
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,068
you're just making things worse,
like always.

118
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,194
- Worse?
- Yeah!

119
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,238
She took down that wall with an ax.

120
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,406
She said that Will was inside
and that he's talking to her.

121
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,991
Yeah.
Maybe he was.

122
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,827
This isn't some kind of joke.

123
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,912
Your mom was half frozen to death
when I got here.

124
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,372
Trembling, scared out of her mind.

125
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,707
You come in here and you start
feeding into her hallucinations

126
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,959
or whatever the hell you want to call it,

127
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,544
you're gonna push her right over the edge.

128
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,004
You hear me?

129
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,385
Look, I'm on your side.

130
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,761
I'm here to help.

131
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,639
I'm gonna make things better
around here for all of us.

132
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,433
Thank God you're here.

133
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,688
Do me a favor.
At the funeral tomorrow, just behave.

134
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,482
If not for me, for your mother.

135
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,948
Take that down.
It's inappropriate.

136
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,834
- Good.
- Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.

137
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,628
Ah... there.
It's supposed to be a little tight.

138
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,797
Looks good.

139
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,258
Here we go.

140
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,344
You look nice, sweetie.

141
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,682
Anything else?

142
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,642
You can borrow my black heels if you want.

143
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,561
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.

144
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,938
I'm fine. Thanks.

145
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,633
Ugh.

146
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,232
Come on.
Time to go.

147
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,947
Come on.

148
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,910
<i>"Fear not,
for I am with you.</i>

149
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,663
<i>Be not dismayed, for I am your God.</i>

150
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,624
I will strengthen you.

151
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,876
Yes, I will help you.

152
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,630
I will uphold you
with my righteous right hand. "

153
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,093
It's times like these
that our faith is challenged.

154
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,721
How, if He is truly benevolent...

155
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,059
could God take from us
someone so young, so innocent?

156
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,980
It would be easy to turn away from God...

157
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,316
but we must remember that nothing,

158
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,027
not even tragedy,
can separate us from His love.

159
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,114
We are here today to find comfort
in the truth of scripture,

160
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,449
and to surround Will and his family...

161
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,869
Just wait till we tell Will that
Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.

162
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,091
- I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

163
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,260
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...

164
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,387
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

165
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,640
Take care, all right?
Thanks.

166
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,226
Thanks for coming out.

167
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,281
I see Will the Wise is back.

168
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,910
What's that shooting out of his cane?

169
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,412
Fireballs.

170
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,789
I couldn't find the red crayon,
so that's why it's green.

171
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:52,915
Oh, well...

172
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,044
if he's so wise,
why does he need fireballs?

173
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,338
Why can't he just, you know,
outsmart the bad guys?

174
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,050
Most of the time, yeah, totally.

175
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,428
But... sometimes the bad guys
are smart, too.

176
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,512
You know?

177
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,056
Yeah.

178
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,099
So he needs the fireballs?

179
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,977
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.

180
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,480
All right. Well, I don't know
who's been raising you,

181
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,982
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons

182
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,985
because it looks like
he's shooting cabbages.

183
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,764
<i>Will! Will, it's us!
Are you there?</i>

184
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,224
<i>Can you hear us?
We're here!</i>

185
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,602
<i>Hello? Mom?</i>

186
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,480
<i>Why can't he hear us?
I don't know!</i>

187
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,899
<i>Mom, it's coming!</i>

188
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,194
She was there.

189
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,823
This is where we know
for sure it's been, right?

190
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,367
- So, that's...
- Steve's house.

191
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,995
And that's the woods
where they found Will's bike and...

192
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,163
that's my house.

193
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,124
- It's all so close.
- Yeah. Exactly.

194
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,585
I mean, it's all within a mile
or something.

195
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,963
Whatever this thing is, it's...
it's not traveling far.

196
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,966
You want to go out there.

197
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,843
We might not find anything.

198
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,261
I found something.

199
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,142
And if we do see it...

200
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,230
then what?

201
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,068
We kill it.

202
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,365
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a second.

203
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,542
Are you serious?

204
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:27,004
What? You want to find this thing
and take another photo? Yell at it?

205
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,259
This is a terrible idea.

206
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,886
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.

207
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,889
What? You can tell someone,
but they're not gonna believe you.

208
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:37,974
You know that.

209
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,308
Your mom would.

210
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,894
- She's been through enough.
- She deserves to know.

211
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,354
Yeah, and I'll tell her...

212
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,814
when this thing is dead.

213
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,445
I don't know what in the world caused it.

214
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,698
- Let's take a look, huh?
- Yeah.

215
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,450
Mr. Clarke says
he's never seen anything like it.

216
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,577
Mr. Clarke?

217
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,580
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.

218
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,789
That right?

219
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,251
Apparently, some of the less
athletic types go nuts for this stuff.

220
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,871
Mr. Clarke?

221
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,581
Oh, hey, there.

222
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,791
How are you boys holding up?

223
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,004
We're... in... mourning.

224
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,840
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.

225
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,217
We were wondering
if you had time to talk?

226
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,471
- We have some questions.
- A lot of questions.

227
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,474
<i>So, you know how in Cosmos,
Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions?</i>

228
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,683
Like, beyond our world?

229
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,268
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.

230
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,436
Right, theoretically.

231
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,105
So, theoretically,
how do we travel there?

232
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,398
You guys have been thinking about

233
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,567
<i>Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation,
haven't you?</i>

234
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,280
Well, basically,
there are parallel universes.

235
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,782
Just like our world,

236
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,326
but just infinite variations of it.

237
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,578
Which means there's a world out there

238
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,246
where none of this tragic stuff
ever happened.

239
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,499
Yeah, that's not what we're talking about.

240
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,125
- Oh.
- We were thinking of more

241
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,752
of an evil dimension,
like the Vale of Shadows.

242
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,379
You know the Vale of Shadows?

243
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,881
An echo of the Material Plane,
where necrotic and shadow magic-

244
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,965
Yeah, exactly.

245
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,426
If that did exist,
a place like the Vale of Shadows,

246
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,844
how would we travel there?

247
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,805
- Theoretically.
- Well...

248
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,354
Picture... an acrobat...

249
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,815
standing on a tightrope.

250
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,526
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.

251
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,070
And our dimension has rules.

252
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,989
You can move forwards, or backwards.

253
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,075
But, what if...

254
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,287
right next to our acrobat,
there is a flea?

255
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,499
Now, the flea can also travel
back and forth, just like the acrobat.

256
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,875
- Right?
- Right.

257
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,253
Here's where things
get really interesting.

258
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,630
The flea can also travel this way...

259
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,841
along the side of the rope.

260
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,551
He can even go...

261
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,720
underneath the rope.

262
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,013
- Upside down.
- Exactly.

263
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,349
But we're not the flea,
we're the acrobat.

264
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,685
In this metaphor, yes,
we're the acrobat.

265
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,353
So we can't go upside down?

266
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,771
No.

267
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,607
Well, is there any way for the acrobat
to get to the Upside Down?

268
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,278
Well... you'd have to create
a massive amount of energy.

269
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,156
More than humans are currently
capable of creating, mind you,

270
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,533
to open up some kind of tear
in time and space,

271
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,826
and then...

272
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,083
you create a doorway.

273
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,836
- Like a gate?
- Sure. Like a gate.

274
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,714
- But again, this is all-
- Theoretical.

275
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,258
But... but what if this gate
already existed?

276
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,761
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.

277
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,137
It would disrupt gravity,

278
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,181
the magnetic field, our environment.

279
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,683
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.

280
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,478
Science is neat.

281
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,314
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.

282
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,951
Whoa.

283
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,539
Hey, Chief!

284
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,250
- Hello? Whoa!
- Hey!

285
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,546
- Jesus, Chief. You all right?
- What are you doing here?

286
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,300
- We tried calling, but-
- Yeah, the phone's dead.

287
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,805
Hey, so Bev Mooney came in
this morning all upset.

288
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,557
Said that Dale and Henry
went hunting yesterday...

289
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,683
and they didn't come back home.

290
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:54,230
She thought they were on another binger,
but she's not so sure now.

291
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,567
I think this whole Will Byers thing
has everybody on edge.

292
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,277
- Where was this?
- It was at the station.

293
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,279
No, no. Where did Henry
and Dale go hunting?

294
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,240
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.

295
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,825
Mirkwood.

296
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,159
What?

297
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,994
Okay.

298
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,789
You go back to the station.
I'll take care of this, all right?

299
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,542
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, leave it.

300
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,087
- Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.
- What?

301
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,090
Barbara Holland's car.
Seems she ran away after all.

302
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,717
Staties found it late last night
at a bus station.

303
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,845
Funny, right?
They keep doing our job for us.

304
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,724
Yeah.
It's funny.

305
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,856
Is he off his meds again?

306
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,568
He's been spending too much time
with Joyce Byers.

307
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:41,902
That's what I think.

308
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,036
What are you doing?

309
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,746
What does it look like I'm doing?

310
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,373
You want to freeze to death all winter?

311
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,589
- I told you not to take these down.
- They were in the way, babe.

312
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,049
How long are you gonna keep those up?
I mean, really?

313
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,390
You know, it's a shame
what they've done to this family.

314
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,267
- What?
- The Sattler Company.

315
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,060
I went to the quarry
on the way over here.

316
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,146
I just wanted to look around, you know?

317
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,732
Couldn't believe it.
I just couldn't believe it.

318
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,403
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.

319
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,531
Ought to be held accountable
if you ask me.

320
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,413
It would take a lot of energy
to build a gate like this.

321
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,581
But that's got to be what happened.

322
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,710
- Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?
- Right.

323
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,671
What we want to know is,
do you know where the gate is?

324
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,508
Then how do you know
about the Upside Down?

325
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,559
Dustin, what are you doing?
Dustin?

326
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:56,894
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

327
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,897
- I... I need to see your compasses.
- What?

328
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,274
Your compasses.
All of your compasses, right now!

329
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,365
What's exciting about this?

330
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,951
- Well, they're all facing north, right?
- Yeah, so?

331
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,912
- Well, that's not true north.
- What do you mean?

332
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,082
I mean exactly what I just said.
That's not true north.

333
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,501
Are you both seriously this dense?

334
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:26,715
The sun rises in the east,
and it sets in the west. Right?

335
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,176
Which means that's true north.

336
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,969
So what you're saying
is the compasses are broken.

337
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,515
Do you even understand
how a compass works?

338
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,850
- Do you see a battery pack on this?
- No.

339
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,936
No, you don't.
Because it doesn't need one.

340
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,814
The needle's naturally drawn
to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.

341
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,315
So what's wrong with them?

342
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,401
Well, that's what I couldn't figure out,
but then I remembered.

343
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,528
You can change the direction
of a compass with a magnet.

344
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,988
If there's the presence
of a more powerful magnetic field,

345
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,782
the needle deflects to that power.

346
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,534
And then I remembered
what Mr. Clarke said.

347
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,285
The gate would have so much power-

348
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,954
It could disrupt
the electromagnetic field.

349
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,080
Exactly.

350
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,541
Meaning, if we follow
the compasses' north...

351
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,584
They should lead us to the gate.

352
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,140
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

353
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,477
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

354
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,147
- Nothing.
- I hope that's not meant for me.

355
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,607
What? No.

356
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,734
Oh, no, I was just...

357
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,571
- thinking about joining softball.
- Oh.

358
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,531
Well, uh...

359
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:15,949
listen, I'm really sorry.

360
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,786
I mean, even before you threatened me
with the baseball bat.

361
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,622
Okay.

362
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,207
I panicked and...

363
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:28,086
- I mean, I was a total dick.
- Yeah, you were.

364
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,801
Did you get in trouble with your parents?

365
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,135
Totally, but...

366
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,387
you know, who cares?
Screw 'em.

367
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,306
Any news about Barbara?

368
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,352
- Parents heard from her? Or...
- No.

369
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,523
Hey, listen.

370
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,609
Why don't we, uh, why don't we
catch a movie tonight, you know?

371
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,362
Just kinda pretend everything's normal
for a few hours.

372
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,239
<i>All The Right Moves is still playing.</i>

373
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,742
<i>You know, with your lover boy
from Risky Business?</i>

374
00:26:58,826 --> 00:26:59,868
Yeah, I know.

375
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,620
You know, Carol thinks
I actually kinda look like him.

376
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,455
What do you think? Huh?

377
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,625
<i>♪ Just take those old records
Off the shelf ♪</i>

378
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,211
<i>♪ I'll sit and listen to them by myself ♪</i>

379
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,673
I just, I... I don't think I can.

380
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:17,219
I've been really busy
with this whole funeral thing and...

381
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,429
with my brother.

382
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,223
It's been really hard on him.

383
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,934
Yeah, sure.
Sure, yeah, yeah.

384
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,396
So...

385
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,149
I should go.

386
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,318
Sorry.

387
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,031
I'll call you later.
Is that okay?

388
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,786
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

389
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,749
<i>♪ Just take those old records
Off the shelf ♪</i>

390
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,418
<i>♪ I'll sit and listen to them... ♪</i>

391
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,890
You were here for the money!
No!

392
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,559
The money!
Admit it!

393
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,187
You aren't here 'cause of Will.
You never cared about him. You never did!

394
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,566
Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral today.
Do we have to do this right now?

395
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,193
- I can't believe I fell for this.
- I'm here to help, Joyce.

396
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,529
- To help?
- We could use that money for good.

397
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,282
Oh, like maybe
to pay off your debts?

398
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,701
To pay for Jonathan to go to school!

399
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,912
- Oh, don't do that.
- Do what?

400
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,997
- Lie to me!
- I'm not lying to you!

401
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,457
Yeah, well, where does he wanna go?

402
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,583
- Huh?
- What?

403
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,251
Where does Jonathan
want to go to college?

404
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,253
We get that money,
anywhere he damn well pleases!

405
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,088
NYU, Lonnie!

406
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:38,717
He's wanted to go to NYU
since he was six years old!

407
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,094
So then he goes to NYU!

408
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,346
Get out.

409
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,890
Get out!

410
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,975
You need me here, Joyce.

411
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,687
Oh, brother,
I have not needed you for a long time!

412
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,065
Oh, no?
Look what happened.

413
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,319
Oh, don't you dare.

414
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,863
- At least I was here!
- Oh, come on, Joyce.

415
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,823
Just look around at this place.

416
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,283
All your Christmas lights.

417
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,453
What the hell am I supposed to think?
You're such a great mom? You're a mess!

418
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,748
Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm crazy.
Maybe I'm out of my mind!

419
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:14,836
But, God help me, I will keep
these lights up until the day I die

420
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,631
if I think there's a chance
that Will's still out there!

421
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,635
Now, get out!

422
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,804
Get out of my house!

423
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,944
You're supposed
to hit the cans, right?

424
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:44,157
No, actually, you see the spaces
in between the cans?

425
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,118
I'm aiming for those.

426
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,244
Ah.

427
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,081
You ever shot a gun before?

428
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,042
Have you met my parents?

429
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,004
Yeah, I haven't shot one since I was ten.

430
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,507
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.

431
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,342
He made me kill a rabbit.

432
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,219
- A rabbit?
- Yeah.

433
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:08,015
I guess he thought it would make me
into more of a man or something.

434
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,434
I cried for a week.

435
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,685
Jesus.

436
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,021
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.

437
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,399
I meant your dad.

438
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,692
Yeah.

439
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,738
I guess he and my mother
loved each other at some point, but...

440
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,158
...I wasn't around for that part.

441
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,703
Um, yeah.

442
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,248
Just, uh, point and shoot.

443
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,211
I don't think my parents
ever loved each other.

444
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,255
They must've married for some reason.

445
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,715
My mom was young.

446
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,176
My dad was older,

447
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:49,348
but he had a cushy job, money,
came from a good family.

448
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,728
So they bought a nice house
at the end of the cul-de-sac...

449
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,772
and started their nuclear family.

450
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,691
Screw that.

451
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:00,942
Yeah.

452
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,570
Screw that.

453
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,085
<i>- Hello?
- Hey.</i>

454
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,670
<i>Jim?</i>

455
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,506
Yeah.

456
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,258
<i>Why are you calling me here?
I told you not to call me.</i>

457
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,969
I know, I know, I know.
I just wanted to...

458
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,430
I just wanted to hear your voice
and, uh...

459
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,643
I just wanted to say that, um...

460
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,525
even after everything that happened,
I don't...

461
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,277
I don't regret any of it.

462
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:47,239
And those seven years, they were...
everything to me.

463
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,783
<i>Have you been drinking?</i>

464
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,577
No.

465
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,831
No.

466
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,041
<i>Honey, hey...</i>

467
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,211
<i>Hey, it's okay...
it's okay.</i>

468
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,923
You know what, actually,
I have been drinking, I'm sorry.

469
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,383
<i>Jim, I can't...</i>

470
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,552
Just take care of yourself, okay?

471
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,011
Say hi to Bill for me.

472
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,388
<i>Are you sure-</i>

473
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,250
How much further?

474
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,421
I don't know.
These only tell direction, not distance.

475
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,716
You really need to learn more
about compasses.

476
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,259
I'm just saying.

477
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,761
How do we know
when we get to the gate?

478
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:55,515
Uh, I think a portal to another dimension
is gonna be pretty obvious.

479
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,022
Do you think she's acting weird?

480
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,692
You're asking if the weirdo
is acting weird?

481
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,904
I mean, weirder than normal?

482
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,615
I don't know.
Who cares?

483
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:21,917
How far, Papa?

484
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,252
Farther than we've ever gone before.

485
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,634
- The bath?
- Yes.

486
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,261
Yes, the bath.

487
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,058
Is that okay?

488
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,355
Okay.

489
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,570
Mike.

490
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,031
Yeah?

491
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,657
Turn back.

492
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,284
What? Why?

493
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,452
I'm tired.

494
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:24,331
Look, I'm sure we're almost there.
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

495
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,142
You never said what I was saying.

496
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,603
What?

497
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,812
Yesterday.

498
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,441
You said I was saying something
and that's why you took my picture.

499
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,692
Oh, uh...

500
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,861
I don't know.

501
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,531
My guess...

502
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:04,746
I saw this girl, you know,
trying to be someone else.

503
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,290
But for that moment...

504
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,834
it was like you were alone,
or you thought you were.

505
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,295
And, you know,
you could just be yourself.

506
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:18,093
That is such bullshit.

507
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,552
What?

508
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,264
I am not trying to be someone else.

509
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,850
Just because I'm dating Steve
and you don't like him-

510
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,561
You know what? Forget it.
I just thought it was a good picture.

511
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,647
He's actually a good guy.

512
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,815
Okay.

513
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,193
Yesterday, with the camera...

514
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,321
He's not like that at all.

515
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,699
He was just being protective.

516
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,617
Yeah, that's one word for it.

517
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,537
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?

518
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,122
No, I... I never said that.

519
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,415
He had every right to be pissed-

520
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,542
Okay, all right.
Does that mean I have to like him?

521
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,043
No.

522
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,212
Listen, don't take it so personally, okay?

523
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,173
I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.

524
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,262
You know, I was actually starting
to think that you were okay.

525
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,180
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

526
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,350
Yeah, I was thinking,
"Jonathan Byers,

527
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,645
maybe he's not the pretentious creep
everyone says he is. "

528
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,731
Well, I was just starting
to think you were okay.

529
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,691
- Oh.
- I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler,

530
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,694
she's not just another suburban girl
who thinks she's rebelling

531
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,697
by doing exactly what
every other suburban girl does...

532
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,408
until that phase passes
and they marry some boring one-time jock

533
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,659
who now works sales,

534
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,579
and they live out a perfectly boring
little life at the end of a cul-de-sac.

535
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,999
Exactly like their parents,
who they thought were so depressing,

536
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,084
but now, hey, they get it. "

537
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,305
Go away, Lonnie.

538
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,309
Seriously!

539
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,228
I am gonna murd-

540
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,108
What? What?

541
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,287
Oh, Jesus.

542
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,803
Oh, no.

543
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:27,680
"Oh, no"?
What's, "Oh, no"?

544
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,224
- We're headed back home.
- What?

545
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,558
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

546
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,977
Setting sun, right there.
We looped right back around.

547
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,605
And you're just realizing this now?

548
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,608
- Why is this all on me?
- Because you're the compass genius!

549
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,193
What do yours say?

550
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,820
North.

551
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,364
Makes no damn sense.

552
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,407
Maybe the gate moved.

553
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,368
No, I don't think it's the gate.

554
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,287
I think it's something else
screwing with the compasses.

555
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,122
Maybe it's something here.

556
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,625
No, it has to be like a super magnet.

557
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,377
It's not a magnet.

558
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,379
She's been acting weirder than normal.

559
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,298
If she can slam doors with her mind,
she can definitely screw up a compass.

560
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,424
Why would she do that?

561
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,468
Because she's trying
to sabotage our mission.

562
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,886
Because she's a traitor!

563
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,932
Lucas, what are you doing?

564
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,853
You did it, didn't you?

565
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,729
You don't want us to reach the gate.

566
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,648
You don't want us to find Will.

567
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,858
Lucas, come on, seriously,

568
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,109
- just leave her alone!
- Admit it.

569
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,819
- No.
- Admit it!

570
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,990
- Fresh blood. I knew it.
- Lucas, come on!

571
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,159
I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks!
She was using her powers!

572
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,036
Bull! That's old blood.
Right, El?

573
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,206
Right, El?

574
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,878
It's... not...

575
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,506
it's not safe.

576
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,069
Okay.

577
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,738
Should be okay, I mean...

578
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,824
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be okay.

579
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,576
What the hell is going on, Hopper?

580
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,870
They bugged my place.

581
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,288
- What?
- They bugged my place.

582
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,832
They put a microphone in the light.

583
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,171
It's because I'm on to them
and they know it.

584
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,964
- I don't know...
- Who?

585
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,424
I thought they might be watching you, too.

586
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,761
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA,
Department of Energy... I don't know.

587
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,013
You gotta explain this to me,
'cause I am not-

588
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,141
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.

589
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,602
What?

590
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,604
It wasn't him.

591
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,522
What?

592
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,733
Will's body, it was a fake.

593
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,408
You were right.

594
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,080
This whole time, you were right.

595
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,213
What did I tell you?
She's been playing us from the beginning!

596
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,507
That's not true.
She helped us find Will!

597
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,926
Find Will?

598
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,388
Where is he, then? Huh?
I don't see him.

599
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,140
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- No, I actually don't.

600
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,475
Just think about it, Mike.

601
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,228
She could've just told us where
the Upside Down was right away,

602
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,396
but she didn't.

603
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,439
She just made us
run around like headless chickens.

604
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,149
- All right, calm down!
- No!

605
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,026
She used us, all of us!

606
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,487
She helped just enough
so she could get what she wants.

607
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,780
Food and a bed.

608
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,074
- She's like a stray dog.
- Screw you, Lucas!

609
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,159
No! Screw you, Mike.
You're blind...

610
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,537
blind because you like
that a girl's not grossed out by you.

611
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,081
But wake up, man!
Wake the hell up!

612
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,208
She knows where Will is,

613
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,086
and now she's just letting him die
in the Upside Down.

614
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,630
- Shut up!
- For all we know, it's her fault.

615
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,756
Shut up.

616
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,300
We're looking for some stupid monster...

617
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:55,596
but did you ever stop to think
that maybe she's the monster?

618
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,016
I said shut up!

619
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,519
- Stop!
- Knock it off, you idiots.

620
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,937
- Stop it!
- Mike, get off!

621
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,981
Stop it!

622
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,446
Jesus!

623
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,325
Lucas! Lucas!
Lucas, are you all right?

624
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,161
- Lucas.
- Lucas, come on!

625
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,329
- Lucas, wake up! Lucas.
- Come on, Lucas!

626
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,081
Why would you do that?

627
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,542
- Come on.
- What's wrong with you?

628
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,837
What is wrong with you?

629
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,995
What is that?

630
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,414
I have no idea.

631
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:04,308
Help! Help!

632
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,187
Come on, wake up.
Come on!

633
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,232
Lucas...
Lucas, come on!

634
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,404
Lucas.

635
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,573
Lucas, you okay?

636
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,743
Lucas... Lucas,
how many fingers am I holding up?

637
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,203
Lucas, how many fingers?

638
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,289
- Let me see your head.
- Get off of me!

639
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,791
Just... Lucas.
Lucas, let me see.

640
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,168
Get off of me!

641
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,297
- Lucas, come on.
- Let him go.

642
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,593
Man, let him go.

643
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,932
Where is El?

644
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,144
El?

645
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,563
- El!
- Eleven!

646
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,482
El!

647
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,569
- Eleven!
- El!

648
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:58,863
Eleven!

649
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,222
What, are you tired?

650
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,766
Shut up.

651
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,892
What?

652
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,022
I heard something.

653
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,378
Oh, God.

654
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,845
It's been hit by a car.

655
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,520
We can't just leave it.

656
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,620
I'll do it.

657
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,166
- I thought you said-
- I'm not nine anymore.

658
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,405
What was that?

659
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,313
Where'd it go?

660
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,483
I don't know.

661
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,528
Do you see any more blood?

662
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,073
No.

663
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,912
Jonathan?

664
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,383
Nancy!

665
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,432
Nancy?

666
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,060
Nancy?

667
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,687
Nancy, where are you?

668
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,441
Nancy!

669
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:29,985
Nancy!
