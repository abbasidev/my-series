1
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,038
This the wall
she was talking about, Chief?

2
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,217
A trooper found
something in the, uh...

3
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,095
water that's at the quarry.

4
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,431
Our working theory right now
is that Will...

5
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:01,061
crashed his bike, he...
made his way over the quarry and, uh...

6
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,105
accidentally fell in.

7
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,567
The earth must have given way.

8
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,738
Joyce?

9
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,200
Joyce?

10
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,952
Do you understand what I'm saying?

11
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,245
No.

12
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,457
Whoever you found...

13
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,042
is not my boy.

14
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,961
- It's not Will.
- Joyce.

15
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,213
No, you don't understand.

16
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,049
I talked to him...

17
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,551
a half hour ago.

18
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,721
He was...
He was here.

19
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,098
He was...
He was talking with these.

20
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,808
- Talking?
- Uh-huh.

21
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,227
One blink for yes, two for no.

22
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,813
And... And, uh...

23
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:49,776
And then I made this
so he could talk to me.

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,195
'Cause he was hiding...

25
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,364
from that... that thing.

26
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,824
The thing that came out of the wall?

27
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,117
- The thing that chased you?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,411
- Yeah.
- Mom, come on, please.

29
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,538
- You've gotta stop this.
- No, maybe he's...

30
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,914
It's after him!

31
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,460
- He's in danger. We have to find him! We-
- What exactly was this thing?

32
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,919
It was some kind of animal, you said?

33
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,004
Uh, no, it was...

34
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,341
It was almost... human,
but it wasn't. It...

35
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:16,470
It had these long arms and...
it didn't have a face.

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,472
It didn't have a face?

37
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,975
- Joyce.
- It didn't have a face...

38
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,352
Joyce, listen to me.

39
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,895
Listen to me.

40
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,066
After Sarah...

41
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,070
I saw her, too.

42
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,237
And I heard her.

43
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,117
I didn't know what was real.

44
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,370
And then I figured out
that it was in my mind.

45
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,497
And I had to pack all that away.

46
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,792
Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole...

47
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,668
that I couldn't get out of.

48
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:52,589
No, you're...
you're talking about grief.

49
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,924
This is different.

50
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,470
- I'm just saying that you-
- No, I know what you're saying, Hop.

51
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,766
I swear to you,
I know what I saw.

52
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,102
And I'm not crazy.

53
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,020
I'm not saying that you're crazy.

54
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,022
No...
You are.

55
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,733
And I understand, but...

56
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,236
God, I...

57
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,905
I need you to believe me.

58
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,993
Please.

59
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,078
Listen...

60
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,458
I think you should go to the morgue
tomorrow and see him for yourself.

61
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,419
It'll give you the answers that you need.

62
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,878
- But tonight...
- Oh, God.

63
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,631
...I want you to try to get some sleep,
if you can.

64
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,003
<i>Byers' body was found
in the water of this quarry</i>

65
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,172
<i>by state police earlier this evening.</i>

66
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:43,009
<i>It was discovered by state trooper
David O'Bannon, just after dark.</i>

67
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,011
<i>The state police
are mounting an investigation</i>

68
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,972
<i>to determine Byers' cause of death,</i>

69
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,431
<i>but an initial inquiry...</i>

70
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,059
Should I go down and talk to Michael?

71
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,313
Give him time.

72
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,148
He'll come to us when he's ready.

73
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,668
Can you please stop that?

74
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,425
Are you deaf?

75
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,678
I thought we were friends, you know?

76
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,597
But friends tell each other the truth.

77
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,307
And they definitely don't lie
to each other.

78
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,226
You made me think Will was okay,
that he was still out there,

79
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,270
but he wasn't.
He wasn't!

80
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,357
Maybe you thought you were helping,
but you weren't.

81
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,652
You hurt me.
Do you understand?

82
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,988
What you did sucks.

83
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,742
Lucas was right about you.

84
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,744

Do you copy?

92
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,235
Over.

93
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,822
Will, are you there?

94
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,783
Will!

95
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,749
Was that...

96
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,875
Was it...

97
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,838
Will.

98
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,374
<i>Mom...</i>

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,673
Mom!

100
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,175
Mom! Wake up.

101
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,302
What... what time is it?

102
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,055
It's almost 8:00.
We have to go.

103
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,474
Go where? Where?

104
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,726
To see Will.

105
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,814
Michael?

106
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,027
Hi, honey.
How are you feeling?

107
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,696
I, uh...

108
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,657
I don't think I can go to school today.

109
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,451
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.

110
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,788
I need to drop off Nance,
then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents.

111
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,207
Why don't you grab a book
or something and come with me?

112
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,334
We can stop by the video store
on the way back,

113
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,753
pick out whatever you want.
Even R-rated.

114
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,589
I think I just want to stay home today.

115
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,132
I mean, if that's okay?

116
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,511
Well, are you sure you're gonna be
all right here by yourself?

117
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,054
I think so.

118
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,015
Okay.

119
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,434
But if you need anything,
call Dad at work.

120
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,394
- Okay.
- Okay.

121
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,357
Bye.

122
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,942
Bye, sweetie.

123
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,782
Lucas, do you copy?

124
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,077
<i>Lucas, come on, I know you're there!</i>

125
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,870
This is urgent.
I'm serious.

126
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,292
I'm not gonna stop until you answer.

127
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,794
Lucas.

128
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,337
Lucas!

129
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,214
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas...

130
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,591
<i>Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas-</i>

131
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,135
Go away, Mike.

132
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,221
I'm not in the mood, all right?
Over and out.

133
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,681
<i>No, not "out. "</i>

134
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,225
I'm not messing around, okay?
This is about Will.

135
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,227
<i>- Over.
- What about Will?</i>

136
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,729
You mean about his funeral?
Over.

137
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,981
No, not his funeral.

138
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,566
- Screw his funeral!
- What?

139
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,943
Just get over here stat.
And bring Dustin.

140
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,319
Over and out.

141
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,449
What's taking so long?

142
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,620
Well, everything's been a bit chaotic
around here without Gary.

143
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,581
Without Gary?

144
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,750
- Where's Gary?
- Well, I thought you knew.

145
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,212
Those men from State, they...
they sent Gary home last night.

146
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,674
So who did the autopsy?

147
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,843
Someone from State.

148
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,830
He has a birth mark on his right arm.

149
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,624
Can you show that to me, please?

150
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,339
How's your mom doing?

151
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,010
I don't know.

152
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,473
How long's this stuff been going on?
With the lights and, uh...

153
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,767
Will and the thing in the wall?

154
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,730
Since the first phone call, I guess.

155
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,403
You know, she's had anxiety problems...

156
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,696
in the past.

157
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,699
But this...

158
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,410
I don't know.

159
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,209
I'm worried it could be...

160
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,212
Ugh, I don't know.

161
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,093
She'll be okay.

162
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,512
We'll be okay.

163
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,266
My mom...

164
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,980
she's tough.

165
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,564
Yeah, she is.

166
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,485
Hey.

167
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,279
She is.

168
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,492
Ma'am!

169
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,119
- Ma'am, I need you to sign!
- I don't...

170
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,998
I don't know what you think that thing
is in there, but that is not my son!

171
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,833
- Joyce, wait a second.
- No!

172
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,043
- Mom!
- Ma'am, I- Ma'am!

173
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,342
So, wait a sec. I don't understand.
You went back to my house?

174
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,802
To look for Barb.

175
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,971
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you
just talk to me?

176
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,681
That's crazy.

177
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,600
I don't know, I... I was scared.

178
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,311
You seriously think
you saw a guy in a mask

179
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,063
just hanging out in my yard?

180
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,898
I don't think it was a mask.

181
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,775
But he had no face?

182
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,778
I don't know!

183
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,739
I don't know, I just...

184
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,408
I have a terrible feeling about this.

185
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,534
Oh, this is bad.

186
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,161
This is really bad.

187
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,287
What?

188
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,247
The cops...

189
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,083
they're gonna want to talk
to all of us now.

190
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,670
Tommy, Carol,
everybody who was at the party.

191
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,714
- So?
- My parents are gonna murder me!

192
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,759
Are you serious right now?

193
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,927
You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.

194
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,514
Barb is missing!
And you're worried about your dad?

195
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,934
Okay, just...
When you talk to the cops, just...

196
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,936
don't mention the beers.

197
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,813
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,

198
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,024
and Barbara's got nothing to do with it,
okay?

199
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,069
I can't believe you right now.

200
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,155
- I can't believe you.
- Nancy.

201
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,158
Nancy, wait!

202
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,078
Nancy!

203
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,039
- Mom, will you get in?
- No, I...

204
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,541
I need to think.
Just go on home.

205
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,585
Mom, will you just get in, please?

206
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,881
Mom.

207
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,717
Mom!

208
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,179
Mom.

209
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,640
- Stop.
- Just go home, Jonathan.

210
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,476
No, this is not an okay time
for you to shut down.

211
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,978
- Shut down? What...
- We have to deal with this, Mom.

212
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,772
We have to deal with the funeral!

213
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,315
The funeral?

214
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,318
For... for who?
For that thing back there?

215
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,445
Okay, let me get this straight.

216
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,698
Will, that's not his body,
because he's in the lights, right?

217
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,617
And there's a monster in the wall?

218
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,202
Do you even hear yourself?

219
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,205
I know it sounds crazy.

220
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,623
I sound crazy!

221
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,500
- Yeah.
- You think I don't know that?

222
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,751
It is crazy!

223
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,670
But I heard him, Jonathan.

224
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,422
He talked to me!

225
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,341
Will is... is calling to me!

226
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,303
And he's out there, and he's alone,
and he's scared, and I...

227
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,347
I don't care if anyone believes me!

228
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:36,018
I am not gonna stop looking for him
until I find him and bring him home.

229
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,188
I am going to bring him home!

230
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,066
Yeah, well,
while you're talking to the lights,

231
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,652
the rest of us are having
a funeral for Will!

232
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,780
I'm not letting him sit in that freezer
another day!

233
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,202
All right, show's over.

234
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,247
What?

235
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,346
We keep losing the signal,
but you heard it, right?

236
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,849
Yeah, I heard a baby.

237
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,975
What?

238
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,853
Mike, you obviously tapped
into a baby monitor.

239
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,521
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.

240
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,398
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?

241
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,774
- That was Will!
- Mike...

242
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,068
Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.

243
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,361
Words!

244
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,198
He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him!

245
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,492
Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him,
then I guess-

246
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,826
Are you sure you're on the right channel?

247
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,911
I don't think it's about that.

248
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,664
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.

249
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,417
- Like... like Professor X.
- Yeah.

250
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,169
Are you actually believing this crap?

251
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,129
I don't know, I mean...

252
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:48,049
Do you remember when Will
fell off his bike and broke his finger?

253
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,343
He sounded a lot like that.

254
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,471
Did you guys not see what I saw?

255
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,806
They pulled Will's body out of the water.

256
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,433
He's dead!

257
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,230
Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.

258
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,981
- It's not his ghost.
- So how do you know that?

259
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,733
- I just do!
- Then what was in that water?

260
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,901
I don't know!

261
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,195
All I know is Will is alive.

262
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,738
Will is alive!

263
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,156
He's out there somewhere.

264
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,866
All we have to do is find him.

265
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,999
This isn't gonna work.

266
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,960
We need to get El to a stronger radio.

267
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,046
- Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
- Yeah.

268
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,172
The Heathkit's at school.

269
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:32,510
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo
in there without anyone noticing.

270
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,471
I mean... look at her.

271
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,559
Wow.

272
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,686
- She looks-
- Pretty.

273
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,106
Good.

274
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,482
You look pretty good.

275
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,000
Pretty.

276
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,961
Good.

277
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,840
Clear.

278
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,472
- You boys hear me all right in there?
- Loud and clear, Shepard.

279
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,266
Good luck in there, son.

280
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,330
"The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness,

281
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,416
bearing us down towards the sea

282
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,252
with twice the speed
of our upward progress.

283
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,006
And Kurtz's life
was running swiftly, too-"

284
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,550
Nancy Wheeler?

285
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,510
If you'll come with me, please?

286
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,935
This argument
you and Barbara had?

287
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,645
What exactly was it about?

288
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,858
It wasn't really an argument.

289
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,819
Barb just wanted to leave.

290
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,030
I didn't, so, I...

291
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,658
I told her to just go home.

292
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,869
Then what?

293
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,665
Then I went upstairs
to put on some dry clothes.

294
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,627
And the next day, you went back and...

295
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,128
saw a bear, you're thinking?

296
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,841
I don't know what it was, but...

297
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,134
I think...

298
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,222
I think maybe it took Barb.

299
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,599
- You need to check behind Steve's house-
- We did.

300
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,017
There's nothing there.

301
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,770
- There's no sign of a bear.
- And no car.

302
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,021
- What?
- Look.

303
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,357
We figure that Barbara
came back last night

304
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,567
and then she took off,
went somewhere else.

305
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,820
Has she ever talked to you
about running off?

306
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,363
Leaving town, maybe?

307
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,572
No.

308
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,866
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.

309
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,328
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact
that you were spending time with this boy?

310
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,622
Uh, Steve Harrington?

311
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,332
What? No!

312
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,585
Maybe she was jealous
because she saw you go up to Steve's room?

313
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,753
It wasn't like that.

314
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,963
Like what?

315
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,924
Steve and me, we're... we're just friends.

316
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,759
We... we just talked.

317
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,888
Now was this before or after
you changed out of your clothes?

318
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,853
So, Gary, tell me
about these troopers that brought in Will.

319
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,147
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.

320
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,482
They're all Staties?

321
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,567
Yes, sir.

322
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,695
Never seen that many troopers
come with a body before.

323
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,573
They told you that they were gonna
take care of the autopsy, huh?

324
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,575
Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.

325
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,661
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top
to me, considering...

326
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,580
Considering what?

327
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,791
Considering this was Will Byers
and not John F. Kennedy.

328
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,427
- Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
- Sure thing.

329
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,054
<i>...let the people know that, uh,
the troopers are on duty</i>

330
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,683
<i>and you should be safe, because we think
this is just an isolated incident.</i>

331
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,269
<i>State trooper David O'Bannon,
thank you so much for your help.</i>

332
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,937
<i>Thank you, sir.
Back to you...</i>

333
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,836
Okay, remember,
if anyone sees us, look sad.

334
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,588
<i>Attention students,</i>

335
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:47,343
<i>there will be an assembly to honor
Will Byers in the gymnasium now.</i>

336
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,261
<i>Do not go to fourth period.</i>

337
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,512
It's locked.

338
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,765
- What?
- Hey, do you think you can open it?

339
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,558
With your powers?

340
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,101
Boys?

341
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,186
Hey.

342
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,771
Assembly's about to start.

343
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,607
We know.
We're just, you know...

344
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,484
Upset.

345
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,860
Yeah, definitely upset.

346
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,403
We need some alone time.

347
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,656
- To cry.
- Yeah, listen...

348
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:09,990
I get it. I do.

349
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,077
I know how hard this is,
but let's just be there for Will, huh?

350
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,578
And then...

351
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,583
the Heathkit is all yours
for the rest of the day.

352
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,085
What do you say?

353
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,671
I don't believe we've met.
What's your name?

354
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,424
- Eleven-
- Eleanor! She's my, uh-

355
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,592
- Cousin.
- Second cousin.

356
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,886
She's here for Will's funeral.

357
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,222
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle,
Eleanor.

358
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,349
I wish you were here
under better circumstances.

359
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,475
Thank you.

360
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,144
Uh, where are you from exactly?

361
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,605
Bad place-

362
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,399
- Sweden!
- I have a lot of Swedish family.

363
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,900
- She hates it there.
- Cold!

364
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,569
Subzero.

365
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,114
- Shall we?
- Yep!

366
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,908
<i>At times like these...</i>

367
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,829
it is important that we come together
as a community.

368
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,123
We come-

369
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,627
Abort.

370
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,215
We come together to heal...

371
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,843
we come together to grieve...

372
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,888
- You lied to the police!
- I didn't lie!

373
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,224
How naive do you think I am?

374
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,435
You and Steve were just talking?

375
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,769
We slept together!

376
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,105
Is that what you want to know?
It doesn't matter!

377
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,525
- It does matter!
- No! It is all bullshit!

378
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,819
It has nothing to do with Barb
and she's missing.

379
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,779
And something terrible
happened to her. I know it.

380
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,781
I know it!

381
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,908
And no one is listening to me!

382
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,535
Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.

383
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,329
- I'm listening to you-
- No! You're not!

384
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,415
Nancy... Nancy!

385
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,208
Just leave me alone!

386
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,848
Try him again.

387
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,559
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

388
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,230
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

389
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,651
<i>This is Shepard.
Confirming, over.</i>

390
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,529
Shepard.
Where are you?

391
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:39,032
Can you describe to us
what it is you see? Over.

392
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,994
<i>It's low visibility.
I'm about one click south of the rift.</i>

393
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,581
<i>Everything's still here,
but it's all eroded. Covered in blood...</i>

394
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,084
Shepard? Do you copy?

395
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,338
Shepard?
Can you hear me?

396
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,049
<i>There's something else...
There's something else in here!</i>

397
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,928
Reel him in.

398
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,056
- Reel him back in!
- Get him in.

399
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,516
Come on, come on!
Faster!

400
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,101
<i>There's something else in here!</i>

401
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,228
<i>Pull me out!
Pull me out, pull me out!</i>

402
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,522
<i>Pull me out! Pull me out!</i>

403
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,087
Shepard, come in. Over.
Comms are down, sir.

404
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,756
Shepard, come in!
Over.

405
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,122
<i>Will Byers' death
is an unimaginable tragedy.</i>

406
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:14,670
Will was an exceptional student
and a wonderful friend to all of us.

407
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:20,259
It's impossible to express the hole
his loss will leave in our community.

408
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,637
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.

409
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,390
She's a local grief counselor
from the church over in Jonesboro.

410
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,101
But before she comes up here,

411
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:33,355
I just want those of you who are having
trouble dealing with this tragic loss...

412
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,606
Look at these fakers.

413
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,442
They probably didn't even know
his name till today.

414
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,152
What?

415
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,947
Who is interested in this?
This is so stupid.

416
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,491
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

417
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,743
Oh,
he was such a great student.

418
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:51,123
Oh, he's going to leave
a hole in the community.

419
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,791
Mouth breather.

420
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,976
Hey! Hey!

421
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,562
Hey, Troy!

422
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,607
You... you think this is funny?

423
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,109
What'd you say, Wheeler?

424
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,737
I saw you guys
laughing over there.

425
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,947
And I think that's
a real messed up thing to do.

426
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,074
Didn't you listen to the counselor,
Wheeler?

427
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,784
Grief shows itself in funny ways.

428
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,872
Besides, what's there to be
sad about, anyway?

429
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,915
Will's in fairyland now, right?

430
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,960
Flying around
with all the other little fairies.

431
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,545
All happy and gay!

432
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,144
You're dead, Wheeler!

433
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,937
Dead!

434
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,658
Dude, Troy peed himself.

435
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,502
Holy shit!

436
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,092
Hey! What's going on here?

437
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,259
Oh.

438
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,428
Mike! Let's go!

439
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:40,482
It's made of soft wood
with a crepe interior.

440
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,986
Uh, now, I...
I don't know what your budget is,

441
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,740
but over here, we...
we have copper and bronze.

442
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,457
Can you just give me a second?

443
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,583
Of course.

444
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,631
Hey.

445
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,425
Hey.

446
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,971
Your mom, um... she said you'd be here.

447
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:14,599
I just...

448
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,146
Can we talk for a second?

449
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,401
It looks like it could be
some kind of perspective distortion,

450
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,528
but I wasn't using the wide angle.

451
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,156
I don't know.

452
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,449
It's weird.

453
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,163
And you're sure you didn't see
anyone else out there?

454
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,039
No.

455
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,584
And she was there one second
and then, um...

456
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,211
gone.

457
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,921
I figured she bolted.

458
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,340
The cops think that she ran away.

459
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,344
But they don't know Barb.

460
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,014
And I went back to Steve's...

461
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,767
and I thought I...

462
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,644
saw something.

463
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,021
Some...

464
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,274
weird man or...

465
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,777
I don't know what it was.

466
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,159
I'm sorry.

467
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:18,163
I... I shouldn't have come
here today. I'm...

468
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,081
I'm so sorry.

469
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,541
What'd he look like?

470
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,253
What?

471
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,589
This man you saw in the woods.

472
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,633
What'd he look like?

473
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,637
I don't know.

474
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,433
It was almost like he...

475
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,559
he didn't have-

476
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,478
Didn't have a face?

477
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,565
How did you know that?

478
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,248
Aw, come on!

479
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,668
Another, please.

480
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,711
And another for my, uh, friend here.

481
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,756
Oh, thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

482
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,425
Yeah, that's all right.
I'm, uh... I'm celebrating.

483
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,387
My daughter,
she won the spelling bee today.

484
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,722
Is that right?

485
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,307
Yeah, that's right.

486
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,686
"Odontalgia. "

487
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,646
That was the word.

488
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,565
You know what it means?

489
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,109
It's a fancy name for a toothache.

490
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:35,073
Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart.
Don't know where she gets it from.

491
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,450
I've been tryin'
to figure that out for years.

492
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,245
Your daughter, she got a name?

493
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,125
What?

494
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,752
Your daughter?
What's her name?

495
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,505
Sarah.

496
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,008
Her name's Sarah.

497
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,511
To Sarah.

498
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,690
I recognize you.

499
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,025
Are you famous or somethin'?

500
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,404
Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh...
I found that Byers boy.

501
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,575
So, you on that case or what?

502
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,327
I just saw him on patrol, you know?

503
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,536
Dumb luck.

504
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,415
So that quarry, that's, uh...

505
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,917
that's state-run,
where they found the boy, huh?

506
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,337
Yeah.

507
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,718
Yeah, well, that's funny.

508
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,055
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact
that it's run by the Sattler Company.

509
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,975
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got
a couple operational quarries up in Roane.

510
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,435
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

511
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,562
That's right.

512
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,815
So why are you lying to me, man?

513
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,236
What's your problem, bud?

514
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,946
I don't have a problem.

515
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,491
I'm just a concerned citizen.

516
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,742
Yeah?

517
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,495
Well, stick your nose someplace else.

518
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,871
The kid is dead.

519
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,122
End of story.

520
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,086
Thanks for ruining the game, dick.

521
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,637
Okay...

522
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,681
Let's try this one more time.

523
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,766
Who told you to be out there?

524
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,601
What were you doing out there?

525
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,105
I don't know!
I don't know. They...

526
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,442
they just told me to call it in
and not let anybody get too close.

527
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,152
Get close to what?

528
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,487
The body.

529
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,156
Who do you work for?

530
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,701
The NSA? Hawkins Lab?

531
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,620
Who is that?

532
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,580
- You're gonna get us both killed.
- Who is that?

533
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,083
Hey! Hey!

534
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,688
Come on!
Come on!

535
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,525
Talk to me!

536
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,902
I know you're here!

537
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,782
Come on.

538
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,789
- Now what?
- She'll find him.

539
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,999
Right, El?

540
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,137
Eleven?

541
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,766
Are you listening?

542
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,645
That man before you...

543
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,401
I need you to find him.

544
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,159
- Hurt him?
- No.

545
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,828
No, I don't want you to hurt him.

546
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,457
I want you to listen to him.

547
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,837
- Listen?
- Yes.

548
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,343
I want you to listen to what he says
and repeat his words back to me.

549
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,931
Just like we used to
with those old nursery rhymes.

550
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,432
Do you remember?

551
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,185
Hmm?

552
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,395
Do you think you can do that for me?

553
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,149
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

554
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,085
<i>Begin.</i>

555
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,003
Amulet.

556
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:00,922
Frigid.

557
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,882
Evolve.

558
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,051
Airplane.

559
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,303
Eleven?

560
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,056
Repeat the words.

561
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,813
<i>Apricot.</i>

562
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,982
<i>Peninsula.</i>

563
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,817
<i>Game.</i>

564
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,360
<i>Enchantment.</i>

565
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,445
<i>Mouse.</i>

566
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,781
<i>Balloon.</i>

567
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,616
She's doing it.

568
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,410
- She's finding him!
- This is crazy.

569
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,287
Calm down.
She just closed her eyes.

570
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,707
Holy...

571
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,841
What is that?

572
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,776
<i>Mom?</i>

573
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,778
Will?

574
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,280
<i>Mom?</i>

575
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,657
No way!

576
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,534
<i>- Mom...
- Will!</i>

577
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,660
<i>Please...</i>

578
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,078
Will!

579
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,080
Will!

580
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,208
Will...

581
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:21,669
Will!

582
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,087
<i>- Mom!
- Will!</i>

583
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,590
I'm here! I'm here!

584
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,883
<i>- Oh, God...
- Mom!</i>

585
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,927
- Will!
- Will, it's us! Are you there?

586
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,386
Can you hear us?
We're here!

587
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,472
<i>Hello? Mom?</i>

588
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,598
Why can't he hear us?

589
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,891
I don't know!

590
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,769
Baby...

591
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,647
- Mom?
- Oh, God. Will!

592
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,731
Mom!

593
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,775
Oh, thank God.

594
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,652
Baby...

595
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:46,778
Will...

596
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,988
Mom...

597
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,406
Mom, it's coming!

598
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,700
Tell me where you are!
How do I get to you?

599
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,286
<i>It's like home,
but it's so dark...</i>

600
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:59,248
<i>It's so dark and empty.
And it's cold!</i>

601
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,541
<i>Mom? Mom!</i>

602
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,920
Listen to me!
I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay?

603
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,838
But right now, I need you to hide.

604
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,298
Mom, please!

605
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,968
No, no, listen! Listen, I...

606
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:13,012
I will find you, but you have to run now!

607
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,431
Run! Run!

608
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,583
- El, are you okay?
- Oh!

609
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,712
Can you move?

610
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,133
Here, help her up.

611
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,294
This way!

612
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,260
And you're...

613
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,679
Brightening.
Enlarging.

614
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:37,889
Hmm.

615
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,019
Did your mom say anything else?

616
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:47,148
Like, um,
where it might have gone to, or...

617
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,651
No, just that it came out of the wall.

618
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,035
How long does this take?

619
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,204
Not long.

620
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,084
Have you been...

621
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,002
doing this a while?

622
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,670
What?

623
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,005
Photography?

624
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,716
Yeah.

625
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:18,805
I guess I'd rather observe
people than, you know...

626
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,932
Talk to them.

627
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,975
I know.
It's weird.

628
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,060
No!

629
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,270
No, it is.

630
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,855
It's just, sometimes...

631
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,567
people don't really say
what they're really thinking.

632
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,403
But you capture the right moment...

633
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,656
it says more.

634
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,116
What was I saying?

635
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,743
What?

636
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,120
When you took my picture.

637
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,456
I shouldn't have taken that.

638
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,668
I'm, uh...

639
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,294
I'm sorry.

640
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,673
It's just-

641
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,299
That's it.

642
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,344
That's what I saw.

643
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,807
My mom...

644
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,851
I thought she was crazy

645
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,686
'cause she said...

646
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,522
that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.

647
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,275
- And if he's alive-
- Then Barbara.

648
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,337
- Hey, Patty!
- Hey, uh, need something, Chief?

649
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,923
- Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
- Oh.

650
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,717
I'll just be a minute.

651
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,892
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.

652
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,018
Hey, you can't be back here.

653
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,686
Yeah, I just got off the line
with O'Bannon.

654
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,730
He said that he needs
to see you at the station.

655
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,899
- It's some emergency...
- What the hell are you talking about?

656
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,108
I don't work with O'Bannon.

657
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,985
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...

658
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,989
Okay.

659
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,799
Babe...

660
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,217
Jesus, the hell happened?

661
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:28,929
Lonnie.
