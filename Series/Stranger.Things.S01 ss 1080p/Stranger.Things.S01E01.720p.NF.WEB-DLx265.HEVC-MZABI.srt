1
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:48,150
Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

2
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,821
A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

3
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,865
- It is almost here.
- What is it?

4
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,283
What if it's the Demogorgon?

5
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,411
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

6
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,537
It's not the Demogorgon.

7
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,873
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

8
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,083
- Troglodytes?
- Told ya.

9
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,963
Wait a minute.

10
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,591
Did you hear that?

11
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,092
That... that sound?

12
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,845
Boom... boom...

13
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,680
- Boom!

14
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,641
That didn't come from the troglodytes.
No, that...

15
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,392
That came from something else.

16
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,855
- The Demogorgon!

17
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,398
- We're in deep shit.
- Will, your action!

18
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,775
- I don't know!
- Fireball him!

19
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,151
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

20
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,070
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

21
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,697
- Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
- Cast Protection.

22
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,492
The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

23
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,369
It stomps towards you.

24
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,453
- Boom!
- Fireball him!

25
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,830
- Another stomp, boom!
- Cast Protection.

26
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,750
- He roars in anger!

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,335
- Fireball!

28
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,045
- Oh, shit!
- Where'd it go?

29
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,838
Where is it?
I don't know!

30
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,465
- Is it a 13?
- I don't know!

31
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,716
Where is it?
Oh, my God!

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,385
Mike!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

33
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,552
Mike!
Can you find it yet?

34
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,720
No, I can't find it!

35
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,472
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,349
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

37
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,559
You mean the end?
Fifteen after.

38
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,813
Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
Why do we have to go?

39
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,607
- Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
- It's a school night, Michael.

40
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,151
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

41
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,778
- But that'll ruin the flow!
- Michael-

42
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,113
I'm serious, Mom.

43
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,657
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

44
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,659
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

45
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,619
You've been playing for ten hours?

46
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,749
- Dad, don't you think that 20 more-
- I think you should listen to your mother.

47
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,294
- Dang dumb piece of junk.

48
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,297
Oh, I got it!

49
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,258
- Does the seven count?
- It was a seven?

50
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,469
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

51
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,267
Yo, hey, guys.

52
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,227
- Does anyone want this?
- No.

53
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,857
Yeah.

54
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,234
No, I don't think...

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,945
Yeah, he's cute.

56
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,365
Barb, no, I don't think so.

57
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,908
- Barb, you're not-
- Hey, Nancy.

58
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,161
There's a slice left if you want it.

59
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,580
- Sausage and pepperoni!
- Hold on.

60
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,382
- There's something wrong with your sister.
- What are you talking about?

61
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,259
- She's got a stick up her butt.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,845
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

63
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,680
Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

64
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,098
She's always been a real jerk.

65
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,058
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

66
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,519
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

67
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,812
Four years ago!

68
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,355
Just saying.
Later.

69
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,984
- It was a seven.
- Huh?

70
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,819
The roll, it was a seven.

71
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,114
The Demogorgon, it got me.

72
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,159
See you tomorrow.

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,844
Good night, ladies.
Kiss your mom 'night for me.

74
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,264
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

75
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,016
- Any comic?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,019
Hey! Hey!

77
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,063
I didn't say "go"!

78
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,150
Get back here!

79
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,361
I'm gonna kill you!

80
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,863
<i>I'll take your X-Men 134!</i>

81
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,704
Son of a bitch.

82
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,140
Mom?

83
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,767
- Jonathan? Mom?

84
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,417
- Hello? Hello?

85
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,405
<i>And that's it
for News Center this morning.</i>

86
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,823

<i>Let's hand off now to Liz

88
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,702
<i>All right, thank you, Donna.</i>

89
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,870
<i>Turning now to local news,</i>

90
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,373
<i>we're getting reports of surges
and power outages all across the county.</i>

91
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,418
<i>Last night, hundreds of homes

92
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,879
<i>leaving many residents in the dark.</i>

93
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,090
<i>The cause of the outage is still unknown.</i>

94
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,383
<i>We reached out to Roane County

Mmm.

99

<i>In other news,
you might wanna stay home tonight</i>

100
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,078
<i>or at least pack an umbrella.</i>

101
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,581
<i>We turn to everybody's favorite
morning weather guy, Charles.</i>

102
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,087
Where the hell are they?

103
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,590
- Jonathan?
- Check the couch!

104
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,799
Ugh, I did.

105
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,386
Oh... Got them.

106
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,848
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

107
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,766
- Yeah, see you later.
- Where's Will?

108
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,934
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.

109
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,144
- He's probably still sleeping.

110
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,355
- Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
- Mom, I'm making breakfast.

111
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,274
I told you this a thousand times.

112
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,986
Will! Come on, honey.
It's time to get up.

113
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,743
- He came home last night, right?
- He's not in his room?

114
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,120
- Did he come home or not?
- I don't know.

115
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,455
- You don't know?
- No.

116
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,582
I got home late.
I was working.

117
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,708
You were working?

118
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,710
Eric asked if I could cover.
I said yeah.

119
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,253
I just thought we could use
the extra cash.

120
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,048
- Jonathan, we've talked about this.
- I know, I know.

121
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,050
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

122
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,302
Mom, it's not a big deal.
Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.

123
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,055
- I'm sure he just stayed over.
- I can't believe you.

124
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,724
I can't believe you sometimes.

125
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,272
- That's disgusting.

126
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,566
- You're disgusting!
- Hello?

127
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,401
Hi, Karen.
It's Joyce.

128
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,528
- Oh, Joyce, hi.
- What the hell, Mike?

129
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,780
- Hey!
- Quiet!

130
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,573
- Language.
- Are you kidding?

131
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,033
Was that Will I heard back there?

132
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,618
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

133
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,119
Will didn't spend the night?

134
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,622
<i>No, he left here
a little bit after 8:00.</i>

135
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,040
Why? He's not home?

136
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,961
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

137
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,046
<i>- Thank you so much. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.</i>

138
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,904
That's weird.
I don't see him.

139
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,531
I'm telling you, his mom's right.

140
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,449
He probably just
went to class early again.

141
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,035
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

142
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,037
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

143
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,374
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

144
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,085
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

145
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:19,757
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

146
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,346
I'd go with Toothless.

147
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,891
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

148
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,727
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

149
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,812
"I told you a million times. "

150
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,939
- Do the arm thing.

151
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,066
Do it, freak!

152
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,658
God, it gets me every time.

153
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,829
- Assholes.
- I think it's kinda cool.

154
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,081
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

155
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,042
Like Mr. Fantastic.

156
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,377
Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

157
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,512
So, did he call?

158
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,140
Keep your voice down.

159
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,808
Did he?

160
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,643
I told you, it's not like that.

161
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,981
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

162
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,983
We just...

163
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,611
made out a couple times.

164
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,073
"We just... made out a couple times. "

165
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,491
Nance, seriously,

166
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,659
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

167
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,161
No, I'm not.

168
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,915
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

169
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,793
If you become friends with Tommy H.
or Carol-

170
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,169
Oh, that's gross!

171
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,421
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

172
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,341
- Two-time thing.

173
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,472
You were saying?

174
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,359
- Steve...
- Mmm-hmm?

175
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,111
- I have to go.
- In a minute.

176
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,864
Steve.
I really, like...

177
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,783
Seriously, I have to go.

178
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,243
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's...

179
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,203
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

180
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,206
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

181
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,542
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

182
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,335
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

183
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,587
- Well, then, just let me help.
- You failed chem.

184
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,673
- C-minus.
- Well, in that case...

185
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,092
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

186
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,137
- Are you crazy? My mom would not-
- I'll climb through your window.

187
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,389
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

188
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,723
You are crazy.

189
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,642
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

190
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,018
We can just...

191
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,020
We can just, like, chill in my car.

192
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,065
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

193
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,569
Steve... I have to study.

194
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,362
I'm not kidding.

195
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,739
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

196
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,493
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

197
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,043
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

198
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,254
To study.

199
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,768
Good of you to show.

200
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,522
Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

201
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:25,276
- Hey, Chief.
- Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

202
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,360
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

203
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,988
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

204
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,699
While you were drinking or sleeping,

205
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,744
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

206
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,828
Phil Larson called.

207
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,581
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

208
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,124
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

209
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,460
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

210
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,086
On a more pressing matter,

211
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,214
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

212
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,050
Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

213
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,344
- Just give me a minute.
- Joyce is very upset.

214
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,304
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

215
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,723
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

216
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,685
- Chief, she's already in your-
- Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

217
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,949
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

218
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,618
And I apologize again.

219
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,078
I'm going out of my mind!

220
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,748
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

221
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,833
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

222
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,460
- He wouldn't do that.
- Well, you never know.

223
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,254
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

224
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,922
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

225
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,674
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

226
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,718
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

227
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,304
He's not like... most.

228
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,267
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

229
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,185
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

230
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,312
- They laugh at him, his clothes-
- His clothes?

231
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,356
- What's wrong with his clothes?
- I don't know.

232
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,733
- Does that matter?
- Maybe.

233
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,861
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

234
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,657
Lonnie...
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

235
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,075
Called him a fag.

236
00:17:56,158 --> 00:18:00,079
- Is he?
- He's missing is what he is.

237
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,958
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

238
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,423
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

239
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,259
- But he has nothing to do with this.
- Why don't you give me his number?

240
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,219
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

241
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,514
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

242
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,725
the kid is with a parent or relative.

243
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,310
What about the other time?

244
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,730
- What?
- You said, "99 out of 100."

245
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,857
- What about the other time, the one?
- Joyce.

246
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,066
The one!

247
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,985
- Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?

248
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,820
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

249
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,988
in the four years I've been working here?

250
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,239
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

251
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,451
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

252
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,244
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

253
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,997
Okay, fine.
I will call Lonnie.

254
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,790
He will talk to me before he talks to-

255
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,834
- What, a pig?
- A cop!

256
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,921
Just find my son, Hop.

257
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,882
Find him!

258
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,645
Dr. Brenner.

259
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,273
This way, gentlemen.

260
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,193
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

261
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,113
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

262
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,930
This is where it came from?
Yes.

263
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,015
And the girl?

264
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,769
She can't have gone far.

265
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,740
All right, and one more.

266
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,618
Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

267
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,245
Hey, I don't know.
I don't know.

268
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,664
I don't know,
37 points per game average-

269
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,457
Thirty-seven now, but...
Mr. Basket.

270
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,114
Hey!

271
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,323
Come here!

272
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,367
Hey, come here!

273
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,082
You think you can steal from me, boy?

274
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:58,752
What in the hell?

275
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,132
- Remember, finish chapter 12

276
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,011
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

277
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,221
and other forms of science investigation.

278
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:13,183
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

279
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:16,312
It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

280
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,356
So, did it come?

281
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,816
Sorry, boys.

282
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,776
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

283
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:24,903
it came.

284
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,491
Yes!

285
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,368
The Heathkit ham shack.

286
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,911
Whoa.
Ain't she a beaut?

287
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,039
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

288
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,290
Think bigger.

289
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,375
- California?
- Bigger.

290
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,835
Australia?

291
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,379
- Oh, man!

292
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,341
When Will sees this,
he's totally gonna blow his shit.

293
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,508
Lucas!

294
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,968
- Sorry.

295
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,931
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

296
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,726
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

297
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,479
What are you doing?

298
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,730
Hello, this is Dustin,

299
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,816
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

300
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,069
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

301
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:12,076
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow
Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

302
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,624
Okay, okay, okay.

303
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,669
One at a time, all right?
You.

304
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,380
- You said he takes what?
- Mirkwood.

305
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,049
- Mirkwood?
- Yeah.

306
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,636
- Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
- I have not. That sounds made up to me.

307
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,513
<i>No, it's from Lord of the Rings.</i>

308
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,474
<i>- Well, The Hobbit.
- It doesn't matter.</i>

309
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,393
- He asked!
- "He asked!"

310
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,061
- Shut up, guys!
- Hey, hey, hey!

311
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,105
- What'd I just say?
- Shut up.

312
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,483
One at a damn time.
You.

313
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,778
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

314
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,238
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

315
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,824
- Yeah, all right, I think I know that-
- We can show you, if you want.

316
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,242
I said that I know it!

317
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,244
- We can help look.
- Yeah.

318
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,246
- No.

319
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,457
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

320
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,750
Immediately.

321
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,629
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

322
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:06,797
no nonsense.

323
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,841
<i>This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.</i>

324
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,719
<i>- The Hobbit.
- Shut up!</i>

325
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,178
- Hey!
- Stop it!

326
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,390
Do I make myself clear?

327
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:26,150
Do I make myself... clear?

328
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,944
Yes, sir.
Yeah.

329
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,499
Ring-a-ding-ding!

330
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,293
Anybody home?

331
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,003
Password?

332
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,046
Uh, Rada...

333
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,884
Radaga- Radagast?

334
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,386
Yeah. You may enter.

335
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,930
Thank you, sir.

336
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,558
So, guess what?

337
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,102
I got off early and...

338
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,855
<i>Ta-da!
Poltergeist.</i>

339
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,482
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

340
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,941
I changed my mind.

341
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,819
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

342
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,405
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

343
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,490
Oh, yeah?

344
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,241
Not even of clowns?

345
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,409
No.

346
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,870
What about my witch?

347
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,371
- No. Mom...
- Ooh...

348
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,290
- I'm not five anymore.
- But Will Byers...

349
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,834
- I'm going to cook you up in my-
- Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

350
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,298
Will?

351
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,966
- Will?
- Will?

352
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,761
Will?

353
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,307
- Will?
- Will!

354
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,101
- Will!
- Will?

355
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,728
Will!

356
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,480
Where are you?

357
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,074
Geez.

358
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,701
Your parents forget to feed you?

359
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,207
Is that why you ran away?

360
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:09,878
They, uh...

361
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,047
They hurt you?

362
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,635
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

363
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,387
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

364
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,641
All right.

365
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,855
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

366
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,940
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

367
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,109
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

368
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,445
We got a deal?

369
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,076
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff. All right?

370
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,538
My name's Benny.
Benny Hammond.

371
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,331
See? Like this. Here.

372
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,334
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

373
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,880
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

374
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,265
Eleven?

375
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,601
What's that mean?

376
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,228
What's it mean?

377
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,565
- No.
- Well, I'll be damned.

378
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,358
She speaks.

379
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,110
"No"? No, what?

380
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,907
All right.
I guess no more food, then.

381
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,158
Eleven.

382
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,577
Yeah.

383
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,455
What's it mean?

384
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,625
Eleven.

385
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,503
All right, then.

386
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,339
Here you go.

387
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,174
Take it easy, take it easy.

388
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,179
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

389
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,389
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

390
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,099
kidnapped or something.

391
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,187
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

392
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,733
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane.
Yeah, Randolph.

393
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,387
Will Byers?

394
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,557
Will!

395
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,061
Will Byers?

396
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,066
Come on, kid!

397
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,401
Will?

398
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:42,322
- Hey! I got something.

399
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,291
- That his bike?
- Yeah, he must have crashed.

400
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,210
You think
he got hurt in the fall?

401
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,629
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

402
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,631
Bike like this is like
a Cadillac to these kids.

403
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,341
He would've walked it home.

404
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,312
<i>...get off work if I win.</i>

405
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,063
<i>Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...</i>

406
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,941
<i>...but we will cover
whatever the damages are to your property.</i>

407
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,693
<i>- It's just, um...
- That's for sure.</i>

408
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,203
<i>Is Lonnie there?</i>

409
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,581
<i>Lonnie isn't here right now.
Can you please-</i>

410
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,541
<i>- I told you, Lonnie's not here.
- Who is this?</i>

411
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,626
<i>- His girlfriend, Cynthia.
- Cynthia.</i>

412
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,421
<i>- Who the hell is this?
- Cynthia, this is Joyce.</i>

413
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,256
<i>- Who?
- Lonnie's ex-wife.</i>

414
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,383
<i>- I really need to speak to him-
- Lonnie's not here.</i>

415
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,344
<i>- Can you please put- No!
- Why don't you call back later?</i>

416
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,636
No, not later. Now!

417
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,888
- Can-

418
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,389
- Bitch!
- Mom.

419
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,933
- What?
- You have to stay calm.

420
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,735
<i>Hey, you've reached Lonnie.</i>

421
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,029
<i>Leave a message
and I'll holler right back at ya.</i>

422
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,866
Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me.

423
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,452
Will is... is missing.
I don't know where he is.

424
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,703
I need...

425
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,373
I just need you to call me back,
please, just-

426
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,794
- Damn it! Damn it!

427
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,545
- Mom?

428
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,630
What?

429
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,841
Cops.

430
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,235
- It was just lying there?
- Yeah. Cal?

431
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,823
- Did it have any blood on it, or-
- No, no, no, no, no...

432
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,408
Phil?

433
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,910
If you found the bike out there,
why are you here?

434
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,831
- Well, he had a key to the house, right?
- Yeah.

435
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,250
So...

436
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,377
maybe he came home.

437
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,504
You think I didn't check
my own house?

438
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,381
I'm not saying that.

439
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,051
- Has this always been here?
- What? I don't know.

440
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,971
Probably. I mean, I have two boys.
Look at this place.

441
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,765
You're not sure?

442
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,736
Hey.

443
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,115
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

444
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,701
Nothing, he's probably just hungry.
Come on.

445
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,323
- Hey!
- Jesus!

446
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,992
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

447
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,537
- What's going on?

448
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,831
Hello?

449
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:05,001
- Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
- Listen, I want you to call Flo.

450
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,419
I want to get
a search party together, all right?

451
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,631
All the volunteers she can muster.
Bring flashlights, too.

452
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,008
Hey, you think
we got a problem here?

453
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,810
We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

454
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,770
We've been over this, Mike.
The chief says-

455
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,355
- I don't care what the chief said.
- Michael!

456
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,107
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

457
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,400
More reason to stay put.

458
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,527
- Mom!
- End of discussion.

459
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,660
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

460
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,162
- That's cool, right?
- No, not cool.

461
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,497
What? Why not?

462
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,792
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?

463
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,920
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.

464
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,797
- This is such bullshit.
- Language.

465
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,299
So we're under house arrest?

466
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,301
Just because Mike's friend got lost
on the way home from...

467
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,678
- Wait, this is Will's fault?
- Nancy, take that back.

468
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,305
- No!
- You're just pissed off

469
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,348
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

470
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,226
- Steve?
- Who is Steve?

471
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,729
- Her new boyfriend.
- You are such a douchebag, Mike!

472
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,606
- Language!

473
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,692
Nancy, come back.

474
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,777
Come back!

475
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:16,281
It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

476
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,033
You see, Michael?

477
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,410
- You see what happens?
- What happens when what?

478
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,080
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

479
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,207
That is really unfair, son.

480
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,500
We care.

481
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,174
- Mike!
- Let him go.

482
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,304
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.

483
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,598
What did I do?

484
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,519
Hey! What'd I do?

485
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,608
Will!
Will Byers!

486
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,734
Will!

487
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,653
Will, we're here for you, bud!

488
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,741
He's a good student.

489
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,244
- What?
- Will. He's a good student.

490
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,954
Great one, actually.

491
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,374
I don't think we've met.
Scott Clarke.

492
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,752
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

493
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,837
I always had
a distaste for science.

494
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,881
Well, maybe you had
a bad teacher.

495
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,300
Yeah, Ms. Ratliff
was a piece of work.

496
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,011
Ratliff?
You bet.

497
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,263
She's still kicking around,
believe it or not.

498
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:26,142
Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.

499
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,269
Sarah, my daughter...

500
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:33,817
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

501
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,361
I always figured there was enough
going on down here,

502
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,196
I never needed to look elsewhere.

503
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,490
Your daughter,
what grade is she?

504
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,368
- Maybe I'll get her in my class.
- No, she, uh...

505
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,995
She lives with her mom in the city.

506
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,541
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

507
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,629
- She died a few years back.
- Sorry?

508
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:55,964
His kid.

509
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,978
Lucas, do you copy?
It's Mike.

510
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,897
<i>- Lucas?
- Hey, it's Lucas.</i>

511
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:13,982
I know it's you.

512
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,235
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

513
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,945
I'm done. Over.

514
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,448
I'm worried about Will. Over.

515
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,575
Yeah.

516
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,328
This is crazy. Over.

517
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,038
I was thinking...

518
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,376
Will could've cast Protection last night,
but he didn't.

519
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,461
He cast Fireball.

520
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:38,298
<i>- Over.
- What's your point? Over.</i>

521
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:43,094
My point is... he could've played it safe,
but he didn't.

522
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,054
He put himself in danger
to help the party.

523
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,264
<i>Over.</i>

524
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,478
Meet me in ten.
Over and out.

525
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,301
What are you doing here?

526
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,678
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

527
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,598
- I figured we'd just study here.
- No. No way.

528
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,934
Oh, come on.
I can't have you failing this test.

529
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,811
So just... bear with me.

530
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:36,856
What'd I tell you?

531
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,400
Ninja.

532
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,916
You like that ice cream, huh?

533
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,585
Smile looks good on you.

534
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,004
You know, smile?

535
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,765
All right.
You just sit tight.

536
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:14,227
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

537
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,107
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

538
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,735
- Hey, can I help you?
- Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

539
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,071
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

540
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,907
- So try back tomorrow morning.
- Connie Frazier. Social Services.

541
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,869
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

542
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,788
- That's a heck of a drive.
- Not too bad this time of night.

543
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,124
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

544
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,169
I didn't want her running off again.
She's a tad skittish.

545
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,881
- Children I work with usually are.
- Right, right.

546
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,301
- So, where is she?
- Right. She's in the kitchen.

547
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,219
- Come on up. I'll introduce you.
- Thank you.

548
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,096
Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

549
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,222
- It's fine.
- You know, it's funny.

550
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,725
- Your, uh, voice sounds different on the-

551
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,467
Ah, man.
This is it.

552
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,061
Hey, guys.
You feel that?

553
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,774
- I think maybe we should go back.
- No.

554
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,485
We're not going back.
Just stay close.

555
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,694
Come on.

556
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,157
Just stay on channel six.
Don't do anything stupid.

557
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,163
Hey, guys, wait up.

558
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,123
Wait up!

"Which polymers occur naturally?"

560

Starch and cellulose.

Mmm.

564
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,480
Wow.
Jesus, how many of these did you make?

565
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,399
You said you wanted to help.

566
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,651
How about this? How about...

567
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,277
How about every time
that you get something right,

I have to take off
an item of clothing.

569
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,531
But every time
that you get something wrong-

570
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,824
- Uh, pass.
- Oh, come on.

571
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,950
- Come on.
- No.

572
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,410
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- No.

Yeah, that's not what you said.

579
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,675
- No.
- No?

580
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,886
Oh, do you need...
Do you need help, or...

581
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,013
No.

Steve.
Steve, come on.

583

What?

584
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,456
Are you crazy?
My parents are here.

585
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,668
That's weird, I... don't see them.

586
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:34,177
Was this your plan all along?
To... to get in my room and then...

587
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,846
- get another notch on your belt.
- No. Nancy, no.

588

I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

You mean, you're not a slut.

590
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,643
That's not what I'm saying.

591
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,479
You know, you're so cute when you lie.

592
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,230
Shut up.

593
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,485
Bad Steve.

594
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,113
Bad.
Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

595
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,741
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

596
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,702
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

These are great.

Wow, they really are.

602
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,357
I know I haven't been there for you.
I've been...

working so hard and I...

604
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,444
I just feel bad.
I don't even...

barely know what's going on with you.

606
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,825
All right?
I am sorry about that.

607
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,496
Hey, what is it?

608
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,748
What is it, honey?

609
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,919
- Nothing.
- Tell me. Tell me.

610
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,046
- Come on. You can...
- No.

611
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,297
It's just...

612
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,300
I should've been there for him.

613
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,387
No. Oh, no.
You can't do that to yourself.

614
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,682
This was not your fault.
Do you hear me?

615
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,435
He is... close.
I know it. I...

616
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:09,814
I feel it in my heart.

617
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,359
You just have to...
You have to trust me on this, okay?

618
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,780
- Yeah.
- Oh, look at this.

619
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:20,241
Look at this one.
Look at this one.

620
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,745
- I mean, that's it, right?
- Yeah.

621
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,622
That's it.
That's the one.

622
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:34,839

Will?

- It's Will?

- Mom, it's Will?

- Who is this?

630
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,067
- What have you done to my boy?
- What? What?

631
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,652
Give me back my son!

632
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,448
- Hello?

633
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,782
Hello, who is this?

634
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,619
- Hello? Who is this?

635
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,163
- Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?

636
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,915
- It was him.
- Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?

637
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,207
- Yes.
- What did he say?

638
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,418
He just breathed.
He just breathed.

639
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,462
- And was someone else there?
- I...

640
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,256
- Mom, who was there? Who was it?
- It was him.

641
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,051
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.

642
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,720
- Will!

643
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,223
- Will!
- Byers!

00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,896
Guys, I really think
we should turn back.

646
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,230
Seriously, Dustin?

647
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,608
You wanna be a baby,
then go home already!

648
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,401
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!

649
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,487
No, you're just being a big sissy!

650
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,491
Did you ever think Will went
missing because he ran into something bad?

651
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,452
And we're going to the exact same spot
where he was last seen?

652
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,372
- And we have no weapons or anything?
- Dustin, shut up.

653
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,457
I'm just saying,
does that seem smart to you?

654
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,668
- Shut up. Shut up.

655
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,419
Did you guys hear that?
