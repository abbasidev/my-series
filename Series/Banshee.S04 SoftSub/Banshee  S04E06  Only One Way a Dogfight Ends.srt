1
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,672
Is the sheriff in?

2
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,568
Sheriff Lotus is in a meeting.
Can I help you?

3
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,579
I have information
he needs to hear.

4
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,683
Can I help you, ma'am?

5
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,017
He wants you to
know he won't stop.

6
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,559
Taking those girls
was just the beginning.

7
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,358
- What is this?
- He wants you to see.

8
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,521
You will all see.

9
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,008
What the hell are you doing?

10
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,527
Don't! No!

11
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,092
Don't do it!

12
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,995
Calvin.

13
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,602
Where have you been?

14
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,275
What happened to you?

15
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,005
Is that blood?

16
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,017
- Calvin...
- Quiet.

17
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,787
Stop, please. Stop.

18
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,451
What the fuck is wrong with you?

19
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,618
Nothing, just not so rough.

20
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,023
- Please.
- Jesus.

21
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,531
Wait a second.
Are you screwing somebody else?

22
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,697
What? No.

23
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,864
Of course not.

24
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,871
We haven't fucked in months.
What is it?

25
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:25,866
You just...

26
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,542
You scared me.

27
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,713
You scared me.

28
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,961
What happened to you?
What's going on?

29
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,291
What happened to you?

30
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,938
Oh, God, Calvin.

31
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,344
Calvin!

32
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,500
Shower's all yours.

33
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,729
Help yourself.

34
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,974
Not really my thing.

35
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,578
You know,
I started out an undercover.

36
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,003
Pretty white chicks have to go a

37
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:20,890
little bit further to
prove themselves.

38
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:25,728
So it was either fuck
'em or smoke their shit.

39
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,032
Sometimes it was both.

40
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,894
You don't have to
explain yourself to me.

41
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,000
I've been meaning to kick it.

42
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:39,009
But when you spend your
days up to your neck in this shit,

43
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,179
sometimes I got to
get out of my own head.

44
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,614
Do I need to worry about you?

45
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,540
No.

46
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,844
Might be nice if you did.

47
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,751
Wow, you, my friend,
have some intimacy issues.

48
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,139
Thanks for letting me crash.

49
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,561
Could have shared the bed.

50
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,595
Just saying.

51
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,994
Who the fuck are you?

52
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,699
Maggie.

53
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:54,868
Kurt.

54
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,036
What's wrong?

55
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,212
- It's...
- You want to sit for a second?

56
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,977
No, I don't want to sit.

57
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,906
Helen,
you think you could get Hank here

58
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,186
one of those snacks
that you keep upstairs?

59
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,247
Sure.

60
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,415
Hi, Hank.

61
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,153
Want to come with me?

62
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,152
Thank you.

63
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,222
Come here.

64
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,096
What happened?

65
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,531
Did he hurt you'?

66
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,935
That motherfucker.

67
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,070
I left.

68
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,012
I couldn't be in that
house another second.

69
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,846
- He let you leave?
- He doesn't know.

70
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:39,581
I just grabbed Hank
and packed things and...

71
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,691
I don't even know where I'm going,
Kurt.

72
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,854
- You'll stay with me.
- I can't.

73
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,261
That's the first place
he's gonna come look.

74
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,060
Not if I find him first.

75
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,192
No.

76
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,528
No, I have to think about Hank.

77
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,967
Kurt,

78
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,576
I think he killed my father.

79
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,712
Randall's dead?

80
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,048
I don't know.
They left together and then Calvin...

81
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,282
And he was covered in blood.

82
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,549
And then he...

83
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,421
It was terrifying.

84
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,753
Okay. Shh.

85
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,392
It's okay.

86
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,428
That's my mother's sweater?

87
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,461
It is.

88
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,732
She never wears it.

89
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,236
- Looks good on you.
- Most things do.

90
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,404
You best clean that glass up
before your mother gets home.

91
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,914
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

92
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,815
So how do you fit into
this whole shit show'?

93
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:52,359
Your mother and your
father and I go way back.

94
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,427
Yeah? Which father?

95
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,830
The one that gave
you that smart mouth.

96
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,293
Got it.

97
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,630
So is she Carrie or Ana to you?

98
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,366
There weren't no Carrie
before I invented her.

99
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,044
Well,
I can use a shiny new life myself.

100
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,444
You wanna hook me up?
I figure you owe me.

101
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,110
Ain't you the fucked-up
little delinquent?

102
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:18,182
Hey, I'm just trying to play
the shitty hand I was dealt.

103
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,690
Girl, what you were dealt

104
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,987
were two parents who
would kill or die for you.

105
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,723
That's a hell of a lot
more than most people got.

106
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,797
Deva.

107
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,794
What are you doing here?

108
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,896
Missed you, too, Mom.

109
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,637
I'm just surprised to see you.

110
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,708
You changed the
locks on the door again.

111
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,003
Sorry, I should have told you.

112
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,216
- Does Grandma know you're here'?
- I left her a note.

113
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,720
I really don't think
they'll miss me.

114
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,482
- Deva.
- I'm not going back, Mom.

115
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,853
There's no Wi-Fi and
it smells like ass there.

116
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,623
- Honey, if the court finds out...
- They won't.

117
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,727
- I know I can keep a secret.
- You stay out of this.

118
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,266
If it makes it any easier,
you really don't have a choice.

119
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,732
All right,
so why don't we just arrest Calvin?

120
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,664
She'll never
testify against him.

121
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,034
She's terrified.

122
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,339
She thinks Calvin
killed her father.

123
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,537
Does Calvin know'?

124
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,776
- Does Calvin know what?
- About you two.

125
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:29,952
- No.
- You sure?

126
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,527
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you didn't think I could tell,

127
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,429
and it took me all of
about 10 seconds to see it.

128
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,997
Now, granted,
I'm a smarter-than-average cop

129
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,198
And he's a
hatemongering asshole...

130
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,223
Calvin doesn't know.

131
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,203
They can stay at my place.

132
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,608
- Really?
- Yeah.

133
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,743
Just until you find a way
to take your brother down.

134
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,049
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

135
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,315
Hey, you okay, by the way?

136
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,256
This morning, the burning.

137
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,727
Must have hit
pretty close to home.

138
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,553
Yeah, I'm fine.

139
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,828
Can't get that smell
out of my head.

140
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,831
It takes a while.

141
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,746
- Can I help you?
- I highly doubt it.

142
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,260
You can't go back there.

143
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,623
- You can't go back there.
- I know.

144
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,230
That's the swelling, babe.
They'll soften up...

145
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,495
- Sweet Jesus.
- Hey, hey, hey, you can't be in here.

146
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:44,966
And yet I am. FBI.

147
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,802
Honey, get out of here.

148
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,174
Dr. David Quick.

149
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,968
I have been looking for you.

150
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,177
What's up, Doc?

151
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,486
Why don't you take a seat?

152
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,834
Should we try that again?

153
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,568
Performing breast
augmentation after

154
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:13,558
being stripped of
your medical license,

155
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,859
now, that's a felony.

156
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,332
We don't perform
any procedures here.

157
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,433
Tiffany is a friend of mine.

158
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,268
She asked me to look at her boob job,
that's all.

159
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,034
- Mmm, so, Why'd you run?
- I don't like cops.

160
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,199
Hey, you can't go in there,
buddy.

161
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:25,832
You got a warrant?

162
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,734
I don't need one.

163
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:29,638
I'm not a cop.

164
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,011
Yeah, look,
we can go clown that road,

165
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,918
but ifs tangled and boring and,
in the end, you'll still lose.

166
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,719
Or you can answer a few
questions and I'll forget we ever met.

167
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,892
Over here.

168
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,921
Okay.

169
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,300
- What do you wanna know?
- Body modifications.

170
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,325
What about it?

171
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,370
- You do it?
- Now and then. It's a growing field.

172
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,071
So,
you must do some pretty fucked-up shit.

173
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,041
Not as fucked up as
the shit I turn down.

174
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,538
You wouldn't believe the
kind of things people want.

175
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,910
Hey, Jesus, man!

176
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,237
Shit's expensive.

177
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,681
I'm looking for a guy
with horn implants.

178
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,548
- You ever do anything like that?
- Yeah.

179
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,712
Well,
then whip out your files, Doc.

180
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,688
We don't keep files
on that kind of stuff.

181
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,591
I can't imagine devil
horns is a common request.

182
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,083
They're more
common than you think.

183
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,062
It's Satan's country out here.

184
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,534
Yeah, but still it's pretty unique,
even for a guy like you.

185
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,365
Who was the last guy you did?
I'm sure you remember something.

186
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,417
The kind of people
who want this shit,

187
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:32,376
they're not exactly
model citizens.

188
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,912
I take cash in advance.
I don't even ask their names.

189
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,046
How convenient for you.

190
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:38,709
This is bullshit.

191
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,446
I'm gonna call my lawyer.

192
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,044
Let's go.

193
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,146
He doesn't know anything.

194
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,958
This has not been a satisfying
conversation for me, Dr. Quick.

195
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,727
If I were you, I'd call me.

196
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,833
Thank you.

197
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,935
Hey,
I barely started working that guy.

198
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,301
He wasn't gonna talk.

199
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,834
This might help.

200
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,678
- That was on his desk.
- Mmm-hmm.

201
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,808
You, my friend,
have some serious skills.

202
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,783
He was watching you the whole time,
so was I.

203
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,762
- How'd you do it?
- That's the trick, isn't it'?

204
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,585
Just when I thought
I'd seen it all.

205
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,997
Wow, amazing what low
self-esteem can do to a sociopath.

206
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,157
Mmm.

207
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,669
I've been trying to reach you.

208
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,172
I've been busy.

209
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,447
Do we have a problem,
Deputy Cruz?

210
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,782
Not at all.

211
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,843
But speaking of problems,

212
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,783
remember that matter
you asked me to look into?

213
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,614
- Yeah.
- I looked into it.

214
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:56,882
You found him?

215
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,223
No, I found her.

216
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,329
Exhibit number four was also
turned in to our hearing officer

217
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,197
five days before
this trial began.

218
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,703
Now, if it pleases the court,
you'll note that the photograph

219
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,640
shows the remnants of
a crushed back side door.

220
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,108
This photograph was
taken at the scene...

221
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,202
Mrs. Hopewell.

222
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,875
Of a hit-and-run
five months back

223
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:17,474
at the intersection
of Highway 6...

224
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,143
I'm seeing you around the
courthouse quite often these days.

225
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,312
Taking an interest in the law?

226
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,047
You could say that.

227
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:34,197
You know, I never really had the
chance to offer my condolences

228
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,494
for the loss of your husband.

229
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,395
You hated Gordon.

230
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,001
No, I didn't hate him.

231
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,201
I respected him.

232
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,011
Never took it personally.
I'd like to think he didn't either.

233
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,909
He did.

234
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,509
Ah.

235
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,458
Well, either way,
I was very sorry to hear about it.

236
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,765
I'm sorry about your niece.

237
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,035
We both suffered a great loss.

238
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:21,637
You know, sometimes a loss
like that clouds the judgment.

239
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,808
Makes us do things impulsively.

240
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,880
Things we might regret.

241
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,052
Do you know what I mean?

242
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,381
No, not really.

243
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,325
No? Well, I'd watch out for it.

244
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,298
You still have so much to lose.

245
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,230
I guess we all do.

246
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,671
I suppose we both
should be more careful.

247
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,672
Remember me, sunshine?

248
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,335
Yeah, the bitch who didn't know
when to stop asking questions.

249
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,004
Ah, you remembered.
I'm so flattered.

250
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,604
I'm also the bitch
with the badge.

251
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,706
Did I not mention
that the other day?

252
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,359
- I don't want any trouble, all right?
- Now, that's the spirit.

253
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,947
We're looking for a
guy with devil horns.

254
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,651
- You got people like that in here?
- Yeah, body mods.

255
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,274
Right, well,
this guy is killing girls.

256
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,862
Why don't you scroll through here,
see if you recognize anyone?

257
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,274
Look, most of the so-called

258
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:50,159
Satanists that come
in here are tourists.

259
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,814
They're assholes
looking to be more

260
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:53,634
edgier and badass
than they really are.

261
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,467
With the exception of this guy.

262
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,299
Who's this?

263
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,804
That's Bode. Declan Bode.

264
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,379
He's a hardcore ritualist.

265
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,682
- Does he come here often?
- No, he used to a while back.

266
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,653
Feeling people out.
Maybe looking for followers. I don't know.

267
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,755
Nobody took to the guy,
'cause he was a little too committed.

268
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,256
So, you're talking about a guy

269
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,417
who was so twisted he
creeped out other Satanists?

270
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,420
- Got it.
- Where do we find him?

271
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,518
Fuck if I know.

272
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,337
You knew his name.

273
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:22,030
Yeah,
and that's all I'm telling you, cop.

274
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,132
- Where do we fucking find him?
- I don't fucking know, man.

275
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,567
- Where?
- I don't fucking know!

276
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,537
The fucking guy thinks the
devil works through him, all right'?

277
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,705
One night the
freak comes in here,

278
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,708
starts spouting off about
how he's talking to Lucifer.

279
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,904
I tell him he's full of shit.

280
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,706
Guy takes the paring
knife out of my hand,

281
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,907
starts peeling back his
fingernails one by one,

282
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,744
smiling the whole time.

283
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,012
Then he orders a drink.
Who the fuck does that?

284
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,953
Someone we should meet.

285
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,687
See?
When we're helping, we're happy.

286
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,915
Yeah? Well, that's interesting.

287
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,483
Okay.

288
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,837
All right, thanks.
I'll call you back.

289
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,594
Our boy Declan Bode doesn't
have much of a footprint.

290
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,760
No known address. No relatives.

291
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,270
But he does have a prior.

292
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:13,035
He was convicted of statutory
rape 15 years ago next county over.

293
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,305
- Girl's name is sealed.
- Can we get it unsealed?

294
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,358
Yes,
but I will need a court order,

295
00:22:17,382 --> 00:22:19,372
which won't happen
until tomorrow.

296
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,107
Oh, Jesus Christ.

297
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,317
Don't you have any
judges you can wake up?

298
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:26,855
It might surprise you to learn

299
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,450
I'm not very popular
among the federal judges.

300
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,788
All right,
so what do we do now?

301
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,623
Now we wait.

302
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:37,893
Just wait?

303
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,026
Yeah.

304
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,630
Great.

305
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,984
You're not built for downtime,
are you?

306
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,653
The way you move,
the way you pace,

307
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,387
the way you want
to push through every

308
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,054
wall without even
looking for the door

309
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,420
or the key to that door.

310
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,584
You have a point?

311
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,190
That's not the
temperament of a man who

312
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:06,922
worked his way up
through law enforcement.

313
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,899
Put my feet to the fire,
I'd say you're more criminal than cop.

314
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:13,760
You don't know me.

315
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,496
I know you can't sit still.

316
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,207
I'm guessing you
were once made to

317
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,341
for a very long time
and you didn't like it.

318
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:27,181
You check the comers
every time you enter a room.

319
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,680
That's not police training.
That's survival.

320
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:33,850
Your demeanor towards
me is complicated.

321
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,953
You have trouble
making eye contact.

322
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,587
It's not lack of confidence.

323
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,393
You've got a secret.

324
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,027
Or secrets.

325
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,570
Maybe I just don't like you.

326
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:50,866
But you do.

327
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,267
Don't you?

328
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,604
Wow.

329
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,813
You think you know me?

330
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,978
Let me tell you something.
You have no fucking idea.

331
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,615
Yeah, I check the corners,
because for as long as I can remember,

332
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,233
there's always been someone
waiting there to get the jump on me.

333
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,191
And I don't stay still,
'cause every time

334
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:13,989
I do,
someone close to me fucking dies!

335
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,666
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,071
No, you're not.

337
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,570
No, I'm not.

338
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,647
It's nothing.

339
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,031
Hey.

340
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,668
What is it?

341
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:15,845
I'm sorry.

342
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:58,014
There is a serial
killer out there...

343
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,090
- It's terrifying.
- I know, baby. I know.

344
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,895
- I'll take patrol.
- It's my shift.

345
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,079
No, I'm pulling rank.
I've got to get out of this zoo.

346
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,395
Okay.

347
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:27,951
Someone there?

348
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,607
Shit.

349
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,704
Burning the midnight oil, I see.

350
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,741
This is not the place to talk business,
Calvin.

351
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,609
That's fine because we no longer
have any business to discuss.

352
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,806
The Brotherhood no
longer works for you.

353
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,884
- Is that so?
- Yes, that is so.

354
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,483
Well, that's unfortunate.

355
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:35,815
Not from where I'm sitting.

356
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,224
I can't help but wonder what
Watts will think about this.

357
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,095
Well, why don't we ask him?

358
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,070
What do you think, Randall?

359
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,103
Seems the cat got Watts' tongue.

360
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,608
That's a bold choice.

361
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,342
Yeah.

362
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,352
I thought you'd like that.

363
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,729
So here's how it's gonna work.

364
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,426
Everything that's
yours is now ours.

365
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,564
Warehouses, shipments,
buyers, I fucking want all of it.

366
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,469
You can go quietly
or you can go bloody,

367
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,972
but either way, you are gone.

368
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:33,974
You can keep the
head as a souvenir.

369
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,140
Hi.

370
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,250
I saw you on TV.

371
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,918
I didn't ask for this.

372
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,017
He chose me.

373
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:14,917
Do you understand?

374
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,851
He chose me.

375
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,788
You can't stop me.

376
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,090
I've been delivered.

377
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,467
To feed the beast,

378
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,938
I've become something different,
something more.

379
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,503
And you... You're a bug.

380
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,272
A tiny worthless insect
in the face of his power.

381
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,103
Fuck you.

382
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,113
Close your eyes, cop.

383
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,386
Close your eyes.

384
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,055
Cherish the darkness,

385
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,284
for soon you will bear
witness to his plan.

386
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:55,359
And only then will I take
your miserable little life.

387
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,419
Where are they, Kurt?

388
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,997
Get the fuck off my property.

389
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,727
Where's my wife?

390
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,072
She's somewhere safe.
She'll call you when she's ready.

391
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:39,199
You are fucking with my family,
Kurt.

392
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,676
My wife, my son.

393
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,614
Do you have any idea what I
will fucking do to you for that?

394
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:47,839
Where's Watts?

395
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,177
Watts is dead.

396
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:54,580
Where's Maggie?

397
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,234
She doesn't want to see you.

398
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,456
Fuck you.
You don't get to fucking tell me that.

399
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,054
I just did.
I'm going into my house.

400
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,625
In two minutes,
if you're still here,

401
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,032
I'll come back out.

402
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:11,538
Trust me,
you don't want me to come back out.

403
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,446
Kurt.

404
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,804
Do you remember,
Dad used to take us to

405
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:28,087
the dogfights when
we were in Vandergrift?

406
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:32,956
Yeah.

407
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,554
Remember, I'd once asked him

408
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,732
if the matches
ever ended in a tie.

409
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:45,970
And he laughed at me

410
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:49,341
and he said,

411
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,244
"There's only ever one
way that a dogfight ends."

412
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:57,949
You remember that?

413
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,986
I remember.

414
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,960
There's only one way, Kurt.

415
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,604
I know.

416
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,186
Deva!

417
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,215
- Are you hurt?
- No.

418
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,544
Come on, Come on.

419
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,451
Get out there, Get on the roof.

420
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,480
- What?
- Go, go, go!

421
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,724
Here, take this. Safety's off.

422
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,888
Two hands. Point and squeeze.

423
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,264
Find a place to hide, wait.
You stay safe.

424
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,325
Go.

425
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,425
Now!

426
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:03,953
No.

427
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:07,215
I am sick and tired...

428
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:09,485
of fighting for my
motherfucking life.

429
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,492
Ah!

430
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:18,892
Damn.

431
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,228
Where's Deva?

432
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:32,906
Are you hurt?

433
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,242
Give me this.

434
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,384
I'm sorry.

435
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:43,884
I'm sorry.

436
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,661
I'm sorry.

437
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:55,998
I'm sorry.

438
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,946
Deva.

439
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Slow down.

440
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:40,781
You okay? You hurt?

441
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,452
Okay.

442
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,548
I just wanna go home.

443
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,825
I know.

444
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,058
The thing is,
I don't know where that is.

445
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:00,895
Come here.

446
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,295
Underwood,
tell me you have something.

447
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,128
The judge unsealed the file.

448
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,136
The victim on that statutory
rape is a Kim Newton.

449
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,603
She still lives in the area.

450
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,765
- You got an address?
- Just emailed it to you.

451
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:39,869
You're the best. I owe you.

452
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,103
You owe me many.

453
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,181
What is it with
this fucking town?

454
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,777
Can't we go one
week without some

455
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:49,308
motherfucking
army shooting at us?

456
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,977
Seems like you handled it fine.

457
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,117
That's because it's already
become a motherfucking habit.

458
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:59,351
Thank you.

459
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,658
Baby,
there's a whole world out there.

460
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,703
So they tell me.

461
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:22,544
What the fuck happened here?

462
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:27,077
Proctor.

463
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:28,590
What are you doing
messing with him?

464
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,655
Are you kidding me?

465
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,245
You don't get to
walk into my life

466
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:35,496
every few years and question me.

467
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,830
Hey, hey,
Deva could have been fucking killed.

468
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,828
Get out of here.

469
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,195
- Come on, Ana.
- Get the fuck out of here!

470
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:46,306
Who the fuck do you think
you are saying that shit to me?

471
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,375
You don't think I don't know
what could have happened to her?

472
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,743
I don't know what...

473
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:53,111
Shh. Hey, hey, stop.

474
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:54,444
It's okay.

475
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,511
It's okay.

476
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:01,618
It's okay.

477
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:03,689
It's okay.

478
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,573
Hello. Can I help you?

479
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,042
Kim Newton?

480
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:31,109
Yes.

481
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:36,050
My parents were the
ones that called the police.

482
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:39,390
I was 15, Declan, he was 25.

483
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,129
I was a quiet girl.

484
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:46,795
I didn't have many friends in school.
Always the kid in the back row.

485
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,798
Nobody really paid
any attention to me.

486
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,097
And then I met Declan.

487
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,643
He told me I was beautiful
and I could tell he meant it.

488
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:00,306
I had never even
been kissed before,

489
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,624
and here was this
handsome older guy

490
00:44:02,648 --> 00:44:05,251
falling head over
heels in love with me.

491
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,313
And I understand now that I
was young and impressionable

492
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:12,087
and he manipulated me,
but, you know...

493
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,363
I still think he loved me

494
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:19,764
and I know I loved him. Mmm.

495
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,761
So what happened?

496
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:24,372
My dad found out.

497
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:27,667
He wanted to go after
Declan with a tire iron,

498
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:31,941
but my mother convinced
him to call the police instead.

499
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,383
Oh, I cried for days.

500
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,350
And the sex?

501
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:43,053
Was it perverse in any way?

502
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:48,296
It was intense, but, no,
I wouldn't say it was perverse.

503
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:52,559
Is Declan in some
kind of trouble?

504
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:53,795
He's a person of interest.

505
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,464
When was the last
time you spoke to him?

506
00:44:58,496 --> 00:44:59,839
The night he was arrested.

507
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,408
After that,
I never saw him again.

508
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,755
It's a nice piece of
property you have.

509
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,727
Oh, thanks.
My parents left it to me.

510
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,563
Well, if you think of anything else,
give me a call.

511
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:28,598
- Thanks for your time.
- Yeah.

512
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:01,196
Hey, it's Veronica.

513
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,102
You disappeared
on me this morning.

514
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,042
But, anyway,
I tracked down our statutory rape victim.

515
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:11,407
She said all the right things,
but my bullshit meter is ringing.

516
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:14,710
Anyway,
I'm going back to the hotel,

517
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,378
so call me and I'll
fill you in on my...

518
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,570
Oh, shit.

519
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,517
I heard you were looking for me.
