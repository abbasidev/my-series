1
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,769
Oh, my God.

2
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,606
Help me.

3
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,368
No, please.

4
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,001
Please don't.

5
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,491
Please.

6
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,325
Please don't. No.

7
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,164
No.

8
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,163
No, please.

9
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,810
No.

10
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,771
Please! Please! Please! Please!

11
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,444
Stop. No.

12
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,121
Cut!

13
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,648
Moving on, people.

14
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,656
- Let's reset for close-up.
- Sheriff's Department.

15
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,576
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You're all under arrest.

16
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,080
The fuck are you talking about?
This is a licensed production.

17
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,447
There's no license for what
you're doing here, asshole.

18
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,648
Jesus Christ, son,
pull your pants up.

19
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,681
You all right?

20
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,802
Look at me.

21
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,803
How old are you?

22
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,721
Don't answer that.
You're making a big mistake.

23
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Don't fucking touch me.

24
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,888
Bunker,
I want you to arrest all these people.

25
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,008
- Don't fucking say anything.
- Shit, fuck!

26
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,003
Go ahead, resist.
Give me a reason, huh?

27
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,286
Run!

28
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,451
Fuck you, bitch!

29
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,326
Pony Joe.

30
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,731
Motherfucker.

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,001
Fuck.

32
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,086
Have I mentioned
you're under arrest?

33
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,889
Fuck you, traitor.

34
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,491
Split 'em up.
I need individual statements.

35
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,847
Where do you want the director?

36
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,604
Put him in the
interrogation room.

37
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,931
Turn up the heat.

38
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,202
- I want to talk to my lawyer.
- Yeah, yeah.

39
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,529
Good morning, Sheriff.

40
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,848
Mr. Mayor, you're in my chair.

41
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,651
I heard you and your
deputies had a busy morning.

42
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,128
Well, arrests don't mean shit if
your DA can't get a conviction.

43
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,850
That won't be a problem.

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,889
Yeah, I guess it won't.

45
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,044
I'm not an idiot.

46
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,282
You think I don't know
that every time your girl Cruz

47
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,648
gets an anonymous tip,
we're doing your dirty work?

48
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,450
I don't need to remind you
who put you in charge here

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,727
and kept you in charge, do I?

50
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,246
What can I do for you,
Mr. Mayor?

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,283
What progress have you made
on my niece's murder investigation?

52
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,930
We have a few leads.

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,525
Yeah, I read through the files.

54
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,104
These files are confidential.
And in case you've forgotten,

55
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,309
you're still a person
of interest in this case.

56
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,689
And if I wasn't out there wasting my
time shutting down fuck films for you,

57
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,936
I'd have arrested a suspect
in all three murders by now.

58
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,849
I expect daily
updates from now on.

59
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,536
Really?
I thought that was Deputy Cruz's job.

60
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,767
I want them from you, Brock.

61
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,647
Then I will make it a top priority,
Mr. Mayor.

62
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,802
Thank you for your time.

63
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,445
You're welcome.

64
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,246
Hi.

65
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,441
You look good.

66
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,363
Fuck you.

67
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,371
So what do you have here,
10 acres?

68
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,806
Twenty-five.

69
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,962
The woods are mine, too.

70
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,244
It's peaceful.

71
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,563
It's private.

72
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,851
Thanks.

73
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,723
New place is great.

74
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,003
A work in progress.

75
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,081
Mmm.

76
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,443
Where have you been?

77
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,564
I guess I needed some time.

78
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,286
Yeah,
I could have used some, too.

79
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,041
I shouldn't have
turned my back on you.

80
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,642
You didn't turn your
back on just me.

81
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,801
- Job's dead.
- Why, because Dalton said so?

82
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,043
No, because that's what
they do with people like Job.

83
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,168
You didn't know.

84
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,368
There was nowhere left to look.

85
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,322
You kept looking for him.

86
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,481
Yes.

87
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,365
Still nothing.

88
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,241
No.

89
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,921
What about Deva?

90
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,921
Didn't you at least
want to see her?

91
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,730
I have seen her.

92
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,760
She didn't tell me.

93
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,640
She knew if she did,
you'd want to come.

94
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,330
And Deva going behind
your back feels like a betrayal?

95
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,926
I just... I need to protect her.

96
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,082
- From him?
- From everything.

97
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,520
- That's not possible, Carrie.
- It used to be.

98
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,245
Ana.

99
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,050
Before he showed up in Banshee
and forced himself back into your life?

100
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,567
- I didn't say that.
- But that's what you feel, isn't it?

101
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,886
I'm sorry.

102
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,890
For what?

103
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,570
Everything.

104
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,768
The losses you've suffered,
the pain you've endured,

105
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,684
all the result of a choice
made by someone else.

106
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,650
And now he's back again,
showing up like he did two years before.

107
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,564
If you're so concerned
about my losses and pain,

108
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,688
why don't you let my
kids come home to me?

109
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,096
- We've already discussed this, Carrie.
- Let's discuss it again.

110
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,336
All I can do is make
a recommendation.

111
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,416
Beyond that, my hands are tied.

112
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,885
Then what the fuck
am I doing here?

113
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,760
Tell me who gets to make that
choice and let me go talk to them.

114
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,724
This is bullshit.

115
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,328
Let's talk about Gordon.

116
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,002
What about him?

117
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,209
Have you started sorting
through his belongings?

118
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,206
No.

119
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,363
The longer you wait, Carrie...

120
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,566
What?

121
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,289
The harder it gets?

122
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,444
Trust me,
it can't get any fucking harder.

123
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,201
Hey,
get those last three pallets loaded.

124
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,164
That truck should have
been on the road hours ago.

125
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,449
Motherfucker.

126
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,646
Mr. Proctor,
I was not expecting you today.

127
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,007
My condolences on your loss...

128
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,045
Don't.

129
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,248
I'd say our terms of
agreement were pretty clear.

130
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,607
You and your brotherhood
manage my operations

131
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,082
and I permit you to maintain
yours for a bit of your profits.

132
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,536
And that's what you've been getting.
I check the accounting myself.

133
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,246
Which is why I hold you
responsible for any errors.

134
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,368
Or omissions for that matter.

135
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,336
- You've been running a side business.
- Mr. Proctor...

136
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,762
What happened this morning
was your one and only warning,

137
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,764
Mr. Bunker.

138
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,206
From now on,
my cut goes up by 10%.

139
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,407
Do you want me to talk to
Mr. Watts about our new terms?

140
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,249
That won't be necessary.

141
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,929
I didn't think so.

142
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,290
What are you going to
do about the arraignment?

143
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,725
Why should I do anything?

144
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,521
My men are solid. I can vouch for them,
but the director's a freelancer.

145
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,800
There's no telling who he'd
rat out to save his own ass.

146
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,611
Mr. Bunker, you seem
determined to prove your ineptitude.

147
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,044
I'll deal with it.

148
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,763
Somebody pick this shit up.

149
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,846
Hey.

150
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,961
You don't seem happy to see me.

151
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,805
How are you?

152
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,446
Never better.

153
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,524
Good, 'cause I need your help.

154
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,566
With what?

155
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,404
You ever heard of
Aaron Boedicker?

156
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,642
Yeah, a meth dealer.

157
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,525
He and his clan used to
just cook up in the foothills,

158
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,648
but now they've
started selling it in town.

159
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,888
Sounds like a
problem for Proctor.

160
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,167
No,
it's actually a problem for me.

161
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,040
They were experienced
cooks and I was looking

162
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,684
to branch out on
my own a little bit.

163
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,287
I warned Boedicker that
Banshee was off-limits.

164
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,361
Let me guess, the inbred drug dealer
didn't listen to the 24-year-old girl.

165
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,681
I'm asking you
to help me fix this.

166
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,443
My uncle finds out what I've done,
I'm dead.

167
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,444
- Please?
- It's not my problem.

168
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,126
You drinking yourself to
death in a shithole motel room

169
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,725
wasn't my problem either.

170
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,846
I'm going after Boedicker
with or without you.

171
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,524
I just thought that with you
I'd have an actual chance.

172
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,845
Stop!

173
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,370
Drop the gun, bitch.

174
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,522
You drop yours, asshole.

175
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,642
Why the hell would he do that?

176
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,002
'Cause if he doesn't,
I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.

177
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,606
Well,
since you asked so nicely...

178
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,921
It's okay, son, I got this.

179
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,002
Get him out of here.

180
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,331
So, is this a social call?

181
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,971
'Cause my memory could be failing me,
but

182
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:02,526
I don't remember
inviting you to visit.

183
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,763
- You didn't.
- Then you're trespassing on my land.

184
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,047
- We had a deal.
- You've been getting your cut.

185
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,681
The deal was you wouldn't
sell meth in Banshee.

186
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,929
Do you have any idea what my
uncle would do to you if he found out?

187
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,402
I never much liked
being told what to do.

188
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,643
Then you're really gonna
hate it when I shut you down.

189
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,961
Shit, girl,

190
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,407
that there just ain't
never gonna happen.

191
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,448
Lem, get the girl inside.

192
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,161
She and I need to
have a little chin-wag.

193
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,364
Hey.

194
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,480
I don't think you appreciate how
much trouble you're in, little girl.

195
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,449
He'd better not touch me again.

196
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,842
And I don't know what I was
thinking getting into business with you.

197
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,651
You're the one who
broke the agreement.

198
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:36,249
The problem with being a pretty
girl is that over time you get the idea

199
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,928
that you can do or say
whatever the fuck you want.

200
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,771
I'm gonna do you a favor.

201
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,202
I'm gonna remove
the burden of beauty.

202
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,209
Hesher here chased down
a rabid possum a while back.

203
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,087
He ain't been the same since.

204
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,601
Jesus.

205
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,291
You fucking bitch.

206
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,609
Oh... Jesus Christ!

207
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,331
You okay? Look at me.
Look at me.

208
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,281
Come on.

209
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,761
Come on.

210
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,601
Rebecca! Rebecca!

211
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,922
Hey, Rebecca.

212
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,002
We don't have time for this.

213
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,881
Rebecca.

214
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,525
Get down!

215
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,605
Yeah!

216
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,087
Yeah!

217
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,240
I know, I know, I know...

218
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,081
Bunker.

219
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,202
Not the kind of bar I would
think you'd hang out in.

220
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,249
There's a lot you
don't know about me.

221
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,482
I'm sure that's true, sir.

222
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,324
Is there a law against
drinking in this bar?

223
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,046
The sheriff asked
me to ask you to wait.

224
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,804
Wait for what?

225
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,450
I'll let him tell you.

226
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,082
- Nice car.
- Thanks.

227
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,050
What are you doing here, Hood?

228
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,964
I was thirsty.
Thought I might get a beer.

229
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,736
You're not here investigating
the Bowman murder?

230
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,161
No, sir.
I told you, I'm retired.

231
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,368
Yeah, yeah, listen.

232
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,445
Someone's out there killing young
girls and I'm a little under the gun here,

233
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,888
so I'm gonna ask you again,
what are you doing here?

234
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,525
One of the guys in the band
had a thing with Rebecca.

235
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,922
I figured I'll watch the show,
introduce myself.

236
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,771
No, you wait here.
Bunker and I will go talk to him.

237
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,205
Kid's a hillbilly drug dealer.

238
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,408
He's gonna run as soon
as he sees the uniforms.

239
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,891
Then we'll know
which one to grab.

240
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,325
Let's go, Bunker.

241
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,401
Sorry.

242
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,884
Your thoughts are
being read out loud

243
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,327
So everyone can hear

244
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,769
We know your insecurities

245
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,081
We know your biggest fear

246
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,445
Your thoughts are
getting worse and worse

247
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,524
You picture your
mother dead in a hearse

248
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,842
You plague your friends
with the worst curse

249
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,844
You can think of...

250
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,370
Everybody knows,
knows what you're thinking...

251
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,520
- Get out of the way!
- What the hell, man!

252
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,965
Get out of the way. Hey!

253
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,247
- Bunker!
- Look!

254
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,731
Here!

255
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,080
Shut up.

256
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,845
Hood!

257
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,362
God damn it.

258
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,406
Come in.

259
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,411
Mr. Franklin.
Do you wanna sit down?

260
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,968
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

261
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,168
I've been going through the case
file from the pornography arrests.

262
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,480
The evidence is overwhelming.

263
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,016
I'll have no problem getting
convictions for all five defendants.

264
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,168
- Withdraw the charges.
- What?

265
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,891
- Why?
- I have my reasons.

266
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,216
Sir, with all due respect,
you told

267
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,496
me to throw the
book at these guys.

268
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,170
And now I'm telling
you to let them go.

269
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,402
Mr. Proctor,
there's only so many times we can do this

270
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,323
before people start
asking questions.

271
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,085
- I'll worry about that.
- Sir, frankly, I don't understand...

272
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,128
And you worry about me.

273
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,011
- Was there anything else?
- No, sir.

274
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,082
Thank you for your time.

275
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,009
He won't be a problem.

276
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,485
Take a seat.

277
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,004
What the fuck am I doing here?

278
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,809
I said take a fucking seat.

279
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,130
What happened to Rebecca Bowman?

280
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,336
How the fuck should I know?
Why am I even sitting here?

281
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,089
You're not even a cop anymore.

282
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,571
That's right.

283
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,247
That means I can kick your
fucking head in and not get fired.

284
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,324
You dragged me here.
You know, why don't you go fuck yourself...

285
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,326
Or...

286
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,083
All right. All right.

287
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,204
I liked Rebecca.

288
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,408
We had a good thing going.

289
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,084
Till she dumped you?

290
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,447
She didn't dump me.

291
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,488
Things just got complicated.

292
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,602
Complicated how?

293
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,570
- Can I get a beer or something?
- No.

294
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,324
Complicated how?

295
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,761
I should have never told
her about my fucking uncle.

296
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,126
Aaron Boedicker?

297
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,806
- They did some business, right?
- She was his business.

298
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,282
He was cooking that junk up in
his bathtub before she got involved.

299
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,736
She's the one that gave him cash
as long as he didn't deal in Banshee.

300
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,330
That was the deal.

301
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,536
- I told her he wouldn't stick with it.
- And he didn't.

302
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,770
That's when she started acting
all crazy paranoid about everything.

303
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,800
I thought that she was
scared of my family,

304
00:26:54,824 --> 00:26:57,046
but she said they were nothing.

305
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,524
It was Proctor that
scared the shit out of her.

306
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,211
The twisted shit she
told me about him.

307
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,523
Man, you have no idea how
fucked up that guy really is.

308
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,807
You wanna know what
happened to Rebecca?

309
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,803
Ask that motherfucker.

310
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,729
All right, go.

311
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,403
Get the fuck out of here.

312
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,481
Seems this girl's ghost
has got you all out of sorts.

313
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,562
Yeah, I owed her one.

314
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,161
Must have been a real big one.

315
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,846
You got something to say,
just say it.

316
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,245
Seems like you owe Job a
lot more than you owe this girl.

317
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,569
There, now I've said it.

318
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,483
Senor Proctor.

319
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,891
Welcome to Pennsylvania,
Mr. Loera.

320
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,689
About your niece.

321
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,491
You should take time to mourn.
Business can wait.

322
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,005
On the contrary.

323
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,607
A life can stop,
but business must go on.

324
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,321
My operation's been growing
exponentially since we last talked.

325
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,249
Expanding my distribution
network is of high priority.

326
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,926
- How does that benefit me?
- Market dominance.

327
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,181
It's no secret that the
Sinaloa's partnership

328
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:23,289
with the Chinese has
hurt your bottom line.

329
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,601
Once the cartels got
into the pill industry,

330
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,682
you could no longer
control the market pricing

331
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,928
like you did with the
cocaine and the heroin.

332
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,406
They're moving product
across the border,

333
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:35,131
twice your rate,
just a fraction of the price.

334
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,171
The increased traffic is just causing
you even more border headaches.

335
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,528
I can offer a local pipeline
without any of the risk

336
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,730
or expense of having to import
the product itself from Colombia.

337
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,725
No disrespect,
but I deal in a very different volume

338
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,684
than you do here
in Pennsylvania.

339
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,366
Your ambition impresses me,

340
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,211
but I'm not convinced that
you can play in my league.

341
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,567
Then allow me to convince you.

342
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,164
Very well. I expect three tons
ready for pickup in 14 days.

343
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,571
Done.

344
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,326
When this transaction
is completed,

345
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,200
I expect to be your
exclusive East Coast supplier.

346
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,731
Do we have a deal?

347
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,330
Senor Proctor,
I've heard the stories.

348
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,131
You're a dangerous man.

349
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,010
But a dangerous man in Banshee,
to the cartel...

350
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:44,734
is still nothing but a mosquito.

351
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,931
Failure to deliver
is not an option.

352
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,082
I'll see you in two weeks.

353
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,810
I reviewed the complaint.

354
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,486
All seems to be in order.

355
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,406
Are you prepared to make a bond
recommendation, Mr. Franklin?

356
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,688
At... At this time, Your Honor,
the People would like

357
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,321
to withdraw their complaint
against all five defendants.

358
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,647
Are we discussing the same case here,
Counselor?

359
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,331
There seems to be more than
sufficient cause here to proceed.

360
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,576
Yes, Your Honor, however,
the people have recently discovered

361
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,810
new evidentiary inconsistencies
and possible Miranda violations

362
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,201
on the part of the Banshee
Sheriff's Department.

363
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,296
In light of these unfortunate developments,
we have no choice

364
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,608
but to vacate the charges
and decline prosecution.

365
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,651
Very well.

366
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,883
I take it there are no
objections from the defense?

367
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,008
- No, Your Honor.
- Motion granted.

368
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,525
All charges are dismissed.

369
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,768
These men are to be released
from custody immediately.

370
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,161
I am free. Home and free.

371
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,449
Mr. Prosecutor,
I'd like a word in my chambers.

372
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,002
Hey, Bunker. How you doing?

373
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,890
I can't believe this
guy's back on the street.

374
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,325
Most of his actresses
are underage.

375
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,086
He doesn't just shoot them,
he drugs them and rapes them.

376
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,931
Nice to see you again,
Mrs. Hopewell.

377
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,169
What happened?

378
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,447
I'm having my things removed.

379
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,483
I thought you'd want to
redecorate your new office.

380
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,966
Thank you, Uncle.

381
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,730
You're welcome.

382
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,284
Aaron Boedicker
didn't kill Rebecca.

383
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,885
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

384
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,966
She was fucking his nephew.

385
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,889
Did you know that?

386
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,045
Who she fucked is
none of my business.

387
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,286
I trust you'll keep me informed
of anything else you find out.

388
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,681
What if I find out it was you?

389
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,089
I got nothing to hide.

390
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,485
Yeah?

391
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,642
Forensics report
came back from the lab.

392
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,921
There was a positive match

393
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,924
to the blood sample we found
in Rebecca Bowman's SUV.

394
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,240
Help me.

395
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,925
Hood.

396
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,446
- Son of a bitch.
- It doesn't make him a killer.

397
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,211
Yeah, well,
it sure as shit makes him a liar.

398
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,931
You're safe now, sweetie.

399
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,684
Everything's gonna be okay.

400
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,966
I'll be right back.

401
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,884
You don't really think he did it,
do you?

402
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,521
I don't want to, but he and Proctor
have never been best buddies.

403
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,928
You know,
maybe Rebecca got caught up between them.

404
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,968
That's not a motive for murder.

405
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,366
- Without that, we don't have a case.
- Yeah, I know.

406
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,881
And we don't have anything
connecting him to the other girls.

407
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,365
No, I know. I know.

408
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,046
And also you know Hood.

409
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,087
I know Hood just well enough to
know that I don't know him at all.

410
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,847
Do you want me to bring him in?

411
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,445
No, let's wait.

412
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,045
Let's see where
this trail leads us.

413
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,043
Yeah.

414
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,491
Thanks.

415
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,161
Right this way, girls.

416
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,766
Welcome to Dick
Webster Productions.

417
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,844
This is where the magic happens.

418
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,844
I want you to sit down.
Sit down on the couch.

419
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,490
Get comfortable.

420
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,809
You want to check out some of the
posters or, you know, some of the DVDs?

421
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,325
I'm gonna get us some cocktails

422
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,250
and then we're gonna start the audition,
okay?

423
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,244
We're gonna make it vodka.

424
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,687
Yeah, buddy.

425
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,805
You got me.

426
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,201
You got me, lady.

427
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,724
Who the fuck are you?

428
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,609
A concerned citizen.

429
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,811
I don't think you
want to mess with me.

430
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,967
I do.

431
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,971
How can Watts
be so fucking blind?

432
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,161
Proctor's got us running
around like niggers in the field

433
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,484
doing all the hard work while that
motherfucker just keeps getting richer.

434
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,322
Maybe all that time in the cage

435
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,927
and Watts doesn't mind taking
it up the ass, but I fucking do.

436
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,681
I'm done being
everybody's bitch.

437
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,728
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

438
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,727
I'm going to wait
for the right moment

439
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,883
and then I'm going
to fucking seize it.

440
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,924
I'm going to remind the
Brotherhood who the fuck we are.

441
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,248
Sometimes I wonder if
I'm the only one who sees

442
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,288
how batshit crazy
this world has become.

443
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,646
Please don't kill me.

444
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,802
Watts has lost his vision.

445
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,524
Fuck Watts.

446
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,721
He doesn't care that
our families are in danger,

447
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,480
that our future is on the brink,
but I do.

448
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,326
Fortune favors the bold.

449
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,166
Power comes from being
willing to do whatever it takes.

450
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,810
Killing you would
be much too easy.

451
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,882
Justice at any cost.

452
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,245
I'll be watching you.

453
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,201
Hello?

454
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,770
Who's there?

455
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,361
Hello?

456
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,926
I don't want any trouble,
Proctor.

457
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,205
I didn't kill Rebecca.
I swear to God.

458
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,450
You can tell him that yourself.

459
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,681
Please. Please.

460
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,762
Good morning, Job.
