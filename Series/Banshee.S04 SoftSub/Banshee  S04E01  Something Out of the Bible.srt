1
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,560
This is Brock.

2
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,723
There's an old hunting cabin up here.
I'm gonna go check it out.

3
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,926
Copy.

4
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,884
Do you want to wait for backup?

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,968
Negative. Looks abandoned.

6
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,571
Holy shit.

7
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,487
Hood.

8
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,764
How'd you find me?

9
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,161
I didn't.

10
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,240
I mean,
I wasn't looking for you.

11
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,641
I thought you were gone.

12
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,490
Hey, you want to do me a favor and
point that thing somewhere else, okay?

13
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,651
Holy hell.

14
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,724
Haven't seen you in two years.

15
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,080
And all that time you've been

16
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,287
living up in this cabin like some
kind of mountain man or something?

17
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,570
Is anybody here with you?

18
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,281
No.

19
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,520
Then I'm gonna need
you to come with me.

20
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,760
No.

21
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,887
I'm not asking.

22
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,447
Sheriff Lotus.

23
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,646
That's right.

24
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,323
How does that feel?

25
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,925
Like a hemorrhoid.

26
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,889
You want to tell me
what this is about?

27
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
I'll tell you down
at the station.

28
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,921
You mean the Cadi?

29
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,761
No.

30
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,480
No, I don't.

31
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,045
What do you think?

32
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,244
Bulletproof glass.

33
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,448
One-and-a-half-inch-thick
polycarb.

34
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,246
Thought you'd like that.

35
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,456
Scott, I need those fingerprint
results as soon as you get them.

36
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,811
- Sure.
- Thanks.

37
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,000
I need to know about
the press conference.

38
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,923
Bunker, you remember Mr. Hood?

39
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,684
Deputy Nina Cruz.

40
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,803
Billy Raven moved on.
He's the new Chief of the Kinaho PD.

41
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,921
Sheriff.

42
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,446
- Helen, any messages?
- On your desk.

43
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,648
- Oh, the FBI?
- Not yet.

44
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,451
Nice office.

45
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,761
Yes, it is.
Can I get you something to drink?

46
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,171
I got water, coffee.

47
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,481
I've got this espresso
machine here.

48
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,841
Have a seat.

49
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,720
First of all, you should know,

50
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,600
when I went up there today,

51
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,368
you were the last
person I expected to find.

52
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,122
Were you in that
cabin two nights ago?

53
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,645
Yes.

54
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,927
- Anybody with you?
- No.

55
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,126
Who's dead?

56
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,561
Who is that?

57
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,126
Rebecca.

58
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,965
Her body was found yesterday,
near the river.

59
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,841
That's not where she was killed,
but that's where the body was dumped.

60
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,246
Jesus.

61
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,209
This is the third murder of its
kind that we've had this year.

62
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,526
- You call the FBI?
- Yeah.

63
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,329
I called them after
the second one.

64
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,496
And they sent some
little shit up here,

65
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,256
and he looked through our
files and took some notes,

66
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,205
and then he ran back to Quantico as fast
as his little $60 loafers could take him.

67
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,090
Told me to call back if
a third body turned up.

68
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,764
So maybe now
they'll give a shit.

69
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,640
So,
what does this have to do with me?

70
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,324
When was the last
time you saw Rebecca?

71
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,970
I haven't seen anyone

72
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,084
for about 18 months.

73
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,640
You know, and yet,
it's the weird part,

74
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,961
the last coordinates
on her car's GPS

75
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,530
brought me up to
your cabin today.

76
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,487
- You didn't see her?
- Nope.

77
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
Any idea why she'd
come looking for you?

78
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,856
You know, how the hell she even
know you were up there, Hood?

79
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,336
I'm just trying to
put this together.

80
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,283
- It's her uncle's land.
- It's what?

81
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,761
It's her uncle's land.

82
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,936
You're living on Proctor's land?

83
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,610
He doesn't know.

84
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,170
What happened to you, Hood?

85
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,291
I retired.

86
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,888
We found trace blood
that didn't match Rebecca's.

87
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,526
I'm gonna need you to, uh,

88
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,171
voluntarily submit a blood
sample so we can rule you out.

89
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,096
What, do you think I'm a
fucking serial killer, now?

90
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,645
Have you seen yourself lately,
Hood?

91
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,166
You're living up in the woods.
You look like the Unabomber.

92
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,321
Yes, you can have my blood.

93
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,606
Oh, and, Hood,

94
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,960
if there's anything else you
want to tell me, now's the time.

95
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,764
You should be
looking at Proctor.

96
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,684
Yeah, well, these days
that's a little more complicated.

97
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,841
He's...

98
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,410
Yeah?

99
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,216
- Press conference is about to start.
- Oh, shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

100
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,368
- Okay.
- Sheriff Hood.

101
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,681
He's not the Sheriff.

102
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,126
Listen, I'll have Deputy Cruz
come up and take your blood,

103
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,680
and then she'll
give you a lift back.

104
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,525
Take care of yourself.

105
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,165
And you are?

106
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,486
Is there something wrong?

107
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,562
Sorry, you just, uh...

108
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,843
You reminded me of
someone for a moment.

109
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,921
Mmm.

110
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,042
Deputy who got killed.
Indian gangbanger broke her neck?

111
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,127
I think I like you better
when you don't talk.

112
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,281
Sir.

113
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,241
Sir.

114
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,445
It's time.

115
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,845
Mr. Mayor, this is the third
murder of a young woman this year.

116
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,056
Is this a serial killer and...

117
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,208
Is it true that the latest
victim was your niece?

118
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,601
Mr. Mayor,
why are the police reports being withheld?

119
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,009
Here's... Here's what we know.
Here's what we know.

120
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,208
Yesterday,
the body of Rebecca Bowman

121
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,005
was found near the mouth
of the Dellwood Basin.

122
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,040
She was murdered.

123
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,456
And while the police
can't say for certain,

124
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,245
there are definitely
similarities between this case

125
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,881
and the murders of two other young
women that occurred over the last year.

126
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,923
The Banshee Sheriff
Department has notified the FBI,

127
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,800
and agents are en route
to assist in the investigation.

128
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,607
And to answer your question,
yes, Rebecca was my niece.

129
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,209
And, yes,
you can rest assured that neither I

130
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,682
nor Sheriff Lotus and the
members of his department will rest

131
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,242
until we have found this sick,
twisted bastard.

132
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,771
So, this is it?

133
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,926
Yes, this is it.

134
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,091
It's beautiful.

135
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,768
I'm going to be Mayor,

136
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,004
and you're taking on more of a
leadership role in the business.

137
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,282
I just figured we'd need
something a bit more secure.

138
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,286
Do you like it?

139
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,966
I love it.

140
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,006
Get out.

141
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,130
What's going on?

142
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,249
DA dismissed the charges.
You're free to go.

143
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,361
You're fucking with us.

144
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,967
You got 10 seconds before
I close that door again.

145
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,961
I knew that arrest was bullshit.

146
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,370
- What was it this time?
- Physical evidence.

147
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,684
They practically
strangled that old man.

148
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,531
I know.
DA's a real piece of work.

149
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,125
He's a puppet.

150
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,560
Proctor's got his
hand up his ass.

151
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,844
But that's a talk
for another time.

152
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,763
The walls have ears.

153
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,651
Hey, thanks a lot, Officers.
Have a nice evening.

154
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,769
There's always some part of
me that's thinking about him.

155
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,522
How he looked when he died.

156
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,886
How he looked at me.

157
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,250
There are days when that look
haunts me so badly I can barely breathe.

158
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,561
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look at this.

159
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,609
And then there are days
when I can distract myself.

160
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,808
You lost, honey?

161
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,848
Where I can shut
off all the noise.

162
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,366
Maybe we can help
you find your way.

163
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,851
Oh, I hope so.

164
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,484
And just do what I have to do.

165
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,409
Those are the good days.

166
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,488
So, you tough guys like
beating up on people, huh?

167
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,568
It wasn't us. They let us go.

168
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,369
Well, they shouldn't have.

169
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,487
There's always that
moment when I just wake up

170
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,767
where I think I'm still there.

171
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,289
Still back there
in our old house.

172
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,409
And when I roll over,
Gordon will be there lying next to me.

173
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,883
And then I'll hear the
kids stirring in their rooms.

174
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,443
So, how do you handle it?

175
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,806
I exercise.

176
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,050
I eat something.

177
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,362
I start working on the house.

178
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,204
How's the house coming along?

179
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,080
There's something about working
with my hands that gives me peace.

180
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,284
What else gives you peace?

181
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,121
Not much.

182
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,723
Do you find our
sessions helpful?

183
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,042
I'm here because
it's court-mandated.

184
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,047
No offense.

185
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,887
None taken.

186
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,607
If I vouch for your competency
to parent your children, today,

187
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,641
would you come back?

188
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,608
If I said yes,
would you do that?

189
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
That's not really how it works.

190
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,080
They had no right
to take my kids away.

191
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,411
- You violated the terms of your probation.
- I was abducted.

192
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,368
The military
investigation cleared us.

193
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,047
Any association with the criminal
element was enough for social services...

194
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,281
I know.

195
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,681
I know.

196
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,682
How many times are
you gonna ruin our lives?

197
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,531
From now on, you're just the
asshole who knocked up my mom.

198
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,406
Please.

199
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,847
What are you doing here?

200
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,607
The manager told me our
former sheriff was on a bender.

201
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,565
Trashing the room.

202
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,766
Playing with guns.

203
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,764
How is that your business?

204
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,126
It's my uncle's motel.

205
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,009
Just leave me alone, would you?

206
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,401
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

207
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,891
Please go.

208
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,565
You can't stay here.

209
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,485
Let me take you
back to your place.

210
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,688
No, I can't live there anymore.

211
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,363
- There's ghosts.
- Hmm.

212
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,446
Even before you wrecked it,
this dump is nowhere to live.

213
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,882
Come on. Let's go for a ride.

214
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,363
It's an old hunting cabin.

215
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,890
Hasn't been used in years,
but the water still runs.

216
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,605
Whose is it?

217
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,286
Who do you think?

218
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,725
You really think your uncle's
gonna let me stay here?

219
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,240
He won't know.

220
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,085
How do you like it?

221
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,566
Yeah.

222
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,331
I thought you would.

223
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,850
No ghosts.

224
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,768
- Does this hurt?
- Not anymore.

225
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,525
I hate that they
did this to you.

226
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,727
I had been meaning to get
that tattoo removed anyway.

227
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,924
Just wish it could
always be like this.

228
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,166
Maybe one day.

229
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,046
You Okay?

230
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,201
No.

231
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
Hang on right there.
He'll be with you in a moment.

232
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,566
You fuck.

233
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,686
We have a strict agreement
with the Redbones.

234
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,766
You keep your business on the reservation,
and we keep ours off it.

235
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,447
You are in breach
of that agreement.

236
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,486
Yeah?

237
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,926
I just got to work,
for fuck's sake.

238
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,840
Who's there?

239
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,600
Shit.

240
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,089
No. Okay. Don't do a fucking thing.
I'm coming back to town.

241
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,445
Well, you can ask him yourself.

242
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,126
Things are going
fantastic over here.

243
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,487
This time you're buying. Okay.

244
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,600
All right, all right, all right.
Great.

245
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,206
Say hi to Carol for me.

246
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,245
Hey there, Calvin.
What can I do you for?

247
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,324
I'm not feeling great.
I'm gonna need to go home.

248
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,849
- You look fine.
- I've got a stomach bug.

249
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,056
I thought I could make it through the day,
but I can't.

250
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,960
You're handling the tri-quarterlies,
aren't you?

251
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,527
Mmm-hmm.

252
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,647
They done?

253
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,851
Not yet, no.

254
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,164
Kind of need those done today.

255
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,776
Well,
I can take them home with me

256
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,736
and I'll have them done
for you first thing tomorrow.

257
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,525
We were late with them last quarter,
too, weren't we?

258
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,204
I don't think so, no.

259
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,085
I think we were, Calvin.

260
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,048
Gook motherfucker!

261
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,847
I'll have those to you
first thing tomorrow.

262
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,400
What the fuck is he doing here?

263
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,888
We came in and found him here with
this motherfucker already in the vice.

264
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,244
He was dealing in our territory.

265
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,449
The territory you and your
men are charged with protecting.

266
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,323
I brought him here as

267
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,481
a courtesy.

268
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,961
Mmm-hmm.

269
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,160
So my tax dollars aren't enough
for you and your little tribe, huh?

270
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,081
Now you fuckers are going
to encroach on my business?

271
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,041
Fuck you.

272
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,526
I don't think so.

273
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,526
We pay for your houses...

274
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,404
For your damn reservations,

275
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,211
for your school and
your health care,

276
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,489
even when all of you were getting
rich off your fucking casinos, right?

277
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,442
This country has lost its spine.

278
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,416
The politicians are giving it away
to the mutts and the mongrels

279
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,842
while good,
pure-blooded Americans go hungry.

280
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,728
This isn't a nation anymore.
It's a fucking soup kitchen!

281
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,960
And you know what?

282
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,169
We're all out of fucking soup!

283
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,603
Thanks for the heads up.

284
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,536
You can tell Proctor that
we've got it under control.

285
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,360
Don't use his name
in front of outsiders.

286
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,646
Him?

287
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Yeah, I don't think he's
paying too much attention.

288
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,367
You don't want me
to come back here.

289
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,731
Hey, Sugar.

290
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,440
You disappear for
a year and a half,

291
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,568
you show up here looking like

292
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,008
something out of the Bible,

293
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,921
and all you got to
say for yourself is

294
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,050
"Hey, Sugar"?

295
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,406
How you been?

296
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,805
Small talk?

297
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,641
Seriously?

298
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,290
Somebody killed Rebecca Bowman.

299
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,966
I know that.

300
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,649
Everybody around
here knows that.

301
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,523
Now why do you know that?

302
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,366
Well,

303
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,091
I guess I'm a suspect.

304
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,486
Did you do it?

305
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,761
No.

306
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,602
Look, it's a fair question.

307
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,289
I mean, look at yourself.

308
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,608
Where the hell have you been?

309
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,090
I had to disappear for a while.

310
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,246
Clear my head.

311
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,971
You clear your
head for a few days.

312
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,966
A week maybe.

313
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,884
For you, maybe even a month.

314
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,962
But you, you went AWOL.

315
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,486
And you forgot about your
friends and you forgot about...

316
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,050
I did not forget about Job.

317
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,641
How the fuck was hiding
away gonna help him?

318
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,250
You here for your money?

319
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,486
No.

320
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,209
But I do need a car.

321
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,531
Only thing I bought.

322
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,446
Figured it might come in handy
if I ever needed a quick exit.

323
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,446
So, what happens now?

324
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,447
I don't know.

325
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,644
But something, right?

326
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,522
Yeah. Something.

327
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,369
Remember, Hood,
you're not the sheriff anymore.

328
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,086
I never was.

329
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,125
You know what I mean!

330
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,328
What'd the other guy look like?

331
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,401
Ha-ha.

332
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,724
Very fucking funny.

333
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,369
Actually, I wasn't kidding.

334
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,131
What did he look like?

335
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,805
He looked like a fucking asshole
smashing the shit out of my hands.

336
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,170
The guy stuck around long
enough to walk all over your face,

337
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,526
and you didn't even get a look?

338
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,965
It was dark.

339
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,765
Don't worry.

340
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,971
I got time.

341
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,887
You're back.

342
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,005
Sorry about Rebecca.

343
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,400
What does this
have to do with you?

344
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,681
Nothing.

345
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,245
And yet here you are.
Is there anything I should know?

346
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,806
Your uncle,

347
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,241
he's not a good man.

348
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,765
Well, then,
let me live with you.

349
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,330
I'm not a good man either.

350
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,928
I was gonna ask
you the same thing.

351
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,844
You think I had anything
to do with my niece's death?

352
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,651
You may not have killed her,
but you sure as shit got her killed.

353
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,251
As soon as you took her in,
it was only a matter of time.

354
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,686
Yeah.

355
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,607
You may be right.

356
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,922
I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch.

357
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,245
But as a mayor,

358
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,601
I'm somewhat hampered in
my ability to clarify matters.

359
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,045
How'd you pull that off?

360
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,566
I ran unopposed.

361
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,406
Of course.

362
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,364
Where would you start?

363
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,847
With the foothills.
The Boedickers.

364
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,930
- I heard they got burned down.
- It's true.

365
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,802
But Aaron
Boedicker's still alive.

366
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,324
You guys,
you did see the yellow tape here, right?

367
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,526
Sheriff.

368
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,127
It's fine.

369
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,689
Our work is done here.

370
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,641
Following me, Brock?

371
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,767
Me? No.

372
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,800
That's what deputies are for.

373
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,010
Is Hood a suspect?

374
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,962
Well, if he was, you'd be the
first to know it, wouldn't you?

375
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,445
No, Mr. Hood is a person
of interest in this case,

376
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,240
which is something
you two have in common.

377
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,611
- Be careful, Sheriff.
- I always am, Mr. Mayor.

378
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,125
Just like old times, huh?

379
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,411
Except no one's bleeding.

380
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,281
Yet.

381
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,121
Hey, Kurt.

382
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,161
Come on, bro.
How long are you gonna keep this up, man?

383
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,281
Huh?

384
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,204
I saved your fucking life, Kurt.

385
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,696
What do you think Watts would have done?
He would've had you executed.

386
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,803
I took action before he could order it,
that's it.

387
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,611
I was in the burn
unit for two months.

388
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,569
I know and I'm sorry,

389
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,574
but you put me in an
impossible situation

390
00:37:09,598 --> 00:37:11,531
and I had to prove
my loyalty to the cause.

391
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,931
You know that.

392
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,203
Just come for dinner, man.

393
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,325
Maggie would
really love to see you.

394
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,243
And we can work this out.

395
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,560
Brothers before Brotherhood,
that's what you always said.

396
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,445
You're not my brother.

397
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,004
What?
What the fuck did you just say to me?

398
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,330
I'm the only thing standing
between them and you, asshole.

399
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,443
You better fucking
remember that!

400
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,201
- Hey, Carrie.
- Hey, Brock.

401
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,960
The place is really
starting to come together.

402
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,686
- Thanks.
- No.

403
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,526
Looks good.

404
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,050
How are the kids doing?

405
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,723
Oh, you know.
Gordon's parents are driving them crazy.

406
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,244
Something on your mind, Brock?

407
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,163
Listen, Carrie,
I don't know if you've heard,

408
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,127
but Hood is back.

409
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,969
Guess you haven't heard.

410
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,563
He's been living up in
the foothills in a cabin.

411
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,642
He, uh... He looks rough.

412
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,040
Just thought you'd want to know.

413
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,441
Yeah.

414
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,160
Call me if you need anything,
all right?

415
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,926
Okay.

416
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,400
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

417
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,123
Lewis, is everything okay?

418
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,851
Lewis, come in.

419
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,971
Don't fucking move.

420
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,446
Something funny?

421
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,691
Wait for it.

422
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,361
Uh-uh.

423
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,040
Drop it!

424
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,087
You.

425
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,766
Me.

426
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,371
Long time, huh?

427
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,570
Why don't you take a seat?

428
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,167
You finally tracked me
down after all these years.

429
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,165
Who are you?

430
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,206
My name is Dalton.

431
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,486
Are you military?

432
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,001
I was.

433
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,131
But now I recruit men like you.
I develop them for an elite unit.

434
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,491
What unit?

435
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,801
What branch?

436
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,167
Exactly.

437
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,931
So,

438
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,322
- This is revenge?
- Revenge?

439
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,010
Not really.

440
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,445
Where's Job?

441
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,326
How the fuck would I know?

442
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,449
No, no, no, no. You know how this works.
You taught me.

443
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,370
Elbows, insteps, knees.
I can keep you alive for fucking days.

444
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,523
I know, which is why if I knew something,
I would tell you.

445
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,647
Bullshit.

446
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,768
I didn't take him.

447
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,207
But the man who did
knew I would want him.

448
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,329
I paid him his price
and he handed over Job.

449
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,687
Then what?

450
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,131
I turned him in.

451
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,840
I cleaned my slate
with the powers that be.

452
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,245
- And who are they?
- Oh, come on.

453
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,449
Don't be a fucking idiot.
You know how this works.

454
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,807
Faces without names,
names without faces.

455
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,360
Yeah, go ahead.
Go ahead, shoot my other knee.

456
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,324
Go ahead. You know that it
won't change what I'm saying.

457
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,410
I have no idea
where they took him.

458
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,891
No, but you can find him.

459
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,851
Black sites, ghost detention centers.
You have access to those files.

460
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,048
Not anymore.
After the congressional hearings,

461
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,164
they closed the
loop and I'm not in it.

462
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,765
Bullshit.
You are the fucking loop.

463
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,171
I was. That was 20 years ago.
Things change.

464
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,889
Why are we even
having this conversation?

465
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,443
You know that
Job is already dead.

466
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,490
No, he has intelligence.
He's a valuable asset.

467
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,564
His intelligence
was 20 years old.

468
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,331
He was a fucking trophy grab.

469
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,691
- He was a head on somebody's wall.
- Whose wall?

470
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,244
Doesn't matter.

471
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,090
The man's dead.

472
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,404
You know it and I know it.

473
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,008
We got to go. We got to go now!

474
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,881
I guess I'm still
in certain loops.

475
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,801
Go, go, go!

476
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,840
Did he come to see you?

477
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,081
Yes.

478
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,444
But he's not the man
that left that night.

479
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,726
Not anymore.

480
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,682
- Well, did he say where he's been?
- No.

481
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,967
Did he say anything?

482
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,888
You thought he might
have a lead on Job?

483
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,721
Look, the day he left,

484
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,763
that was the day you needed to
stop looking to him for any answers.

485
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,081
You think Job's still alive?

486
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,721
I don't know.

487
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,483
Sometimes I hope he isn't.

488
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,007
Why?

489
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,731
Because if he is,
it makes us even bigger assholes

490
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,961
than we already are.

491
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,970
So, you got nothing.

492
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,120
Nothing.

493
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,609
Either he didn't know
or he wouldn't say.

494
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,805
He didn't know.

495
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,848
I guess we'll never know now.

496
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,096
Did you really have to kill him?

497
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,565
He didn't know.

498
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,360
Okay.

499
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,925
What's our next play?

500
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,525
We don't have one.

501
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,200
It's over.

502
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,561
No.

503
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,482
We don't just give up.

504
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,050
We have no choice.

505
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,366
So, what?

506
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,447
- You're done?
- We got nothing.

507
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,805
- So we find something.
- We've got nothing.

508
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,728
- I can't just leave him for dead.
- Do you think I want to?

509
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,529
Don't you think I'd do anything?

510
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,210
Dalton was right.

511
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,086
He was right.

512
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,249
Job was dead from the
moment he handed him over.

513
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,770
Where the hell are you going?

514
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,086
He's dead.

515
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,125
Anybody home?

516
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,926
Hello?

517
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,203
Daddy!

518
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,362
What's up, little man?

519
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,851
- Where's your mommy?
- Upstairs.

520
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,081
Yeah?

521
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,889
Babe, I'm home!

522
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,689
Coming.

523
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,247
God, you got bigger.
What do you weigh, like 1,000 pounds?

524
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,960
- No.
- What, are you, like, 10 feet tall?

525
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,128
- No.
- Okay, maybe tomorrow.

526
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,205
- Hi.
- Hi.

527
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,931
You're home early.

528
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,320
Yeah,
we finished the tri-quarterlies today.

529
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,722
The slope gave
everybody the day off.

530
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,131
Nice.

531
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,010
It smells really good in here.

532
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,731
It's just a pot roast
and some soup.

533
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,801
Hmm.

534
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,360
- You want to go shoot some hoops? Yeah?
- Yeah.

535
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,080
Maybe we'll go play and Mommy
will let us know when dinner's ready?

536
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,016
Don't beat me like you did last time,
though, okay?

537
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,000
- Will you take it easy on your old man?
- I will.

538
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,160
I'm pretty sure I'm going to beat you,
though.

539
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,884
Where would you start?

540
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,325
With the foothills.
The Boedickers.

541
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,249
I heard they got burned down.

542
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,928
Aaron Boedicker's still alive.

543
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,049
Hey, Boedicker.

544
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,160
Remember me?

545
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,805
Where were you four nights ago?

546
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,005
Fuck you.

547
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,609
I'm not gonna ask you again!

548
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,720
I don't know what
the fuck you want,

549
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,969
but I'm not telling you shit.

550
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,648
You took my fucking hand.

551
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,885
Rebecca Bowman
got killed four days ago.

552
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,363
Fucking bitch had it coming.

553
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,816
Yeah, see,
when you say things like that,

554
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,207
that makes me think you
had something to do with it.

555
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,528
Oh, you can torture me all you want,
you fucking sadist,

556
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,126
but I'm only gonna
tell you two things.

557
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,370
I didn't kill her,

558
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,405
and I don't give
a shit she's dead.

559
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,609
You do know something.

560
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,405
Oh, I know a lot of things.

561
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,562
You know how a guy with
no hands wipes his ass?

562
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,325
I've... I've got a nephew.

563
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,007
Eljay.

564
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,047
Thinks he's some
kind of rock star.

565
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,841
He was fucking her for a while.

566
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,685
Where do I find him?

567
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,404
I don't know where he stays,

568
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,245
but he plays nights at this
shithole called Snake Eyes.

569
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,481
It's off the connector.

570
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,771
I find out you're lying to me,
I come back for the other hand.

571
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,849
You're not welcome around here.

572
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,480
I better get going, then.

573
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,129
- You're not going anywhere.
- Want to bet?

574
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,728
Looks like you're gonna
end up full of holes.

575
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,007
Not before I put one
big fucking hole in you.

576
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,162
- Okay, let's break it up!
- God damn it.

577
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,401
Now.

578
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,051
Most cops know better
than to come into the hills.

579
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,647
Most assholes know better
than to talk back to me.

580
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,656
Something makes me
think if I start looking,

581
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,081
I'm gonna find a lot of
outstanding warrants standing here.

582
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,610
So, you are following me around.

583
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,296
Yeah, I thought that was
obvious by the way I pulled up

584
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,800
right at the nick of
time to save your ass.

585
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,400
What are you doing here, Hood?

586
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,282
Just visiting an old friend.

587
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,964
I'm guessing you're
working an angle.

588
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,081
That Rebecca was killed by
one of her uncle's enemies.

589
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,570
I'm not working any angles.

590
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,001
You're the sheriff now.
This is your fucking mess.

591
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,648
Yeah, and you're still a
person of interest in this mess.

592
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,121
Does that mean you're gonna
follow me all fucking day?

593
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,016
Yeah, well, believe it or not, Hood,
I've got better things to do with my time.

594
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,087
Good.

595
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,808
And you're welcome, by the way!
