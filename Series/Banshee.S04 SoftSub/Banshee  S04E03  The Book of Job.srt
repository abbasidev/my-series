1
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,625
Know what photokeratitis is?

2
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,541
How about flash blindness?

3
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,311
The same thing, really.

4
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:39,011
Both caused by excessive
exposure to ultraviolet light.

5
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:46,985
Cornea burns,
unable to handle the light's intensity.

6
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,089
And you temporarily
lose your vision.

7
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:59,662
In theory,
pain is only psychological

8
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,167
since the retina has
no pain receptors.

9
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:10,909
This particular model was
built by Homeland Security

10
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,382
to torture prisoners after 9/11.

11
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,919
Unfortunately, it was banned

12
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,219
after some of those
fuckers went blind for good.

13
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,674
Let me the fuck out!

14
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,418
Or I'll fucking kill you!

15
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,217
Motherfucker,
I will fucking kill you!

16
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,571
Thank you.

17
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,144
Hey, Bunker.

18
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,078
Doctor says you're
gonna be all right.

19
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,788
Hey. Hey, hey.

20
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,225
It's okay. It's okay.
You're safe. Look at me.

21
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,060
It's okay.

22
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,134
You have a fever.

23
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,671
Your body is fighting
off the infection.

24
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,672
I'm gonna lift up your head,
okay?

25
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:57,013
Hold it down. That's good. Okay.

26
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,288
That's good.

27
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,593
That's it, swallow.

28
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:12,131
I'm gonna clean you up a little bit more,
okay?

29
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,468
It's gonna sting.

30
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,376
Do you have any idea

31
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,205
what you're even doing?

32
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,115
You're still breathing,
aren't you?

33
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,701
You.

34
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,675
You gonna invite us in?

35
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,115
Colonel Stowe may
have been crazy,

36
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,453
but he was still military
and kept meticulous records.

37
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,024
After Genoa,
CID seized his files.

38
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,860
I tried everything I could
to get my hands on them,

39
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,557
but I kept hitting brick walls.

40
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,530
So, then she came back to you?

41
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,865
Y'all know busting through
walls is my specialty.

42
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,070
Okay, so,
then you stole the Genoa files from CID?

43
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,046
Don't need to steal when you
got the power of persuasion.

44
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,514
Took a little longer
than I would have liked.

45
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,212
Finally got to the right
record clerk in the Pentagon.

46
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,714
In exchange for me
not chopping off his dick,

47
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,724
he graciously supplied
me with a copy of the files.

48
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,755
There was a list of everyone
working on the base that day.

49
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,656
So, you compared it to the
list of casualties?

50
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,379
One name was unaccounted for.

51
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,757
Private contractor
named Leo Fitzpatrick.

52
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,510
I'm guessing you know
how to find this Leo?

53
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,586
Of course, soldier boy.

54
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,755
I've never been
on my own before.

55
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,493
You're not on your own.

56
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,025
Sir?

57
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,428
Nina Cruz.

58
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,935
Send her in.

59
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,940
- Mr. Mayor.
- What is it, Deputy?

60
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,808
The last three guys your
district attorney cut loose

61
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,211
were all royally
fucked up after the fact.

62
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,881
- Vigilante?
- I think it's more than that.

63
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,148
See,
all three releases were connected to you.

64
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:22,057
Whoever the vigilante is,
they know you've got the DA in your pocket.

65
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,792
Someone's sending you a message.

66
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,827
Sheriff Lotus.

67
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,166
What do you think, Deputy?

68
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:34,224
I think Brock makes a lot of noise,
but he'd never come after you like that.

69
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,365
Then get me a name.

70
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,139
It could get messy.

71
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,304
Then you'll clean it up.

72
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,473
You hired me to be
your eyes and your ears.

73
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,381
I don't mind doing the cleaning,
but that costs more.

74
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,484
Then you better be worth it.

75
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,570
Sheriff?

76
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,082
Helen,
the damn Internet is broken again.

77
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,380
I'll take a look.
The Bowmans are here to see you.

78
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,380
Oh, shit.

79
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,448
- Shall I bring them upstairs?
- Uh, no. No, I'll do it.

80
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,618
Try to fix this.

81
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,860
- Mr. and Mrs. Bowman.
- Sheriff.

82
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,003
Would you like to come
up to my office and talk?

83
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,770
The county coroner won't
release Rebecca's body to us.

84
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,605
Uh, yes, that's true.

85
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,339
Unfortunately,
the body can't be released

86
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,346
until the coroner has determined
an official cause of death.

87
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,111
The funeral must
be held immediately.

88
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,811
- I understand.
- This is our way.

89
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,546
It's... It's been a week
since our daughter's passing.

90
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,123
I know,
and I assure you my entire department

91
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,286
is working day and night
on your daughter's case.

92
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,887
You have no right
to keep her from us.

93
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:11,129
- Mrs. Bowman...
- Please, let us put her to rest.

94
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:18,965
Um...

95
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,974
All right,
let me make some calls.

96
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:25,413
I'll try to move things along,
okay?

97
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,916
I promise.

98
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,684
Come. Let's go.

99
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,987
Again, I'm sorry for your loss.

100
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,659
With technology crossing
cultural boundaries,

101
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,132
computer ethics are
virtually intractable.

102
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,708
Why?
Well, how can we set a global standard

103
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,367
when cultural relativism
makes it impossible?

104
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:50,941
And by "we", I mean" thew.

105
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,603
And by "they",
I mean the United States government.

106
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:58,312
But what they can do is enforce title 18,
section 1030.

107
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,891
If you are caught
accessing a computer

108
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,819
with intent to steal information or
damage a network, you will go to jail.

109
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,978
And when you're out, you'll get a
six-figure gig as a security analyst.

110
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,288
That's it. Go home.
I'll see you all next week.

111
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,727
Hey.

112
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,207
That's great.

113
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,507
Go to the next station!

114
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,401
Please stand clear of the doors.

115
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,101
- I'm on the train.
- Copy. I'm on the move.

116
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,105
Next stop, Wallace Street.

117
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,945
What the fuck, bro?

118
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,053
Asshole.

119
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:47,917
Move!

120
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,221
- He's on the train.
- Copy.

121
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,761
Hey!

122
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:22,748
Whoa, whoa.

123
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,951
Move!

124
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,769
About time, soldier boy.

125
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,600
Just get him in the car!

126
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,780
Get the fuck in the car!

127
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,522
Come on,
get the fuck in the car!

128
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,642
- Yeah, got him.
- Jesus fucking Christ, come on!

129
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,641
- Hi, Kurt.
- Maggie.

130
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,019
I heard you were back.

131
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,414
What are you doing here?

132
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,022
I brought you some groceries.

133
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,992
Why?

134
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:35,221
I don't see anyone else
lining up to help you out.

135
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,891
I don't need any help.

136
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,026
Yeah, of course you don't.

137
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,064
Are you gonna let me in?

138
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,543
Yeah. Yeah.

139
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:06,019
I haven't, uh,
had time to go through my mail yet.

140
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,365
I called the hospital every
week to check on you.

141
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:16,802
No one told me.

142
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,466
I asked them not to.

143
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:26,816
I know that it was Calvin and
his goons that did that to you.

144
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,212
Why didn't you report them?

145
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,389
That you asking or Calvin?

146
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,354
Don't be an asshole.

147
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:38,478
You know
he'd kill me if he knew I was here.

148
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,264
I want to kill him for
what he did to you.

149
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,237
It's just amazing how

150
00:18:55,601 --> 00:19:00,243
two brothers can be so different
and so alike at the same time.

151
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,754
I have to get home.

152
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,596
- My cell.
- If you need anything.

153
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,415
- Shit. Shit. Shit.
- What?

154
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,555
Calvin.

155
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,873
What the fuck?

156
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,681
Where the fuck are you?

157
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,516
I can't do this, Kurt.

158
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:52,089
I know.
It's not always gonna be like this.

159
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,391
You think you can
still get him out?

160
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,034
No, I don't. I did.

161
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,070
But after this...

162
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,142
I know there's no
coming back for him.

163
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,604
I just need to figure
out how to put him away.

164
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,374
That's gonna take some time.

165
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,245
Time's not gonna change anything,
Kurt.

166
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,219
What do you want me to do?

167
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,255
Just kill him now.

168
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,232
I can't kill my own brother.

169
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,234
He's Hank's father.

170
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:43,110
Kurt, when I was a little girl,

171
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,480
my father poisoned me with fear.

172
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:50,780
He made sure that I
would only ever feel safe

173
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,749
If I was with a
man just like him.

174
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,925
And I just accepted that.
That that's how things would always be.

175
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,428
And then you came back.

176
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,129
For the first time in my life,
I thought things could be different.

177
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,093
But this isn't about me.

178
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:13,642
I'm terrified that my son is
gonna turn out to be just like Calvin

179
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,702
and just like my father.

180
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,782
Mean, hateful, violent.

181
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,545
I won't let that happen.

182
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,448
You have to trust me, Maggie.

183
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,896
I assume there's a good reason
why this son of a bitch is still breathing.

184
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,701
Hey, Leo.

185
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,337
Jesus Fuck!

186
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,308
Where's Job?

187
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,915
What?

188
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,649
Where's Job?

189
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,220
Where the fuck is Job?

190
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,163
I don't know who that is.

191
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:16,065
Tell me another lie. Please?

192
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,742
See how this works?

193
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,676
Every time you bullshit us,
she's gonna hit you.

194
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,077
When she gets tired,
I'm gonna start.

195
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,517
She hits hard.

196
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,889
I hit harder.

197
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,191
You understand?

198
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:40,192
You took our friend.
And we want him back.

199
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,866
Untie me,
I'll think about helping you.

200
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,699
Stop!

201
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:59,376
The boy can't talk if he ain't conscious.
Take Nikita to the kitchen.

202
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,710
Give me and Sugar a minute.

203
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,446
Go!

204
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,679
I'm sorry.

205
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,249
You were just doing
what we all wanted to.

206
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,430
It's just,
everybody disappeared all at once,

207
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,097
you know'?

208
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,168
It's all my fault.

209
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,172
Job knew the risks.

210
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:04,773
We all did.

211
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:09,116
I'm not talking about Job.

212
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,120
You know,
I spent nearly two years up in those hills

213
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,859
blaming myself for
everything that happened.

214
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:28,365
Now that would have been a big
waste of time if this was all your fault.

215
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,206
Everything got so fucked up.

216
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:40,907
Yeah, it did.

217
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,019
Mr. Fitzpatrick has
had a change of heart.

218
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:54,157
Really?
You always travel with a handsaw?

219
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,593
Tools of the trade, soldier boy.

220
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,906
It would be best for you if
you told them what you told us.

221
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,849
After Genoa, Job was interrogated
for three months straight.

222
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,522
They worked him for names,
dates, everything.

223
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:28,891
- But he wouldn't give them shit.
- That stubborn motherfucker.

224
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:33,031
So, they gave up
and they marked him for EDE.

225
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:35,865
What the hell is that?

226
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:39,274
Extended detainment
and exploitation.

227
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,907
It's usually reserved
for enemies of the

228
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:44,473
state who require
some extra motivation.

229
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,106
So, where is he now'?

230
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:52,115
- Where the fuck is he?
- They're keeping him in a black site.

231
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:56,216
A supermax hellhole that makes
Abu Ghraib look like the Four Seasons.

232
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,959
- How do we get in there?
- You don't.

233
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,964
- How?
- No one gets in, period.

234
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:05,459
- Wrong answer, homes.
- Wait! Wait!

235
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,664
No one gets in, but we might be able
to buy him out if you have the cash.

236
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,298
- Cut his fucking foot off.
- No, don't!

237
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,434
The money is not for me!

238
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,970
Look, the government needs
plausible deniability,

239
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,482
so, these places,
they are completely autonomous.

240
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,416
The guys who are running them,
they answer to no one.

241
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,512
Sometimes, they'll deal.

242
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,460
- How much?
- How much do you have?

243
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,623
So much for early retirement.

244
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,966
Job is gonna be really
pissed that we spent it all.

245
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,937
He'll get over it.

246
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,203
Make the call.

247
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,042
Glad you kept it safe
for us all these months.

248
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,483
Yeah,
I was saving it for a rainy day.

249
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:59,882
I made the deal.
What are you talking about?

250
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:03,225
Are you sure? The money is here.
I am staring right at it.

251
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:06,057
But if he dies, you get nothing,
you hear me?

252
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,497
What the fuck just happened?

253
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:14,698
- Job is scheduled to go dark.
- What the hell does that mean?

254
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,831
It means they have
no further use for him.

255
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,170
- When?
- Unclear.

256
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,417
It could be two days,
it could be two hours.

257
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:23,577
You want him back alive,
we need to go now.

258
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,993
Okay,
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.

259
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,261
You never heard of
the five-second rule?

260
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,525
You finished with
Rebecca Bowman?

261
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,536
Well, she's Y'd and tied,
but it's gonna be some time

262
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,960
before I finish
the full pathology.

263
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,440
No, we are out of time, Dan.

264
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,010
I need to get this girl's
body home to her family.

265
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,171
I hope you're not asking
me to rush the autopsy

266
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,955
for the victim of an
alleged serial killer.

267
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,581
Tell me what you have so far,
then, all right?

268
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,551
What I've got is an
autopsy in progress.

269
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,917
Don't test me Dan.
Don't fucking test me right now.

270
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:07,115
Jesus Christ, Brock, relax.

271
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:20,058
Well, puncture wounds
and tearing of the soft tissue

272
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,536
are consistent
with animal bites,

273
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,436
but they were most
likely caused postmortem.

274
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,607
Right, she was already dead when
he dumped her body in the woods.

275
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:27,133
- We knew that, right?
- Yes.

276
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:31,203
But she was still alive when he
filleted her chest and cut her heart out.

277
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,908
That's some real
Temple of Doom shit.

278
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,914
So, it is the same
as the other two girls.

279
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,820
Sick son of a bitch.

280
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,689
I'll bet a week's pay
the tox screen will find

281
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,784
similar traces of Valium
and Demerol in her system.

282
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:48,090
He probably used just
enough to keep her conscious,

283
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,364
but knock the fight out of her.

284
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:50,932
God damn it, Dan.
Just give me something.

285
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,230
Anything to catch this asshole.

286
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,770
A fingerprint, a DNA, something.

287
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,601
This guy's good, Brock.
He covers his tracks like a pro.

288
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,298
Fuck you!
You've got nothing, then.

289
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:02,345
Actually,
I've got the opposite of nothing.

290
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,418
Holy shit.

291
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,887
I haven't seen you in here before,
have I?

292
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,459
You don't look like
our usual clientele.

293
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,295
I'll just have a cup of coffee.

294
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,565
Could I help you with something?

295
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:09,374
- Um, how much for a piece of pie?
- $3.

296
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,151
That's all I got.

297
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,016
How about a cup of coffee?

298
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,759
I'll pay for the pie.

299
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,493
And a glass of milk?

300
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,900
Sure. Whatever you like.

301
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,785
What's your name?

302
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,790
Cherry.

303
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:58,919
What's your real name?

304
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,394
Jennifer.

305
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,697
Come on in.

306
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,941
Have a look around.

307
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,373
Where are your parents,
Jennifer?

308
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:24,084
Don't know. Don't care.

309
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:32,922
You have your own bathroom,
Jacuzzi tub.

310
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,986
There's plenty of fresh towels.

311
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,733
Clothing in the closet.

312
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,736
Should all fit you nicely.

313
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,977
So, help yourself.

314
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,575
Are you gonna fuck me?

315
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,083
I just want you to
feel comfortable,

316
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,689
nothing more.

317
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,990
You must be tired.
I'll let you get some rest.

318
00:33:07,014 --> 00:33:09,014
You can stay as long as you like.

319
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,930
Hey,

320
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,102
whose room is this?

321
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,143
Someone who was
very special to me.

322
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,860
I'm afraid our time together
has come to an end.

323
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,932
Start walking.

324
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,507
Go!

325
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,123
Keep moving.

326
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:52,920
Easy. Easy.
I got you. I got you.

327
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,597
I got you.

328
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,657
I got you.

329
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,100
It's about motherfucking time.

330
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,003
Let's get you home.

331
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:26,823
- What the fuck is this?
- If you have to ask, you already know.

332
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:46,543
For future reference,
we don't make deals.

333
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,047
Hey.

334
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,481
I was just wondering.

335
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:58,517
Do I look like the kind of
motherfucker who wouldn't know that?

336
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:44,196
Get the fuck up!

337
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,215
What do you want to do with him?

338
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,984
Yeah, Job.

339
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,887
What are you gonna do now?

340
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,583
Can we go now'?

341
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,976
Where are you going?

342
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,085
Stay the fuck away from me.

343
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:42,247
Hmm.

344
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,225
You ungrateful bitch.

345
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,928
I'm sorry. Please don't hurt me.

346
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,437
No.

347
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,909
I gave you freedom!

348
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,708
I gave you a place to stay!

349
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,350
I gave you everything.

350
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,777
But it was never enough, was it?

351
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,818
Man,
you got all the time in the world.

352
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:52,224
We got two on the gate.

353
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:04,502
C-block inmates,
prepare for yard detail.

354
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:08,270
Yard detail in 15 minutes
for all C-block inmates.

355
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:15,612
Smokes are being X-rayed...

356
00:41:15,636 --> 00:41:17,217
They'll be waiting for
you on the other side.

357
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,152
Thanks,
but what I really need is for...

358
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,087
you to pull your
head out of your ass.

359
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:22,951
I don't understand.

360
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:25,125
What the hell were you thinking
shooting porn in Banshee?

361
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,096
- You talked to Proctor.
- He's getting tired of your fuckups.

362
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,260
And so am I.

363
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,024
I saw an opportunity to earn...

364
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:34,335
You need to get your priorities straight,
boy.

365
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,463
Scrounging for chump change,
that's for niggers and spies.

366
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,167
Why the fuck are we still
answering to this asshole anyway?

367
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,610
We have an army 10
times bigger than his.

368
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,444
Because I say so.

369
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,611
There are some other
reasons I don't want to get into,

370
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:53,019
but for your purposes,
that's the only one you need.

371
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,522
Do you hear me?

372
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,027
I hear you.

373
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,462
No more fuckups.

374
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,328
No, sir.

375
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:12,072
Good. Now get the fuck out
of here before I miss lunch.

376
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:13,699
It's taco Tuesday.

377
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,829
Kai.

378
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:46,065
I'm sorry, Miriam.

379
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:50,005
I can't legally do anything to
make them release the body.

380
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,572
Legally?
Since when has legal ever stopped you?

381
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,906
I'll personally bring
Rebecca home to

382
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,680
you as soon as I possibly can,
I promise.

383
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,525
When Rebecca left us,
I prayed that she'd return.

384
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,393
But when you took her in,

385
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:12,367
I knew that God had
forsaken my prayers.

386
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,727
Her blood is on your hands, Kai.

387
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:22,108
And for that,
I will never forgive you.

388
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:34,614
You rescued me
from that hellhole

389
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:39,460
and the first place you
bring me back is here?

390
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:43,891
Baby, you heartless.

391
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,436
I think we could all
use another drink.

392
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:55,073
This is an 18-year-old
bottle of Glenlivet.

393
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,580
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

394
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:14,862
Come on, Job. Drink up.

395
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:26,472
I just need to get some rest.

396
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,939
Then I'm going to grab
my take from Genoa,

397
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:34,140
head back into the city,

398
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:37,846
maybe set myself
up with a penthouse.

399
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:41,813
What?

400
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,786
Somebody better
start talking now.

401
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,699
Buying them off wasn't cheap.

402
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,733
Leo got away with the bag.

403
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,533
How much?

404
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,839
All of it.

405
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,977
So, after all that time,
I got nothing.

406
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:10,384
You still got your place in the back,
Job.

407
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:14,820
No, he's not gonna stay in a back room.
You're gonna come stay with me.

408
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:19,218
I'm gonna take care of you.
The kids are away. It'll be quiet.

409
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,730
And what about Gordon?

410
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,257
I lost track.
Is he in or is he out?

411
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,068
Gordon didn't make it.

412
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,677
Thank you all,
for coming to get me.

413
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,255
Next time,
you can tell me why it took 20 months.

414
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:55,956
What the hell is this?

415
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,801
Lucas Hood.

416
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,970
You're under arrest for the
murder of Rebecca Bowman.

417
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:03,899
Brock, is this a joke?

418
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:07,932
Sir, I'm sorry,
but we have a warrant.

419
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,909
Brock, you know I didn't do it.

420
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,887
Yeah? Then maybe you want
to tell me how...

421
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:13,411
your blood ended
up inside of her car.

422
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,410
Nothing?

423
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,993
And I'm guessing you have no
idea how you knocked her up either.

424
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:20,912
What?

425
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,982
Yeah, Bunker, put the cuffs on this man.
Let's go.

426
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:31,294
Sir.

427
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,641
Okay, wait a minute. This is...

428
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,234
Hey. Cruz, stand down.

429
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:45,843
I said stand the fuck down.

430
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,512
Let's go. Get him in the car.

431
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:50,244
It's okay.

432
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:01,491
Sorry.

433
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:06,595
So, did I miss anything
while I was gone?
