1
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,889
What the fuck do you want?

2
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,405
You want to tell me how
you got those bruises?

3
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,245
Not really.

4
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,644
You afraid if you do,
you won't get your kids back?

5
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,231
I'm starting to
wonder if I should

6
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:24,245
be more afraid of
getting them back.

7
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,728
I don't deserve
to be their mother.

8
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,409
Maybe I don't deserve anything
more than exactly what I got.

9
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,201
I'm gonna give you a free pass.

10
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,726
Nothing you say now will affect
my custody recommendation.

11
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,846
You have my word.
This is off the record.

12
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,649
Why would you do that?

13
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,326
Because believe it or not,
I'm trying to help you...

14
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,930
And I can't without the truth.

15
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,604
I put her in danger again.

16
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,126
Who, Deva? She was home?

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,525
What happened?

18
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,090
They came for me.

19
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,162
Who came for you, Carrie?

20
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,362
You want the truth?

21
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,010
I'm a liar.

22
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,284
I lied to my family.
I lied to my husband.

23
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,443
Gordon, he never lied.

24
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,924
And his truth is the
only one I have left.

25
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,528
He dedicated his whole life

26
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,409
to fighting corruption
in this town.

27
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,244
And you feel you
have to see it through

28
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,651
because he died saving you.

29
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,722
- It's not so simple.
- Then help me.

30
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,006
Help me out with it.

31
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,565
Help me understand, Carrie.

32
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,367
What's the truth?

33
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,086
Carrie, help me...

34
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,004
That I never stopped
loving somebody else.

35
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,291
I know,
I have to stop this fighting.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,331
No.

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,764
You have to finish
what you started.

38
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,523
What kind of shrink are you?

39
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,409
This is not the shrink talking.

40
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,369
This is the father in me.

41
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,091
And I know that until
you make peace with this,

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,323
you can't be the parent
that your children need.

43
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,368
So go finish it.

44
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,925
Where's my drugs?

45
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,002
They took everything.

46
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,684
Who did?

47
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,842
I... I don't...

48
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,249
You let Calvin Bunker take my drugs?
Huh?

49
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,441
You let Bunker take my drugs?

50
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,522
Hey, it's Veronica.

51
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,762
You, uh,
disappeared on me this morning.

52
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,847
But anyway,
I tracked down our statutory rape victim.

53
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,843
She said all the right things,

54
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,002
but my bullshit
meter is ringing.

55
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,244
Anyway, I'm going back to the hotel,
so call me

56
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,522
and I can fill you in on the...

57
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,045
Okay,
hotel surveillance shows Dawson

58
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,686
leaving the property a
little before noon yesterday.

59
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,161
I've got every available
deputy out searching for her.

60
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,288
FBI is mobilizing a task force.

61
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,161
She won't live that long.

62
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,049
We have to find her now.

63
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,801
How?

64
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,171
Hood, I have been hunting for
this son of a bitch for months,

65
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,242
and all I got is dead ends.

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,684
What about the girl?

67
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,683
The one that burned herself.

68
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,285
Gail Westcott.

69
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,204
We searched her
apartment three times.

70
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,124
We can't find a single
connection to Bode.

71
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,485
I did request an expedited
subpoena for her cell phone records,

72
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,856
but that's still gonna
take a few days.

73
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,166
You still got the phone?

74
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,696
Well, yeah, I mean,
what's left of it.

75
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,131
Let's go.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,321
I've seen that look before.

77
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,811
I need your help.

78
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,002
Some things never change,
do they?

79
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,170
Just like old times.

80
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,685
You're the expert on old.

81
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,968
Wait a minute. I know you.

82
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,286
Excuse me?

83
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,601
You and I were in
a gunfight together

84
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,081
with the, uh,
the Ukrainian gangsters at the metalworks.

85
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,049
Correction, I was in a gunfight.

86
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,283
You were lying on the floor
crying about your motherfucking leg.

87
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,204
- What's in the bag?
- Cell phone.

88
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,606
I need the call history.

89
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,682
Last few days.

90
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,130
Look, I'm afraid there's
not much to work with there.

91
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,202
Maybe for your police techs.

92
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,207
This got something to
do with the Bowman girl?

93
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,327
Yeah.

94
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,321
Give me 15 minutes.
Sugar, where's my computer?

95
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,129
Exactly where you left it.

96
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,771
Well,
it ain't gonna fetch itself.

97
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,328
Fuck!

98
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,931
I'm in.

99
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,482
The heat scrambled most
of the internal memory,

100
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,001
but there was still
enough raw data

101
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:36,066
for me to recover the
ESN and hack the log.

102
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,161
I have no idea
what you're saying,

103
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,084
but I sure as hell
missed hearing you say it.

104
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,561
What time did that
girl set herself on fire?

105
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,121
7:00 AM.

106
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,328
She make any calls that morning?

107
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,920
Five in the two hours
before she grilled herself.

108
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,445
All to the same number.

109
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,010
Bode.

110
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,056
Give me the number.
I'll have my people do a trace.

111
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,447
I already traced it.
You best keep up, cop.

112
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,205
Belongs to a Kim Newton.
You know her?

113
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,203
No, but I'm guessing
she's connected to Bode.

114
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,520
Address.

115
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,206
Thanks.

116
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,127
Who the fuck let you in here?

117
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,040
I'm looking for Calvin.

118
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,691
You must also be looking
to get your ass kicked.

119
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,081
Mr. Bunker took something
that didn't belong to him.

120
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,488
My employer would like it back.

121
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,370
Yeah? Well, you can tell Proctor

122
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,602
to go fuck himself.

123
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,129
We're putting him
out of business.

124
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,326
Oh.

125
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,124
I see.

126
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,762
- Easy!
- You, you!

127
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,486
You're an FBI agent.

128
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,241
Yeah.

129
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,971
And you're a serial killer.

130
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,041
I don't kill them

131
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,686
because I like to, you know.

132
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,571
I know.

133
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,642
You kill them
because you're insane.

134
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,089
It's all relative, right?

135
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,571
Not really, no.

136
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,448
You think Satan speaks to you.

137
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,284
There is no Satan.

138
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,681
Ergo, you're insane.

139
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,681
You're not afraid of me,
are you?

140
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,445
Oh, don't take it personally.

141
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,842
I've just seen behind the
curtain one too many times.

142
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,409
The curtain?

143
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,927
Yeah, you know,
like The Wizard of Oz.

144
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,207
Turns out the big
powerful wizard

145
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,727
is just smoke and mirrors,

146
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,168
a delusional old fart
with a few magic tricks.

147
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,001
You know what I think?

148
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,401
What's that?

149
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,721
I think you've taken
down enough wizards

150
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,731
to wonder if maybe,
they know something that you don't.

151
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,608
That maybe there are truths

152
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,842
other than the ones
you tell yourself.

153
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,722
And those truths

154
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,371
have fucked you up so badly

155
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,326
that you don't even
know when to be afraid.

156
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,603
It bothers you I'm not afraid.

157
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,723
Makes you feel impotent,

158
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,040
less powerful.

159
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,727
You can't profile me.

160
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,167
I don't have to.

161
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,368
I already caught you.

162
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,282
I like you, Veronica.

163
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,170
But you're still gonna
cut my heart out.

164
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,765
Yes, I am.

165
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,481
See what I mean?

166
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,250
Fucking insane.

167
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,765
What's wrong?

168
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,646
I just got a call

169
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,564
about a handful of Calvin's
guys dead at the clubhouse.

170
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,723
- Do you think Calvin did it?
- No, they're his guys.

171
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,650
But I think the
Brotherhood's going to war.

172
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,689
And I don't want to
have to worry about you

173
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,171
while I'm dealing with Calvin.

174
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,406
You're not safe here at
Brook's house anymore.

175
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,167
I spoke to a friend
in Dade County.

176
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,605
He's a retired cop.

177
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,728
He's got a place
in Turnberry Isle.

178
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,084
You and Hank will be safe
there for the time being.

179
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,362
- It won't be for long.
- You don't get it.

180
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,530
No matter where we run,
as long as Calvin's breathing,

181
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,489
he's not gonna let me go.

182
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,685
Yeah, it's me.

183
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,411
I'm talking to your
fucking voicemail again.

184
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,925
This is your last chance,
Maggie.

185
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,836
Tell me where the fuck you are

186
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,005
or I swear to God
I will destroy...

187
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,645
Call me back.

188
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,727
Oh, shit.

189
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,370
You really think
I'll let this stand?

190
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,803
You stupid bitch.
This will not fucking stand.

191
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,848
I will fucking end you.

192
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,604
I will rip your
fucking lungs out

193
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,444
and I will strangle
you with them.

194
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,363
Calvin?

195
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,930
- Hello, Martin.
- What the hell are you doing?

196
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,643
Jesus Christ.

197
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,681
Stupid gook motherfucker!

198
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,322
Oh, my God.

199
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,927
Senator Mitchum,
thank you for seeing me.

200
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,288
I figure if it wasn't important,
you would have just called me.

201
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,806
So, what is it?

202
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,769
We had some complications.

203
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,648
We can't afford
any complications,

204
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,609
not with these people.

205
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,522
Or we both wake up
strangled by our own tongues.

206
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,285
I know that.
That's why I'm here.

207
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,209
You're having
production problems?

208
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,647
No, production is on schedule.

209
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,409
I'm having, uh,
personnel issues.

210
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,402
Sheriff's Department.

211
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,209
Hello.

212
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,849
Check around back?

213
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,929
It's open.

214
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,007
We having company?

215
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,411
Later.

216
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,804
I'm not really dressed for it.

217
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,848
I could use a drink
if you're pouring.

218
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,969
What would you like?

219
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,520
Whiskey, please.

220
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,435
You're really gonna make me

221
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:56,963
drink my last drink
through a straw?

222
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,362
We both know if I untie you,
you'll try to run.

223
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,835
Then I'll have to rough you up

224
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:03,489
again to get you
back on the table.

225
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,722
And what would
the neighbors think?

226
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,487
Nothing. I'll check upstairs.

227
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,443
Okay.

228
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,611
- So who's coming over?
- Just some friends.

229
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,202
You have a ritual.

230
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,769
Yeah.

231
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,245
Upstairs is clear.

232
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,606
She was here.

233
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,291
Oh, shit.

234
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,244
Well, she's not here now.

235
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,124
I wonder if this place
has a basement.

236
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,044
Satan didn't tell you to kill me.
I just showed up.

237
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,282
I can't let you live.

238
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,771
Maybe I could just join you

239
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,491
and worship with
you and your buddies.

240
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,685
- No.
- Why not?

241
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,513
Because Satan doesn't exist,
remember?

242
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:31,003
I'm pretty sure you said that.

243
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,803
Nothing more annoying
than a psychopath

244
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,809
who engages in Socratic debate.

245
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,608
Shh.

246
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,201
Now what?

247
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,125
You okay? What's wrong?

248
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,163
Hey.

249
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,729
You look beautiful.

250
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,242
Sorry, Kim. I'm not into girls.

251
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,851
My name is Lilith.

252
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,922
No, it's not.

253
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,123
You asked me how the sex was

254
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,089
when I met Declan.

255
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,762
It was transcendent.

256
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,287
Like he was occupying my soul.

257
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,204
- It was rape.
- No.

258
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,930
You were a child.

259
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,767
And he made me a woman.

260
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,882
- Hey, her car.
- What?

261
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,963
Her car is in there.

262
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,049
Give me a hand.

263
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,327
- This her car?
- Yeah.

264
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,246
There's blood here.

265
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,606
Shit.

266
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,121
Hey, Hood.

267
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,008
- What?
- Diprivan.

268
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,083
Brand name for Propofol.

269
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,128
Same shit that killed
Michael Jackson.

270
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,771
- What's it used for?
- General anesthesia.

271
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,320
So what the fuck is
it doing in a garage?

272
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,081
Brock?

273
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,203
Hey.

274
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,886
Killers, rapists,

275
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,088
drug dealers

276
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,606
all walking the
streets because of you.

277
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,728
No, it's Proctor. It's Proctor.

278
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,371
He threatened me.
I swear to God...

279
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,604
You are the goddamn
District Attorney.

280
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,850
He...

281
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,048
He threatened my family.

282
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,487
I have three kids. Please.

283
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,369
Please don't do this.

284
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,403
I want to know about everything
Proctor has his hands in.

285
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,769
I only know what he
wants me to know.

286
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,763
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

287
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,365
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

288
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,044
Wait.

289
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,250
Last week...
Last week he made my office

290
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,250
seize all the tower records
from the old municipal airport.

291
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,806
Why? Who's flying in?

292
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,881
Emilio Loera.

293
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,807
Loera?

294
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,089
He's a major player in
the Colombian cartel.

295
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,447
Proctor's selling to the cartel?

296
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,170
I don't know. I swear to God,

297
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,129
I'd tell you if I did.

298
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,891
- Go home.
- What?

299
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,247
You just quit.

300
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,006
Get your kids and get
the hell out of Banshee.

301
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,681
Hey, Hood.

302
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,967
The dizziness comes in waves.

303
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,608
They must have drugged us.

304
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,328
You got any give on your cuffs?

305
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,360
No.

306
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,444
Yeah, me neither.

307
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,443
What is this?

308
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,049
I don't know.
Some sort of basement.

309
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,890
Of course.

310
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,089
Did you get a look at him?

311
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,245
He came to visit
me the other night.

312
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,561
- Who did?
- Bode.

313
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,643
You saw him?

314
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,481
Why the fuck didn't
you say anything?

315
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,927
I don't know. Maybe I was, uh...

316
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,920
Spooked.

317
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,725
He knocked me out.

318
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,608
And when I came to,
he had a knife to my throat.

319
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,241
He could have
killed me right there,

320
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,328
but he didn't.

321
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,170
Said he wanted
me to bear witness.

322
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,686
- To what?
- I don't know.

323
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,126
But I'm guessing
we're about to find out.

324
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,523
So Dawson probably showed
up and got the same treatment.

325
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,568
She might still be here.

326
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,404
If she's not already dead.

327
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,410
Hey, I applaud your effort,
but, uh,

328
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,168
you're not gonna break out
of stainless steel cuffs, okay?

329
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,967
You don't break the cuffs.
You work the links.

330
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,642
If you're lucky,
there's a defect.

331
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,566
Why don't you try yours again?

332
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,642
All right.

333
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,481
Ah, fuck.

334
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,687
My right hand's a little loose.

335
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,367
If I can just get a
little more leverage.

336
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,522
They're solid. Stop it.

337
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,285
Hood. Hood. Stop!

338
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,526
Hey, hey, look at me.
Give it up, all right?

339
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,170
We're not getting out of here.

340
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,242
You know what sucks about this?

341
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,891
I mean,
besides the fact that we're gonna die.

342
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,527
I never got to be the
sheriff I wanted to be.

343
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,130
I waited so long for this.

344
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,129
I waited for one sheriff to die.

345
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,328
And then I had to
wait for you to burn out,

346
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,244
which you did in such a big way.

347
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,641
- No offense.
- None taken.

348
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,610
I mean, okay,
so I'm not the most charming guy.

349
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,125
I rub some people the wrong way

350
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,089
and, you know, I can't kiss ass.

351
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,891
It's just not in my nature,
you know?

352
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,440
But I've never been afraid
to stand up to anybody

353
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,364
who threatened the
well-being of my town.

354
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,570
I wanted to be that guy,
you know?

355
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,881
The guy that made
people feel safe.

356
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,242
And I haven't done that.

357
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,811
Hey.

358
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,768
Can I ask you something?

359
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,729
- Be the last time.
- What?

360
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,163
Who the fuck are you?

361
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,282
Really.

362
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,328
Who are you?

363
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,164
Look, I know you got a lot of secrets,
Hood.

364
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,736
I'd be an idiot not
to acknowledge that.

365
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,728
No, we're not gonna do
that condemned men

366
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,484
confess their sins shit,
all right?

367
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,056
Yeah,
I think that's exactly what we're gonna...

368
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,081
No, we're not.

369
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,049
Any minute now,
that door is gonna open

370
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,124
and something very bad
is gonna walk through it.

371
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,521
Now, don't you want to meet
this with a clean conscience?

372
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,489
- No, shut the fuck up.
- Come on, Hood, please.

373
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,927
Then just answer the
fucking question for me.

374
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,128
- I said drop it, Brock!
- No, I'm not gonna drop it!

375
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,925
I want to know! Why are you here?
Why did you become a cop?

376
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,650
I am not a cop!

377
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,927
I never was a fucking cop!

378
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,567
What are you...

379
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,961
- What does that mean?
- I'm not Lucas Hood!

380
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,446
I saw him die.

381
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,286
I picked up his wallet
and I became him.

382
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,560
That's not even possible.
I don't... What are you...

383
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,080
I'm a lie, Brock. I'm a fake.

384
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,169
I was a thief.

385
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,810
Not just a thief,

386
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,360
I'm a fucking
infiltration specialist.

387
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,848
Diamonds, gold, art,
anything, I could get it.

388
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,924
The places no one could get into,
I got in.

389
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,847
I had a good run,

390
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,241
but I got caught
and I did 15 years.

391
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,483
No, no. You're fucking with me.

392
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,767
Come on.

393
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,684
You're an ex-con? No.

394
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,001
- That's right.
- No.

395
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,449
Who else knows about it?

396
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,284
Siobhan know?

397
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,084
In the end, yeah.

398
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,447
Why would you do that? Why?

399
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,285
Why would you come to this
town and pretend to be a cop?

400
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,171
I don't know. I...

401
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,569
When I got out...

402
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,970
I had nothing.

403
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,451
Whoever I was before

404
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,284
was gone.

405
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,089
I was no one.

406
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,485
All I knew is
I needed to be close

407
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,886
to the one person who...

408
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,850
Who really knew me.

409
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,571
- Carrie Hopewell?
- Ana.

410
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,442
She was all I had.

411
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,882
So when I got out,

412
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,847
I tracked her down
and I came for her.

413
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,648
But she had Gordon
and the kids and a life.

414
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,449
That's right.

415
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,966
Oh, my God.

416
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,486
I became...

417
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,403
Sheriff.

418
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,731
But you're not. You weren't.

419
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,847
Well, I was getting up every day,
putting on the uniform.

420
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,266
Eventually, the lie took over.

421
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,842
I believed it.

422
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,082
I was the Sheriff.

423
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,091
I was a cop and I... I liked it.

424
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,762
I fucking loved it.

425
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,489
Somehow it just...

426
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,370
Somehow it just felt right.

427
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,046
There's nothing fucking
right about what you did.

428
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,327
It is the opposite of right.

429
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,448
You son of a bitch.

430
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,522
I believed you.

431
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,851
I trusted you. I followed you.

432
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,571
- I killed for you.
- No.

433
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,642
No, you killed for you.

434
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,605
Not me.
I just showed you the way.

435
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,208
A criminal.

436
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,648
That's rich.

437
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,485
I was deputy to a criminal.

438
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,608
Oh, God.

439
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,688
Oh, God.

440
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,369
Oh, God.

441
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,447
It all makes sense now.

442
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,090
All of it.

443
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,442
I'm so stupid.

444
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,043
If you're not Lucas Hood,

445
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,404
what's your name?

446
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,205
Sheriff Lotus.

447
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,807
It's good to see you again.

448
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,570
And you.

449
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,603
Dr. Quick tells me you're
friends with Agent Dawson.

450
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,802
That's right.

451
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,406
And if you've hurt
her in any way...

452
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,084
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

453
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,970
You fellas are in
for a treat tonight.

454
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,346
Yeah? You gonna con another

455
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,408
poor girl into burning
herself to a crisp?

456
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,409
Gail was a true believer.

457
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,768
No, she was a confused
and vulnerable young girl

458
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,684
who you manipulated
for your own sick pleasure.

459
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,362
It looks like you're going
to be my guests tonight.

460
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,569
Thing is, we have a dress code,

461
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,723
so Dr. Quick is going
to work his magic

462
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,125
and make you look a
little more like family.

463
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,962
You bust into my office.

464
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,169
You steal my camera.

465
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,602
I gotta say,

466
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,001
I was hoping we
would meet again.

467
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,928
Gather round, everybody.
It's almost time to begin.

468
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,049
We have an unexpected
offering tonight.

469
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,691
I think he will be pleased.

470
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,042
Don't worry, Sheriff.

471
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,527
This won't hurt a bit.

472
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,690
Well, maybe a little bit.

473
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,409
Here we go.

474
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,645
No, no.

475
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,563
Stay the fuck away from me.

476
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,967
Stay away.
Stay the fuck away from me.

477
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,568
Amen, evil from us deliver but

478
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,166
temptation into not us lead and

479
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,323
us against trespass
who those forgive we as

480
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,086
trespasses our us forgive and...

481
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,164
bread daily our day this us give

482
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,289
heaven in is it as earth on...

483
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,002
done be will thy
come kingdom thy

484
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,765
name thy be hallowed

485
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,208
heaven in art who Father our.

486
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,009
Hey, hey.
You don't have to do this.

487
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,928
But I really want to.

488
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,010
Hey.

489
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,091
You can't hurt me.
He won't allow it.

490
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,491
Oh, yeah?

491
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,722
Then he won't mind if I do this.

492
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,845
What's so funny?

493
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,206
You have no idea how
insignificant you really are.

494
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,962
That makes two of us, pal.

495
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,008
Declan!

496
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,803
Hood!

497
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,088
Is that the man
that killed my niece?

498
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,001
Yeah.

499
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,844
Thank you.

500
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,244
Thank you.

501
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,330
Don't bother.

502
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,005
Job.

503
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,130
You remembered.

504
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,486
I have money, Job.

505
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,449
Lots of it.

506
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,525
You have no idea.

507
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,841
$23.62 million.

508
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,924
Not counting the $5.2
million in Swiss francs

509
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,809
you have stashed
away in the Caymans.

510
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,611
Or rather I should say, you had.

511
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,851
What did you do with my money?

512
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,051
Oh, honey,
that ain't your money no more.

513
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,331
What do you want?

514
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,646
What do I want?

515
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,287
I want...

516
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,041
20 months of my
motherfucking life back.

517
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,562
It wasn't personal.

518
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,042
But you're right.

519
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,445
I fucked you.

520
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,725
We can put the past behind us.

521
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,008
Imagine what you
and I could do...

522
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,128
Twenty months!

523
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,281
Twenty months

524
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,569
of planning all the things

525
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,008
I was going to
do when I got out.

526
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,409
All the things I was going to do

527
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,609
to the motherfucker
who put me there.

528
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,166
But I have since seen the light.

529
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,166
Erasing your worthless ass

530
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,527
ain't gonna give me
back the time you took.

531
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,883
You're not going to kill me?

532
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,281
No.

533
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,442
I'm going to kill me.

534
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,090
You wanted to
fuck with the best.

535
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,367
Well, now you are the best.

536
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,126
Now you are Job.

537
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,364
From now on,
anytime anybody comes looking for me,

538
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,329
they're gonna find you.

539
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,009
Every security
system I ever cracked,

540
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,447
every organization
I ever compromised,

541
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,522
every dollar I ever stole,

542
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,331
they all got your
fingerprints on 'em now.

543
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,404
Mossad, People's Republic,

544
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,121
Uncle Sam, and a who's
who of unsavory terrorist types,

545
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,567
they all got serious
beef with you now.

546
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,486
Bitch,
I just made your punk ass famous.

547
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,770
And something tells me...

548
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,286
You gonna be a hell of a lot
easier to find than I ever was.

549
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,926
Have a nice short life,
motherfucker.

550
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,604
Job, wait.

551
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,001
You can't do this to me.

552
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,404
Job!
