1
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,721
Morning.

2
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,684
How are you today, Mr. Proctor?

3
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,046
That depends.

4
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,050
You brought me another head?

5
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,367
No.

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,240
Thinking I might leave with one,
though.

7
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,324
You killed my men.

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,171
You stole my drugs.

9
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,482
You know,
there's nothing more annoying

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
than an old guy thinking
he's still running things.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,889
Bunker, you little shit.

12
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,925
I believe you know our
mutual friend Senator Mitchum.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,480
Put that knife away before
I cut out your fucking eyes with it.

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,527
Mr. Mitchum,
what are you doing here, sir?

15
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,490
What am I doing here?

16
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,522
You murdered my fucking
lieutenant is what I'm doing here.

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,250
Sir, he was selling us out.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,251
He was acting on orders.

19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,610
You and Proctor?

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,686
Sir, I don't understand.

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,330
That's 'cause
you're a fucking idiot.

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,402
This little insurrection
stops here.

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,845
Do you hear me?

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,721
Do you hear me?

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,086
Yes, sir!

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,324
You have been
misled by this imbecile.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,209
The minute he
killed one of our own,

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,443
you should have
torn him to pieces.

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,931
But maybe it's time to remind
you that the Brotherhood

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,004
goes way beyond Banshee,
Pennsylvania.

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,366
You're part of a
national movement,

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,550
one that not only
shares your beliefs,

33
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:24,684
but is willing to do
something about it.

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,484
This is Monty.

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,641
He's gonna be running
things from now on.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,256
Make sure things go
smoothly from here on out.

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,281
You cannot come here...

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,724
Smartest thing for you to do
right now is shut the fuck up.

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,321
Do you hear me?

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,329
Your first and only priority
is Mr. Proctor's delivery.

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,408
Once that happens,
Monty will evaluate the chapter,

42
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,005
choose a new captain.

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,161
Any questions?

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,769
Okay, go on.

45
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,926
Get out of here.

46
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,282
Is he gonna be a problem?

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,486
You have my permission
to shoot him if he is.

48
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,200
I didn't think you'd come.

49
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,842
I wanted to make
sure I said good-bye.

50
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,800
Feels like that's pretty much what we do,
right?

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,968
Yeah,
it's kind of a bad habit, huh?

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,050
So, college.

53
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,246
Yeah.

54
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,488
I give it about three months.

55
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,003
With everything that's happened,

56
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,050
I just don't know how I can
possibly fit into someplace

57
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,922
as normal as college.

58
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,448
Ah, you're gonna do great.

59
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,605
I don't know.

60
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,125
I think normal might not
be in my repertoire anymore.

61
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,171
Hey,
you know what's great about being your age?

62
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,404
You got all the time in the
world to figure things out.

63
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,081
You do.

64
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,891
And you will.

65
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,331
You're strong, Deva.

66
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,051
You're a fighter.

67
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,571
Like your mother.

68
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,091
And your father.

69
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,686
You're gonna do great.

70
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,561
And now I'll always
know where to find you.

71
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,841
And will you? Find me?

72
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,720
Promise.

73
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,446
Good.

74
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,404
You might be a shitty father,
but you're the only one I got left.

75
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,251
So Declan believed that
the Devil spoke to him.

76
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,530
Satan did speak to him.

77
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,201
Okay. So you believed it, too.

78
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,131
Something that's true
doesn't require your belief.

79
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,044
Well,
I guess I can't argue with you there.

80
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,681
You need to understand
he didn't choose this.

81
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,208
He was chosen.

82
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,729
So how did he pick 'em?

83
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,885
He chose girls that
seemed to him to be pure.

84
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,842
He called them blessed.

85
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,801
Blessed girls.

86
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,804
Well, he did want to offer me

87
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,121
and I don't think he
thought I was blessed.

88
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,245
You were a surprise.

89
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,764
But I wasn't the only surprise,
was I?

90
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,409
What do you mean?

91
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,211
Well,
Declan was killing on a lunar cycle.

92
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,601
Not every month,
but always on a new moon.

93
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,200
- When the night is darkest.
- Right.

94
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,081
Except for...

95
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,726
Her.

96
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,046
She was killed on the 21st.

97
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,448
Not a new moon. Not a full moon.

98
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,409
Just an unremarkable night.

99
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,531
We had our reasons.

100
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,844
So you were in on it?

101
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,970
Of course I was.

102
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,090
We were in it together.

103
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,166
So, then, tell me,
why did you choose her?

104
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,129
Rebecca Bowman.

105
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,321
What was it about her
that made you and Declan

106
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,290
decide to break out
of the lunar cycle?

107
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,202
Was she a surprise, too?

108
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,129
I don't want to talk anymore.

109
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,051
- You did the final count?
- Yes.

110
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,646
- It's all there.
- Good.

111
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,121
Bring the truck to the designated
point and wait for my call.

112
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,247
We'll be ready.

113
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,409
Close the door.

114
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,605
We're set.

115
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,962
That is a lot of dead skinheads.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,446
Looks like a bomb
went off in here.

117
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,244
Any idea where your brother is?

118
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,401
No.

119
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,124
Still looking.

120
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,948
You get the feeling
there's something

121
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:15,360
going on that we
don't know about?

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,321
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

123
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,290
This is Bunker.

124
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,408
Proctor's deal of the
century is going down now.

125
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,287
This is a really bad time.

126
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,647
I'm sorry.
Should I try and stall the Colombian men

127
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,087
who just flew in
on a private jet?

128
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,366
Cartel?

129
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,647
That would be my
guess if I cared.

130
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,121
Jesus. Where are you?

131
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,163
I'm at the old
Municipal Airport.

132
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,651
All right, I'll meet you there.

133
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,210
Can I see that for a sec?

134
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,564
Mrs. Hopewell, I presume.

135
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,561
Brock?

136
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,361
Hey.

137
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,967
Hey.

138
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,402
How's the interrogation going?

139
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,761
It's going.

140
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,920
You okay?

141
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,644
Uh, yeah. I'm just kind of
rolling through it, you know?

142
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,367
You made pretty good backup,
by the way.

143
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,649
Guess I always thought
you were my backup.

144
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,001
Yeah, no.

145
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,803
Well,
I just came to say good-bye.

146
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,971
Hey.

147
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,291
Declan Bode didn't kill Rebecca.

148
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,806
What?

149
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,486
Bode was killing
on a lunar cycle.

150
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,551
Now, Rebecca's killing stood out

151
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,565
because it wasn't on a new moon.

152
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,608
Now, I pressed Lilith about it,

153
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,411
and she made a bunch of noise,
but behind it all,

154
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,608
I don't think she
knew anything about it.

155
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,282
Well,
maybe Bode didn't tell her.

156
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,250
No, it doesn't make sense that
Bode would break his routine.

157
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,440
So, what, you're saying
there's someone else out there

158
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,608
killing girls and then
cutting out their hearts?

159
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,456
I'm telling you
that someone killed

160
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,730
Rebecca and made it
look like it was Bode.

161
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,241
They'd have to know details
about the other murders, right?

162
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,606
Mmm-hmm.

163
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,722
They haven't been released.

164
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,725
Right, so we're looking for
someone who had access to BSD files

165
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,169
and who's capable of a sadistic,
ritualistic murder like that.

166
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,322
- Oh, fuck.
- Can you think of anyone?

167
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,323
Hey,
maybe you should let me do the talking.

168
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,526
Sure.

169
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,606
They're not home.

170
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,850
Let's take a look around.

171
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,166
- Mr. Proctor.
- Senor Loera.

172
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,006
Good to see you again.

173
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,525
I must admit,

174
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,410
I'm a little surprised that
you were able to pull this off.

175
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,010
I don't promise
what I can't deliver.

176
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,606
Bring it up.

177
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,171
Show me.

178
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,685
Hi.

179
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,286
As long as we all
whipping our shit out...

180
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,450
Emilio Loera, I take it?

181
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,444
Who the fuck are you?

182
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,566
I'm nobody.

183
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,291
You know my name,
so you know who I am.

184
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,407
Which means you know what
kind of a mistake it would be

185
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,084
to try to steal from me, right?

186
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,970
I wouldn't dream
of stealing from you.

187
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,247
No, I came here to provide
you with a valuable service.

188
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,686
Oh, yeah?

189
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,209
Which is what?

190
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,248
I came to show you that
Mr. Proctor was mistaken

191
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,721
when he told you that
Banshee was a safe place

192
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,326
for you to set up
your manufacturing.

193
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,047
Very mistaken.

194
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,246
I mean,
if he had it so locked down,

195
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,482
how did I steal this truck
full of all these drugs?

196
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,001
- I'm gonna fucking slit your throat.
- Stop.

197
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,130
I suppose you have some
fee in mind for this service.

198
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,524
No. Sometimes a service
is its own reward.

199
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,362
Just let my friend and
me walk away right now,

200
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,090
and we'll call it even.

201
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,046
Start walking.

202
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,096
You're not just gonna
let her walk out of here?

203
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,565
Shut up.

204
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,848
Hey, Miss Nobody.

205
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,287
Did you really think that
I was gonna let you leave?

206
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,607
No, actually, I didn't.

207
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,524
That's right.

208
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,329
Someone just blew
up your fucking drugs.

209
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,725
Nice shot.

210
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,281
Thanks.

211
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,367
You know,
you really need to stop doing this shit.

212
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,962
- You invited yourself.
- I'm serious.

213
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,845
It's become like a
bad habit with you.

214
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,844
This was the last time.

215
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,690
I've heard that shit before.

216
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,684
This is a very nice car.

217
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,809
Son of a bitch!

218
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,924
Oh, come on.
No one really knows how to do that.

219
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,607
It's just a matter of
applying the right torque

220
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,082
and then a little
bit of scrubbing.

221
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,202
Toolshed.

222
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,931
Look at you.

223
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,291
If there's one thing
I've learned lately,

224
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,206
it's that there's
always a basement.

225
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,450
Right over here.

226
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,129
We got blood.

227
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,244
Yeah.

228
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,729
What do you think?

229
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,727
I think nothing good
happens in basements.

230
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,045
Jesus.

231
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,042
You find anything
else over there?

232
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,326
No.

233
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,564
No, nothing.

234
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,208
All right, well,
I say we head up.

235
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,721
I can get Forensics down
here in a couple hours.

236
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,201
I want to find out
whose blood that is.

237
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,527
Sure.

238
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,651
You mind if I don't
stick around for that?

239
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,482
I got to check in on someone.

240
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,087
You got to check in on someone?

241
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,767
Yeah.

242
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,524
Hey, you want or need company?

243
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,570
Not this time.

244
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,690
The cartel will come after you.

245
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,171
I know.

246
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,448
And what then?

247
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,601
There'll be time to negotiate.

248
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,121
But before then...

249
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,806
You.

250
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,166
That looks broken.

251
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,090
What the hell are you doing?

252
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,248
Ahh! What the fuck? Hey!

253
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,363
That's Rebecca's necklace.

254
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,244
Yes, it is.

255
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,210
I don't understand.

256
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,169
Bode didn't kill Rebecca.

257
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,082
You? You killed her?

258
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,083
I found this in your shed.

259
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,051
- You think I killed her?
- That's right.

260
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,571
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

261
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,136
I loved her.
I would have died for her.

262
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,680
Maybe you loved
her a little too much.

263
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,056
- What?
- And when you found out she was pregnant,

264
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,776
you realized you
couldn't control her again,

265
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,016
so you took her down in that
weird little dungeon of yours

266
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,041
and you butchered her.

267
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,336
What the hell are you talking about,
"dungeon"?

268
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,856
- You killed her.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

269
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,087
You found out she was
pregnant and you killed her!

270
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,730
No! No, I didn't!

271
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,122
I didn't kill her.

272
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,761
Shit.

273
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,445
What the fuck?

274
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,250
You son of a bitch.

275
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,449
He'll kill you for this.

276
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,171
And will you? Find me?

277
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,481
Promise.

278
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,170
Everything I did...

279
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,166
I did for you.

280
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,531
Untie me!

281
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,048
Untie me, you son of a bitch!

282
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,407
You're ruining him.

283
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,482
I can't let that happen anymore.

284
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,006
He loves me.

285
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,969
You don't understand.

286
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,123
Don't do this.

287
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,082
He doesn't see you,

288
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,128
but I do.

289
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,885
- I see you.
- Burton, please.

290
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,124
I see you!

291
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,562
Please.

292
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,165
I'm sorry.

293
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,004
I'm... I'm sorry.

294
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,851
I'm sorry.

295
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,922
I'm sorry.

296
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,570
I'm sorry.

297
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,405
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

298
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,403
I'm sorry.

299
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,050
I'm... I'm...

300
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,888
It's okay.

301
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,247
- It's all right, Burton.
- I'm sorry.

302
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,810
It's all right.

303
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,686
Did you hear anything?

304
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,289
Nothing yet.

305
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,087
- Kurt.
- I know.

306
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,971
- Kurt!
- Oh, my God, Calvin.

307
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,606
Maggie, go inside.

308
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,561
So you and Maggie, huh?

309
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,644
I guess I should have
seen that coming.

310
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,529
She was always a
sucker for wounded birds.

311
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,364
Just walk away, Calvin.

312
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,683
No, I'm not going to walk away,
Kurt.

313
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,446
I can't.
I mean, a man can only take so much,

314
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,204
can only swallow so much shit

315
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,089
before the time comes to address it,
right?

316
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,367
I'm sorry.
I didn't expect this to happen.

317
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,456
You're sorry? You're sorry you
ever joined the Brotherhood?

318
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,776
You're sorry you
brought me into it?

319
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,609
You're sorry you fucked my wife?

320
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,886
You're just one sorry piece of shit,
aren't you?

321
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,769
I will shoot you.

322
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,687
Go ahead, Kurt.

323
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,324
Shoot me.

324
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,810
Then you get
Maggie free and clear.

325
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,360
You can move into my house,

326
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,091
raise my son.

327
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,400
Come on, Kurt.

328
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,416
Why build your own life
when you can just steal mine?

329
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,601
- Shut up.
- Shoot me.

330
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,489
- Shut up.
- Shoot me!

331
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,482
Please just walk away.

332
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,690
Do it. Go ahead.

333
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,121
Ahh!

334
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,086
Motherfucker.

335
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,210
Give me that fucking gun.

336
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,924
God damn it.

337
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,445
Oh, shit.

338
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,641
Maggie!

339
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,283
There's nowhere you can go,

340
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,600
either of you.

341
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,287
I will find you and
I will make you pay!

342
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,886
Even if you lock me up,
the Brotherhood will hunt you down.

343
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,206
You know it.

344
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,362
They will slit your
throat in front of her

345
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,920
and then tear her ass to pieces.

346
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,810
There's nowhere you can
go that we won't find you.

347
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,406
I will kill my own son

348
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,767
before I let you raise him.

349
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,730
I'm gonna kill you, you bitch.

350
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,564
As long as I'm alive, I will...

351
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,962
Well, I should have known better
than to let you go off like that.

352
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,526
How'd your Forensics team do?

353
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,728
They found some skin samples.

354
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,484
Probably gonna match Proctor's.

355
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,530
It turns out it
wasn't actually him.

356
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,608
It was Burton.

357
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,489
Burton?

358
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,528
Yeah.

359
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,489
Guy with the glasses.

360
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,007
His butler or whatever.

361
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,364
The butler did it?

362
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,169
Seriously?

363
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,483
Well, I should probably go
arrest this butler Burton, no?

364
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,562
Right.

365
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,165
Should have guessed.

366
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,121
Then I guess my
job here is done.

367
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,162
Yeah, me, too.

368
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,129
Me, too.

369
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,166
It's about time I moved on.

370
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,170
It's been time a couple of times,
actually.

371
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,930
Well, if you're ever in D.C...

372
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,125
Look me up.

373
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,043
I will.

374
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,969
- Morning.
- Oh, thank God.

375
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,168
Real coffee.

376
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,651
Yes.

377
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,564
- How's Maggie doing?
- She's okay.

378
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,016
They'll be out of
your place by tonight.

379
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,804
No rush.

380
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,007
Let me see if
I got this straight.

381
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,047
Calvin got the jump on you,
beat the shit out of you,

382
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,256
then somewhere along the way,
you remember you got a gun

383
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,805
and you shoot him
from 20 feet away.

384
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,689
Is that it?

385
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,081
- Yeah.
- Bullshit.

386
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,601
Sir, I'm not sure what
you're trying to imply, but...

387
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,523
No, I'm not implying anything.
I'm saying it.

388
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,028
You beat the shit
out of Calvin,

389
00:43:15,052 --> 00:43:16,480
and then you killed him
for good measure.

390
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,604
Hey, Bunker, relax.

391
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,728
It's just you and me talking here,
okay?

392
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,370
Come on, sit down.

393
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,126
I don't know what it is about this town,
Bunker.

394
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,249
What geographic phenomenon
makes us a magnet

395
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,005
for every scumbag and
criminal east of the Mississippi.

396
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,607
But what I do know
is that to do this job,

397
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,210
Sometimes, you've got to take

398
00:43:55,234 --> 00:43:56,923
off these badges and get bloody.

399
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,287
It's happened before,
and it'll happen again.

400
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,609
And I got to know
that I can trust you.

401
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,728
And you can trust me.
You understand?

402
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,687
Yes, sir.

403
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,330
Good.

404
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,404
A little trust would
be nice around here.

405
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,401
Kurt Bunker,
that's your real name, right?

406
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,763
Just...

407
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,330
So what about Proctor?

408
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,880
You can place him at
the scene of the drug deal.

409
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,281
Yeah, we could arrest Proctor.

410
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,794
But I got a feeling
that the cartel's

411
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:31,091
gonna want a few words with him

412
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,162
about their dead men,
and when they come,

413
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,460
I'd just as soon
he's as far away

414
00:44:34,484 --> 00:44:35,896
from the police
station as possible.

415
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,048
- If you take my meaning.
- That makes sense.

416
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,124
Time and experience, son.
Time and experience.

417
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,323
So, you go write up that
bullshit report so I can sign it.

418
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,129
Yes, sir.

419
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,120
Thank you, sir.

420
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,441
Thanks for the coffee.

421
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,369
Look at your face.

422
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,441
You just can't help yourself,
can you?

423
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,445
I gotta be me.

424
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,445
I know.

425
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,408
Max comes back tomorrow.

426
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,323
That's great.

427
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,129
Yes.

428
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,161
Job tells me you're
heading out to New York.

429
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,163
Yeah. Well, he is.

430
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,208
I'm gonna take the scenic route,

431
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,408
catch up with him.

432
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,083
Where are you headed?

433
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,365
I don't know. I'm gonna...

434
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,121
Hit the road and
see what happens.

435
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,924
You want to come?

436
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,285
Yeah.

437
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,724
You be careful.

438
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,289
Yeah.

439
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,249
I Will.

440
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,328
You know, the whole...

441
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,887
All those years in my cell,

442
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,485
you were always there with me.

443
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,050
I'm still there with you.

444
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,647
And I'll always be here.

445
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,525
No one else...

446
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,568
Nobody ever really knew me.

447
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,846
I know.

448
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,488
Please don't forget about me.

449
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,369
Never.

450
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,042
Never.

451
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,640
Good-bye, Ana.

452
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,570
It's Carrie.

453
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,048
This was a hard car to find.

454
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,600
Yeah, sorry.

455
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,336
I should have figured
that once I loaned it to you,

456
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,046
odds were that I wouldn't
be getting it back in one piece.

457
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,566
How you plan on
getting out of here?

458
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,165
Same way I came in.

459
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,728
It's gonna be mighty
quiet around here.

460
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,690
Don't even pretend like
you're gonna miss me.

461
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,967
I was talking to Hood.

462
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,646
You know,
I think I'm actually gonna miss this place.

463
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,810
I know I'm not.

464
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,363
Sugar,
it's been a thin slice of heaven.

465
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,090
I know you don't mean that.

466
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,650
It's true, I don't.

467
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,488
- You in a rush?
- Damn right.

468
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,496
Every time I try to get out
of this motherfucking place,

469
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,409
some shit goes down,
and I get stuck in it.

470
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,642
I'm getting while
the getting's good.

471
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,768
But before I do...

472
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,328
Figured I'd pay my tab.

473
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,362
Where the hell did you get this?

474
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,448
Now,
you know better than to ask.

475
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,605
Point is, you spent your
retirement fund getting me out.

476
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,365
Well, you're too old to be
slinging drinks, so...

477
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,565
Thank you.

478
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,124
You know how to reach me?

479
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,124
No one knows how to reach you.

480
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,771
- He does.
- Yeah, I do.

481
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,488
This is where I leave you.

482
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,567
Banshee, Pennsylvania.

483
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,129
Suck my tit.

484
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,205
What?

485
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:12,282
I was just remembering the
first time you walked in here.

486
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,091
I never could have imagined.

487
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,724
You know,
some might say you weren't all that bad

488
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,529
at that whole sheriff thing.

489
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,921
Yeah, and other people might say

490
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,890
I was the worst fucking thing
that ever happened to this town.

491
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,289
You got a place to stay?

492
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,886
Putting that badge
on the way you did,

493
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,850
I never thought you'd
be walking out of here

494
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,685
on your own two feet.

495
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,091
Neither did I.

496
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,765
You know,
I probably wouldn't if it wasn't for you.

497
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,887
You know you hid
up on that mountain

498
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,322
because you felt the need
to atone for something.

499
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,641
And for all we know,
you'd still be there

500
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,291
if Brock hadn't come
and pulled you down.

501
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,849
We are cons.

502
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,367
We're made to believe
that you pay for your sins

503
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,364
by getting locked up.

504
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,011
But maybe the way to redemption

505
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,560
isn't hiding on the mountain.

506
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,440
Maybe it's about
choosing another road

507
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,444
down here with the rest of us.

508
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,170
Maybe.

509
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,609
The past has kept you
locked up long enough.

510
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,153
Today, there's really only one

511
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,930
question left to ask yourself.

512
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,445
What are you going to do now?
