1
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,927
Everything was delicious,
sweetie.

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,806
Thanks, baby.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,286
So, how was work?

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,011
Slow and painful.

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,367
Same as always.

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,049
Except for when I got
promoted to shift supervisor.

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,121
I knew it.

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,368
We need to celebrate.

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,406
Do you have anything in mind?

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,682
As a matter of fact.

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,171
Go on, get things started.
I'll clean up in here.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,921
- You sure?
- Of course, baby.

13
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,724
She's a beauty, isn't she?

14
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,284
All right, one second.

15
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,604
Don't want to make a mess.

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,290
Please.

17
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,887
Please. Please.

18
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,970
Please, don't.

19
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,010
No!

20
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,605
No!

21
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,801
No!

22
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,684
Easy.

23
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,691
You're welcome
for saving your life.

24
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,001
Only after I saved yours.

25
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,050
What?

26
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,885
What are you doing here?

27
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,803
I'm trying to help you.

28
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,531
No, that's not what I mean.

29
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,528
What are you doing?

30
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,967
What I have to.

31
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,843
No. That's bullshit.

32
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,522
- You don't have to live like this.
- What am I supposed to do?

33
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,210
Hide away from
the world like you?

34
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,402
No, you don't do what I do.

35
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,764
You can leave.
There's a whole world out there.

36
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,882
The life that you're choosing,
it ends one way.

37
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,246
Maybe.

38
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,047
But at least it's my choice.

39
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,480
Jesus Christ.

40
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,601
I need you to leave.
I need you to go.

41
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,768
- No.
- Get out of...

42
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,323
Don't.

43
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,120
Did you know that Rebecca
Bowman was pregnant?

44
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,043
You've asked me that
three times already.

45
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,480
And I'm gonna keep
asking it till I'm satisfied.

46
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,726
Did you know?

47
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,042
No.

48
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,007
Tell me about your
relationship with Rebecca.

49
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,241
It wasn't a relationship.

50
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,163
Then what was it?

51
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,776
Like just friends with benefits,
or something, until you killed her?

52
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,690
- Fuck you, Brock.
- No, fuck you.

53
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,523
Look, I don't think you're
killing young girls.

54
00:07:00,547 --> 00:07:03,247
But I don't know that you're not.

55
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,609
The only thing I know is you've been
lying to me since you got to Banshee.

56
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,842
And the lies end here.

57
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,684
- When was the last time you saw her alive?
- I don't know. A while ago.

58
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,048
- I need you to be more specific than that.
- I don't keep a fucking diary.

59
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,800
Her car's GPS proves she was at
your cabin the night she was killed.

60
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,123
- Like I told you, I didn't see her.
- Really?

61
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,400
How do you know?
I mean, you don't keep a fucking diary.

62
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,129
I think you did
see her that night.

63
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,329
I think she told you
she was pregnant.

64
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,376
Knowing you, you probably
didn't take that news too well,

65
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,006
so, you argued.
Maybe it turned violent, physical.

66
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,048
No.

67
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,769
Why is your blood in her car?

68
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,569
I don't know.
Why don't you ask Proctor?

69
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,376
- I'm asking you.
- Well, I don't remember.

70
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,803
Well, do you remember cutting
the hearts out of these two girls?

71
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,130
Jesus Christ.
Come on, you know me, Brock.

72
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:01,044
No, see, I don't.
I don't know you.

73
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,521
The only thing I
know is that you went

74
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:04,176
off the deep end when
Siobhan was killed.

75
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,885
You snapped and maybe
you're reenacting her death

76
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,167
over and over and over
again like some psychotic...

77
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,402
Jesus,
open your fucking eyes, Brock!

78
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,543
This didn't happen
in the moment!

79
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,407
Whoever did this shit
took time to plan it!

80
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,449
Think!

81
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,681
What,
you think I got them pregnant as well?

82
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,841
Huh?

83
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,928
- You fucking know it wasn't me!
- I don't know anything!

84
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,480
Yeah, well,
that about sums it up.

85
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,368
Ted, Sheryl and Martin.
How y'all doing this morning?

86
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,488
Have a seat, Mr. Watts.

87
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,085
State your name for the record.

88
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,969
Randall Cody Watts.

89
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,010
Good morning, Mr. Watts.
I'm Commissioner Ted Smith.

90
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,560
I'm joined today by
Commissioner Sheryl Golden

91
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,125
and Commissioner Martin Davis.

92
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,884
Yeah, we've all met.

93
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,161
Today is your sixth appearance
before this board of parole.

94
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,413
If you say so, Teddy.
I've lost count.

95
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:09,609
Sheryl,
I see you finally had that baby.

96
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,325
I did.

97
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,926
I hope you and Mr. Golden
picked out a nice Anglo name.

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,056
Mr. Watts,
I suggest you take this hearing seriously.

99
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,136
What about the kike sitting next to you?
You think she's taking this seriously?

100
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,456
- Mr. Watts!
- Shut the fuck up, Martin.

101
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,320
- Mr. Watts.
- We all know the drill.

102
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,124
You're going to deny my parole,

103
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,204
then go home congratulating yourselves
on making the world a safer place.

104
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,205
But what you minimum wage
pencil dicks can't possibly understand,

105
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,886
is that however repulsive
you seem to think I am,

106
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,247
that the darkness
swallowing this country whole

107
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,160
and coming for you and
your half-breed families

108
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,248
is a million fucking
times worse.

109
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,450
- We're done here, Mr. Watts.
- Go fuck yourself, Ted.

110
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,530
Oh, and, Sheryl,

111
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,921
you be sure to give little Shoshanna
Golden a big kiss from her Aryan uncle

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,526
'cause you know I'm
gonna be thinking about her.

113
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,241
The pain is only psychological.

114
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,446
Sheriff's giving
you five minutes.

115
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,281
You finally got to visit me in jail,
huh?

116
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,090
Better late than never.

117
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,163
- I didn't do this.
- I know.

118
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,923
Do you have any idea who did?

119
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,405
Not yet.

120
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,908
I don't know if you'll make bail,

121
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:54,632
but I can use my house
as collateral if you do.

122
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,324
Thanks.

123
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,164
How's Job?

124
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,003
They did a real number on him.

125
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,366
He'll be okay.

126
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,005
How about you?

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
I really need to get
the fuck out of here.

128
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,203
Hello, Ted.

129
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,681
- How is he?
- Innocent and Brock knows it.

130
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,209
Well, the evidence says otherwise
and the sheriff has to follow up.

131
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,725
You got something for me?

132
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,090
I did. It can wait.

133
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,130
No, I need the distraction.

134
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,245
It's the details of a drug
processing and distribution facility.

135
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,731
Proctor's?

136
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,041
Mmm-hmm.

137
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,730
Thank you, Bunker.

138
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,121
Be careful, Mrs. Hopewell.

139
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,924
You just made bail.

140
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,570
I didn't kill her.

141
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,286
Maybe you did, maybe you didn't.
Either way.

142
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,528
What the hell is this?
Get away from there! Proctor!

143
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:37,552
What the hell are you doing?

144
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,009
I posted the prisoner's bail.

145
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,527
- Bail? This is bullshit.
- Hood is coming with me.

146
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,409
- The hell he is.
- Let him in.

147
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,760
- No.
- Get out of my way, Brock!

148
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,689
- Not gonna happen.
- I'm the fucking mayor!

149
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,162
- And I'm the fucking sheriff!
- Get out of the fucking way.

150
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,767
You give me those keys,
or I will shoot you.

151
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,641
Wow.

152
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,481
Everybody is so angry.

153
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,370
- Ma'am, you cannot be back here.
- Why not? Everybody else is.

154
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,284
- Bunker, take this woman up front, please.
- Stay put, Bunker.

155
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,761
Special Agent Veronica Dawson.

156
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,842
Violent Crimes.

157
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,048
Yeah, that always seems to
suck the air right out of the room.

158
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,567
I take it you're Sheriff Lotus.

159
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,604
- And you are?
- Kai Proctor.

160
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,002
Mr. Proctor,
I am truly sorry for your loss.

161
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,771
Let's go, Proctor.

162
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,616
- I got this.
- Get your fucking hands off me!

163
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,000
I got this, Sheriff.

164
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,527
Mr. Proctor, I can only imagine

165
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,410
how frustrated you must be with
how things have been handled.

166
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,528
But this is my
investigation now.

167
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,646
And while I've got a little
bit of lost time to make up for,

168
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,048
I can assure you I'm a quick study
and I plan to get to the bottom of things.

169
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,084
Do me a favor,
give me some time to sort things through,

170
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,125
and as soon as I do,
you'll be the first to know.

171
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,647
You have 24 hours.

172
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,884
Then what happens?

173
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,244
What a fun group.

174
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,931
Shh.

175
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,730
Do you think she's pretty?

176
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,087
I think he'll be happy.

177
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,404
Lucas Hood.

178
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,528
Onetime sheriff.

179
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,841
Part-time mountain man.

180
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,402
And now the primary
suspect in three homicides.

181
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,289
It's a hell of a résumé.

182
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,731
Sheriff Lotus told me
you don't talk much.

183
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,207
Well,
maybe I just don't talk to him much.

184
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,407
He also told me
about Deputy Kelly.

185
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,963
You two were a couple
at the time of her death?

186
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,841
God, losing a deputy and
a lover in one fell swoop.

187
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,241
That must have been tough.

188
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,689
I've been there.

189
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,044
My husband Paul.

190
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,081
He was leading a
tactical operation.

191
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,528
Some low-level terrorist we could
lean on to get us some bigger fish.

192
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,005
By the book, breach and arrest.

193
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,764
He had the perp
facedown and zip-tied

194
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,090
when in walks the guy's 13-year-old
nephew holding a GLOCK 9.

195
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,185
Paul could have dropped
him in a heartbeat.

196
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:26,209
I mean,
who can't outshoot a kid, right?

197
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,247
But instead,
he tried to talk him down.

198
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,084
I guess that kid
didn't feel like talking.

199
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,563
He shot Paul in the neck.
Killed him instantly.

200
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,929
You've been doing this a while.

201
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,442
Long enough.

202
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,046
Long enough to know
that the fake husband story

203
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,441
is not gonna work
on someone like me.

204
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,447
So, either you think I'm an idiot,
or you wanted me to call you on it.

205
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,604
What, so,
that I would feel like I'm in control?

206
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,361
Seeing as we both
know that's not true,

207
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,962
why don't you cut the bullshit
and ask me what you want to ask?

208
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,483
Okay.

209
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,167
Did you kill Rebecca Bowman?

210
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,886
No.

211
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,849
Well, that was easy.

212
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,088
I so appreciate your cooperation,
Mr. Hood.

213
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
You're welcome.

214
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,085
I'm sure we'll meet again.

215
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,563
I'm guessing you don't have a
lot of pals down at the Bureau.

216
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,928
- You know a lot about the FBI, do you?
- No, not really.

217
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,488
But I know a little
something about burnouts.

218
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,528
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

219
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,964
- He didn't do it.
- Really? You decided that in five minutes?

220
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,884
No, I decided that in about two.

221
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,851
- The evidence...
- The evidence is shit and you know it.

222
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,365
The evidence isn't shit.

223
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,888
It's circumstantial.

224
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,131
I'll cut him loose.

225
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,806
- Not yet.
- Why?

226
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,121
Because the minute
we release him,

227
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,646
Hood's gonna try to find
Bowman's killer on his own.

228
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,564
And I'd like a little
bit of a head start.

229
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,407
For the record, I also knew that
your husband story was bullshit.

230
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,481
Hmm.

231
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,810
Did you know that Proctor was in
the drug business with your old crew?

232
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,289
What are you talking about?

233
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,487
There are neo-Nazis
crawling all over his warehouse.

234
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,241
- How do you know that?
- I'm looking at them right now.

235
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,840
Kurt, did you know?

236
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,611
If I knew,
I would have said something to you.

237
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,927
Look, we need to take a
step back and figure things out.

238
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:47,851
This changes things.

239
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,930
- Not for me, it doesn't.
- Carrie...

240
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,365
Carr...

241
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,690
Why didn't you tell me?

242
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,049
I wanted the new
facility to be a surprise.

243
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,764
When will it be operational?

244
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,571
The end of this week,
maybe a little sooner.

245
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,804
We can run double shifts,
triple the output in the first month.

246
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,689
I'll hire a new
foreman to oversee...

247
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,084
Rebecca, the Brotherhood
will be managing this operation.

248
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,889
What?

249
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,291
- Yeah.
- Why?

250
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,285
They can provide the distance
and the insulation I require as mayor.

251
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,523
This should be mine.

252
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:01,046
No, I know.
But you have to trust me on this.

253
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,282
I have something much
bigger planned for you.

254
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,362
Yes, your big plan.

255
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,965
Meanwhile, nothing is happening

256
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,849
and you're handing over
our business to Nazis?

257
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,009
I know that's how it looks to you,
but I promise this is what's best for us.

258
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,605
No, this is what's best for you.

259
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,886
And that's all you've
ever really cared about.

260
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,046
I wish you'd stop
treating me like a child.

261
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,049
I will when you
stop acting like one.

262
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,136
When you were my age,
you were already running things.

263
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,176
- There was no one holding you back.
- There was no one protecting me either.

264
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,726
- I don't need your protection.
- Yes, you do!

265
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,321
This is a dangerous business.

266
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,244
I'm fucking dangerous!

267
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,330
You have no idea
how dangerous I am.

268
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,488
Oh. Grandma means well, honey.
I think she's just worried about you.

269
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,080
You're just gonna have
to give her a chance.

270
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,285
Well,
could you at least pretend for Max?

271
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,930
'Cause I need you to set a good example,
that's why.

272
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,129
Honey, hold on.

273
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,925
Job?

274
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,720
Deva,
I'm gonna call you right back.

275
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,646
- Fuck, Job!
- Fuck!

276
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,846
I almost shot you.

277
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,006
- Imagine my fucking relief.
- You shouldn't even be out of bed.

278
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,443
And you shouldn't be storing
your AKs next to your Ann Taylor.

279
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,322
- How'd you get in there?
- It's a motherfucking tumbler.

280
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,490
You have enough firepower
in here to start a war.

281
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,324
Not start one.

282
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,641
Just finish it.

283
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,250
Amen.
Evil from us deliver but...

284
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,163
Us against trespass.

285
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,970
Who those forgive we as...

286
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,606
Heaven in is it as Earth on...

287
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,001
Name Thy be hallowed.

288
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,889
Heaven in art Who,

289
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,210
Father our...

290
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,210
Hot date?

291
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,322
- You should really get some sleep.
- That would require me closing my eyes.

292
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,447
It's gonna take time, Job.

293
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,442
Fuck this. I'm coming with you.

294
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,765
That's a bad idea.

295
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:16,605
No, it's the worst
motherfucking idea ever.

296
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,211
You're not coming.

297
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,170
Not you or nobody get to
tell me what to do anymore.

298
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,376
You are not leaving me in
this motherfucking house alone.

299
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,289
Just don't...

300
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,809
Don't leave me.

301
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,490
You're staying in the car.

302
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,768
You're gonna need
someone to watch your back.

303
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,320
- You're gonna need somebody...
- I'm serious.

304
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,169
Fine.

305
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,207
Got your message. What happened?

306
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,482
- Have a drink.
- Come on, man.

307
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,040
I dropped everything 'cause I
thought you were in trouble here.

308
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,481
Shit,
I need to get back to Proctor's...

309
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,444
Fuck Proctor.

310
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,963
Now, sit down,
and show me some goddamn respect.

311
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,010
No, no, don't be a fucking pussy.
Okay?

312
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,003
There you go.

313
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,205
Drink.

314
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,407
You all right, man?

315
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,210
Watts should have never
made a deal with Proctor.

316
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,326
He's so busy chasing
his own retirement plan,

317
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,323
that he's abandoned

318
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,086
everything that we've been
fighting for all these years.

319
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,807
Hmm.

320
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,164
He may be blinded
by Proctor's money,

321
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,208
but I'm not.

322
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,082
And I'm not gonna keep
my mouth shut anymore.

323
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,447
Calvin, you're drunk, buddy.

324
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,484
- Whatever you're thinking...
- No. No.

325
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,161
I'm done thinking, Joe.

326
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,130
I'm done being Watts' bitch.

327
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,600
It's time for me to
man the fuck up.

328
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,647
Watts has to fucking go.

329
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,530
We've been at this for months,
Job.

330
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,250
You must be getting tired.

331
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,641
Let's change the mood, shall we?

332
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,571
Job.

333
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,843
Job. Job.

334
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,564
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

335
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,290
How about you?

336
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,728
I'm fine.

337
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,643
Yeah, you look fucking fine.

338
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,330
Not now.

339
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,847
Just in case I do have
to drive home alone,

340
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,404
you want to tell me
what this is really about?

341
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,366
Why are you doing this?

342
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,841
Hmm?

343
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,124
Do you think all this
Catwoman bullshit

344
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,523
is what he would have wanted?

345
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,284
Stay in the car.

346
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,524
- Hey, what did he say?
- He said you're gonna die.

347
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,765
Oh, what the hell is this?

348
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,891
Hey, this is private property.

349
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,962
Who the fuck are you?

350
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,723
I asked you a question.

351
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,643
Are you deaf, you stupid bitch?

352
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,605
No, I hear you loud and clear,

353
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,686
bitch.

354
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,890
Shit!

355
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,365
Come on back, bitch. Come on.

356
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,600
Come on.

357
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,930
Bitch. Bitch, move. Move!

358
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,451
Run!

359
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,080
So, how'd that go?

360
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,441
Like clockwork.

361
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,927
Unlock gate 13.

362
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,603
See you again real soon there,
convict.

363
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,445
And you fuck your mama, Larry.

364
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,127
You my ride?

365
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,249
Nice car.
Them Krauts always done it best.

366
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,890
We headed to Banshee?

367
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,456
Mr. Proctor would like to see
you at your earliest convenience.

368
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,240
Well, then what the hell
are we waiting for?

369
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,481
- Fuck.
- FBI, skeezy fuckers.

370
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,644
Put the pipe down.
What are you doing?

371
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,561
Get the fuck out of here. Go.

372
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,087
Dawson.

373
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,606
On my way.

374
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,447
({CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

375
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,603
Raven,
this is Agent Dawson from the FBI.

376
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,886
Yeah, what do we got?

377
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,849
Coroner estimated she was killed

378
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,925
Nine or 10 hours ago based
on body temp and lividity.

379
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,526
- MO is the same?
- Yeah.

380
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,841
Attractive female, 18 to 24.

381
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,082
Son of a bitch cut her heart out,
too.

382
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,610
Cut isn't surgical,
but it is precise.

383
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,001
He's in a safe place
when he does this.

384
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,605
Takes his time.

385
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,726
Defensive wounds?

386
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,725
Ligature marks,
just like the other victims.

387
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,521
She was tied up.
Some kind of rope, heavy braiding.

388
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,090
Enough to bruise like this?

389
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,845
She was bound for a while.
He doesn't kill them right away.

390
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,921
No signs of sexual abuse.

391
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,282
No,
he doesn't see them sexually.

392
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,726
Right here. He drugged her.

393
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,361
Just like the others.
Butchered her alive.

394
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,889
Got an ID?

395
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,564
No, nothing yet.

396
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,564
What'd the witness say?

397
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,296
Caught a glimpse of
someone dragging the body

398
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,243
into the woods
just after 5:00 a.m.

399
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,244
And why the hell did they
wait four hours to call it in?

400
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,051
Because his mommy
thought he was making it up.

401
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,763
What's the kid's name?

402
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,091
- Tocho.
- Tocho.

403
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,407
Let's cover her up.

404
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,536
Make sure the coroner gets all those notes,
yeah?

405
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,686
Are you Tocho?

406
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,569
Is that you?

407
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,849
Can you tell me what you saw?

408
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,121
Huh?

409
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,644
Was it a man or a woman, huh?

410
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,850
- Young or old?
- Come on, that's enough.

411
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,964
No more questions, huh?
Come on, Tocho.

412
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,973
Okay,
I'm gonna finish cutting this

413
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:59,131
for you and you're
gonna eat all of it.

414
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,931
- And then treats.
- Okay.

415
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,162
But the vegetables, too.

416
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,810
- Okay?
- Okay.

417
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,405
- Promise?
- Yeah.

418
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,245
How are the potatoes?

419
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,891
Dry.

420
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,448
I'm sorry.
I must have overcooked them.

421
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,850
Stay here.

422
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,531
- What the fuck?
- It's nice to see you, too, Calvin.

423
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,286
And, yes,
I'd love to come inside.

424
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,481
Do I smell Magpie's cooking?

425
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,850
- How did you get out?
- It's a hell of a story.

426
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,890
Maybe I'll tell it
to you sometime.

427
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,570
Daddy.

428
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,248
- You're out?
- Good news, baby.

429
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,448
I've been rehabilitated.

430
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,085
And who might you be?

431
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,963
Uh...
Hank, this is your grandfather.

432
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,964
You just call me Papa,
sweetheart.

433
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,363
Uh, okay,
we're gonna go up and take a bath now.

434
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,325
You know what?
Fuck a man's heart.

435
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,046
You want love,
go right to his stomach.

436
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,124
Congratulations.
You're not a serial killer.

437
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,168
I'll need you to fill
out some paperwork.

438
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,526
Need a ride?

439
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,890
You don't seem like
the type to hold a grudge.

440
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,491
You kept me locked up.

441
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,087
I just got here.
Had to get my bearings.

442
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,362
I'm glad I could help.

443
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,330
You knew I was innocent.

444
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,689
I think innocent might be
a bit of a stretch, don't you?

445
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,604
Yeah, fuck you.

446
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,321
Hey, you're welcome for that alibi,
by the way.

447
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,687
Look, Hood, I know where you live.
It's a long walk to that cabin of yours.

448
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,690
I need a drink.

449
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,565
You definitely need a drink.
