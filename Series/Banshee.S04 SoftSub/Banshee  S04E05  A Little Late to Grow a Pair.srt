1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,121
So, where's your place?

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,405
About a mile through the woods.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,051
This is rustic.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,684
Some backyard you got here.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,169
Yeah, I like the quiet.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,169
Ugh. I fucking hate it.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,362
What,
too many voices in your head?

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,530
You have no idea.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,401
You should talk to
someone about that.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,127
Oh, why the hell do you
think I gave you a ride?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,321
Well, you're just so honest.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,082
I'm honest. You're silent.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,365
We both got our things.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,522
So, um, what's your real damage?

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,241
I mean, you're obviously
punishing yourself for something.

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,408
Hey, we've all got shit we
wish we hadn't done, right?

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,482
And what shit do you
wish you hadn't done?

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,646
Oh, we definitely haven't
drank enough for all that.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,326
So is this the part where you tell me
to just forgive myself and move on?

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,721
Well, I don't know what you did.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,321
Maybe it's not forgivable.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,763
Did you forgive yourself?

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,761
No.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,362
But I don't punish
myself either.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,288
I mean, I figure the world's gonna do
that to me one way or another anyway.

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,206
You want to talk about
Rebecca Bowman?

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,691
- I'm not judging...
- Don't.

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,127
- Sooner or later...
- I said don't.

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,969
What do you want?

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,120
I'm just trying to figure out if I'm
gonna keep running into you on this.

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,885
And we both know I can't
stop you from poking around,

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,490
but it would make my life easier if
you could just keep me in the loop.

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,050
Of course.

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,646
Thanks for the ride.

35
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,681
Don't be a stranger.

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,327
Listen,
I've had a really bad few days.

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,765
I thought we had a deal.

38
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,171
Rebecca was off-limits to you.

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,569
You knew I was living here?

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,370
I thought you were
keeping her safe.

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,530
That wasn't my responsibility.

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,931
Fucking her was?

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,121
I should kill you right now.

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,485
Well, get the fuck on with it.

45
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,324
You find whoever
did this to her.

46
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,531
FBI has it covered.

47
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,803
FBI is gonna arrest him,
most likely kill him.

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,848
You bring him to me.

49
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,007
And you'll need to find
another place to live.

50
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,040
Let's go.

51
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,616
Ms. Bowman,
I really think we should wait...

52
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,165
Take out the goddamn box.

53
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,845
Felix...

54
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,161
Where's my money?

55
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,011
- Ms. Bowman...
- Where the fuck is my money?

56
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,082
Your uncle.

57
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,925
He came and took it.

58
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,321
What?

59
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,006
That's my box. You can't just...

60
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,121
There are rules.

61
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,282
Rebecca, put that gun away.

62
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,321
Put that gun away.

63
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,360
It's okay, Felix.

64
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,040
- Just give us two minutes.
- Yes.

65
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,642
Have you lost your mind?

66
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,961
You took my money?

67
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,335
Skimming cash from my strip club,

68
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,531
and locking it in a box
doesn't make it yours.

69
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,842
You may not have
paid me that money,

70
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,450
but I earned it.

71
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,363
Every fucking penny.

72
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,080
If you want to point that at me,
you had better be ready to shoot it.

73
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,565
Shoot it!

74
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,526
We'll talk about this later.

75
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,288
Watts, come on, man.
This is bullshit.

76
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,408
You shut the fuck up
and do as you're told.

77
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,363
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

78
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,886
Reminds me of how
blessed I am to be a free man.

79
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,736
You said you had something
you wanted to show me.

80
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,841
That I do.

81
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,320
Right this way, gentlemen.

82
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,405
My son-in-law's epic fuckup

83
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,086
may have given you the unfortunate
and grossly inaccurate idea

84
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,164
that the Brotherhood might not be
able to deliver the muscle you need.

85
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,048
But I'm here now,
and I wanted to show you firsthand,

86
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,565
I'll be running a
much tighter ship.

87
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,920
Pony Joe here was in charge
the night your factory got torched.

88
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,090
- Watts...
- Do it.

89
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,926
Now.

90
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,971
Come on.

91
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,325
You know it wasn't my fault!

92
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,011
Hey!

93
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,484
Calvin!

94
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,650
Hey, don't you do this.

95
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,402
Don't do this!

96
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,483
Come on!

97
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,646
Calvin! Calvin!

98
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,083
Don't do this! Calvin!

99
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,244
Let's go, Calvin.

100
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,569
- Hit it, boy!
- Don't do this.

101
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,044
I will have zero
tolerance for fuckups.

102
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,296
- What about the production delays?
- Already started outfitting...

103
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,005
I need three tons in eight days.

104
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,327
That kind of volume
usually means beaners.

105
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,611
Attract a lot of unfriendly attention
on both sides of the borders.

106
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,166
You got one hell of a pair of balls on you,
I'll give you that.

107
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,323
Banshee will become the distribution
hub for the entire East Coast pipeline.

108
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,320
As long as I can count on you,
the Brotherhood will be well compensated.

109
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,283
Employed is fine and good,

110
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,128
but you're talking
about the cartels now.

111
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,401
And for that kind of risk,

112
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,562
I don't want to be compensated.

113
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,721
I want a piece.

114
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,365
Mr. Watts,

115
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,243
you make this delivery on time,

116
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,251
I'm sure you and I will come to
an agreement about your piece.

117
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,610
Glad to hear it.

118
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,926
You hear that, bow tie?

119
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,920
You and me is gonna be buddies.

120
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,165
Well...

121
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,931
That went better than expected.

122
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,481
We just killed one of our
own for that fucking Dutchie.

123
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,364
Yeah, well, it was him or you.

124
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,522
Don't think I
didn't consider it.

125
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,844
Go clean this shit up.

126
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,130
Congratulations, Job.

127
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,488
Twenty-eight hours.

128
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,761
That's a new record.

129
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,324
Now, your over-under with
the guards wasn't too good,

130
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,970
but I never doubted you.

131
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,809
Why?

132
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,087
Why ain't you
just killed me yet?

133
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,170
I could do that.

134
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,246
I could.

135
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,366
But honestly,

136
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,640
I'd miss these little
sessions of ours.

137
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,044
I'll see you tomorrow.

138
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,040
That's one way to get down.

139
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,201
Well played, Job.

140
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,887
Hey.

141
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,002
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

142
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,406
More nightmares?

143
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,723
- If you ever want to talk about it...
- No.

144
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,245
Okay.

145
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,084
You can still make
yourself useful.

146
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,125
What the fuck is this?

147
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,929
That is a list of your
chores for the day.

148
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,051
No free lunches.

149
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,168
This is bullshit.
I'm convalescing.

150
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,123
I'm going into town,
I'll see you later.

151
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,809
I do not do windows!

152
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,682
So they let you out.

153
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,165
Yeah, you sound surprised.

154
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,121
No.

155
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,442
Nothing surprises me
anymore when it comes to you.

156
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,490
But for what it's worth,

157
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,804
I was pretty sure
you didn't kill the girl.

158
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,805
Thanks very much.

159
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,851
I mean, come on.

160
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,484
How well do you ever know a man?

161
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,201
How's Job?

162
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,284
Why don't you pay him a
visit and find out for yourself?

163
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,245
I will.

164
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,610
You smell like an ashtray.

165
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,410
Yeah, I had a fire.

166
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,441
Proctor.

167
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,570
Yeah, he was pretty angry
about your relations with his niece.

168
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,410
That still doesn't
make me a murderer.

169
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,891
Doesn't make him one either,

170
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,168
in this particular case.

171
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,536
You mind if I go next door,
take a shower?

172
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,562
No. You have to use mine.

173
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,891
Your place belongs
to the termites.

174
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,570
Exterminators say we
got to burn the place down

175
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,324
else they'll be over here.

176
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,685
That's probably for the best,
huh?

177
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,725
You got a place to stay?

178
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,325
You should go.

179
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,730
This is a bad idea.

180
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,649
You think we are who we are?

181
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,169
Or you think we can change?

182
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,200
What, you mean people like you?

183
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,560
Tell me about your father.

184
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,166
Seriously?

185
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,841
I know it's a cliché,

186
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,247
but I think in this case we can
both agree your father was influential.

187
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,925
What's there to tell?

188
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,970
My father was a monster
that got what he deserved.

189
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,122
Do you really believe that?

190
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,607
I had a dream about
him the other night.

191
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,569
We were at Coney
Island at the Boardwalk.

192
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,148
He used to take me
there every Sunday

193
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,920
in the summertime
when I was a little girl.

194
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,249
After the rides,
we would have popcorn and saltwater taffy.

195
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,194
And we would sit on
the same bench and

196
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:03,444
he would tell me
stories about my mother.

197
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,569
Then we'd take our shoes
off and put our feet in the surf.

198
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,800
And what happened in the dream?

199
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,241
Nothing.

200
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,522
I mean, I don't know.

201
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,365
We were just there.

202
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,925
You miss him.

203
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,208
How fucked up is that?

204
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,410
Well, look who got out of jail,

205
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,321
again.

206
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,243
So how you doing?

207
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,811
You look better.

208
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,369
Yeah, I'm a real fashion plate.

209
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,924
How about you?

210
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,084
What about me?

211
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,208
I hear you went native
while I was away.

212
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,726
Yeah.
That's one way of putting it.

213
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,005
You got another way?

214
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,527
Listen, Job,
I tried to find you.

215
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,845
We all did.

216
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,407
After Dalton was dead...

217
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,970
You mean after you killed him.

218
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,649
I thought you were dead.

219
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,643
I believed it.

220
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,001
And then something, uh...

221
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,884
Something inside me,
it just, uh...

222
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,250
I gave up.

223
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,046
And I'm sorry.

224
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
Well, it could have been worse.

225
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,322
Could have been 15 years.

226
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,243
You never put that shit on me.

227
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,568
- Rabbit fucked us.
- Yes, he did.

228
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,164
On my watch.

229
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,161
Baby, all our bullshit...

230
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,010
That's all in the past.

231
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,331
You and me,

232
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,090
we ain't ever getting
that time back.

233
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,725
So...

234
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,351
What you really
need to worry about is

235
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,206
what's happening
in the here and now.

236
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,164
What do you mean?

237
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,647
Our little friend is building a fortress,
and she is armed to the teeth.

238
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,926
For what?

239
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,324
Seems she feels the only
way to honor her dead husband

240
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,406
is to finish his war
on Proctor herself.

241
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,271
Mr. Watts has made
provisions to keep all

242
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:20,126
five facilities running
around the clock.

243
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,656
I'll need you to keep
an eye on things.

244
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,761
I don't trust him.

245
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,648
If I don't deliver on my
promise to the Colombians,

246
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,480
Watts is gonna be the
least of our problems.

247
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,682
Stop the car. Stop the car.

248
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,207
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor?
Mr. Mayor, is it true that your office

249
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,328
is withholding Rebecca
Bowman's body?

250
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,841
- Do you have any comment...
- Sir, what do you expect...

251
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,336
What the hell are you doing,
Miriam?

252
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,840
We want her back, Kai.
You can't keep her like this.

253
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,088
- I'm not keeping her.
- You can fix it.

254
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,964
Rebecca wasn't the
only girl who was killed.

255
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,247
She's the only one
we need to bury.

256
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,324
It's not right keeping her body like this.
It's disrespectful.

257
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,840
I'm gonna give you two minutes
to get these men out of here.

258
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,644
We will not leave
without Rebecca.

259
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,486
You lost all right to Rebecca
when you shunned her!

260
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,131
If you don't leave right now,

261
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,441
I'm gonna have you dragged away,
and put into jail.

262
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,711
We are not scared of you anymore,
Kai.

263
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:15,725
There's nothing
else you can do to us.

264
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,725
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

265
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,606
- Mr. Mayor?
- Mr. Mayor?

266
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,120
- Mayor Proctor...
- Mayor Proctor...

267
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,211
Go home!

268
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,887
All of you!

269
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,447
Get out, now...

270
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,246
Or you will all go to jail!

271
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,601
Go away!

272
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,920
Sir, sir.

273
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,560
We should go inside.

274
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,896
I want these steps cleared right now.
You understand?

275
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,922
- They have a permit.
- I don't give a shit.

276
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,481
Hey.

277
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,687
- Jesus Christ, Hood.
- Afternoon, Sheriff.

278
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,160
You have any idea how
many laws you just broke?

279
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,721
You gonna arrest me again?

280
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,136
If you came looking for an apology,
you're not gonna get one.

281
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,003
No,
I would have done the same thing.

282
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,081
You would have shot me.

283
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,771
Yeah, maybe.

284
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,806
- What do you want?
- Heard there was another girl.

285
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,282
Yeah,
20-year-old college student.

286
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,645
Any leads?

287
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,250
Other than a six-year-old witness
who can barely speak English, no.

288
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,525
Nothing.

289
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,680
You're not gonna stay out of this,
are you?

290
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,370
You know, I got to ask,

291
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,280
you really didn't know
she was pregnant?

292
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,326
No.

293
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,004
Must have been quite a shock.

294
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,410
I'm sorry, Hood.

295
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,842
- Ms. Francis?
- Yes.

296
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,889
I'm Sheriff Brock
Lotus from the BSD.

297
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,689
We spoke after
your sister was found.

298
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,404
Yeah, I remember.

299
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,484
I already answered all your questions.
The FBI, too.

300
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,767
No, I know. I...
We appreciate it.

301
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,840
These are, um,
Jill's personal belongings.

302
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,602
I just wanted to
return them to you.

303
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,641
Look, I can only imagine
how hard this must be for you.

304
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,964
This guy killed three women,
and he was still out there free

305
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,610
walking around to kill Jill?

306
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,047
I mean, you're the Sheriff.

307
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,804
It was your job to protect her.

308
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,605
I know.

309
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,406
Howdy, Kurt.

310
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,442
- You're out.
- They let me go.

311
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,089
And it got me thinking.

312
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,849
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

313
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,007
Come back to the family, Kurt.
We need you.

314
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,086
Now more than ever.

315
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,570
Calvin, he talks a big game,

316
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,086
but he ain't made of the
same steel you and I are.

317
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,562
You want me to
rejoin the Brotherhood?

318
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,110
With your knowledge
of BSD procedure,

319
00:28:02,134 --> 00:28:04,204
you'd be more
valuable than before.

320
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,890
Come on.

321
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,450
What do you say?

322
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,241
Randall...

323
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,562
I don't know how you got out.

324
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,804
But you made a mistake
coming back here.

325
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,287
How's that?

326
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,204
Because now that I
know that you're out,

327
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,807
I'm gonna dedicate myself
to putting you back in.

328
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,291
Yeah.

329
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,049
I didn't expect you
to bite right away.

330
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,604
I mean, hell,
you got to be you, right?

331
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,602
Well, look,
tonight I'm gonna party.

332
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,803
Celebrate my emancipation.

333
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,604
Tomorrow I'm gonna get to work.

334
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,383
If you haven't accepted
my offer by then,

335
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:55,321
you're gonna be the
first order of business.

336
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,526
Sheriff's office.

337
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,170
I know, I'm sorry...

338
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,049
Helen,
call everybody and tell them...

339
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:34,841
I'm holding a press
conference in one hour.

340
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,440
- What are you gonna do?
- What I should have done a while ago.

341
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,650
What is the meaning of this?

342
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,331
You won't be selling your
produce in Banshee anymore.

343
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,526
You won't be selling
your produce anywhere.

344
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,401
Oh...

345
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,286
Kai!

346
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,289
Why, Kai?! Why?!

347
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,808
These are sad and dangerous
times for the town of Banshee.

348
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,490
Four young women have been
brutally and senselessly murdered

349
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,129
by a twisted coward

350
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,851
who preys on those smaller
and weaker than himself.

351
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,801
You Tocho?

352
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,408
Can I draw, too?

353
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,081
My entire department
along with the FBI

354
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,984
have been working
around the clock

355
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:47,165
to identify and
apprehend this killer.

356
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,490
But obviously we haven't yet.

357
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,683
And for that,
I take full responsibility.

358
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,840
You know,
I used to be a policeman.

359
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,569
And even though I
don't do it anymore,

360
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,089
sometimes I still help them
chase the bad guys away.

361
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,649
I would like to make a pledge,
a promise, that I will not stop

362
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,768
until Jill Francis, Meredith Coble,
Amanda Crowley

363
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,650
and Rebecca Bowman receive the
justice they so desperately deserve.

364
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,284
Is that the man you saw the other night,
in the woods?

365
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,689
See these things
you drew on his head?

366
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,645
Was he wearing a hat?

367
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,601
Are they horns?

368
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,730
And now,
I would like to talk directly to you,

369
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,886
you sad, pathetic coward.

370
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,088
I don't know what you have
convinced yourself that you are,

371
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,569
but you will never be anything
more than a sad little freak.

372
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,888
I am gonna find you. I am.

373
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,696
And I'm gonna take you down,

374
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,564
and I'm gonna make sure that you
never hurt anyone else ever again.

375
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,886
- You drinking?
- Whiskey, rocks.

376
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,080
I've heard good
things about this place.

377
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,849
But where's the real action?

378
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,160
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

379
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,844
I think you do.

380
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,769
Go home, little girl.

381
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,251
Not until I find
what I'm looking for.

382
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,890
Thank you for the tip.

383
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,485
That's just nasty.

384
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,046
What the fuck?

385
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,082
You shouldn't be here.

386
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,323
Yeah?
Well, bad choices are sort of my thing.

387
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,364
But you must know
something about that.

388
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,965
I don't know who you are,

389
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,490
but the rules here
are very simple.

390
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,011
No one walks out the
same way they walk in.

391
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,968
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that.

392
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,362
See, I'm pretty kinky,
but you guys, you're fucked up.

393
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,521
No!

394
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,521
You come here, too?

395
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,884
- How'd you know I was here?
- I didn't.

396
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,849
The Kinaho kid drew this.

397
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,171
This is the only place in town
where the freaks have horns.

398
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,050
How'd you get here?

399
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,930
Our murders are consistent
with other ritualistic murders

400
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,923
in the FBI database.

401
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,571
Pointed to Satanism.

402
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,929
Hey, shitneck,
where'd you get your work done?

403
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,890
Where did you get
your work done?

404
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,007
Get fucked.

405
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,725
Wrong answer.

406
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,281
Okay! Okay!

407
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,844
Guy named Quick. Dr. Quick.

408
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,203
- He's a surgeon?
- Yeah. No, he used to be.

409
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,770
Where do we find him?

410
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,724
Works out of the back of a
dry cleaner over on Swanson.

411
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,449
You kids need to
find a new hobby.

412
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,205
It's you.

413
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,846
Hey, Gail.

414
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,841
You seem nervous.

415
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,362
No, I just...

416
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,609
I just didn't expect
you to be here.

417
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,891
I'm sorry.

418
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,441
I didn't mean to startle you.

419
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,202
I've been watching you, Gail.

420
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,524
You're quiet,

421
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,042
less flashy than some
of the other acolytes.

422
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,726
But your commitment
is very pure.

423
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,049
I find that exciting.

424
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,883
Thank you.

425
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,644
We're a lot alike, Gail.

426
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,562
You're a true believer,
aren't you?

427
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,606
I am. I am.

428
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,291
That's good,
because I have chosen you

429
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,285
for a very special honor.

430
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,723
Will you serve him with me?

431
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,287
I will. I will.

432
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,328
Thanks. Thank you.

433
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,441
Is there a problem, Deputy?

434
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,450
Just answering
your prowler call.

435
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,563
We didn't call no police.

436
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,484
- Must have been your neighbors.
- Must have been.

437
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,360
'Course,
we ain't got none of those.

438
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,366
No. No, you don't.

439
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,406
Why'd you leave your car all
the way at the end of the road?

440
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,970
It's a long walk
to this here gate.

441
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,730
Do you live here?

442
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,645
Just visiting.

443
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,164
It's a lot of
surveillance equipment.

444
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,404
Well, you know what they say,

445
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,484
just 'cause you're paranoid don't
mean they ain't all out to get you.

446
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,931
Words to live by.

447
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,081
Mmm-hmm.

448
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,171
Have a safe night.

449
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,885
I'll do my best.

450
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,807
I just want to say a
few things real quick.

451
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,121
I gotta thank you all
for this celebration.

452
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,605
It's great to see all of you.

453
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,244
Now,
I look around and I see, man,

454
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,891
a lot of changes since I went in.
A lot of changes.

455
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,962
But after eight years in a cage,

456
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,040
there's one thing that
hasn't changed at all.

457
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,570
That's my commitment
to all of you.

458
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,606
Yeah!

459
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,927
Like it or not,
you degenerates are my family.

460
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,051
- Family sticks together.
- Yeah!

461
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,770
No matter what.

462
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,805
And on a personal note,

463
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,241
I've done my time.

464
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,041
Paid my dues.

465
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,809
And I'm tired of living in the
gutter in the name of the cause.

466
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,283
We sacrifice a
lot for our beliefs.

467
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,285
But we's also allowed to
enjoy some of the spoils of war.

468
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,050
Yeah!

469
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,881
So I have laid plans.

470
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,244
Plans that will put some of
those spoils into our own pockets.

471
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,251
And with that money
comes security.

472
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,729
And with that, power.

473
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,723
- Tonight we drink.
- Yeah!

474
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,367
- Tonight we fuck.
- Yeah!

475
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,965
And tomorrow,

476
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,962
the new Aryan revolution begins.

477
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,121
Yeah!

478
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,481
What the fuck was that?

479
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,125
That was a new beginning,
Calvin.

480
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,764
Money?
That's your fucking pitch?

481
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,496
Money? Since when has the
Brotherhood been about money?

482
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,841
Grow the fuck up, Calvin.
I take care of my own.

483
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,161
Ideas don't pay the rent.
We can't all put on ties

484
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,163
and suck dick for some
shit ass conglomerate.

485
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,004
You're selling out
the Brotherhood.

486
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,096
Everything that we worked for,
everything you went to fucking jail for.

487
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,361
I went to jail for my brothers,
for my family, for you...

488
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,091
You ungrateful shit.
And I come out and I see you shitting...

489
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,731
all over the deals I made,
looking at me like I'm in your fucking way.

490
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,202
Now, Maggie,
she married the wrong brother.

491
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,411
Kurt might be confused,
but at least he got balls.

492
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,842
Okay.

493
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,201
Okay.

494
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,720
Let's fucking party!

495
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,884
Bunker. Really?

496
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,406
What are you doing?

497
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,288
You know you have a
GPS tracker on your cruiser.

498
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,880
What the hell are you doing?

499
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,930
Brock, leave me alone.
That's Randall Watts, the top dog.

500
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,124
He just got out of jail.
One shot in his head and this is over...

501
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,136
One shot and you're gonna have
the entire Brotherhood up here.

502
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,561
Get up. God damn it, Bunker.
Be smart.

503
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,644
We've gotta be
smarter than them.

504
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,326
We cannot beat them at their game.
We gotta beat them at ours.

505
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,691
You're in uniform
using one of our vehicles.

506
00:44:28,715 --> 00:44:30,400
What the hell are you thinking?

507
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,808
- I'm sorry.
- No, fuck sorry.

508
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,211
This town's going off the rails.

509
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,011
We got a serial killer on the prowl,
we got a mayor who's a gangster,

510
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,003
and you want to start a
war with the neo-Nazis.

511
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,081
Look at me.

512
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,565
I don't have much in my life
that I care about anymore, Bunker.

513
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,444
Just Banshee. That's it.

514
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,456
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
give up this town without a fight.

515
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,687
Now you gotta decide right now

516
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,161
whether you want to
fight with me the right way

517
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,440
or you're just gonna be
another headache I gotta handle.

518
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,805
Okay.

519
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,081
- Okay?
- Okay?

520
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,765
Let's get the hell out of here.

521
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,970
That was a...

522
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,242
Good speech.

523
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,761
Ugh.

524
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,321
Damn.

525
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,604
I took a couple
shots back there.

526
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,285
But you gave some, too.

527
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,769
Hey, don't worry.

528
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,490
I already checked under the bed.

529
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,489
You should get some rest.

530
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,725
I should.

531
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,767
But I can't drink all
this scotch by myself.

532
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,842
Yeah,
I think we both know that's not true.

533
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,520
Try and tell me you
don't need a drink

534
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,604
after that madness we
just witnessed back there.

535
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,489
Yeah, you have a point.

536
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,201
Jeez.

537
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,569
So,
we gonna track down that surgeon?

538
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,088
Well, I'm not a cop anymore.

539
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,806
Even when I was,

540
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,603
I wasn't much of a team player.

541
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,886
Yeah, me neither.

542
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,450
But we're both out there
looking for the same guy.

543
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,040
Might as well have
each other's backs.

544
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,009
I know you can go it alone.

545
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,609
Me, too.
That's why they sent me.

546
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,170
But this guy is

547
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,569
a different kind of bad news.

548
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,609
And this is your town.
You know the lay of the land.

549
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,364
And I could really
use the backup.

550
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,241
Okay.

551
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,446
Maggie.

552
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,046
Oh, I've been trying to reach you.
They let my dad out.

553
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,682
I know.
He came to see me earlier.

554
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,121
You've gotta do something, okay?
You can't wait any longer.

555
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,406
I'm working on it, Maggie,

556
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,801
but this is a lot bigger than
just your father and Calvin.

557
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,160
You're talking about the drugs.

558
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,645
How do you know about that?

559
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,730
I found these on Calvin's desk.

560
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,882
Jesus Christ, Maggie,
if he caught you...

561
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,122
I'm just trying to give you
what you need, okay?

562
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,089
This is some kind of
a production schedule.

563
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,720
There's some big delivery coming up,
I think.

564
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,850
This was on Calvin's desk?

565
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,090
Yeah, why?

566
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,811
These are very large quantities.

567
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,246
This isn't just
local drug dealing.

568
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,845
This is...

569
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,560
These numbers...

570
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,561
I swear to you,
this is almost over.

571
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,766
But I need you to go home and
pretend like everything's okay.

572
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,128
Kurt, I can't do this much longer,
okay?

573
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,690
I'm scared all the time.

574
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,804
I know.
I will get you out of there.

575
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,690
I promise.

576
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,644
So, did you make me one?

577
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,522
I want you out of here.

578
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,962
This is my house and
you are not welcome.

579
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,086
That's cute, Calvin,

580
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,768
but it's a little
late to grow a pair.

581
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,724
How about you just shut the
fuck up and pour me a drink?

582
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,808
Fuck it. I'll do it myself.
