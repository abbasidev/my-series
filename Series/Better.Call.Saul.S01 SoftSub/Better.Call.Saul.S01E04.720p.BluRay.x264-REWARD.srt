1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:04,212
Works every...
I'm telling you, every time.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,297
- Do it, try it.
- No. What, right now?

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,341
- Right here.
- All right, all right.

4
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,053
Kind of. Kind of that.
Gotta work on it, bro.

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,638
- All right, man.
- Seriously.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:17,934
All right, bro, I'll work on it.
But just tell me, when do you...?

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,853
Right before the cork pops.
Timing's important, but...

8
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,022
But you don't do it, like, in her ear?

9
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,984
No, you don't do it in her ear.
It's a given you don't do it in her ear.

10
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,612
- This is, like, scientifically proven.
- Really?

11
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:32,365
- Prehistoric stuff. It's like the medulla.
- Crazy.

12
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,700
- The wolf brain.
- What?

13
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:36,828
- It's primitive stuff.
- Okay, let me try it again.

14
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,664
Yeah!

15
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,458
- Yeah? That's the wolf brain!
- Nice.

16
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,754
Man, this town sucks.

17
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,591
Sorry, bro, I know it's yours
and everything, but it's not even 2.

18
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,344
Yeah, it does kind of suck.

19
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:58,057
Hey, I know this after-hours place over...
A couple blocks off Cermak.

20
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:02,019
- You wanna hit it? Fucking hit it.
- Hells, yeah. Let's do it.

21
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,899
That's what I'm talking about.

22
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,281
Okay.

23
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,453
- Not in her ear, right?
- Right, not in her ear.

24
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,080
Hey, bro, I never did catch your name.

25
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,000
- Saul.
- Saul?

26
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,294
"S'all good, man."

27
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,922
- Get it?
- I do. All right, Saul.

28
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,425
Hey, hey, brother, whoa.

29
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,136
Check it out. What is that?

30
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,307
Holy shit.

31
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,185
There's gotta be at least
a thousand bucks in here.

32
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,353
Oh, my God, look at that.

33
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,355
- Whose is it?
- Mine.

34
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:50,943
Hey, possession's like four-tenths
of the what-do-you-call-it, bro.

35
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,529
- Like, is there an ID or...?
- Yeah.

36
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,909
I don't know, some fat guy.

37
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,125
I'm thinking that one.

38
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,797
Let's see.

39
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,727
Jesus.

40
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,229
Is he...?

41
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,105
- What?
- Is he...?

42
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,899
I don't know.

43
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,544
Hey. Hey, fella. You all right?

44
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,427
Hey, buddy.

45
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,012
Hey, would you answer me?

46
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,598
Hey, answer this, you butthole.

47
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,644
- "Butthole"? What the hell?
- Hey.

48
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,354
Hey, bro, be nice, all right?

49
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,065
This guy right here,
he's trying to help you.

50
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,318
Help yourself to some of this,
you butthole.

51
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,279
- Hey.
- Hey, we're not buttholes.

52
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,406
- All right? So stop saying that.
- Yeah.

53
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,659
Butt, butt, butthole

54
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,370
Hey, man, what's your problem?

55
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,040
My problem is I'm standing here
talking to a couple buttholes.

56
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,167
You're not standing, you fat bastard.

57
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,086
You're laying on your fat ass.

58
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,965
Hey, I'll roundhouse-kick you
right in your heads. You think I won't?

59
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,342
I'll come into the McDonald's
where you work...

60
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,846
...I'll buy the whole damn place
and I'll fire you.

61
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,559
I'll say, "Drop your mops,
you buttholes, because you're fired."

62
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:52,273
And then I'll roundhouse-kick you
right in your stupid heads.

63
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:58,070
And then I'll go
Jean-Claude Van Damme on you, you...

64
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,616
Butthole.

65
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,162
I'm keeping the money.

66
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,039
Here you go, fatty.

67
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,125
I got dibs on that watch, man.

68
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,545
I didn't see that.

69
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,800
What kind is it?

70
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,096
I don't know, it's just a watch.

71
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,890
We gotta get out of here, man.

72
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,767
What kind of watch is it?

73
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:32,563
- It's... I don't know, it's...
- Well, then let me look at it.

74
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,817
- It's a damn Rolex.
- I don't know.

75
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,362
Not cool to be greedy, bro. Not cool.

76
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,281
I didn't know what...

77
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,410
So how do you wanna split this up?
Tell you what. You keep the cash.

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,788
- I'll just keep the watch.
- It's worth 3 grand.

79
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,539
- What?
- Three thousand, easy.

80
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,833
- No.
- Yeah.

81
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,127
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, now.

82
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,712
Let's figure this out.
Gotta get out of here.

83
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,923
All right, you're right. You know what?

84
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,300
I will sweeten the pot.

85
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,096
You got 5, 20, 40, 60, 80...
Five hundred and eighty bucks.

86
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,640
Add that to the thousand,
it's more than half.

87
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,935
What do you know about that thing?
Is it worth more than 3?

88
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,312
No, I don't know, but we're good, right?

89
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,481
Yeah, we good? Okay?

90
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,191
Well...

91
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,654
Later, sucker!

92
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,258
Six left.

93
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,719
- Can we get more?
- God, I hope so.

94
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,514
It's like a license to print money.
Thing of beauty.

95
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,059
Hey, what was that crazy stuff
about roundhouse kicks?

96
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,228
- Where did you get that?
- I don't know.

97
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,231
Just something in my brain, you know?
It just came out.

98
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,567
- Too much?
- No, I loved it.

99
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:04,196
It was, like, deep or something.

100
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,408
Wanna talk about brilliant, I mean...

101
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,660
You're the man. Me, I'm just...

102
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,413
I love watching you work.

103
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,711
It's good for making beer money.
That's about all.

104
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,655
Please, no one has to know.

105
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,116
You could just pretend
you didn't find us.

106
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,577
We would never tell anyone,
would we, Craig?

107
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:52,995
- No, absolutely not.
- No.

108
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,331
I already called your lawyer.

109
00:06:55,624 --> 00:07:00,544
Besides, this little family outing of yours
has put an innocent man in jail.

110
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,005
Cops are investigating this
as a kidnapping.

111
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,675
They already rounded up
some poor suspect.

112
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,095
A working-class guy.

113
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,222
A father, I think.

114
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,142
But anyway, you two,
you almost ruined someone's life.

115
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,353
Potentially several someones.

116
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,813
We had no idea.

117
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,857
Could this have been
the person in the van?

118
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,986
What if the man they arrested
is the one we were warned about?

119
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,781
Yeah, maybe he's not so innocent.

120
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,741
Warned? Warned how?

121
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,411
We had a phone call.
Someone disguising their voice.

122
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,205
They said someone was coming for us.

123
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,374
And there was a van outside the house...

124
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,210
...as if whoever was inside
was watching us.

125
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,798
And once that drove off,
we did what we did.

126
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,216
- For the kids.
- The kids.

127
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,803
I wouldn't know about
any of that, I just...

128
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,140
I can assure you that
you and your family are safe.

129
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,476
- The police are all over this thing, so...
- It doesn't matter.

130
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,020
We can't just go back.

131
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,857
Our case. They'll crucify Craig.

132
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:08,320
Can't you just call Ms. Wexler again?
Tell her you didn't see us after all.

133
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,324
If they think I ran away,
it'll look like I did something wrong.

134
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,535
Yeah,
and we can't risk losing everything...

135
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,662
...just because of some teensy mistake.

136
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,205
Can I ask you something?

137
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,499
What were you hoping would happen?

138
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,586
I mean, before I found you,
what were you planning to do?

139
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,338
Well, we were in the process
of, you know...

140
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:30,092
- ...working that out, when you...
- We were working that out, yeah.

141
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,972
All right, well, you've still got
a little bit of manoeuverability, all right?

142
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,225
You're outdoorsy, right? So you
went on an impromptu camping trip.

143
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,729
I don't know, it's something
people do, apparently.

144
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:46,275
You left the house a mess
and you kicked in your own front door...

145
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,527
...because it's a free country.

146
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,113
Kim Wexler is very good.
She'll make it work.

147
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,240
What about the money?

148
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:00,164
If she knows about it, she'll tell.
Right? I mean, she'll have to tell.

149
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:05,044
Well, like they say in Silicon Valley,
"It's not a bug, it's a feature."

150
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,630
You ever hear of a bargaining chip?

151
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,175
What we have right here
is the mother of all bargaining chips.

152
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,594
As in...

153
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,804
...you expect us to give this back?

154
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,851
We are not giving this back.

155
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,313
We are not guilty.
This money belongs to us.

156
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,440
We... Well, I mean, Craig earned it.

157
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,983
- I worked very hard.
- Yeah.

158
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,736
- Weekends and holidays, all unpaid.
- All unpaid.

159
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,322
Always.
And just because you're salary...

160
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,532
...doesn't mean
you don't deserve overtime.

161
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,953
- I think that's only fair.
- Really, that's what this is about, right?

162
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,537
- Fairness.
- Fairness, right.

163
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,289
I mean, not just what's legal.

164
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:47,419
You wanna talk about legal,
slavery, that used to be legal.

165
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,381
Human slavery. So...

166
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,385
Yeah, this is right up there with that.

167
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,231
Please, just don't tell anyone
about the money.

168
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,857
I can't take a bribe.

169
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,609
- Who would know?
- We won't tell.

170
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,695
- Yeah, take it.
- I can't take it.

171
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,489
Please, didn't you say
that you wanted to help us?

172
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,742
Just pretend you never saw
the money. How hard is that?

173
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,536
Take it.

174
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,413
Take it.

175
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,915
I can't... I can't take a bribe.

176
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,879
But you know what I ca...?

177
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,673
I can take a retainer.

178
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,510
- A retainer?
- Yeah, for my services.

179
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,679
As your lawyer.

180
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,266
- You're not our lawyer.
- Well, not yet.

181
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:48,939
Look, I know that HHM is shiny and it's
slick and it's chock-full of lawyers...

182
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,317
...and compared to them I'm like...

183
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,486
...a kiddie lemonade stand
trying to compete with Walmart...

184
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,030
...but here's the thing:

185
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,281
What are you gonna get from me...

186
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,575
...that you won't get
from those other guys?

187
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,703
Passion. Commitment.

188
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,205
Ask yourself this: Who found you?

189
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:10,377
I don't see Howard Hamlin ruining his
$300 Gucci loafers out here.

190
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,298
If you're with me, you're my number one
client, morning, noon or night.

191
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:19,094
You call me, I'm there.
I would be singularly devoted to you.

192
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,725
Why not?

193
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,268
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,811
You're just...

195
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,649
Just what?

196
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:37,196
You're the kind of lawyer
guilty people hire.

197
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,520
Did it make the paper?

198
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,648
- What?
- Did it make the paper?

199
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,650
Did what make the paper?

200
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,693
Okay, well,
probably missed the deadline...

201
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,404
...but check it out tomorrow morning.

202
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,825
Front page. The Kettlemans,
all four of them, safe and sound.

203
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,661
- Looks like you called it.
- Yeah.

204
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,204
Camping, you know?

205
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:32,167
Pretty much right in their own backyard.
Well, five miles above it. Jesus.

206
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,753
The night I had.
I got pine nuts in my shoes.

207
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,798
But, I mean, can you believe it?

208
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,845
I guess you can. It's just, you know...

209
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:47,891
...you assume that criminals
are gonna be smarter than they are.

210
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:52,020
I don't know, it kind of
breaks my heart a little.

211
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,861
Not the loquacious sort, are you?

212
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,823
We can't all be as blessed as you.

213
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,702
- Well, thanks for your help.
- Don't mention it.

214
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,122
And if you ever need any assistance...

215
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:30,017
Whoa, whoa, why is my client
in handcuffs? This man is innocent.

216
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:34,271
He's a victim.
Why on earth would he be cuffed?

217
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,398
Go ahead, take them off.
There you go.

218
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,526
Free at last.
Hey, did he tell you the good news?

219
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,820
Never even kidnapped.
How about that?

220
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,699
A family can't go on a vacation without
the whole city going on lockdown?

221
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,785
By the way, where's your partner?
You lose the coin toss?

222
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,622
Because we expect an apology
from him as well as you.

223
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,750
You really don't wanna push your luck
with me, scumbag.

224
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,711
We got eyes on you, asshole.
One little slip.

225
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,588
- Just one.
- Yeah.

226
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,341
Well, you're both very pretty, so...

227
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,934
Well, I believe I did more
than what you asked of me...

228
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,730
...so that would make us square, yes?

229
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,273
Great.

230
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,611
- You need a ride?
- Camping?

231
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:27,658
- You expect me to believe that shit?
- Yeah, I know.

232
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,494
The things people do, huh?

233
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,581
They decide to go camping
right after I run my little offer by you?

234
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,418
Could be argued that all of life
is one great coincidence.

235
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,844
Somebody told those people
to go camping.

236
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,264
Somebody warned them.

237
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,433
They're very woodsy.

238
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,185
And between you and me...

239
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,854
...they're rash when it comes to
the decision-making.

240
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,482
They're not really
the plan-ahead types.

241
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:05,028
Yeah, I'd cut the cute attitude
right about now if I were you.

242
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:09,241
You ratted on me.
There will be consequences.

243
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,120
Hey, if somebody
warned the Kettlemans...

244
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,498
...it was probably somebody
who was worried about those kids.

245
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,546
Know how much trouble you caused me?

246
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,715
You didn't need any help getting caught.

247
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,843
Okay? The neighbour ID'd you.
You were sloppy.

248
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,805
Any trouble you might have,
that's on you.

249
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,808
Not to mention the blood in your van.

250
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:38,186
Here's a thought: Ajax, Formula 409.

251
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:42,608
You have no idea the tap dance I had to
give those cops to get you out of here.

252
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,320
You gave them probable cause
out the wazoo.

253
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:51,158
Now, whoever the somebody is
who may have warned the Kettlemans...

254
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,203
...got them out of there before
you did anything even more stupid.

255
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,751
You should be thanking
this Good Samaritan...

256
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,380
...because whoever he is,
he did you a favour.

257
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,440
Okay, I'm thinking hourly here.

258
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,568
There were some
special circumstances...

259
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:15,617
...so our elite-tier pricing
would be $950 an hour.

260
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,413
Round off to 20 hours.

261
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,082
Nineteen thousand.

262
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,544
Plus 1000 for travel expenses.

263
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,005
Consulting fees, 1500.

264
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,800
And research.

265
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,635
Five for filing fees.

266
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,137
I ate on the road.

267
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,224
And storage fees.

268
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,605
Miscellaneous expenses.

269
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,947
Upon this rock, I will build my church.

270
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,122
Double-breasted or single, sir?

271
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,916
Single. And I want you to cut
the arm holes high, okay?

272
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:08,837
- Of course.
- And trim through the middle. Trim.

273
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,422
Cloth?

274
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,008
Well, wool.

275
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,551
Yeah.

276
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,640
Super 170 Tasmanian wool.

277
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,101
- Beautiful choice, sir.
- Thanks.

278
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,854
- Navy, all right?
- Yeah.

279
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,607
Oh, that's it, perfect. Pinstripe.

280
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,609
Shall we discuss shirts?

281
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,571
Okay, I'm gonna need your finest
sea island cotton...

282
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,157
...with a white club collar
and French cuffs.

283
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,575
I have the very thing.

284
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,036
And I'm assuming
you want to see some ties.

285
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:45,248
Yeah, I was picturing something
in a light-blue knit.

286
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,876
- Okay.
- Oh, and could you make sure...

287
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,670
...those are real mother-of-pearl
buttons on the shirts?

288
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,050
- Okay? None of this fake plastic crap.
- Of course. I'll be right back.

289
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,260
Some coffee, David?

290
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,166
Here we are.

291
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,462
Shall we?

292
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,798
Yeah, let's go.

293
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,052
Yeah.

294
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,972
So, what do you think?

295
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,017
Strawberry Fields Forever?

296
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,855
No, are you crazy? Not even close.

297
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,231
Yes, it is, look.

298
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,151
No, no, it's way more
Sassafras Glow. Way more.

299
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,446
Use your eyes.
Strawberry Fields Forever.

300
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,407
Ladies, back me up. Hey.

301
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,951
Sassafras Glow, am I right?

302
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,829
Maybe Rhapsody in Blond, but...

303
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,125
See, they agree with me. What happened
to "the customer is always right"?

304
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,879
- Sassafras Glow. Mix it up, all right?
- You're wrong. You see.

305
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,215
Big deal. I'll wash it out
in the morning. No biggie, jeez.

306
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,342
It's bleach. It doesn't wash out.

307
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,720
What? It's permanent?

308
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,848
We'll Photoshop the colour, okay?

309
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,516
Change of plan, ladies.

310
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,520
I wanna go with a simple
curling iron job, okay?

311
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,274
Give me, like, ringlets,
you know, on top.

312
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,526
Like Tony Curtis in Spartacus.

313
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,322
Yeah, like the bath scene
in Spartacus.

314
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:46,411
Stop talking about it.
Make me beautiful already.

315
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,313
Hello, you've reached the law offices
of James M. McGill, Esquire...

316
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,106
...a lawyer you can trust.

317
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:20,779
Kindly leave your information at the tone
and Mr. McGill will phone you promptly.

318
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,405
Hey.

319
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,449
It's me. Hi.

320
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:29,162
Anyway, The Thing is playing
downtown on Saturday.

321
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,499
Thought you might be up
for some Kurt Russell action.

322
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:37,003
I owe you one, so why don't we just
grab some dinner first, my treat?

323
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,634
And, you know, if not,
can you give me a call anyway?

324
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,804
I really wanna talk to you. Okay, bye.

325
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,390
- Come in.
- Hey.

326
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,600
Hey. Hey.

327
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,560
How goes it?

328
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,647
Tricky, for sure.

329
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,608
Craig and Betsy really put us in a corner
with the police...

330
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,235
...not to mention the press.

331
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,571
But this camping story of theirs...

332
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,616
...they've been keeping it
consistent at least.

333
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:11,121
If it's okay with you, I think I should
talk them into hiring a PR firm.

334
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,623
Certainly for the next couple of weeks.

335
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,837
So okay on the PR firm?

336
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,091
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah, of course. What's up?

337
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,968
Take a ride with me.

338
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,803
Okay.

339
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,097
Where are we going?

340
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,331
Yeah.

341
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,293
Shit.

342
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,462
Yep.

343
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:06,342
That's... I mean, that's my suit, right?

344
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,721
- Am I crazy here?
- No, you're not crazy.

345
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,139
Look at the logo.

346
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,101
That's our logo.
He's just straight-up copying us.

347
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,688
I mean, what the hell
is he thinking with this?

348
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:24,486
- Really, he's, you know, a free spirit.
- Yeah.

349
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:25,987
That's one way to put it.

350
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,659
You two are still friends, right?

351
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,870
- I wouldn't exactly...
- You talk, though.

352
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,539
- Not really.
- Still, you're the one he called...

353
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,667
...when he found the Kettlemans'
camped halfway up the Sandias.

354
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,754
He was looking out
for his own client, that's all.

355
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:47,258
This isn't the third degree, Kim. I really
don't care one way or the other. I just...

356
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,723
He's really forcing my hand here.

357
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,041
- Hey.
- Hey.

358
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,460
Am I interrupting?

359
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,131
Not at all. Perfect timing. Come on.

360
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,635
Sit. Have a massage, free of charge.

361
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,263
- Okay.
- You gotta try the footbath too.

362
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,182
Oh, yeah.

363
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,560
Give the old dogs a rest.

364
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,903
- Go for the deep-tissue setting...
- Is that the small fist?

365
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,656
- Use the... It's three arrows.
- I did. I pressed it.

366
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:54,242
Yeah. Now, you feel it?

367
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,537
- Now, relax, okay?
- Okay.

368
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,039
You deserve a break today.

369
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,256
- It's very nice.
- Told you.

370
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,091
I get this free every night.

371
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:14,053
- Just one of the perks of salon living.
- The others being...?

372
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,473
- Free cucumber water, obviously.
- Obviously.

373
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,809
Free mani-pedis?

374
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,477
Deep-discount mani-pedis.

375
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,396
The ladies still gotta eat, you know?

376
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,608
- Well, it's still a deal.
- Yeah.

377
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,944
You're living like a king, then.

378
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,337
What's this?

379
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,423
- Is this a cease and desist?
- Yep.

380
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,343
How pissed was he?

381
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,263
His head didn't actually explode,
but pretty damn pissed.

382
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,100
- Like this-won't-end-well-for-you pissed.
- Yeah.

383
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,936
- How about that?
- Jimmy.

384
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:04,979
This is serious.

385
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,314
- I know.
- Do you?

386
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:10,193
I mean, what the hell
is with that billboard?

387
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,072
I know you have a problem
with Hamlin...

388
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,115
...but I just don't get your angle here.

389
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,826
Aren't you trying to build
your own law practice?

390
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:22,872
Instead, you're spending God knows
how much money turning yourself...

391
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:27,919
...into a little Hamlin clone. I mean,
why are you making this personal?

392
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,172
- It's not personal.
- It is so personal.

393
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,841
It is completely and totally personal.

394
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,095
- No, no, no. It's not. Nope.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

395
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,180
Stop trying to pretend.

396
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,809
I can advertise, can't I?
What, do I have to clear everything...

397
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,728
- ...past the great Howard?
- You can advertise all you want.

398
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,898
That billboard is not advertising.
That is a declaration of war.

399
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,359
- "Declaration of war."
- Right at Hamlin's exit.

400
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,070
- You know he drives by it every day.
- It's business.

401
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,780
I'm building a brand.

402
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,241
You're ripping off a brand.

403
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,702
There is nothing original in that ad.

404
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,954
It certainly doesn't represent
Jimmy McGill.

405
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,790
Hey. All right, now,
he fired the first shot, okay?

406
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,378
Trying to keep me from using my name?
My own name, Kim?

407
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,213
I get that.

408
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:14,549
But this?

409
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,385
- You're better than this.
- I'm better than this?

410
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,679
- Yes, you are.
- I'm better than this? I'm bet...

411
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,931
Well, you're better
than that schmuck Hamlin.

412
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,182
Oh, come on, Jimmy.

413
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,978
You could work anywhere. You could be
somewhere where they appreciate you.

414
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,855
Where they see how valuable you are.

415
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,566
Where, I don't know,
maybe they care about you.

416
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,287
Forget it, okay?

417
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,415
If Hamlin wants to come after me,
he knows where I am.

418
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:51,002
I'll be ready. Guns blazing.

419
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,231
The cease and desist
is just the beginning.

420
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,985
The next step is an injunction.
You can't win this fight.

421
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,266
Your Honour,
I'm a humble solo practitioner...

422
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:51,771
...merely trying to ply my trade in an
aggressive and evolving marketplace.

423
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,732
As I've argued repeatedly,
this is trademark infringement.

424
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,902
Mr. McGill's new logo
is an absolute copy of ours.

425
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,863
I think it falls
firmly under fair use.

426
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,409
Fair use? You're clearly profiting,
so fair use doesn't apply.

427
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,996
There are only so many fonts out there.
Does Mr. Hamlin outright own them all?

428
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,500
No. But we've been using
this particular font for 12 years now.

429
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:16,379
And it, in concert with our tri-rectangle
graphic and Hamlindigo blue...

430
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,549
...constitutes
a trademark-brand identifier.

431
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,969
Whoa, back up. "Hamlindigo blue"?

432
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,638
Yes. That is our trademark name.

433
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:31,769
Holy crap, you seriously named
a colour Hamlindigo? That is...

434
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,815
From the man dressed exactly like me.
Your Honour...

435
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,734
...I feel like I'm in the mirror routine
with Groucho Marx.

436
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,237
Like we should be standing
waving our arms.

437
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,281
Really? I don't see it.

438
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,908
In addition, the name McGill
appears in both logos...

439
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,203
...which Mr. McGill is hoping
to further confuse potential clients.

440
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,372
So I can't advertise
under my own name now?

441
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:52,707
I'm to be penalised...

442
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,835
...because I happen to share a name
with one of HHM's partners?

443
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,087
You can't take my name from me.

444
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,673
The name is not the problem here,
Mr. McGill.

445
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,925
Mr. Hamlin certainly seems to think so.

446
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,219
I mean, he wants me
to change my name...

447
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,848
...because he claims that, what,
it's some kind of threat to his business?

448
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,017
- Your Honour...
- This is restraint of trade.

449
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,394
Okay, whatever happened
to the free market, huh?

450
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,898
- Hamlin here wants you to tell...
- Okay, enough, Mr. McGill.

451
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,941
I've heard enough.

452
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:23,279
All right, yes, you are within your rights
to advertise using your own name.

453
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:28,117
However, in my estimation, the billboard
clearly and intentionally...

454
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,162
...duplicates elements of the
Hamlin Hamlin McGill logo.

455
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,166
You're actively copying their
established brand for your own gain.

456
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,959
I don't see any other explanation.

457
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,213
- Your Honour...
- Jimmy. Jimmy. Wise up.

458
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,341
The billboard must come down
within 48 hours.

459
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,429
This is a classic
David-versus-Goliath story.

460
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:52,642
I mean, you got your gigantic law firm
stomping all over the little guy.

461
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,686
But it's investigative journalism
at its best.

462
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,897
It's right up your alley.

463
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,404
Yeah, okay. Well, let me give you
my cell just in case.

464
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,157
Yeah. Thank you.

465
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,336
Can I get the news desk, please?
I got a hot tip.

466
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,713
Wanna be the station
that brought down big law?

467
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,758
You could be like the reporters
that brought down big tobacco.

468
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,094
Look, I'm talking
Woodward and Bernstein here.

469
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,847
Your exposé on predatory ATM fees,
that was...

470
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,350
Well, it's a miscarriage of justice.

471
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,478
And I think your viewers
would be very, very interested...

472
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:41,524
...and grateful to you
for exposing this injustice.

473
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,402
I wouldn't characterise this
as a community health risk...

474
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,237
...but it's community interest.

475
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:50,741
No, yes.
HHM is a pillar of the community. Yes.

476
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,869
No, the war is
an important story as well.

477
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,581
That's why this action is so egregious.

478
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,957
Sure. Okay.

479
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,501
Well, at least consider
the human interest angle here.

480
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,755
Are you kidding? "Lawyer pulls
himself up by his bootstraps...

481
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,551
...only to be ground under the heel
of the old-money mega-firm"?

482
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,803
That's hearts and minds.

483
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,434
Yeah, I have your number too, so...

484
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,811
Yeah, I see. Okay.

485
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,195
Oh, no, no, no, man.
Can't touch the goods.

486
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,572
I signed the form.
Only I can touch the camera.

487
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:14,659
Fine. May I suggest you
widen the frame to include...

488
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,203
The billboard is the story, okay?

489
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,538
I'm also the story.

490
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,750
- So gotta get me in there.
- Okay, so get on your mark.

491
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,169
No offence to your minutes
of experience...

492
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:29,256
...but I'd like to see what we got
before we do this, okay? Other guy.

493
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,718
Other guy. Only other guy that's here.

494
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,179
Go stand where I was standing.

495
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,014
Shrink down. Shrink down.

496
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,724
Yeah, scrunch.

497
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:39,975
Yeah.

498
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:43,396
Okay, widen the frame,
get the billboard.

499
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,856
Okay, now get me. Me, me, me.

500
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,400
No, not me.

501
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,151
Get him. He's me.

502
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,945
Yeah, like that.

503
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,697
- Got it?
- Yeah.

504
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,198
Good.

505
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:56,951
Okay.

506
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,995
- Is he in the shot?
- No. Dude, just go.

507
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,456
- How do I look?
- Great.

508
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:03,958
Well...

509
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,502
No, this is my good side.

510
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,922
- Is the billboard in?
- Yes. Jesus, just...

511
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,216
You said 100 for one hour,
not fricking three.

512
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:15,553
You have a journalistic impulse.
You're a go-getter. You know that?

513
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,179
Go get this.

514
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,724
All right, count me down.

515
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,394
In five, four, three...

516
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,438
Gravitas.

517
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:33,320
I'm James McGill. Like most Americans,
I'm a self-made man.

518
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,240
I put myself through law school.

519
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,617
Working in the courts
as a public defender...

520
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,746
...I represented those
with nowhere else to turn.

521
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,707
I believe in service.
It's what I built my career on.

522
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:49,044
But I've also had a dream,
a dream that many of us have.

523
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,465
A dream to own my own business.

524
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:58,262
Well, I scrimped and I saved and finally,
I was able to buy one billboard.

525
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:04,351
A tiny foray into advertising
for my fledgling law firm.

526
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,230
I've always been told that America
is the land of opportunity...

527
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,526
...and I believed it. Until today.

528
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,864
Not 24 hours
after my billboard went up...

529
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,949
...a large law firm came after me.

530
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,243
They said
that I was hurting their business.

531
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:25,790
They're rich, they're powerful.
I'm just one man.

532
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,375
So who do you think
the court sided with?

533
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:35,007
So now my little billboard comes down.

534
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,510
Let me tell you something:
If they want a fight...

535
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,305
...they're gonna get a fight
because I'm not giving up...

536
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,099
Holy shit. Dude, the dude!

537
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,851
- Dude, the dude!
- Help!

538
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,102
The worker guy.

539
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,479
Shit.

540
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,898
Please. Get me down!

541
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,525
- Dude.
- Okay. Call 911.

542
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,318
Help me.

543
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:55,986
- You got a cell?
- Yeah, yeah.

544
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:59,490
- Please.
- Yeah, a guy just fell off a billboard...

545
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,712
Help me.

546
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,472
I don't think that's very safe.
You need to be licensed for that.

547
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,766
- Help me.
- Man.

548
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:36,318
Not looking down. One rung at a time.

549
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,362
Not looking down.

550
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,841
Hurry up.

551
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,718
Come get me.

552
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,512
Help.

553
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,477
Help me.

554
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,358
- Sir, I'm right here.
- Please.

555
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,360
Please.

556
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,951
- Pull me up.
- Here.

557
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,661
- Grab my hand.
- Pull me up.

558
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,921
Pull me up.

559
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,535
You okay?

560
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,537
Took you long enough.

561
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:25,886
I was scared, yes. I mean, I'm not really
a big fan of heights, let me tell you...

562
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,389
...but, you know,
something inside me said:

563
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,807
"You have to do this."

564
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,394
I'm sure our city's first responders
would have been here momentarily...

565
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,355
Jesus, can you believe this guy?

566
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,816
Whole thing was a publicity stunt.
It's gotta be.

567
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,360
That's all anybody wants
when they're in trouble.

568
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,487
Didn't think life was gonna call on me...

569
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,447
You don't think
anyone's gonna buy this?

570
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,535
- ...in an immediate, life-threatening way.
- It's hard to say. People love a hero.

571
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,412
You take it as it comes, right?

572
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:55,916
The universe put me in that spot
at that moment. Who am I to say no?

573
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,795
You know, as a lawyer,
well, I help people every day.

574
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,630
Whole thing's a damn stunt.

575
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,676
I think my clients know
that when they're in trouble, I'm there.

576
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,803
I'm just a guy
who was in the right...

577
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,672
You have seven new messages.

578
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,303
To listen to your messages, press one.

579
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,266
First message. Received at 5:40...

580
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,097
It's just showmanship, Chuck.

581
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,809
Yeah, right.

582
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,343
You're early.

583
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,220
- Did you...?
- Yeah, I grounded myself.

584
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,847
Hey, big day.

585
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,849
My phone's ringing off the hook.

586
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,518
I have three consults before lunchtime.

587
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,895
- Three.
- That's great, Jimmy.

588
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,522
Yep.

589
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,483
The worm has turned.

590
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:31,238
That's really great. So to what
do you credit this sudden change?

591
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,032
Well, I gotta admit, you were right.

592
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,576
How so?

593
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:40,747
Well, you told me to keep plugging and
do good work and the clients will come.

594
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:44,042
You know, I'll admit,
I almost lost faith a couple times.

595
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,629
But the worm has turned.

596
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:55,512
So, what, you've been getting referrals
from your PD clients?

597
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,681
Yeah. You know, you work hard...

598
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:01,101
...show you got half a brain and
people come knocking, like you said.

599
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,937
I just needed to get my face out there.

600
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,399
So the prosecutors then,
referring clients.

601
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:11,320
Yeah. Yep, exactly.

602
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,571
Was it Bergeron?

603
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,616
When I was starting out,
she sent me a couple of good ones.

604
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:20,412
Yeah, it was someone on her team,
you know.

605
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:24,583
I mean, hey, it just took
some elbow grease and clean living.

606
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,919
People noticed.

607
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,047
I knew you had it in you.

608
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,926
I don't see the Journal here.

609
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,932
- Here you go.
- No, Albuquerque Journal. It's not here.

610
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,517
Oh, yeah.

611
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:43,852
I didn't see it outside.

612
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,104
It wasn't out there? It's always out there.

613
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,606
I didn't see it.

614
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,235
Maybe they forgot to deliver it.
Maybe some kids grabbed it.

615
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,571
Because if there's one thing kids love,
it's local print journalism.

616
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,824
I don't know what to tell you,
you got a ton of reading material.

617
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:01,495
Look, hey. Financial Times.

618
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,790
You know, I know Albuquerque
is a hub of global intrigue...

619
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,752
- ...but you think that'll tide you over?
- Fine, but if it's not here tomorrow...

620
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,545
...I need you
to call the subscription office.

621
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:11,922
Yeah, will do.

622
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,966
Look, I gotta go. I don't wanna be late.

623
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,551
- Hey, good luck today.
- Thanks.

624
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,345
Keep it up.

625
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:21,348
Hard work looks good on you.
