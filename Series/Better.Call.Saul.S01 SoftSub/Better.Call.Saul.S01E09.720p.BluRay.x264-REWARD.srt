1
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,620
Don't worry about that, all right?

2
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,373
Look down. Look at the grass.

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,044
Kick off your shoes like this.

4
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,724
When was the last time you did that?

5
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,017
Feels good, right?

6
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,562
Yeah.

7
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,189
Grass between your toes.

8
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,359
Feels nice.

9
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,319
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,412
Well, I think maybe...
Maybe it's time we go in.

11
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:24,417
We have a lot of work to do. We need
to get ready. You need to get ready.

12
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,962
If I were Schweikart and Cokely,
I'd seek a restraining order.

13
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,007
Turn this into a civil harassment issue.

14
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:34,385
Schweikart and Cokely can come
after me with a restraining order...

15
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,596
...or anything else they got,
I'll be ready.

16
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,639
Confidence is good.

17
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,517
Facts on your side, better.

18
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,228
Know what you're walking into.

19
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:07,418
- House needs a coat of paint.
- Yeah.

20
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,357
I got her all her shots.

21
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,360
Healthy gums.
And no worms. No fleas.

22
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:37,156
I promise you, if the little sucker
has fleas, I'll kick her butt myself.

23
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,451
Yeah, it's just, a dog...

24
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,870
Hey, it's good to have a dog around.

25
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,124
Bad guys think twice about
breaking into a house with a dog.

26
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,294
Yeah, I bet that one's gonna
keep a lot of burglars away.

27
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,713
It's just a thought.

28
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,301
You know, you can always
keep her over at my place.

29
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,054
Kaylee can visit her
any time she wants.

30
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,851
Well, if you decide to keep her...

31
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,854
...I got a giant bag of puppy chow
out in the car for you.

32
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,023
All the supplies. Everything you need.

33
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,905
All right.

34
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,074
What's that?

35
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,536
The dog can stay here.

36
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,246
You sure?

37
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,123
Yes.

38
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,958
Thank you.

39
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,169
All right. Done.

40
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,424
Excuse me a minute.

41
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,556
Yeah?

42
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,311
Sure.

43
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,690
Yup.

44
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,486
Got it.

45
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,913
Is everything okay?

46
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,541
Yeah. Just a lead on a job opportunity.

47
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,046
Your Honour, Mr. Schweikart
and his cohorts are attempting...

48
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,632
- ...to keep me away from their victims.
- Victims?

49
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,092
My clients. Yes.
You're denying me access.

50
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:24,931
Even the worst prisoners in this
building are allowed access to a lawyer.

51
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,226
Are you saying my poor, elderly clients
have fewer rights than jail inmates?

52
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,521
Not at all. And no one is denying
Mr. McGill access to his clients.

53
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,232
- We're denying access to the property.
- It's semantics.

54
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,235
Within Sandpiper Crossing's rights.
The building's private property.

55
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,656
- Paid for by the residents.
- But managed by licensed professionals.

56
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,783
Okay. One at a time, gentlemen.

57
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:48,454
Mr. Schweikart, you're denying him
access on what grounds?

58
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:52,083
These assisted living residents have
a daily routine that they're used to.

59
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:57,338
Mr. McGill, who is loud and flamboyant,
is a disturbance to these routines.

60
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,424
Residents who want to see a lawyer,
free to leave whenever they want.

61
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,801
Leave whenever they want?

62
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,137
We're talking about elderly
and infirm people here.

63
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:09,684
The most common phrase in this place?
"I've fallen and I can't get up."

64
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,895
There's phone consultations.
There's mail and messenger services.

65
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,939
Plenty of ways to confer with clients.

66
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,943
But for residents who don't want to be
afflicted with Mr. McGill's presence...

67
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,237
...this becomes an
issue of civil harassment.

68
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,990
Wow, you are stretching
that definition to its limit.

69
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,534
And FYI, old people adore me.

70
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,952
Okay. I've heard enough.

71
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,913
I have enough here to let me
rule on this restraining order.

72
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:39,338
Yeah. Don't worry, Chuck.
That's not smoke you smell. That's me.

73
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:45,928
This mo-fo is on fire. Your baby bro
kicked some Schweikart ass today.

74
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,472
What the hell's all this?

75
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,810
There was a delivery
while you were in court.

76
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,479
Schweikart and Cokely sent this?
What is it?

77
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,858
The served interrogatories
on each class representative.

78
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,610
This box is deposition notices.

79
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,699
Documents calling into question the
mental health of our elderly clients.

80
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,368
Attempting to stop the
class from being certified...

81
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,412
...on the grounds
they're not competent.

82
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,831
Oh, this is just the beginning.

83
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:18,044
They're gonna continue this document
dump until we're drowning in paperwork.

84
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:23,382
All right.
We can deal with this. I mean, hey.

85
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:27,928
It's... It's just paperwork. Right?

86
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,515
- It's no big deal. Just hit it head on.
- Jimmy.

87
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,351
Prioritise.
The most important stuff first.

88
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,855
Or is it better to
deal with the easy stuff?

89
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,649
You know, get that off the decks.

90
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,528
You tell me, Chuck. You just
point to a box. We can do this.

91
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,198
- Jimmy, we need to talk.
- Chuck.

92
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,242
- Sit down, won't you?
- No, I'm good.

93
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,870
I know you're not gonna
like what I have to say next.

94
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,538
But facts are facts.

95
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,083
And what we're facing here...

96
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,795
A case this size, it is not
a two man job. We need help.

97
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,214
- No.
- And for the good of the clients...

98
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,591
- ...we need to refer this case...
- Don't say it.

99
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,551
Refer it out to HHM.

100
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,222
Damn it, Chuck. No. Come on.

101
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:16,268
We can do this.
We're doing great on our own.

102
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,231
We don't need Hamlin or anyone else.
I mean, hey.

103
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,526
We can Erin Brockovich
the shit out of this case.

104
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,903
Erin Brockovich didn't do it alone.

105
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,114
She and Ed Masry
brought in heavy hitters...

106
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,991
...from Los Angeles to get that
case across the goal line.

107
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,995
And that's what we need to do.
And there's no shame in that.

108
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,664
This is our case.

109
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,459
Yes, it's ours.
And the task ahead is monumental.

110
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,962
Could we do it alone?

111
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:47,049
Could two men alone build
the Brooklyn Bridge? Maybe.

112
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,468
But it would take forever.

113
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:53,305
Just how long do you think the
residents of Sandpiper Crossing have?

114
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:59,520
Referring this case to HHM
is for the good of the clients.

115
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,107
That argument you won today
against the restraining order...

116
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,234
...the judge was never
gonna grant that.

117
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,736
Schweikart is throwing softballs.

118
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,364
And he's gonna keep on
throwing them over and over.

119
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,824
We'll be busy swatting them away...

120
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,076
...we'll never spend time
on the actual case.

121
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,787
This case will span years.

122
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,374
And we don't have the capital
to carry it forward by ourselves.

123
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,585
We simply don't.

124
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,931
- Fine.
- So?

125
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,392
The case goes to HHM?

126
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,898
Hail Satan. I submit to the dark side.

127
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,902
I'll call Kim and arrange a meeting.

128
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,488
All right. Good, Jimmy. Thank you.

129
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,658
I know you'll come to see
that it's for the best.

130
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,175
I guess I'll have to get
an office right next to yours.

131
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,888
Finally out of the mailroom, huh?

132
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,981
Yes. Hello.

133
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,776
No. It's me.

134
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,065
- This the place where we wait?
- Think so.

135
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,473
So.

136
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,646
What'd our guy tell you about the job?

137
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,691
Not much.

138
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,445
It's a protection job. Civilian.

139
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:25,244
Guy is as green as they come, but we'll
be in there to make sure things fly right.

140
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,418
You been doing this long?
I just assume we're all heavy hitters.

141
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,669
And it makes sense.

142
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,379
The vet recommends
the best of the best.

143
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,925
Dealing with some of these ethnic types,
blood tends to run a little hotter.

144
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:43,554
That's just science. Physiology.

145
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,433
There's historical precedent.
Know what I'm saying?

146
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,937
So, what you packing?

147
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,316
- A pimento.
- Sorry, what?

148
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,735
Pimento sandwich.

149
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,323
That's funny. Pimento.

150
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,743
No, I mean, what are you carrying?

151
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,121
You know, the piece?
What's the make?

152
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,042
Pimento is a cheese.
They call it the caviar of the south.

153
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,920
You don't want to tell me
what you're carrying, so be it.

154
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,214
But you don't have to
be a douche about it.

155
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,925
Just told you what I'm carrying.

156
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,097
So you're saying
you don't have a gun?

157
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,932
Is that what you're saying?

158
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,602
How are you here without a gun?

159
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,271
- You have a gun?
- Yeah.

160
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,483
Yeah. Of course. He's got a gun.

161
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,444
I got at least two guns on me
that I'll tell you about.

162
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,155
I go old school with
a Wilson Combat 1911.

163
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,910
I got a Glock 22 Gen 3. And those are
just the ones I'll tell you about.

164
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,748
I mean, what the hell? Really?

165
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,250
How do you not pack a gun?

166
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:16,104
Hi. Hello. My name is Price.

167
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,107
Actually, that's not my name.

168
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:23,904
But I have a nephew named Price.
I've always kind of liked that name.

169
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,073
Anyway, we're not
dealing with names today.

170
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,201
You can tell me or not tell me yours.
Or a fake one is fine.

171
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:34,289
If I need to talk to you, I'd prefer
something other than "Hey, you."

172
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,126
Either way, you all come highly
recommended, so thank you.

173
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,380
First order of business,
we have a long drive ahead of us.

174
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,466
I have a cooler of water in the car,
some soft drinks.

175
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,470
I don't drink coffee,
but there is a diner on the corner.

176
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,475
Also a bathroom in there in case
you need to go before we go.

177
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,727
Second order. Money.

178
00:14:55,937 --> 00:15:02,359
Just to be clear that the
agreed upon fee of $500 per man is...

179
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,735
...agreed upon.

180
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,779
- If that's acceptable...
- Yeah, I have a thought.

181
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,739
Yeah.

182
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,118
How about you give me
and Man Mountain 750 each?

183
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:16,206
And send Uncle Fester there home.
He's not carrying a gun. He's useless.

184
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,878
- Is that true? You didn't bring a gun?
- I didn't think I'd need one.

185
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,339
It's a protection job.

186
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,510
It's basic common sense that you
need a gun to protect your employer.

187
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,845
You're dead weight.

188
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,889
- He's just a third wheel without a piece.
- I'll tell you what.

189
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,434
If I need a gun, I'll use one of his.

190
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,396
Really? One of my guns? How do you
picture that happening exactly?

191
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,440
Well, I guess I'm gonna
take it from you.

192
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,777
That... That is just special.

193
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,947
Take. How are you gonna
take one of my guns?

194
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,825
Come on, Billy Jackoff.

195
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,494
Take my gun from me.

196
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,246
Let me see it.

197
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,042
Here. I'll make it easy for you.

198
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,549
You can make it not so easy.

199
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,676
Sure thing.

200
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,763
You got it.

201
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,851
What the...? Son of a...

202
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,858
Okay. Let's see what you got.

203
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:30,906
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A guy like you...

204
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,576
I'll bet you'd have an ankle holster,
wouldn't you?

205
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:38,372
You know, that's cute. What else?

206
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,923
Wow, now, that's impressive.

207
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,218
So many guns,
I don't know which one to use.

208
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,097
How about you? You want one?

209
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,772
All right.

210
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,744
Let's go.

211
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:22,666
- But we need three guys.
- No. No, we don't. Come on. Let's go.

212
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,427
Oh, he'll be fine.

213
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:39,433
And now that I'm doing the job alone,
I get the full 1500. We agree upon that?

214
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,017
Sure.

215
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,863
You got this, okay? No problem.

216
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,448
Yes.

217
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,701
- The suit okay? Is it too tight or too hot?
- Yeah.

218
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,412
No, I mean. No. No. It's good.

219
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,456
Well, you look good.

220
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,460
Can't even tell that's under there.

221
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,253
It was a good idea.

222
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,090
Yeah. At any point, it's too much,
you're uncomfortable...

223
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,635
...we'll turn around and come home.
You want maybe like a safe word?

224
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,096
How about, "Get me the hell home"?

225
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,515
That'll work. Okay.

226
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,559
Let's do this.

227
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,603
Let's do this.

228
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,024
Okay.

229
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,610
Looking good.

230
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,322
We're just going for a little ride.

231
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,785
Here. Let me get that for you.

232
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,537
Here you go.

233
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,132
- Jimmy.
- Just a sec.

234
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,056
- Oh, crap.
- What is it?

235
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,934
I must have left my
stupid phone on last night. It's dead.

236
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,811
Well, could you put it in the trunk?

237
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,979
Yeah.

238
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,954
Okay. Thanks.

239
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,623
That everyone?

240
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,667
They'll be here in one minute.

241
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,045
Anyone still have a phone,
add it to the collection now.

242
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,465
- Okay. Shut it down.
- Okay. Got it.

243
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,750
- How you doing? You doing all right?
- Yeah.

244
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,961
Okay. Great stuff.

245
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:28,059
Okay. We're walking.
Walking in, Chuck.

246
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,312
Here we go.

247
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,547
- Good to see you. Welcome home.
- Howard, you didn't need to do all this.

248
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,925
Oh, I couldn't have
stopped them if I wanted to.

249
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,968
- Come on, let's get you upstairs.
- Yeah. Sure.

250
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,888
Francis. Brenda. Jose, you shaved.

251
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,903
To date, we have
68 very willing plaintiffs...

252
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:25,617
...signed to the class-action with hopes
of raising that number to 350 or more.

253
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,621
Many more, now that we know
Sandpiper has facilities in five states.

254
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,376
Fraud, unfair and deceptive
trade practises, and racketeering.

255
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,836
Jesus. Guys, this is...

256
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,341
Well, no case is ever a slam dunk.

257
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,886
But I feel as confident about this as
anything that's come through our doors.

258
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,222
Francis, start putting together teams
to travel out of state.

259
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,556
Talk to these residents.

260
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,977
Pair fourths with our best second years.
Laura will take care of the travel.

261
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,771
Kim, Daniel.
Take the list of clients Jimmy's signed.

262
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,692
Introduce yourself as the face of HHM.
Make them feel secure and confident.

263
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,194
Hey, Howard.
I'm glad you're all excited.

264
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,114
But can we slow down a second
and discuss terms, maybe?

265
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,532
Oh, of course.

266
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,701
Kind of shot out of a cannon
with this case.

267
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,036
- It's exciting stuff you have here.
- I get it.

268
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,080
Look, Chuck is already
an equity partner.

269
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,833
You, as the lawyer who
brought this case to the firm...

270
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,502
...we could guarantee you,
say, 20 percent...

271
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:20,880
...of the common fund share
of the final settlement.

272
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,133
That will work.

273
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,637
That's a few years down the road.
As for money for you now...

274
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,098
...we don't do referral fees.
Chuck will agree.

275
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,934
- HHM doesn't view that as ethical.
- As we discussed.

276
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:36,271
But what we could do
is arrange an of-counsel fee...

277
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,692
...for the time that you've already put in.
Time that you spent building the case.

278
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,819
I think we could go as high as 20,000.

279
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,740
- That, too, will work.
- Great.

280
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,493
Give us an invoice.
I'll have Helen cut you a cheque.

281
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:55,498
Oh, got it right here.
And I'd like to use 312 as an office.

282
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,002
- It's right next to Chuck's.
- I'm sorry?

283
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:03,298
Three-twelve. I know, it's got that view
that clients love, but you know what?

284
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,549
That's a waste of space.

285
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,303
The waiting area by the kitchen
is just as good.

286
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:14,100
Well, come on, guys.
I mean, I need an office.

287
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,231
Can I have the room?
Everybody, please. Just give us a few.

288
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,614
- Howard...
- When the room's clear, Chuck.

289
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,502
Jimmy. Jimmy, I'm just gonna say it.

290
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,797
- You're not working here.
- What are you talking about?

291
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,341
- You said this case is a slam dunk.
- Yes.

292
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,761
We want the case. We don't want...

293
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,141
The case is all we want.

294
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,354
You gotta be...

295
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,689
You're serious?

296
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:06,236
I walk in here with a multi-million dollar
class-action lawsuit...

297
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,240
...on a damn platinum platter.

298
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,828
A case that I found,
that I made happen.

299
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:18,414
And you don't want me?
Why in Christ not?

300
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,502
Well, I know that
you hate me, Howard.

301
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,630
You better believe,
feeling goes both ways.

302
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,467
But I'm willing to set that aside
to work with you on this.

303
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,553
Why can't you do the same for me?

304
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,472
What is it that you can't let go of?

305
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:40,770
What slight did I make to your fine,
upstanding character you can't forgive?

306
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,190
A majority decision has been made
by myself and the partners.

307
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,650
All due respect to you, Chuck...

308
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,486
...we are not taking in
any new associates into the firm.

309
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,697
Bullshit. New associates?

310
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:55,285
Someone walks in with a case like this,
you beg them to be partner.

311
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,287
Tell me why.

312
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:01,040
You didn't want me then. Okay.
You don't want me now?

313
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,917
Explain it.

314
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,795
Howard.

315
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,757
I don't know what to say.

316
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,262
I am very disappointed.
I really think you should reconsider.

317
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:18,975
I'm sorry, but no. I think it's best
if Jimmy takes the of-counsel fee.

318
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,186
We could probably up it a bit.
Keep in mind.

319
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,314
You will be well compensated in the
back end. It's easy money, Jimmy.

320
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,024
No reason not to take it.

321
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,736
Go to hell, Howard.

322
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,946
I'm not giving you my case.

323
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,782
And I'm gonna tell
every one of those clients...

324
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:38,453
...what a lying miserable
pig fucker you are.

325
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:44,709
I will burn the whole thing to
the ground before I give it to you.

326
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:50,715
Okay then. If that's your decision.

327
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,385
Good luck to you moving forward.

328
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,397
What the hell just happened?

329
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,237
Yeah. Come.

330
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,365
Hi.

331
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,826
Was wondering if you had a moment?

332
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,205
Sure. Just give me a second.

333
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:39,180
- What's up?
- I wanted to talk about what happened.

334
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,183
With Sandpiper Crossing,
things didn't work out.

335
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:45,395
It was unfortunate.
It was a good case.

336
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,731
- But things happen.
- I'm just trying to understand why.

337
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,359
Jimmy found that case. He built it.

338
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,070
Did all of the leg work.

339
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,281
The class-action
doesn't exist without him.

340
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,074
He deserves a seat at the table.

341
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,909
I understand.

342
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,455
But the decision has been made, Kim.

343
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,041
Thank you for your input.

344
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,924
But why?

345
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:23,891
The partners have made a decision
and the why is not your concern.

346
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,352
I think it is my concern.

347
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,479
And why is that?

348
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,650
Because he's my friend.

349
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,154
And the way I see it,
you're not treating him fairly.

350
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,573
The way you see it?

351
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:43,870
I don't know what image
you have of him, past or present.

352
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:49,375
Or whatever he did or said to you,
but Jimmy is a good lawyer.

353
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,210
And he works very hard.

354
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,589
Did your friend send you in here
to say that?

355
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,467
No.

356
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,386
I'm saying it because I believe it.

357
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,806
Well.

358
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,266
Duly noted.

359
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,894
Want to know what I believe?

360
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:12,190
I believe that you're
way out of your depth in this matter.

361
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,650
So the next time
that you want to come in here...

362
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,736
...and tell me what I'm doing wrong...

363
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,739
...you are welcome to
keep it to yourself.

364
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,075
Because I don't care.

365
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,129
Stop.

366
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,177
Close the door.

367
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,606
They're late.

368
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,983
Must be traffic.

369
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,948
I wonder how this is
supposed to work.

370
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:07,412
I mean, who goes first?
Do I hand over the pills first?

371
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:11,791
Or do they give me the money
and then I hand over the pills?

372
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,044
I mean, I guess it makes sense
if we just exchanged...

373
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,798
...at the same time, right?
I mean, that's fair.

374
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,176
Maybe we just count to three.

375
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,096
Probably the less talk, the better.

376
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,347
Right.

377
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:31,144
Yeah. I suppose you could really
overthink something like this.

378
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,520
Yeah.

379
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,857
- Well, in any case...
- Here is what is going to happen.

380
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,860
You're gonna take the money.
You're going to count it.

381
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,155
If it's all there, you hand them the pills.

382
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,365
Easy peasy.

383
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:02,758
I knew we needed three guys.
I knew it. It's a three man job.

384
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,886
God.

385
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,864
Hello. Hi.

386
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,911
- Do you have it?
- I do.

387
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,165
Do you have the money?

388
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,199
Is it all there?

389
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:15,790
We're short 20. Twenty dollars.

390
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,209
That's fine.

391
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,089
Agreed amount or no deal.

392
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,591
You serious?

393
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,678
You saying
I intentionally shorted you?

394
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,223
No. Mistakes happen.

395
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,476
You really willing to blow up this deal
over 20 bucks?

396
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,521
Are you?

397
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:08,384
It's all there. Eighty milligram pills,
still factory sealed.

398
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:53,596
You can pay me now.

399
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,278
How did you know?

400
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,658
How did you know not to bring a gun?

401
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:17,912
This 1500?
I'll just say you're getting a bargain.

402
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,956
I put in a lot of leg work
before coming here.

403
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,960
Now, that fella you just met with,
name is Ignacio Varga.

404
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,797
He runs with a
connected crew of drug dealers.

405
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,716
This deal he's doing with you,
he's doing outside his crew.

406
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,551
He doesn't want his bosses to know.

407
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,806
So it was in his best interest
that things go very smoothly.

408
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,187
The lesson is, if you're gonna be
a criminal, do your homework.

409
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,564
Wait. I'm not a bad guy.

410
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,609
I didn't say you were a bad guy.
I said you're a criminal.

411
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,779
What's the difference?

412
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,950
I've known good criminals and bad cops.
Bad priests. Honourable thieves.

413
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,954
You can be on one side
of the law or the other.

414
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:04,291
But if you make a deal with somebody,
you keep your word.

415
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:09,213
You can go home today with your money
and never do this again.

416
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:12,049
But you took something
that wasn't yours.

417
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,510
And you sold it for a profit.

418
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,640
You're now a criminal.
Good one, bad one? That's up to you.

419
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,145
I can get more pills.

420
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:28,190
And I am sure that fella
will keep buying.

421
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:35,448
Why don't you get us home?
You can sleep on it before you decide.

422
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,702
- Hey.
- Hey.

423
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,496
I was worried about you.

424
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:27,666
- I must have called a dozen times.
- Sorry. My phone died.

425
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,878
It's one of the perks of living
in Chuckland. Nowhere to plug in.

426
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,423
But tonight, it's Jimmyland.

427
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:38,344
I've got gin. I've got tequila.
I've got good Kentucky bourbon.

428
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,929
And you may partake with me...

429
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,473
...in any beverage of your choice
on one condition.

430
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,852
You have to listen to me rant about
what an unwashed asshole your boss is.

431
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,396
- Jimmy...
- No. It's true.

432
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,856
Don't deny it.

433
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,608
He has reached
a level of douche baggery...

434
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,944
...that will live on for generations.

435
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,614
Passed down by
windtalkers and the like.

436
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:02,034
He'd rather tank a multi-million dollar
case than work with me.

437
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:05,287
That's sick. He has a sickness.

438
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,749
He hates me that much?
I hate him more.

439
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,876
- What you drinking?
- Jimmy.

440
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:15,464
Yeah, I wanna grab him by that stupid
knit tie of his and swing him around.

441
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,174
- Jimmy.
- Hamlindigo blue.

442
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,427
- How about Hamlindigo blow me?
- Jimmy!

443
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,847
I think you should take the deal.

444
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,433
What?

445
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:30,396
I think you should slow down
and think about it.

446
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:36,026
Because taking the deal
really is the best thing for you.

447
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:40,614
You'll find yourself
a proper office, your office.

448
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:45,703
You'll build your practise.
You'll leave Hamlin and HHM behind.

449
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,997
Be your own man.

450
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,877
You want me to give up the case?

451
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,128
My case?

452
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,673
I want you to be happy.

453
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,885
And I know you want to
stay with the case.

454
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,930
But you'll get all the
financial reward without the risk.

455
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,348
How can that be bad?

456
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:11,645
You come here peddling
that horseshit on me? God, you?

457
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,689
You sure know where
your bread is buttered.

458
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,734
Don't wanna go up against the boss,
that it? You're like a...

459
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,695
You're like a damn pod person.

460
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,698
What did Hamlin promise you?
Please...

461
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,034
...tell me he didn't buy you off cheap.

462
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,328
Did he promise you
the office I asked for?

463
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,414
Or did he just swear never to
move you back downstairs?

464
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,835
Take the deal.

465
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,580
Oh, son of a bitch.

466
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,645
Jimmy.

467
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,189
- Hey.
- Jesus, when did you come in?

468
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:23,569
I don't know. I left my watch outside.

469
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,573
Maybe an hour ago.
You doing some ironing?

470
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,991
Yeah.

471
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:35,539
Hey, I know things
didn't go well for us yesterday.

472
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:39,501
But being back in the office
sure felt good, really good.

473
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:43,005
I'm gonna be prepared in case
any more work comes my way.

474
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:47,634
And the space blanket lining in the suit,
what a fantastic idea.

475
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:51,722
It really made being outside
much more tolerable.

476
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:55,934
I'm thinking about taking
a little walk around the block later on.

477
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,063
That's great, Chuck.
You should do that.

478
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,859
Jimmy, are you all right?

479
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,072
Well, I didn't sleep last night, so...

480
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:14,036
I was doing some soul searching,
and I came to a decision.

481
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,872
I'm gonna take that deal.

482
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:21,251
You're sure? This is what you want?

483
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,506
Kim talked to me.

484
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,717
I got pretty nasty. I'm not proud.

485
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:34,264
But thinking about what she said,
I'd be a fool to pass up that money.

486
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,558
It is a lot of money.

487
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,063
And I have zero interest
in working with Howard.

488
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:45,567
So it's probably best that
we keep to our separate sandboxes.

489
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:50,864
- Wish it could have worked out.
- Yeah. Imagine that, huh?

490
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:54,827
The two McGill boys
side by side storming the gates.

491
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,454
Righting wrongs,
taking down the bad guys.

492
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,456
And making a boatload
of money to boot.

493
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,166
That would have been great.

494
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,211
- Right?
- The very best.

495
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,713
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

496
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,884
I'll keep on Howard.

497
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,598
Won't badger him, but maybe
I can gradually wear him down.

498
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,851
- Get him to come around.
- That's...

499
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,853
Thanks.

500
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,398
I'm so lucky to have you
looking out for me.

501
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,859
I'll do what I can.
I'm not promising anything.

502
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,444
I get it. It's a long shot.

503
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:33,115
- Hey, he might change his mind.
- Yeah.

504
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:39,663
Hey, maybe there is a way that you
could get Howard to change his mind.

505
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:42,124
- How?
- Quit.

506
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,462
- Jimmy, no. No, no, no.
- No, no, it's perfect.

507
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:51,341
We've already been through all this.
The reasons I'm never gonna leave HHM.

508
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,802
But you don't have to really quit.

509
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,513
Okay? You just threaten to quit, right?

510
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:59,892
You get in a game of chicken
with Howard.

511
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:04,521
He's gotta blink, or HHM goes under.
It's a perfect plan.

512
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:09,026
- Jimmy...
- If you want us working together.

513
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,612
You can make it happen easily.

514
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,781
I mean, hey, that reception
you got yesterday at HHM...

515
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:19,536
...how about that, right? The whole
lobby of HHM applauding for you.

516
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,663
They love you.

517
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:26,543
Now, you threaten to pull out, Hamlin
would be insane to screw with you.

518
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:30,297
You've got the nuclear option.
Launch the doomsday device.

519
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:36,929
Game over. If working with me is
what you really want, right, Chuck?

520
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,683
You called him.

521
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,060
You called Hamlin.

522
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:48,565
I always turn my phone off
before I put it in your mailbox.

523
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:53,028
Two nights ago, it was left on.
Battery drained.

524
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:56,740
I was so damn sure that
I turned it off, you know.

525
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,159
Because I always do.
It's a habit, right?

526
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,703
So it was nagging me.
It was nagging me.

527
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,873
So I called the phone company.
Turns out...

528
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:09,920
...there was a deleted call at 2 a.m.
when I was asleep right there.

529
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:14,800
And you know whose number? Hamlin's.

530
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:22,891
The only person who could have made
that call and deleted it is you, Chuck.

531
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,979
Boy, that phone, huh?

532
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,148
Phone must have felt like
a blowtorch in your ear.

533
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,736
All that electricity. All those radio waves
right up against the side of your head.

534
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,155
My God.

535
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:41,785
What was so important that you had to
call Howard before our meeting?

536
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:43,287
The only thing I can think...

537
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:49,001
The only thing that makes sense is
you told him not to hire me.

538
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,004
It was always you, right?

539
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,465
Right back to when I passed the bar
and tried to join the firm.

540
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:58,552
You didn't want me.

541
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,929
Speak up.

542
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,515
Tell me why.

543
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:07,602
It's the least you can do for me now.
I'm your brother.

544
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,314
We're supposed to
look out for each other.

545
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,942
Why were you
working against me, Chuck?

546
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:18,113
You're not a real lawyer.

547
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,159
- I'm what?
- You're not a real lawyer.

548
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,955
University of American Samoa,
for Christ's sake.

549
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,708
An online course? What a joke.

550
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,127
I worked my ass off to get where I am.

551
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,589
And you take these shortcuts
and you think suddenly you're my peer?

552
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,467
You do what I do because you're funny
and you can make people laugh?

553
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,428
I committed my life to this.

554
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,476
You don't slide into it like a cheap pair
of slippers and reap all the rewards.

555
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,979
- I thought you were proud of me.
- I was.

556
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:54,691
When you straightened out and got
a job in the mailroom, I was very proud.

557
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,777
So that's it then, right?

558
00:44:56,986 --> 00:45:01,156
Keep old Jimmy down in the mailroom.
He's not good enough to be a lawyer.

559
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,533
I know you.

560
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,703
I know what you were,
what you are. People don't change.

561
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,497
You're Slippin' Jimmy.

562
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,624
And Slippin' Jimmy
I can handle just fine.

563
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,252
Slippin' Jimmy with a law degree
is like a chimp with a machine gun.

564
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,755
The law is sacred.

565
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,299
If you abuse that power,
people get hurt.

566
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:20,842
This is not a game.

567
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:25,889
You have to know... On some level,
I know you know I'm right.

568
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,516
You know I'm right.

569
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:37,776
I...

570
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,613
I got you a 20 pound bag of ice.

571
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,366
And some bacon, and some eggs...

572
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,369
...and a couple of those steaks
that you like.

573
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,414
Some fuel canisters.
It's enough for three or four days.

574
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:54,960
After that, you're on your own.

575
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,921
I am done.

576
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,007
Jimmy.

577
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,593
Jimmy.

578
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,855
Jimmy.

579
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,525
Jimmy, come back inside.

580
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,698
Jimmy.

581
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:27,117
Jimmy.
