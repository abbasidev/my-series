1
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,762
Yeah, that is some detail.
That is some Western detail right there.

2
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,722
Western detail. Attention to detail.

3
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,809
He's even got spurs on the back
of his boots and they're sharp.

4
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,894
- Love it.
- They are.

5
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,397
The clock is gone on this piece,
Christine, so...

6
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,566
- Oh, my goodness
- Well, let's just move on.

7
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,778
Well, from time to time,
people make mistakes, that's okay.

8
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,281
This is our first Renoir of the evening.

9
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,950
This is a heliogravure,
which is an etching...

10
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,036
...it was hand pulled from a copperplate
in Paris in 1919.

11
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,747
We know this because
that's what it says on the back...

12
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,585
...where the certificate of authenticity
is located. Just as lovely as can be.

13
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,379
Look at the soft, delicate shading,
very feminine.

14
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,339
This is a limited edition.

15
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,010
This is what you're looking for
if you are a Renoir fan.

16
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,596
One hundred, oh, my goodness.
Right at the buzzer.

17
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:42,847
Good.

18
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,766
The few exceptions
is the African pancake tortoise...

19
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:50,229
...which has a flat, flexible shell
that allows it to hide in rock crevasses...

20
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,983
Big swath of light to moderate snow
from the Broken Bow area...

21
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,402
...down toward Kearney, Hastings,
Grand Island.

22
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:00,781
That is all moving in our direction,
so I do think around 7 to 8:00...

23
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,868
...the snow will become pretty steady
here across the region...

24
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,953
...with all this moving on top of us...

25
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,414
...and that's really gonna
knock down visibility.

26
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:12,209
And again, snow-covered roads are
gonna be definitely likely this evening...

27
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,712
...making it even slippier...
More slippery.

28
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,881
Than it is out there at this time.

29
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,634
There's that winter weather advisory
in effect...

30
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,011
...till very early tomorrow morning.

31
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,684
The bitter cold weather
helped break up the compactions...

32
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,395
...we created this fall in our fields.

33
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,444
Don't let false allegations bully you
into an unfair fight.

34
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,156
Hi, I'm Saul Goodman,
and I will do the fighting for you.

35
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,075
No charge is too big for me.

36
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,579
When legal forces have you cornered,
better call Saul.

37
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:35,334
I'll get your case dismissed.
I'll give you the defence you deserve.

38
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,671
Why? Because I'm Saul Goodman,
attorney at law.

39
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,676
I investigate, advocate, persuade,
and most importantly, win.

40
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,470
Better call Saul.

41
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,180
Do you feel doomed?

42
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,808
Have opponents of freedom
wrongly intimidated you?

43
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,562
Maybe they told you you're in serious
trouble and there's nothing you can do.

44
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,815
I'm Saul Goodman, and I'm here
to tell you that they're wrong.

45
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,484
It's never too late for justice.
Better call...

46
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,248
I think...

47
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,751
...your brain is just not all there yet.

48
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:46,715
If we were all held responsible
for what we did when we were 19...

49
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:51,887
I remember what it was like to be a kid.
Think back.

50
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,475
It's all... Judge, what would you say?

51
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,312
These boys, 19, I can't... I don't...

52
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,816
These three young men, just like you.

53
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,152
Just like...

54
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:25,212
Oh, to be 19 again.
You with me, ladies and gentlemen?

55
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,590
Do you remember 19?

56
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:33,220
Let me tell you, the juices are flowing,
the red corpuscles are corpuscling...

57
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,642
...the grass is green and it's soft,
and summer's gonna last forever.

58
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,272
Now do you remember? Yeah, you do.

59
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,818
But if you're being honest,
I mean, really honest...

60
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:52,364
...you'll recall that you also had
an underdeveloped 19-year-old brain.

61
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,533
Me, personally...

62
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,328
...if I were held accountable...

63
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:02,625
...for some of the stupid decisions
I made when I was 19, oh, boy, wow.

64
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,837
And I bet if we were in church right now,
I'd get a big "amen."

65
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,673
Which brings us to these three.

66
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,385
Now, these three knuckleheads...

67
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,804
And I'm sorry, boys,
but that's what you are.

68
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,265
They did a dumb thing.
We're not denying that.

69
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,685
However, I would like you to remember
two salient facts.

70
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:27,524
Fact one, nobody got hurt. Not a soul.
Very important to keep that in mind.

71
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,485
Fact two...

72
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:34,490
Now, the prosecution keeps
bandying this term "criminal trespass."

73
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,035
Mr. Spinauzo, the property owner,
admitted to us...

74
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,496
...that he keeps most portions
of his business...

75
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,332
...open to the public
both day and night.

76
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,961
So trespassing?

77
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,756
It's a bit of a reach, don't you think,
Dave?

78
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,092
Here's what I know.

79
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,471
These three young men,
near honour students all...

80
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:02,142
...were feeling their oats
one Saturday night and they just...

81
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,603
...went a little bananas.

82
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,982
I don't know. Call me crazy,
but I don't think they deserve...

83
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:12,486
...to have their bright futures ruined
by a momentary, minute...

84
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:16,156
...never-to-be-repeated
lapse of judgment.

85
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,492
Ladies and gentlemen...

86
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,412
...you're bigger than that.

87
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,721
- Kenny, are you rolling?
- Yeah, wait a minute.

88
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,975
- Yeah, baby. Yeah.
- Tone it down. Chill out, would you?

89
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,312
Hey, Miss Watson's fourth period
biology class, this one's for you.

90
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,565
- Watch and learn, losers.
- Oh, yeah.

91
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,736
- Oh, God.
- Dude, where'd all the blood go?

92
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,988
He's dead.
They suck it all out, dumb-ass.

93
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,990
- Awesome.
- Where do they put it?

94
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,618
All right, I'm through
the neck bone now, dude.

95
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,620
- Kenny, get over here.
- I'm getting it.

96
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,289
- Get a shot of this.
- Fine, fine.

97
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,166
- Let me do it.
- I got it.

98
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,918
All right.

99
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,045
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

100
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,172
You're sawing like a pussy. Let me do it.

101
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,007
Would you get off? Chill out.

102
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,636
- All right.
- Wait, wait. Okay. Wait for it. Wait.

103
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,100
Yeah.

104
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,937
- Come on. Yeah, baby. Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

105
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,439
I dare you to stick your wang
in the throat hole.

106
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,400
I will if you will, loser.

107
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,693
All right, all right.

108
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,863
- What the hell kind of math is that?
- Seven hundred per defence.

109
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,408
No, no, no. "Defendant." "Dant."

110
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,118
Three defendants, 2100.

111
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,745
Which, by the way, bargain.
What I did for them...

112
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,789
They going to jail, ain't they?

113
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,918
So since when does that matter?
They had sex with a head.

114
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:36,004
Look, didn't nobody tell you
to try all three of them together.

115
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,799
- One trial, $700.
- You're gonna miss me.

116
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,760
You are gonna miss me
because it'll be a cold day in hell...

117
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,514
...before I do any more PD work
for this shitty court. Sayonara, baby.

118
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,267
You have yourself a nice day.

119
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,878
Law offices of James McGill,
how may I direct your call?

120
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,548
Yes, Mrs. Kettleman,
so good of you to return.

121
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:24,052
Actually, I don't have Mr. McGill
at the moment, but I know he...

122
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,847
Oh, splendid.

123
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,683
Unfortunately,
our offices are being painted...

124
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,685
...and the fumes are quite horrid.

125
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:36,857
Could he meet you and your husband
at, say, Loyola's Café on Central?

126
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,904
Four o'clock it shall be. Cheers.

127
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,690
Three dollars.

128
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,817
I'm validated. See the stickers?

129
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:25,489
Well, I see five stickers. You're one shy.
That's $3.

130
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:30,369
They gave me... Look,
I'm validated for the entire day, okay?

131
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,622
Five stickers, six stickers,
I don't know from stickers because...

132
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:38,001
...I was in that court back there
saving people's lives, so...

133
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,670
Gee, that's swell.

134
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,257
And thank you for restoring my faith
in the judicial system.

135
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,467
Now, you either pay the $3...

136
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,929
...or you go back inside
and you get an additional sticker.

137
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,724
Son of a bitch.

138
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,061
Fine. You win. Hooray for you.

139
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,399
Backing up. I have to back up.
I need more stickers.

140
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,234
Don't have enough stickers.

141
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,113
Thank you. Thank you. Very nice.

142
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,746
Employee of the month over here.

143
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,584
Yeah. Hooray. Give him a medal.

144
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,546
Don't do anything, guys.
Just relax, all right?

145
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:27,634
Well, I'm just fuzzy as to why
you think he needs a lawyer.

146
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,386
I mean, Craig...

147
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,139
...the way you run your office
is beyond reproach.

148
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,473
- Beyond reproach.
- Yeah.

149
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,768
- I'm a stickler, you know...
- He is. He's a stickler with the money.

150
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,812
- He's definitely a stickler.
- Yeah. Yeah.

151
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,398
- He's certainly not guilty of some...
- Certainly not.

152
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,485
He's innocent of any wrongdoing,
that's abundantly clear to me.

153
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,239
And frankly, I don't go looking
for guilty people to represent.

154
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,992
I mean, who needs that aggravation,
right?

155
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,660
Right.

156
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,623
Look, all I know is
what I read in the paper.

157
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,126
And typically when money goes missing
from the county treasury...

158
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:05,339
- And the number here is 1.6 million?
- Well, that's an accounting discrepancy.

159
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:10,177
It's a discrepancy, absolutely.
But typically when that happens...

160
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,262
...the police look at the treasurer.

161
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,390
And since that person is...

162
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:20,228
I just think a little proactivity
may be in order.

163
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,857
I just think I'd look guilty
if I hired a lawyer.

164
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,150
Yeah.

165
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,695
Actually, it's getting arrested
that makes people look guilty...

166
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,113
...even the innocent ones.

167
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,282
And innocent people
get arrested every day.

168
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,077
And they find themselves
in a little room...

169
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,413
...with a detective who acts
like he's their best friend.

170
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,583
"Talk to me," he says.
"Help me clear this thing up."

171
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,795
"You don't need a lawyer,
only guilty people need lawyers."

172
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,381
And, boom,
hey, that's when it all goes south.

173
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,591
That's when you want
someone in your corner.

174
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,928
Someone who will fight tooth and nail.

175
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,223
Lawyers, we're like health insurance.

176
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:01,103
You hope you never need it,
but, man, oh, man, not having it? No.

177
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:06,650
How would we proceed
if we decided to...?

178
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,820
Well, this is a letter of engagement.

179
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,823
It's very simple, straightforward.
Please, read it closely.

180
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,033
But if you sign it...

181
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,203
...I can get started
on that defence strategy of ours...

182
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,956
...this very afternoon.

183
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,889
Craig...

184
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,351
...I think maybe we should sleep on it.

185
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,938
Sure.

186
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,150
- Don't you think, Mr. McGill?
- We should sleep on it.

187
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,944
Oh, please, call me Jimmy.

188
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,697
Absolutely. I mean, there's no rush.

189
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,743
Oh, and you know, Craig,
we gotta pick up the kids.

190
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,453
- At the...
- Right.

191
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,704
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

192
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,457
Well, we will be in touch.

193
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:07,294
Thank you for the coffee,
and for the advice.

194
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,755
You're very, very welcome.

195
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:15,010
Here. Take this.
It's got my phone number on it.

196
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,722
- Yeah. Okay.
- Got it.

197
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,237
The number is 9456, 0054...

198
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:40,577
...4896, 0643,
and the expiration is 11, '04.

199
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:45,332
Okay, and the key word here
is "classy," all right? Super classy.

200
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,337
Use only flowers that look expensive,
but, you know, aren't.

201
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,672
And the note should say:

202
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,925
"Dear Betsy and Craig.

203
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,513
Best wishes from your stickler
for justice, James McGill."

204
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,390
Okay? And McGill is spelled M-C...

205
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,267
Well, run it again.

206
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,853
Well, no, no, no. It's paid up.
Run it again...

207
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,325
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

208
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,037
Oh, my God, Cal. Cal. Look at me.

209
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,498
Buddy, look at me. Are you okay?
Say something.

210
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,167
What did you do?
What did you do to my brother?

211
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,379
- Why don't you look where you're going?
- He came out of nowhere.

212
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,924
You freaking hit him, man.
You ran him over.

213
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,342
You ran over my brother.

214
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,970
- I got the whole thing on video.
- It was an accident.

215
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,390
It was an accident. He didn't...
He didn't mean to. Look, let me just...

216
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,059
- It's broke. Is it broke?
- It's my leg.

217
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,769
- You broke his leg.
- It's my leg.

218
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,604
Why you driving around
and not looking?

219
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,606
Driving around breaking people's legs.

220
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,024
- Okay.
- Somebody call the cops.

221
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,277
- Don't call... Don't call the police.
- Police.

222
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,320
Don't call the police.
Don't call the police.

223
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,572
Call them myself.

224
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,824
- Don't call the police.
- Don't call the cops?

225
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,450
- No.
- How you gonna fix this?

226
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,036
What are you gonna do
to make things right?

227
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,503
I don't know, fellas.

228
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,090
What can I do to make it right?

229
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,182
I don't know.

230
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,436
Five hundred dollars.

231
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,940
Five hundred bucks? Yeah?

232
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,650
Yeah.

233
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,113
- What the hell, man?
- Listen, Starlight Express.

234
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:44,326
I'm gonna give you a 9.6 for technique,
0.0 for choice of victim.

235
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,494
I'm a lawyer.

236
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,539
Furthermore,
does this steaming pile of crap...

237
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,708
...scream "payday" to you, huh?

238
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,210
The only way that entire car
is worth 500 bucks...

239
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,838
...is if there's a $300 hooker sitting in it.

240
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:00,759
Now, let's talk about
what you owe me for the windshield.

241
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,516
I'll take a cheque.

242
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,069
Chào cô, ladies.

243
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,783
Chào cô, Mrs. Nguyen.
My, don't you look...?

244
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,910
My mail?

245
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,955
You work for people
who have sex with chopped-off head?

246
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:33,416
- Was it in the paper?
- I heard it from my cousin.

247
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,795
Why? Why you work for these people?

248
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,506
Just lucky, I guess.

249
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,842
Cucumber water for customer only.

250
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:39,024
You have zero messages.

251
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,459
Brenda, looking good.

252
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,254
Nice 'do. Where's Lord Vader?

253
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:28,091
- He's not quite ready for you yet.
- South conference room.

254
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,636
- How about you wait out here?
- How about I don't?

255
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,097
Oh, Sir Francis.

256
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,432
- James.
- Well groomed, as always.

257
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,018
- Okay.
- All right.

258
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,277
Keith, Karen. Yes.

259
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:58,163
You have meddled with
the primal forces of nature, Mr. Hamlin...

260
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,207
...and I won't have it.

261
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:05,295
- Do you want me to call security?
- It's okay, Brenda. We got it.

262
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:10,049
- Hey, Jack. Hey, Nate. Hey, Aaron.
- What can we do for you, Jimmy?

263
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:13,344
I'm sorry, it's this table.

264
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,055
Something just comes over me.

265
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:26,691
You can tell me what this
26,000 is supposed to be for.

266
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,861
That's money for Chuck.
Isn't that what you wanted?

267
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,074
A measly 26 grand? Jesus,
you're like Peter Minuit with the Indians.

268
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,577
Throw in some beads and shells
while you're at it.

269
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,329
It's just a start, there'll be more.

270
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,456
Unless you're gonna
just tear them all up.

271
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,375
And why was it made out to me?
Why not Chuck?

272
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,836
Can he make his way to the bank?

273
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,925
I just assumed it was best
to have the money go through you.

274
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,302
We can do it any way you want.

275
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,429
This isn't going away, Howard.

276
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,766
What Chuck did for this firm,
and damn near single-handedly...

277
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,728
...one-third of this place belongs to him.
Yeah.

278
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:07,690
What have you got, 12 chairs here?
Four of these chairs are Chuck's.

279
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,195
You got five of these
light thingamajigs...

280
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,823
...one and two-thirds are Chuck's.
Yeah.

281
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,533
How many Danishes? Six Danishes?

282
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,120
- You can have all the Danish you want.
- No, no. They're Chuck's Danishes.

283
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,623
And Chuck isn't greedy,
so he'll just take two...

284
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,877
...plus $17 million. In that ballpark.

285
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,506
I mean, we'll know once we get
the accountants poking around here.

286
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,134
Until then, no more penny ante cheques
designed to make it look...

287
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,596
...like Chuck still works here.
He doesn't. He never will again.

288
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,599
It's time to do right by him,
and cash him out.

289
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,852
So these are Chuck's own wishes
that you're conveying?

290
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,355
This is what's best for him.

291
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:51,234
So he personally told you that
it's his wish to withdraw from the firm?

292
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,447
See, that would surprise me.

293
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,950
It's been nearly a year
since he set foot in here.

294
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,201
I'm just doing...

295
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,911
- ...what's in his best interests.
- So am I.

296
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:05,581
And I, for one, believe
he's gonna lick this thing.

297
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:09,585
Until then, his office is just as he left it.
His secretary is still on payroll.

298
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,839
If Chuck can call this an extended
sabbatical, then so can we.

299
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,632
He's that important to us.

300
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,885
You know what?
Let's let a jury figure it out.

301
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,638
Yeah. They're gonna love you, Howard.

302
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,766
You're so down to earth and relatable.

303
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:31,691
And you will atone.

304
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,320
It's Ned Beatty from Network.

305
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,781
For chrissakes, guys.

306
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,458
Jimmy.

307
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,712
I almost forgot. This month's filings.

308
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,630
You can save me the postage.

309
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,842
Weren't you listening in there?
Chuck doesn't work here anymore.

310
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,303
Think I'm gonna help you
establish a paper trail?

311
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,139
- Jimmy...
- Stop trying to pawn that shit off on him.

312
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,099
Jimmy.

313
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,353
You know, Jimmy,
sometimes in our line of work...

314
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:13,483
...you can get so caught up
in the idea of winning...

315
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,693
...that you forget to listen to your heart.

316
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,783
Give Chuck my love, would you?

317
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:28,790
Oh, there you are. Betsy, Craig.

318
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:33,252
Hi.
Oh, Craig, you need your own purse.

319
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,422
- Did it work out?
- Yeah.

320
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,761
It was very nice.

321
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,430
- You look lovely today.
- Oh, thank you so much.

322
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,717
- Couldn't you just...?
- You know I can't.

323
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,426
Son of a bitch.

324
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:32,056
- You ground yourself?
- Yes, I grounded myself.

325
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,324
You gotta stop
putting bacon on the list.

326
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:35,328
That cooler's looking like
a trichinosis stew.

327
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,872
Perfect timing.

328
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,585
Professor Brans Vogelson?

329
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,295
University of Helsinki?

330
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,714
Yeah, you're gonna
have to get that translated.

331
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,592
- Into Swedish?
- Finnish.

332
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,512
Finish translating into...?

333
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,974
I'm sure there's someone at UNM
who can do that.

334
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,769
You do know I'm trying
to start a legal practice?

335
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,979
Vogelson's been working
on the effects...

336
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:05,441
...of electromagnetic fields
on zebrafish and...

337
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,069
Financial Times.

338
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,280
Yeah, I knew you missed it,
so I figured, what the heck?

339
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,076
Thank you. I know it's expensive here.

340
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,579
- That's not...
- I don't expect you to go out-of-pocket.

341
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,332
Go ahead, reimburse yourself.

342
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,419
Thanks.

343
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:29,173
Hey, Chuck,
can you not read that for a second?

344
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:31,342
Can we talk?

345
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,806
Are you all right? You look peaked.

346
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,641
I'm fine. Please, just sit.

347
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,645
You're not in trouble?

348
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,567
You gotta cash out.

349
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,237
- You gotta.
- Again? Really?

350
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,488
There's no other way.

351
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,908
I know that you don't wanna hear it,
but you've got to.

352
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,327
You know I'm going to beat this.

353
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,329
You know I'm going to get better.

354
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:02,832
Yeah, sure.

355
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,167
Well, then there's nothing more
to talk about.

356
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:11,340
I will beat this.
Ergo, a falsis principiis proficisci.

357
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,967
- Meaning...
- That's not...

358
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,594
- Meaning...
- That's the one about false principles...

359
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,513
You proceed from false principles.

360
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,474
Your argument is built on quicksand,
therefore it collapses.

361
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,268
Yeah, you're not listening.

362
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:27,440
Fine. Let's take this
to its logical conclusion.

363
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,234
In order to pay out my share...

364
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:33,154
...suppose my partners are forced
to liquidate the firm.

365
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,989
- Then what?
- That's their problem.

366
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,324
My clients are out in the cold.

367
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:41,871
My cases are scattered to the winds,
126 people lose their jobs.

368
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,123
What happens to your cronies
in the mailroom?

369
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,667
The assistants, paralegals,
the janitorial staff...

370
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,419
...all of them out on the street.

371
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,338
Your friend Kim, a promising career,
over and done with.

372
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:54,717
Hamlin owes you everything.
You built that place singlehandedly...

373
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,553
...while he was at Four Hills
working on his bunker shot.

374
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:01,140
- Let's not exaggerate. I helped.
- You helped.

375
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,644
All the more reason not to tear it down
just for a little bit of cash.

376
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,063
Chuck, I'm going under. Okay?

377
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,567
For the third time,
with these bull-crap contract counsel...

378
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,653
- Bull crap?
- Bull crap, pissant, PD cases...

379
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:15,905
...at 700 bucks a shot.

380
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,991
Public defender work is some
of the best experience there is.

381
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:22,870
I just had a case, Chuck,
with three clients.

382
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,956
Arraignment, voir dire, jury trial,
the whole nine yards.

383
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,709
You know what I took home?
Seven hundred bucks.

384
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:31,796
I might as well head down to skid row
and sell plasma.

385
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,632
You're representing people
who have nowhere else to turn.

386
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,050
Money is beside the point.

387
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,094
Money is not beside the point.
Money is the point.

388
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,598
I keep telling you, have patience.
There are no shortcuts.

389
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:46,101
- Do good work and the clients...
- The clients will come. Yeah, I know.

390
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,937
Okay.

391
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:54,318
Hand to God, I wasn't gonna say this,
but you are broke.

392
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:59,782
I can't carry both of us.
I've been trying like hell, but I can't.

393
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,578
You're saying, what,
you think you have to provide for me?

394
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,289
- I never asked you that.
- You didn't have to ask, okay?

395
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:11,252
I've been doing my damnedest,
but the day of reckoning is here.

396
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,754
Soon, Chuck,
you're gonna be out on the street...

397
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:18,050
...with all the electromagnetism
in the world raining down on you.

398
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,135
Now, please, please, picture that...

399
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,805
...then tell me
that money is beside the point.

400
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,808
- This is what has you all worked up?
- Yeah.

401
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,436
Jimmy, there's nothing to worry about.

402
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,481
- Here.
- What is this?

403
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,692
A stipend.
There's gonna be one every week.

404
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:38,279
Eight hundred and fifty seven dollars
from Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

405
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,239
I'm gonna pay him back. Every penny.

406
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,200
I didn't wanna take anything,
but Howard was very insistent.

407
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,077
And I'm gonna pay you back too.

408
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,456
- Hamlin was here?
- It's not like I'm a recluse.

409
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,127
- He put his cell phone in the mailbox?
- He understands the situation.

410
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,879
- He grounded himself?
- Of course.

411
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,798
And the two of you agreed that since,
as everybody knows...

412
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,675
...you're going back to work
any day now...

413
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,844
...the firm should help you
make ends meet?

414
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,138
That's correct, minus the sarcasm.

415
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,806
Hamlin's making you a chump.

416
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,142
I'm going to get better.

417
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:12,521
I'm gonna go back to work,
and I'm picking up where I left off.

418
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,421
Sorry.

419
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,049
Sorry, Chuck.

420
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,974
I understand that
you're trying to look out for me...

421
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,477
...but you're missing the bigger picture.

422
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,480
I got it.

423
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,857
Speaking of which...

424
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,320
Howard brought this.

425
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,322
- He's concerned.
- What?

426
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,866
You have to admit,
it could be confusing.

427
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,953
Hamlin Hamlin McGill. James M. McGill.

428
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:12,998
- That's my name, I was born with it. I...
- Still.

429
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,755
How about "Vanguard Law"?

430
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,132
Or "Gibraltar." Ple...

431
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:27,221
Wait, so I'm not supposed
to use my name on Hamlin's say-so?

432
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,889
What's he gonna do, sue me?

433
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,475
Nobody wants to create
an adversarial situation.

434
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:36,814
I'm sure Howard would gladly pay
the cost of new matchbooks and so on.

435
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:41,068
It's simply a matter
of professional courtesy.

436
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,573
Chuck, whose side are you on?

437
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,703
There are no sides.

438
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,330
But, Jimmy...

439
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,335
Wouldn't you rather
build your own identity?

440
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:02,131
Why ride on someone else's coattails?

441
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,062
You wanna dance, Howard?

442
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,025
Let's dance.

443
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,489
Yeah, backside on it.

444
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,496
Go.

445
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:41,086
You can get closer than that,
you bitch. Come on.

446
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,921
All right, here it comes.

447
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,675
There you go. Better.

448
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,180
- How was that?
- It's all right. Here, take a look.

449
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,808
- So tighter. Everything...
- Tighter? What...? Tighter what?

450
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,644
I don't know, just stand tighter.
You know what I mean?

451
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,313
I don't know what you mean.

452
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,357
That's a... We can call that
a stylistic choice, I guess.

453
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:06,278
Hey, fellas. We got business.

454
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,113
How did you find us?

455
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,242
I know. Eerie, right?

456
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:16,538
Whoa, come on. Give me 30 seconds.

457
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,793
Could be the most profitable
30 seconds of your lives.

458
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:33,055
Let me tell you about a young guy.

459
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:36,558
Actually, he's about your age.

460
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,894
He lived a long way from here...

461
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:43,357
...in a town called Cicero, Illinois.

462
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,361
And in Cicero, he was the man.

463
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,155
I mean,
when he strolled down the street...

464
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,741
...all the corner boys
would give him the high five.

465
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:56,495
All the finest babes
would smile at him...

466
00:40:56,704 --> 00:41:00,165
...and hope that he would smile back.

467
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,961
They called him Slippin' Jimmy...

468
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,757
...and everybody wanted
to be his friend.

469
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,343
Slippin' Jimmy.

470
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,304
What the hell kind of name is that?

471
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:18,350
Well, I'll tell you now.
Winters in Cicero are murder.

472
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,271
You guys, growing up out here
in the Golden West, you don't know.

473
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,984
Okay? I'm talking cold that'll freeze
the snot right in your nose.

474
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,944
I'm talking wind
that'll cut through your jacket...

475
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,113
...and carve you up like a Ginsu knife.

476
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,408
In fact, most folks in Cicero
were scared of winter.

477
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,702
But not Jimmy.

478
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,204
Jimmy would wait around all summer...

479
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,540
...and when September
finally rolled around...

480
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,377
...and he'd feel that first cold wind
come sweeping off Lake Michigan...

481
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:48,172
...he knew it was coming.

482
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,091
Was it Christmas? Was it Kwanzaa?

483
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:55,179
Better. It was slip-and-fall season.

484
00:41:56,097 --> 00:42:00,434
As soon as it was cold enough,
he'd find a nice, smooth patch of ice.

485
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,270
State Street was good,
Michigan Avenue was better.

486
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,523
He'd pick his spot,
wait for it to get busy...

487
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,568
...then he'd walk out on the ice
and boom.

488
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,069
He would biff it so hard...

489
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,031
...people would come running
from five blocks away.

490
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,657
Yeah, but did he collect?

491
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,744
"Did he collect?"
Slippin' Jimmy had it dialled in.

492
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,331
One good fall, he'd clear 6, 8 grand.

493
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,834
That'd keep him in Old Milwaukee
and Maui Waui right through Labor Day.

494
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,712
- Eight grand?
- Eight grand.

495
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:31,673
Now, see, I look at you guys,
I see potential.

496
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,968
The skateboard's a nice wrinkle,
that makes it a year-round gig.

497
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:38,305
Clearly, you know how
to take a header. Right?

498
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,015
But I gotta ask you...

499
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:43,852
...your best day ever,
how much did you clear?

500
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,316
- Six hundred and thirty.
- Six hundred and thirty.

501
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,278
Six hundred and thirty bucks?
Was that for one fall?

502
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:56,281
- Two.
- Two falls in one day?

503
00:42:56,866 --> 00:43:00,494
- Even at your age, that's gotta hurt.
- True that.

504
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,914
All right. Well, I got a job for you.

505
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,582
How's 2 grand sound?

506
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,168
Two grand for one hit?

507
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,087
One hit.

508
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,131
Plus you get to learn from the best.

509
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,260
- Nice boat.
- Yeah.

510
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,012
Discreet,
like a stripper pole in a mosque.

511
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:22,724
Forget the boat. Look at the car.
You know what that is?

512
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,102
- I don't know, a station wagon?
- It's a Mercury.

513
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,938
A 1988 Mercury Sable wagon.

514
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,524
Remember it. Burn it into your brains,
you got it?

515
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,068
It's a Mercury Sable wagon, sure.

516
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,779
Close your eyes. What colour is it?

517
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,030
- Brown.
- Brown.

518
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,949
No, it's medium sandalwood.

519
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,286
Keep your eyes closed.
How does the license plate start?

520
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:45,664
- Four.
- Give those gentlemen a gold star.

521
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,791
Betsy Kettleman's her name.

522
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:52,296
Every weekday between 2:25 and 2:50
she comes through here...

523
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,215
...on her way to pick up her kids
at Kit Carson Elementary.

524
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,801
You need a place where
she's gonna slow down, right?

525
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,554
- Yeah.
- All right. Well, there you go.

526
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,806
She slows down, she hangs a right...

527
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:06,435
...you come shooting out of there
and do what you did to me.

528
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,855
You go ass over teakettle,
you make it a blue-ribbon special.

529
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,525
When she gets out of the car,
you're suffering Saint Sebastian, right?

530
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:17,446
You're the hammer. You get in her face,
you scare the bejeezus out of her.

531
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,573
Give me your phone.

532
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,328
- It's kind of busy here, don't you think?
- Yeah. Witnesses are good.

533
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,121
Witnesses are pressure, all right?

534
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,874
Now, once you've got her
good and rattled...

535
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,377
...then you call for an ambulance,
but really you're calling for me.

536
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:35,339
I'm number one on your speed dial,
next to your weed dealer.

537
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:39,468
You call me, I hotfoot it over here.
I just "happened" to be driving by.

538
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,804
I stop to see what the trouble is,
and this is the important part...

539
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,308
...you don't know me.
We've never met. You got it?

540
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,642
- Sure.
- Okay.

541
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,896
Now, I'm Mrs. K's white knight.
We go mano a mano.

542
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,857
You light into me, okay? Get nasty.

543
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,109
No touching, leave the hair alone...

544
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,945
...but otherwise,
you know, open season.

545
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,156
Yell, stomp, call me a douche bag.

546
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,242
I'm gonna play it cool,
give you back some of the razzmatazz...

547
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:08,872
...and once she's seen the fireworks,
you fold like a lawn chair. Happy ending.

548
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,834
- When do we get our money?
- After.

549
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,337
- "After."
- After.

550
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,880
You get paid when I get paid.

551
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,132
I'm the rising tide
that raises all dinghies.

552
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,884
Now, pop quiz. What's the car?

553
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:23,428
- Mercury Sable wagon.
- Baby-poop brown.

554
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,472
- Okay, do you know me?
- No.

555
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,642
Damn straight. Go with God.

556
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:38,652
Well, I'm just glad
I happened to be passing by.

557
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,823
Happy to be of help, Betsy.
May I call you Betsy?

558
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,242
Please, call me James.

559
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,494
Oh, the kid will be fine. Don't worry.

560
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,205
He just got his bell rung a little.
I'll handle that.

561
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:51,957
Oh, no.

562
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:57,712
Oh, no, no. I wouldn't think
of taking your money for this, so...

563
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:03,718
The embezzlement case?
Yes, I'd be happy to talk it over.

564
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,388
Oh, shit.

565
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,858
Two-minute warning.
Two-minute warning.

566
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,734
Got it.

567
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,799
Oh, my God.

568
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,426
What happened?

569
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,012
Call 911.

570
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,264
Oh, my God. Cal. Cal.

571
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,850
Look at me. Are you okay?
Buddy, say something.

572
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,977
Cal, look at me. Come on already.

573
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,064
What is she doing in there?
She making a sandwich?

574
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,525
Where's her sense of responsibility?

575
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,528
- What?
- What?

576
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,363
Hey. What the...?

577
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:52,118
Funny to run into you, Betsy.
I was just strolling the neighbourhood.

578
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:55,664
You were in an accident? Oh, that's...

579
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,799
Come on.

580
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,184
- Yeah.
- She took off on us.

581
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,103
- She what?
- It was textbook, man.

582
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,355
We were diamonds.
But then she just took off.

583
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,315
Okay, wait. She hit and run?

584
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,901
That's what I'm saying.
She bailed and wailed.

585
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,487
Okay, just stay where you are.
I'll come get you.

586
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:29,948
No, no, no. Screw that, man.
We're following her.

587
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,200
You're... How are...?
You're following her how?

588
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,868
We got our ways, yo.

589
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,954
Okay, okay, okay.
New plan. New plan.

590
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,833
You do know me. I'm your lawyer.
You got that? I'll meet you at the school.

591
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,585
No, she's way past the school.

592
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:45,297
She hooked a left on Juan Tabo,
now she's coming into Holiday Park.

593
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:48,008
Okay, stay with her.
When she gets where she's going...

594
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:50,051
...wherever that is, don't do anything.

595
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,553
- Wait for me.
- Wait for what?

596
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,347
You haven't been right even once.
Slippin' Jimmy my ass.

597
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:58,893
You fell into the honeypot, kid.
You get it? Hit-and-run is a felony.

598
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:02,606
- So what?
- "So what?" So more money.

599
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,649
He says we fell in the honeypot.

600
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,569
- He says more money.
- So, what do we need him for?

601
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,201
Cal, Lars, whoever...

602
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,245
Oh, damn it.

603
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,081
Come on, come on.

604
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:24,961
- Do it, do it, do it.
- Son of a bitch.

605
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:28,214
Come on. Come on.

606
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,666
- Hey, your leg.
- Oh, I'm gonna do this one.

607
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,960
Okay. Hey. Hey. Yo, hold up.

608
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,171
Hey, yeah, you.
What is the matter with you?

609
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,632
- You hit and run.
- You ran him over.

610
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,717
You felonied my brother.

611
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,679
- Habla English.
- We call... We call la policia.

612
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:19,557
- La policia gonna be pissed.
- I see you hit him.

613
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,893
You see that windshield? You did that.

614
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,311
- I did that.
- You did that.

615
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,814
- You did that to me.
- Now you pay.

616
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,149
Make with the dinero.

617
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,860
Sí, righteous dinero.

618
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,743
- Okay.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

619
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,036
Okay.

620
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,788
Let's go.

621
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,916
- Is that money?
- Yeah.

622
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,669
Watch the step. Watch the step.

623
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,213
Watch it. Watch the step.

624
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,976
Where are you?

625
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,978
Holiday Park.

626
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:08,481
Mrs. Kettleman, Betsy,
what are you doing here?

627
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:11,025
Hit-and-run? That's very serious.

628
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,654
I can mediate.
I represent their parents, so...

629
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,240
Come on, come on.

630
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,616
Open up, officer of the court.

631
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,452
Open up in the name of the law.

632
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,539
Good afternoon, this...
