1
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,165
Once again...

2
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,961
...I do all the talking.

3
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,797
That's the only way this works.

4
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,891
Hand it over.

5
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,436
- Now, before that happens...
- Hand it over.

6
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,856
Hey, I've got it right here. Is this it?

7
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,192
I will take that as a yes.

8
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,154
Very well. Mystery solved.

9
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:15,241
I could take you into custody right now,
you son of a bitch. Both of you.

10
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:16,743
Where's this coming from?

11
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,871
You spilled the coffee,
you ambulance-chasing piece of shit.

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,624
Can we dial it down?
You know, just a notch?

13
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:27,837
Look, 45 minutes ago,
I'm sound asleep.

14
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,674
I get a call from Mr. Ehrmantraut,
he's concerned.

15
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:36,596
He's getting threatening voicemails
from you accusing him of petty theft.

16
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,390
I tell him,
"Hey, we're gonna nip this in the bud.

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,436
I don't care what the hell time it is,
we're gonna go talk this thing out.

18
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,940
And walking across the parking lot,
just now, boom, there's a notepad...

19
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,861
...plain as day, lying on the asphalt
where, I can only surmise...

20
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,530
...you accidentally dropped it, detective.

21
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,826
Now, guys, that's all we know.

22
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,291
Let me tell you something, slick.
Wait till I get you back to Philadelphia.

23
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:06,876
I'm confused.

24
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,755
The state of Pennsylvania can extradite
people for returning lost property?

25
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,466
That is one bold legislature.

26
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,220
Anything you wanna say to me
about what you found in here?

27
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,806
Now that it's all out in the open?

28
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:24,519
Maybe your daughter-in-law.
Maybe she's got something to tell me.

29
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,395
Maybe.

30
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,441
- Maybe not.
- Yeah, we'll see.

31
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,943
First thing tomorrow.

32
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,614
You gotta figure she wouldn't reach out
to us if she had nothing to say.

33
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:41,911
Hopefully whatever you are
didn't rub off on the rest of your family.

34
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,715
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

35
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,759
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- No.

36
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,387
I mean thanks as in "three's a crowd."

37
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,097
You can go now.

38
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,142
You're not talking to my client
without me.

39
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,019
Yeah, he is.

40
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,605
Please leave now.

41
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,119
Oh, man.

42
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,371
You ever have jet lag?

43
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,040
I guess that's what this is.

44
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,585
Maybe it's the altitude, man.

45
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,092
Could be the altitude.

46
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,678
We're a mile up, right?

47
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,060
Sorry about the kid.

48
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,855
He's young, looking to make his mark.

49
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,192
I like him.

50
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,407
Your daughter-in-law, what...?

51
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,826
What's she gonna tell us?

52
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,331
I don't honestly know.

53
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:16,172
Well, Mike, if she's got nothing to say,
this pretty well ends it here.

54
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,552
So maybe you should talk to her
before we do.

55
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,554
I talked.

56
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,935
If I were to guess,
I'd say she wouldn't tell you much.

57
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,232
Either way, that's up to her.

58
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,195
That's the least I owe her.

59
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,450
There's a lot of people we both know...

60
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,036
...that think Fensky
got what was coming to him.

61
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,955
Hoffman too.

62
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,124
That whole precinct was a sewer.

63
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,172
Wouldn't be surprised
if there's a few more early retirements.

64
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,676
Might be a good thing. New blood.

65
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,808
Like the kid.

66
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,644
Yeah.

67
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,522
He's all right.

68
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,275
He's just gotta learn, that's all.

69
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,947
Some rocks you don't turn over.

70
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,741
What'd you say to him? Let's go.

71
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,410
Word for word, verbatim,
while it's still fresh.

72
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,122
What I said is none of your concern.

73
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,166
I was speaking to a friend.

74
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,128
You were speaking to a homicide
detective who flew 2000 miles...

75
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:23,591
...to investigate a double murder for
which you are clearly the prime suspect.

76
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,720
How could you not recognise
the mind games, the scams...

77
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,680
...the con jobs these people play?

78
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,224
You used to be one of them.
So, what got said?

79
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:36,270
- Right now. Come on. I'm serious.
- I know you're trying to help, but...

80
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,899
Look, no, I'm trying to help me.
Those two Philly cheese steaks...

81
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,401
...they wanna lock me up
right alongside you.

82
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,196
So work with me here,
for the both of us.

83
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,198
You're safe, counsellor.

84
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,201
And I no longer require your services.

85
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,869
You're kidding, right?

86
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,455
What, you think you're gonna
defend yourself?

87
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,290
It's in someone else's hands.

88
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,876
- What, like God?
- No.

89
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,504
Please don't say
Hamlin Hamlin & McGill.

90
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:05,925
I appreciate your help.
Go home, go to bed, send me your bill.

91
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,427
Oh, I'm sending you my bill.

92
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,221
I'm sending you...

93
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,515
You better believe it.

94
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,490
It's me, your friendly
neighbourhood ice man.

95
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,617
There was a run on bacon.

96
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,911
I'll get you next time.

97
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,080
Chuck, you there?

98
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,291
Chuck.

99
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,462
Chuck?

100
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,343
Chuck, you up there?

101
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:50,886
Hello?

102
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,055
I'm out here.

103
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,100
Chuck?

104
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,317
- One-twelve, 113, 114...
- Holy shit, what are you doing?

105
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:12,283
...115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120.

106
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,202
Go, go. Inside.

107
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,165
What the hell was that?

108
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,044
- What the hell was that?
- Just give me a second.

109
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,632
Okay.

110
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,302
Yeah, okay.

111
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,053
It's an experiment, really.

112
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:38,100
I've been attempting to build up
a tolerance for electromagnetic fields.

113
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,935
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

114
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,395
Yeah, it's like...

115
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:46,859
You know, like taking small doses
of poison to build up an immunity.

116
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,696
Is that a real thing? Because that
does not sound like a real thing.

117
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,615
It's a real thing.

118
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:57,620
Anyway, as you well know,
there is a 60 kilovolt transformer...

119
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,040
...200 metres south-southwest
of my front yard.

120
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,250
I've been trying to get acclimated to it.

121
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,252
I got up to two minutes today.

122
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,129
- Jesus, Chuck.
- Yeah.

123
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,673
Two days ago,
I could barely stand 30 seconds.

124
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,468
I'm trying to get up to five minutes
by next week.

125
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,929
That is just...

126
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,556
- But why now?
- Well...

127
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:21,143
After what happened with the police
and the hospital...

128
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,938
...I almost lost everything, Jimmy.

129
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,357
I can't go on like this.

130
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,236
I have to find a way to get better.
I've got to.

131
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,862
I have to get back to work.

132
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,532
Sitting here rotting away...

133
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,410
This is no kind of life for me.
For anyone.

134
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,372
I need to be useful again.

135
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,710
Chuck, I am so proud of you.

136
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,423
It'll be a long process.

137
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,510
But one to which
I'm very much committed.

138
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,137
I have to be.

139
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:04,103
I... I'll be right back. I gotta get
a few more things out of the car.

140
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,604
All right.

141
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,913
- What's all this?
- It's just some case files.

142
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,208
I'm out of room at the office.
I don't wanna leave them in the car.

143
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,252
There's a lot of sensitive information.

144
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,963
You're not planning
to leave them here?

145
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,675
- Yeah, I don't know, Jimmy.
- It'll just be for a little while.

146
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,429
I'm practically sleeping on these things
back at my place.

147
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,515
- Business is that good?
- It's booming.

148
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,892
Streets of gold. Yeah.

149
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,853
I'll get these out of here
as quick as I can.

150
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,564
I just need to file the 413s
on some of these wills...

151
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,858
...and I'll be out of your hair.

152
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,111
- Four-thirteens?
- Personal property statements.

153
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,529
You mean 513s.

154
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,157
Yeah, sorry. I was
just working with these seniors.

155
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,118
Maybe the dementia's
contagious, huh?

156
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,915
So we good here?

157
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,168
See you tomorrow, same time.

158
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,664
James McGill.

159
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:52,002
Scott said he'd leave the keys to 801,
the suite that's for lease.

160
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,838
Here you go.
Bring them back when you're done.

161
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,298
Got it.

162
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,928
Wow, this is, like, really nice.

163
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:05,391
- Why do you sound surprised?
- Not surprised, no. Just...

164
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,351
You know, could you afford this?

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,648
Oh, yeah. Are you kidding?
The seniors have been very good to me.

166
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,985
I've been meaning to expand, you know?
It's time to invest in myself.

167
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,114
I figure this may be just the place.

168
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,450
Well, won't you miss the nail salon?

169
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,830
Oh, I could always visit, you know,
get some French tips.

170
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,800
It's a clean slate.

171
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,302
Put the reception desk right here.

172
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,930
Get some comfortable seating
for the clients.

173
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,766
It's big. A lot of offices.

174
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,935
Yeah, I like the openness.

175
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,396
I feel like I can breathe in here,
you know?

176
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:57,985
It's not some claustrophobic little closet
that smells like acetone.

177
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,571
Room to grow.

178
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,865
Dream big, I say.

179
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,453
Got a decent-size conference room.
Not as big as Hamlin's...

180
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,538
...but, you know, it's cosy.

181
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,332
Our elderly brethren prefer that, I find.

182
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,001
Yeah. Could be cosier though.

183
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,378
Maybe you could embroider
some little cushions.

184
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,798
- Crochet a runner for the table.
- Rocking chairs all around?

185
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:24,261
Yes. Make it look like the front
of a Cracker Barrel.

186
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,512
Now you're talking.

187
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,556
This is me.

188
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,685
I love it.

189
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,563
Gotta look successful
to be successful, am I right?

190
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,941
Well, this definitely looks like success.

191
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,361
Great view.
Get you a big fancy desk in here.

192
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,072
- Cocobolo desk.
- A what?

193
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,324
I don't know what it means...

194
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,951
...but I just like saying the word.
Cocobolo.

195
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,663
Okay, well, whatever it is,
you deserve it.

196
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,793
And I want you to see this one.

197
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,092
Here we are.

198
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,308
This is way better than the other one.

199
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,477
- You think?
- Yeah.

200
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,728
Who goes in here?

201
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,898
Because I'd be all up in here
if I were you.

202
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,777
Yeah. Yeah, you know, you're right.

203
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,363
- It is real nice.
- It's a corner office.

204
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,699
- You gotta go with the corner office.
- Saving it for someone.

205
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,243
- Who?
- Well, my partner.

206
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,620
Your partner? Who's...?

207
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,998
Who would that be?

208
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,878
Well, you said you were interested
in elder law.

209
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,965
That's... That is so...

210
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,426
Thank you. Really.

211
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,680
But you know I've got a lot invested
at HHM.

212
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,599
With what's going on now,
I'm closer than ever to partner.

213
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,018
Like maybe two years, and I'm in.

214
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,104
Yeah, I know.

215
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,147
Yeah, it's...

216
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,566
It's just a thought.

217
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:05,195
Plus, you know, they put me through
law school. I feel like I owe them.

218
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,532
Actually, I do owe them,
literally, you know?

219
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,493
But it's a nice thought, Jimmy.

220
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,871
Just, you know, playing with ideas.

221
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,625
- I had the extra office and everything.
- Yeah, no, I get it.

222
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,842
I want to see the kitchen.

223
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,184
They have stainless in here.

224
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,312
I don't even have stainless at home.

225
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,070
I know this is the last thing
you wanna hear.

226
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,031
I think your chances...

227
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,743
...of getting a favourable ruling
from a jury are very slim.

228
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:55,954
What does that mean?

229
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,498
We're not in a great position
to win at trial.

230
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,835
But we came to you people
because we were told you win cases.

231
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,671
Winning doesn't always mean
getting a favourable verdict.

232
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,549
We try to achieve the best outcome
for our clients...

233
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,676
...given each individual case.

234
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,513
Frankly, we've worked very hard
to stave off an arrest...

235
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:17,434
...after the misunderstanding
about your camping trip.

236
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,479
The DA was concerned
you might be a flight risk.

237
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,524
Flight risk? We were practically
in our own backyard.

238
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,526
That's exactly what we told the DA.

239
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,528
We've managed
to come up with a deal...

240
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,656
...that is favourable
under the circumstances.

241
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,575
Deal. I hate that terminology.
A deal is what they got O.J.

242
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,203
- Maybe we should hear it.
- It's a terrible term.

243
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,705
What kind of deal?

244
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,375
If the prosecution decides to file...

245
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,251
...which is the direction
this seems to be headed...

246
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,879
...and if they choose
to stack charges, Craig...

247
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,006
...you're looking at 30 years in prison.

248
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,342
- Thirty years?
- That's the maximum.

249
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,969
Given the nature of the charge
and political environment...

250
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,638
...I'd say we should expect it.

251
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:59,226
The public outcry in cases like these
is a big factor.

252
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,062
However, after much discussion
with the DA...

253
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,357
...who is also invested in keeping
the press to a minimum...

254
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,735
...we have arrived at an arrangement
which would include 16 months...

255
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,988
- ...in a county facility.
- Sixteen months?

256
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,992
Down from 30 years. And you most likely
wouldn't serve all of it.

257
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,662
But he would have to say he was guilty.

258
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,540
Admitting wrongdoing
and making the county whole again...

259
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,917
...goes a long way,
hence the minimal sentence.

260
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,961
Making the county whole again?

261
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,587
It includes the stipulation...

262
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,049
...that you return $1.6 million
in misappropriated funds.

263
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,093
- Give back the money?
- There is no money.

264
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,678
We told you Craig is innocent.

265
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,433
I understand.
However, I'd like to emphasise again...

266
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,186
...that this deal is Craig's best chance
of minimising jail time.

267
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:48,233
You're telling us there are drug dealers
and murderers walking the streets...

268
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,319
...but instead of them,
they wanna put an innocent man in jail?

269
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,196
There's no other way?

270
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,992
I'm sorry. I think under the
circumstances, this is your best option.

271
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:01,121
Murderers and rapists,
and this is how they...?

272
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,207
Okay. There is no money.
There never was.

273
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,752
- You have to take this to trial.
- Look...

274
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:12,424
...you have a difficult, but nevertheless
straightforward choice to make here.

275
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,470
- On one hand, you give up the money...
- I just told you, there is no money.

276
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,890
Plead guilty. It's painful, I know.

277
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:24,144
And go to jail for a year and a half.
But your other choice...

278
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,396
...that is no choice at all.

279
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:31,526
If you go to trial, you'll most likely lose,
and Craig goes to prison for decades.

280
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,865
Your children will grow up seeing
their dad through bars on visiting day.

281
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,535
I know what I'd do.

282
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,913
I'd take the deal.

283
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:49,461
Two years from now, you can be
starting over. It's tough, I know.

284
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,338
But you're tough people.

285
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,300
And your family is worth it.

286
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,640
Why don't I give you a few moments
to discuss this?

287
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,099
I know it's a big decision.

288
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,477
We don't need to discuss it.

289
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,230
You're fired.

290
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,859
How about we go to my office
and discuss this?

291
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,153
- There's a solution.
- That won't be necessary.

292
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,405
We will no longer be requiring
your services.

293
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,116
- It's not personal.
- If you're unhappy...

294
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,868
...there may be other directions.

295
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,954
We are done. Please stop following us.

296
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,290
Don't look back, honey.

297
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,918
Only look forward.
Always in life, look forward.

298
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,260
O-70. O-70.

299
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,929
Oh, yeah. Seventy's a good age.

300
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,933
All right, duck your heads,
because here comes another number.

301
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,644
N-32.

302
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:52,148
And the action never stops.
I hope you all took your heart pills...

303
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,901
...because it's almost
too much excitement, right?

304
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,112
Which one will it be?

305
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,197
Say your prayers, here it comes.

306
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,617
All right. We've got G-48.

307
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,912
G, as in Guy Lombardo. G-48.

308
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,459
Keep your elbows to yourselves, okay?
No bodychecking.

309
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,213
All right, what do we have here?
Wait for it.

310
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,548
B-6.

311
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:21,344
Lucky B-6. Just like the vitamin.
All right?

312
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,765
Which you should be taking.
Keep things moving in the old GI tract.

313
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,142
Bingo.

314
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,769
Oh, we have a winner.

315
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,105
Lady Luck has struck again.

316
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,941
Let's see a hand,
so we know who's won.

317
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,736
It's the lovely young lady in the back.

318
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,155
Congratulations, miss, you've won a...

319
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,908
- What do we have for the lovely lady?
- A notebook.

320
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,660
Yeah, it's an adorable notebook.

321
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,746
Do you like cats, Miss...?

322
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,956
Irene. I love kitties.

323
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,960
I have two Siamese cats,
Oscar and Felix.

324
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,297
Felix can wash himself. Oscar won't.

325
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,507
He... He just won't.

326
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,677
What a lovely story. Thank you.

327
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,514
Can you take that to Irene,
and when you come back, cover...?

328
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:10,727
I'm gonna take a short break,
because somebody needs legal help.

329
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:22,781
Offices of James McGill, Esquire.
How may I direct your call?

330
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,453
Yes, yes, of course.
One moment, please.

331
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,333
- Déjà vu, hello again. Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

332
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,377
So how may I be of service?

333
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:39,756
We would like to hire you
as our attorney, Mr. McGill.

334
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,803
- Really?
- However, we have certain conditions.

335
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,513
And these are not up for debate.

336
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,181
We want no jail time. Zero.

337
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,850
Craig is innocent
and we expect you to prove that.

338
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,478
We won't see his name smeared
like this any longer.

339
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,605
Can we back up just a scootch?

340
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:59,109
Because last time we spoke,
you were very enthusiastic...

341
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,111
You were positively insistent.

342
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,530
About being represented by HHM.

343
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,157
- Well...
- That's all right.

344
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,910
We've parted ways.

345
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,663
May I ask why?

346
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:16,626
We disagreed
with their defence strategy.

347
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,128
Okay.

348
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,505
They treated us like we were guilty.

349
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,051
So your previous objections
to my representing you are now...?

350
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:29,556
Oh, I'm sorry about my bluntness
at our last encounter.

351
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,932
Unfortunate.

352
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,518
Yeah, we really...
We're very sorry about that.

353
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,730
We thought long and hard
about it, and we...

354
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:42,235
You know, given your passion
and your can-do attitude, we really...

355
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,362
We just believe you're the lawyer for us.

356
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:45,989
For us, yes.

357
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,535
Well, as flattered as I am by this,
since we last spoke...

358
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,871
...I've changed
my area of specialization.

359
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,540
So I concentrate on elder law now.

360
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,043
But, I mean,
you said that you would fight for us.

361
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,753
- Yeah, you...
- You were adamant.

362
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,338
You promised to get us
a not-guilty verdict.

363
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,466
I don't think I exactly promised that.

364
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,510
You said we would be Client Number 1,
morning, noon or night.

365
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,637
Yes, and I meant what I said.
At the time.

366
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,848
But times change.

367
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,061
But we've already paid you a retainer.

368
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,315
Right.

369
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,649
A retainer.

370
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:26,154
That is what you called it.
That was your specific terminology.

371
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,365
Could you excuse me for a moment?

372
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:33,411
I had a Big Gulp on the way over.

373
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,255
- Hey.
- Hey there.

374
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:50,011
Funny story. I found something
that belongs to you. Again.

375
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:51,888
- Yeah? What?
- Who?

376
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:55,433
Picture The 25th Hour
starring Ned and Maude Flanders.

377
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,769
Oh, Christ, the Kettlemans?

378
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,772
You lose any other clients today?
Yeah.

379
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,066
Mr. and Mrs. Cuckoo-Bananas
just offered me...

380
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,943
...the plum job of defending them.

381
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,195
- They came to you?
- Yeah, I know.

382
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,905
I don't know what you did
to piss them off...

383
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,698
...but it must have been good.

384
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,617
- What did they tell you?
- Not much.

385
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:17,288
Just that you treated them
like they were guilty.

386
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,665
Jesus.

387
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,917
Look, Jimmy...

388
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,710
...I know...

389
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,295
I know this is a lot to ask...

390
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,923
...but you have to convince them
to come back to HHM.

391
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,050
- I do, huh?
- Yes.

392
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,885
Please. It's important.

393
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,263
- What's it worth to you?
- Jimmy, I'm serious.

394
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,599
They left because they think
they can win this case, but they can't.

395
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,019
I managed to scrape together,
from practically nothing, I might add...

396
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,021
...a deal they should feel lucky to have.

397
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,774
This is their absolute best bet.

398
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,485
Please?

399
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:51,030
Make them understand
it's better for them if they come back.

400
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,075
Tell me about this deal.

401
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:55,743
Elder law?

402
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,454
- I don't know what that is.
- Yeah. Me neither.

403
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,166
Elder...

404
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,376
- Do you think...
- Maybe if we were old...

405
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,420
Sorry.

406
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,339
- The mysteries of the bladder.
- Right?

407
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:13,094
So how do we get started?
Do you need us to sign that little paper?

408
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:17,056
I am... I am very sorry,
but I'm afraid I can't take your case.

409
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:21,102
My schedule is just...
It's just chock-full right now.

410
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,813
I highly encourage you
to go back to HHM.

411
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,316
I'm certain they would welcome you
with open arms.

412
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,861
No, we're not going back there.
They were...

413
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,237
...incompatible.

414
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,115
I understand. They asked you
to face some harsh realities.

415
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,367
And I get it. No one likes that.

416
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:40,747
But bottom line here,
Kim Wexler is a fine attorney.

417
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,041
She has a great relationship
with the DA.

418
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,668
Much as I'd love
to sing my own praises...

419
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:49,547
...I doubt I could get you a deal
as good as the one she already has.

420
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,967
Okay. We don't want a deal.

421
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,137
We want you, our lawyer,
to exonerate Craig.

422
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:59,891
Exonerate? That is a big word,
particularly in your case.

423
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,393
But there will be no deal.

424
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,271
There is no money
with which to make a deal.

425
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,613
Can we all three just parachute down
from Cloud Cuckooland?

426
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,950
Because we know without question
there is money.

427
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,246
I distinctly remember a spirited game
of tug-of-war over this money...

428
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,831
...money which we then discussed
at length.

429
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,166
You made many excuses...

430
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,168
...justifying your possession
of said money.

431
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,671
- It's there. It exists...
- But that...

432
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,632
Just, please, for my own sanity...

433
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,926
You can't hide
a big bag of cash forever...

434
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,929
...and you certainly will never be able
to spend any of it.

435
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:42,141
So go back to HHM,
apologise to Ms. Wexler...

436
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,478
...and for chrissakes, take the deal.

437
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,565
- If there were any money...
- Lady, enough.

438
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,278
If there were any money...

439
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,322
...there would have to be
a full accounting of it.

440
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,909
Every penny would have to be present.

441
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,162
Every single penny.

442
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,581
You understand?

443
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,042
All of it.

444
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,879
- That includes the 30,000...
- Craig, yes, he gets it.

445
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,673
Yeah, he gets it.

446
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:18,177
We are in this together, Mr. McGill,
come what may.

447
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,057
Now, where do we begin?

448
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,876
- There you go. Kettleman. That's all of it.
- Where's Kim?

449
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,878
Oh, we moved her over
to the east wing.

450
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,672
The east wing? That's the cornfield.

451
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,133
Why are you sending her
to the cornfield, Howard?

452
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:01,054
- Never heard it called that before.
- Well, that's what you call it.

453
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,307
You're gonna punish her because
you lost those batshit Kettlemans?

454
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,186
You notice I'm not exactly crowing
over how I snaked them away from you.

455
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,437
Here are your files.

456
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,940
I'm not gonna discuss
my employee policies with you.

457
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,735
I'm gonna need some help here.

458
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,738
Yeah. You sure are.

459
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,486
That prick firing you?

460
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:03,074
Best-case scenario is my two-year plan
just became a ten-year plan.

461
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,576
That schmuck.
You didn't do anything wrong.

462
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,496
- I lost the client.
- Not your fault.

463
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,999
They're not really playing
with a full deck, those Kettlemans.

464
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,420
- You had to take their case?
- I'm sorry, okay? I tried.

465
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,672
I really did.

466
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,924
I'm not being fair. Of course you tried.

467
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,427
They'll do what they wanna do.

468
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,807
Hope you didn't promise them
too much.

469
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,642
I doubt you'll be able to do
more for them...

470
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,144
...than we were offering.

471
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,521
You think very highly of my skills,
obviously.

472
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,566
It's not that, Jimmy. It's a loser case.

473
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,402
That deal was their best chance.

474
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,948
After I worked my ass off
finagling with the DA, it's just, like...

475
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,200
- Whatever.
- There's gotta be a way, you know?

476
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,036
- I take it to court...
- You'll lose.

477
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,457
Kettleman did a terrible job
covering his tracks.

478
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,708
For starters...

479
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,210
...they've got reams of cheques
he wrote for false expenses.

480
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,921
I can't even challenge
their admission into evidence...

481
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,382
...because he wrote them to himself.

482
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,594
We're never supposed to say
our clients are guilty...

483
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,345
...but hey,
not my client anymore.

484
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,680
He's guilty as sin.

485
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,766
Yeah, but there has to be something.
Some loophole or...

486
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,477
None that I could find.

487
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,397
- There has to be a way.
- Not without the money.

488
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,609
It's the only chip those Kettlemans have.
They refuse to play it.

489
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:07,985
In the top of the second inning.
First pitch...

490
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:11,572
...curveball for a strike.
The count is 0-and-1.

491
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,311
Is made. Rennings throws...

492
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:46,691
...and it is a liner toward the gap
in right-centre field.

493
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,168
Jesus.

494
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,254
Gets bigger every time I look at it.

495
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:41,216
Thanks for not heading
to the Bahamas with this.

496
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,536
What are you doing?

497
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,665
"The right thing."

498
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,669
You know where you're going?

499
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,379
Yeah.

500
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,762
Am I correct in assuming
we're now square?

501
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,681
Square.

502
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,323
- Good morning.
- Who is it, Craig?

503
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,035
Oh, it's Mr. McGill.
Good morning. Come on in.

504
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,586
Oh, I love what you've done
with the place.

505
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,047
Last time I was here, it was...

506
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:06,468
...well, not a contender for the cover
of Good Housekeeping, that's for sure.

507
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:10,889
- Do you have news about our case?
- I do, in fact.

508
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,852
But before we get to the nitty-gritty,
I think we should chat about your deal.

509
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,105
We told you, there will be no deal.

510
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,649
You did, didn't you?

511
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,360
However,
circumstances have changed.

512
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,154
What circumstances?

513
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,032
To answer that, might I suggest...

514
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,076
...that you go check on that money
you insist you didn't take?

515
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:36,415
In the upstairs bathroom,
under the sink?

516
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,251
Wait. How could you...?

517
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,007
Betsy?

518
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,396
- No, no, no.
- It's okay. It's okay, Betsy.

519
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:02,524
It's gotta be...
It's gotta be in there somewhere.

520
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,114
What did you do with it?

521
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,908
By "it," you mean...?

522
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,744
Where is it?

523
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,080
You mean the money.

524
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,331
Let me see.

525
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,126
It's on its way to the DA's desk
right about now.

526
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,879
What? You...?

527
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,423
- You thief.
- Takes one to know one, doesn't it?

528
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,717
You took it? How did you take it?

529
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,053
A good magician
never reveals his secrets.

530
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,971
Now, here's what we're gonna do.

531
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,642
Oh, you don't tell us what to do.
You stole from us. We...

532
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,060
We will have you arrested.

533
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,397
I can see how upset you are...

534
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:47,069
...and even on a good day,
you and logic are:

535
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,987
But think about what you just said.

536
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,281
Criminals have no recourse,
and you two?

537
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,909
- You're criminals. Big time.
- How dare you?

538
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,871
Luckily, you have a very talented lawyer
who has found a way...

539
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,958
...to minimise the damage
you've brought upon yourselves.

540
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,044
- Oh, you're fired.
- Oh, I quit already.

541
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,796
No, I'm talking about Kim Wexler.

542
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,631
Now, you're gonna go back to her...

543
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:11,051
...apologise for your hasty decision
to terminate her services...

544
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,887
...and you're gonna fall on her mercy
and take that deal.

545
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:17,933
- We'll tell about the bribe you took.
- You could do that.

546
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,979
You absolutely could,
and I'd be in a mess of trouble...

547
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,939
...a real pickle.

548
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,151
But so would you, Mrs. Kettleman.

549
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,862
Because right now only Mr. Kettleman
is on the hook...

550
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,114
...for the whole embezzlement kerfuffle.

551
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,117
But the bribe...
We're back to calling it a bribe?

552
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,411
Yeah, that implicates you as well.

553
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,830
It does not. It was all me.

554
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,791
No, it wasn't.
I'll make sure everyone knows that.

555
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,962
Look on the bright side, you know?

556
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:51,758
They could work out some kind
of inter-prison visitation programme.

557
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:55,012
The occasional conjugal.
Maybe it won't be all bad.

558
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,891
You, you'll probably wind up
running your own gang.

559
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,102
Thing you folks need to know
about me?

560
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,771
I got nothing to lose.

561
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,858
Christ, you should see my office.

562
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,697
No, it's not over.

563
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,574
Let's find another lawyer.

564
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,535
- Oh, Betsy.
- No, no. No.

565
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,871
We don't have to put up with this.

566
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,208
- I will not be treated this way.
- Betsy.

567
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,585
The kids.

568
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,676
We have to do this for the kids.

569
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,304
They can't lose us both.

570
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,894
- We have to.
- No.

571
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,982
It's okay.

572
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,028
It's okay.

573
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,215
Thank you.

574
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:17,357
Law offices of James M. McGill.
How may I direct your call?
