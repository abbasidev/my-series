1
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,477
Jesus.

2
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,937
It can't be done.

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,064
You sure about that?

4
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,608
There's a trick, huh?

5
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:29,278
There's gotta be. This guy wouldn't
put money on it unless there's a trick.

6
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,532
I'm telling you, it can't be done.

7
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,409
So you give up?

8
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,454
Yeah. All right.

9
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,876
Let's see it.

10
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,634
- Wait, what?
- No way.

11
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,055
- Show me that again.
- Sure. You got another 20?

12
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,058
Screw this.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,853
Don't go away mad.

14
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,897
Oh, hey, guys.
You wanna buy a Rolex?

15
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:08,025
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
How much for that cheap piece of crap?

16
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,986
- Look what the wind blew in.
- Hey.

17
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,407
Holy crap. Jimmy, my man.
I said you would beat the rap.

18
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,701
- Hey, Merna. Set him up.
- No thanks. I'm good.

19
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,787
No, go on. He don't mean it.
You just got out of jail. Come on.

20
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,123
You're not gonna have a drink?
That'll be the day.

21
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,042
Settle down. I'm in a rush.
My brother's outside in a taxi.

22
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,295
- The meter's running.
- What, Chuck's outside?

23
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,465
Tell him to pull that broomstick
out of his ass and get in here.

24
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,633
No. We got no time.
We're catching a plane.

25
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,427
I came here to say goodbye.

26
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm moving to Albuquerque,
New Mexico.

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,432
Mexico? You skip bail?

28
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,186
New Mexico. You know, like Bugs Bunny
and the Road Runner.

29
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,229
Okay, yeah.
What are you gonna do there?

30
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,025
I'm gonna work at his law firm,
like in the mailroom. To start, anyways.

31
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:53,112
Now you're talking crazy. You just got
out of jail. Now you wanna go back?

32
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,490
- Working for him, that's all that is.
- Marco.

33
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,952
I was done, you understand?
I didn't beat the rap.

34
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:04,248
Chuck flew in and saved my ass.
It's time to make some changes.

35
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,627
Hey. Listen to me.
You're Slippin' Jimmy.

36
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,378
What do you got to change, huh?

37
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,048
Everything. It's time to grow up.

38
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:16,177
- Yeah, according to who? Chuck?
- The same goes for you, man.

39
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,555
You want to spend the rest
of your life on that stool?

40
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,350
I mean, come on, Marco.
Look at yourself.

41
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,020
All right, that's him. I gotta hit it.

42
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,398
- Jeez. His master's voice.
- Really?

43
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:33,569
Come on. Go outside. Tell Chuckles
that you got some business you forgot.

44
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,821
- Marco.
- Come on.

45
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,031
You gotta have one last blowout.

46
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,825
We'll do the watch thing again.

47
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,245
But maybe we'll pull that tar-money
scam you were talking about.

48
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,496
Get some girls.

49
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,748
- I made a promise.
- Yeah, you made a promise.

50
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,042
But it was... What do you call it?
under duress.

51
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:52,296
Look, he got you out of jail, okay?
But he's your brother.

52
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,591
- I mean, what else is he gonna do?
- Marco. Listen to me, all right?

53
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,218
Chuck's not making me do this.

54
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,680
He's giving me an opportunity
and I'm grabbing it.

55
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,810
Gee, it's like watching Miles Davis
give up the trumpet.

56
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,104
What? What does that even mean?

57
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,190
It's just a waste, is all I'm saying.

58
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,443
Look, I'm gonna fly out there.
I'm gonna get settled.

59
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,946
And I'll call you, okay?

60
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,031
All right, Jimmy.

61
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,827
Hey, have a safe flight, all right?

62
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,679
Hey.

63
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,514
Hey.

64
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,725
What's up?

65
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,770
Just waiting to talk to Howard.

66
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,397
Can I ask about what?

67
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:39,111
I'm taking your advice.
I'm giving the case to HHM.

68
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,738
Why?

69
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,699
The fact
that Chuck doesn't want me here...

70
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,660
...has something to do with it.

71
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,289
I'm so sorry.

72
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,543
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- I just...

73
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,965
I didn't want you hating
your own brother.

74
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,597
How'd you find out? Did Kim tell you?

75
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,308
I figured it out on my own.

76
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,560
It's about time, right?

77
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,232
I brought the Sandpiper stuff with me.
It's down in my car.

78
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,985
I figure your guys
could do the outreach.

79
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,570
If any of those geezers
don't wanna sign with you...

80
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,490
...just give me their names,
I'll talk them into it.

81
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:29,286
You know, Jimmy,
I never wanted it to go this way.

82
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,624
- If it had been up to me, we would have...
- Howard, I get it.

83
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,712
Your brother's very important
to the firm.

84
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,131
Sorry I called you a pig fucker.

85
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,133
Well...

86
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,095
We owe you some money, don't we?

87
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,597
The of-counsel fee.

88
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,059
I think we discussed 20,000.

89
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,937
That and whatever the common-fund
proceeds of Sandpiper...

90
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,773
...ultimately adds up to,
you'll receive 20 percent of that.

91
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,317
Should be a very nice payday for you
when it comes.

92
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,569
Yep.

93
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,864
I've got something for you too.

94
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,700
It's a shopping list for Chuck.

95
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,619
He's doing better,
but he still needs deliveries every day.

96
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,956
I think he'd be more comfortable
with someone else doing it.

97
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,416
I see.

98
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,003
You don't have to do it personally.
It just needs to get done.

99
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,339
It's pretty straightforward.
The ice is a pain in the ass.

100
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:26,802
But he needs it. I usually sneak
into a motel and fill a garbage bag.

101
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,890
But you can have whoever you hire
just buy it.

102
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,309
Most important thing
is the newspapers.

103
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,353
The New York Times.
The Wall Street Journal. They're a must.

104
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,774
There's a newsstand on Eubank
that has both of them at 6 a.m.

105
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,444
Which is good. He's an early riser.
The Albuquerque Journal gets delivered.

106
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,821
But somebody still has to bring it in
for him.

107
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,741
You've been doing all of this
every day?

108
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,786
For over a year?

109
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,207
- You'll take care of this?
- Absolutely.

110
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,334
I'll get it done and done right.

111
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,174
I always liked you, Jimmy.

112
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,637
Remember?
I used to call you Charlie Hustle.

113
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,098
Yeah, I remember that.

114
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,154
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

115
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,165
That was nice.

116
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,292
You sure you're all right?

117
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,004
- It's not a crime to let it out.
- There's nothing to let out.

118
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,382
Chuck's a sick man.

119
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,425
That's no excuse.

120
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,595
He's my brother.
He thinks I'm a scumbag.

121
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,348
There's nothing I can do
to change that.

122
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,809
What else is there to say?

123
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,062
Wow, that's mature.

124
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,565
Dalai Lama's got nothing on me.

125
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:20,416
O-64. As in "Oh, to be 64 again."

126
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,918
O-64.

127
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:28,924
All right. Next up, we got N-32.

128
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:34,638
N as in "Nancy Reagan,"
First Lady with a lot of style.

129
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,057
Anybody else seen
Hellcats of the Navy?

130
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,853
All right. No winners yet?

131
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:45,566
Okay. Here's B-2.

132
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,485
Just like the B-2 bomber,
the Stealth.

133
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,405
Probably one taking off
over at Kirtland right now.

134
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:55,326
We would never know
because it's stealthy.

135
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,661
Still no winners?

136
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,913
No?

137
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,999
Here we have...

138
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,921
...B-4. Another B.
How about that. As in:

139
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,425
"Before too long,
we're gonna have another winner."

140
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,054
No? Nobody? Okay.

141
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,098
All right.

142
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,100
And here comes...

143
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:27,733
Hey, it's our old friend B. B-12.

144
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,739
B as in...

145
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,242
B as in...

146
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,036
..."betrayal."

147
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:44,083
Benedict Arnold
betrayed the United States.

148
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,795
Still no winners?

149
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,672
No?

150
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,340
Okay.

151
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,634
Here it is.

152
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,057
Oh, what are the odds?

153
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,519
Four B's in a row. That's...

154
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,939
B-7.

155
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,900
B as in...

156
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,654
B as in...

157
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,572
..."brother."

158
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,658
Brother.

159
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,746
B-7. Seven brides for seven brothers.

160
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,292
I'm sure a lot of you have brothers.
It's not like mine though.

161
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:31,255
Any winners yet?
Take another look, okay? I'll wait.

162
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,843
I'm gonna say if it's another B,
we could have a real problem here.

163
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,810
And...

164
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,480
Hey, it is another B.

165
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,067
B-5, as in:

166
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:56,530
"Boy, this B thing is really
starting to tick me off."

167
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,201
B as in "battleship."
B as in "bourbon." B as in "Belize."

168
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,163
Beautiful place, so I've heard.

169
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:09,626
I would love to go there, but let's face it,
that's never gonna happen.

170
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:14,048
None of us is ever leaving
this godforsaken wasteland.

171
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,346
Sorry.

172
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,514
Scratch that.

173
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:23,974
Moving on?

174
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,145
I mean, what is it with this place?

175
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,981
It's like living
inside an Easy Bake Oven.

176
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,566
I mean, look out that window.

177
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:37,363
It's like a soulless, radioactive
Georgia O'Keeffe hellscape out there...

178
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,240
...crawling with coral snakes
and scorpions, and...

179
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,244
You ever see the movie
The Hills Have Eyes? It's a documentary.

180
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,040
God forbid, your car breaks down,
you have to walk 10 steps.

181
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,586
You have melanoma the size of a
pineapple where your head used to be.

182
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:59,593
So you ask, "Why?" Why, if that's
how I feel, why do I live here? Why?

183
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,929
Excuse me.

184
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:06,767
- Are you gonna read that number?
- Yeah. I'm gonna read your number.

185
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,186
It's another B.

186
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:16,193
It's another freaking B.
Of course. Why not? Why not?

187
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,406
And the next number...

188
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,666
Quick question. Who here knows
what a Chicago Sunroof is?

189
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:35,129
Anybody? You, sir? No? Okay.

190
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:39,508
True story. Back home,
there was this guy named Chet.

191
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,094
Now, Chet was a real asshole.

192
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:47,558
He might have owed me some money.
He might have slept with my wife...

193
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,687
...before she became my ex-wife.
The details don't matter.

194
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,649
Suffice it to say, I was wronged.

195
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,193
All right. So one summer evening...

196
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,697
...I was out having a few drinks,
one or two, maybe three.

197
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:06,994
You get the picture.
And who do I see? Chet.

198
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,581
He drove up and he double-parked
outside a Dairy Queen...

199
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,417
...and went in to get some soft serve.
Now, Chet drove...

200
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,169
And this will give you an idea...

201
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,880
...of exactly what kind
of a douche bag this guy was.

202
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:23,552
Drove a white pearlescent BMW 7 Series
with white leather interior.

203
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,974
So I saw that thing
and I had had a few, like I said.

204
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,101
And...

205
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,564
...I climbed up top and I may have...

206
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,194
...defecated...

207
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,696
...through the sunroof.

208
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,666
Not my finest hour, I'll grant you that.

209
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,254
But that's what a Chicago Sunroof is.
Now you know.

210
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:03,008
It's a real thing. I didn't make it up.

211
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:07,137
I'm not the first person to do it.
There's a name for it.

212
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:12,100
Guy wanted some soft serve,
I gave him some soft serve.

213
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:17,064
I did not know that his children
were in the backseat.

214
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:21,944
There was a level of tint on the windows
that I'll maintain to this day...

215
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:25,739
...was not legal
in an Illinois licensed vehicle.

216
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,951
But somehow, that's on me, I guess.

217
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,788
Who leaves two Cub Scouts...

218
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,458
...in a double-parked car
with the engine running?

219
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,335
Come on.

220
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:44,508
Now, Chet was connected, see?
Like Cicero, connected.

221
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,553
So usually I'd be looking
at malicious mischief...

222
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:51,014
...public intoxication,
disorderly conduct, maybe.

223
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,227
But he's got the DA saying
indecent exposure.

224
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,563
Calling me a sex offender. What?

225
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:02,985
One little Chicago Sunroof,
and suddenly I'm Charles Manson?

226
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,154
And that's where it all went off the rails.

227
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:11,118
I've been paying for it ever since.
That's why I'm here.

228
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,498
I don't...

229
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,088
You know what?

230
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,134
Any of this stuff you want, come get it.

231
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,971
Kitty-cat notebooks for everybody.

232
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,129
- What can I get you?
- Old Style.

233
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,341
- Make it two.
- You got it.

234
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,052
- What happened to Merna?
- Merna?

235
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,138
She's doing all right.
She's my stepmom.

236
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,557
She don't come in much anymore.

237
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,645
Tell her Slippin' Jimmy says hello.

238
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,231
- Slippin' Jimmy?
- She'll know.

239
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,526
I'll tell her. That'll be 5.50.

240
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,343
Marco.

241
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,680
You gorgeous hunk of a man.

242
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,225
How long will you keep me waiting?

243
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,354
Wake up, you fat son of a bitch.

244
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,982
Bought you a beer.

245
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,068
Jimmy?

246
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,945
In the flesh.

247
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,823
- Come here.
- Hey.

248
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,034
So I'm not dark enough for you, huh?

249
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,079
No, I'm just saying,
I don't see any colour.

250
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,749
I mean, 10 years in a desert,
you should look like...

251
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,877
...Anthony Quinn
in Lawrence of Arabia.

252
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,963
"Turks,
they paid me in golden treasure."

253
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,842
"Yet, I am poor.
Because I am a river to my people."

254
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,553
Hey, I'm Irish, okay?

255
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,181
I spend my time staying out of the sun.

256
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,476
Speaking of pale sons of bitches,
how's your brother doing?

257
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,394
Chuck's fine.

258
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,938
Still working for him?

259
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,441
Sometimes.

260
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,653
What about you? I mean,
besides falling asleep on a bar...

261
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,406
...at 4:00 on a Wednesday afternoon.

262
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:42,579
- Lake Michigan Standpipe? What's that?
- My brother-in-law owns the company.

263
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,164
Hold it. You got married?

264
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,917
No. No. No.
My sister Angie's husband.

265
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,545
- So, what the hell's a standpipe?
- You know what a standpipe is.

266
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,839
- I don't think so.
- The fire department comes.

267
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,549
Stick one end of the hose
on the hydrant...

268
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,176
...the other on the standpipe.

269
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,804
Water goes out the standpipe,
through the sprinklers.

270
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,556
And then douses the flames.
It's important stuff.

271
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,018
- So that's what a standpipe is, huh?
- Well, it's a dry standpipe.

272
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,980
- There's also the wet standpipe.
- What's the difference?

273
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,192
I don't know if I could explain it
to a layman.

274
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,449
Excuse me. How's your mom?

275
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,662
She passed away
about three years ago.

276
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,749
That's too bad. A great lady.

277
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,584
- Yeah.
- From Wisconsin, right?

278
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,211
Yeah.

279
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,421
The funeral out there?

280
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,508
No, it was here.

281
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,760
Here?

282
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,598
Yeah, well, we were only
in town for a few days, so...

283
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,687
You're in town, you didn't look me up?

284
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,481
Chuck was in the middle
of a big case.

285
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,442
And we couldn't stay around. So...

286
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,199
- Can I get you guys anything else?
- I'm good. Want anything?

287
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,327
Your change here for you.

288
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,123
- Hey.
- Thank you.

289
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,760
How's my Cutlass running?

290
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,679
Gets me around.

291
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,348
Well, it's a classic.

292
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,853
A little bodywork, a paint job,
really be something.

293
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,775
So, what you gonna do
while you're here?

294
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,570
I don't know.
See the sights, you know?

295
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,489
Catch a Cubbies game
from the bleachers.

296
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,034
Get a hot dog at Henry's.

297
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,080
Yeah.

298
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,918
All right.

299
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,796
I'm gonna see them tomorrow.

300
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,174
Yeah, both of them.

301
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,259
Okay.

302
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,595
Okay. Bye.

303
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,263
Is he a regular?

304
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,599
No.

305
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,313
You're buying. I'm selling.

306
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,027
All right, then.

307
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,579
All I'm asking is that you take a look.

308
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,375
I'm sorry, buddy. No offence. I'm just...
You know, I'm not interested.

309
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,626
Come on, man.

310
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,088
What's it gonna hurt to take a look?
It'll take you two seconds.

311
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:43,802
All right. All right.
Show me what you got.

312
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,806
Boom.

313
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,767
Okay.

314
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,311
You see it?

315
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,939
I see a Kennedy half-dollar.

316
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,899
Which way is he facing?

317
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,443
JFK is facing left.

318
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,071
Exactly.

319
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,950
Which way is he supposed
to be facing?

320
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,578
Right. He's supposed
to be facing right.

321
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:14,207
Okay. So why is this one facing left?

322
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,795
November 22nd, 1963.

323
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,131
Kennedy is assassinated, right?

324
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,299
The whole nation goes into mourning.

325
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,927
They start naming everything
in sight after him.

326
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,887
The mint wants in on the act.

327
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,974
So in '64, they decide
to change the Lincoln half-dollar...

328
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,851
...into the Kennedy half-dollar.

329
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,730
When they design it, they put
Kennedy facing right, facing east.

330
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,691
Just the way they had Lincoln.
You know why?

331
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,484
East symbolizes the dawn.

332
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,320
That's why pretty much every grave
everywhere faces east.

333
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,282
You know, so the spirit
of the dead person faces the sun.

334
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,451
So that thing. It's a burial thing.

335
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,078
But there's one technician
in the Denver mint, right?

336
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,457
This guy, he believed
in the New Frontier...

337
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,916
...Camelot, the whole deal.

338
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,502
So the assassination,
it just destroyed him.

339
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,005
When he sees that coin
with Kennedy facing east...

340
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,133
...facing the American past,
it pissed him off.

341
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,052
And so he went rogue.

342
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,804
Without telling anybody,
he flipped things around...

343
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:13,892
...so that Kennedy was facing west
towards the New Frontier, the future.

344
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,520
Now, the mint struck about 3000 of these
before they figured it out.

345
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,105
They canned the guy.

346
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:22,067
About 1000 of them
made it out into general circulation.

347
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,778
They managed to get most of them back,
melt them down.

348
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:31,576
But there's still 200 plus
floating around out there.

349
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,412
What's that? I didn't catch that.

350
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,414
I didn't say anything.

351
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,667
You mind, buddy? We're having
a private conversation here.

352
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,172
This one's not in perfect condition.

353
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:50,428
But on the open market,
I'd say it's worth 6 or 800 bucks.

354
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,765
- Eight-hundred dollars?
- Yeah.

355
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:58,186
I'm hard up so I'll take $100 for it.

356
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,981
You want me to give you
$100 for a half-dollar?

357
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,778
I want you to give me $100
for an $800 coin.

358
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,197
Yeah, I don't know, man.

359
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,535
I'm gonna go drain the snake.
Think about it.

360
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,378
This guy's playing me, right?

361
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,673
- Definitely.
- Slick son of a bitch.

362
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,174
You know, I should...

363
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,141
You know,
I know this guy on Wabash.

364
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,268
Coin dealer, a friend of my uncle's.

365
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,229
Hey, Joey, can I use your phone?
Local call.

366
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,022
Keep it short.

367
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,401
Let's see.

368
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,987
I'm gonna call this guy.

369
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,781
When he tells me this is a scam,
know what I'm gonna do?

370
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,241
I'm gonna call the cops.

371
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,828
And get this scumbag thrown in the can.
You're my witness, okay?

372
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,207
Facing west.

373
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,585
My hairy ass.

374
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,379
Hey.

375
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:10,592
How you doing?
Yeah, it's Alvin, Dave Tanner's nephew.

376
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,385
Yeah.

377
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,263
Yeah. That's right.

378
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,141
Hey, this is gonna sound
like the beginning of a bad joke.

379
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,853
But I'm in this bar, and I got this guy
spinning this cock-and-bull story...

380
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,397
...about this 50-cent piece
he's trying to sell me.

381
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:30,737
He says... He says Kennedy's supposed
to be facing west or something.

382
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,948
Yeah?

383
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,578
Yeah.

384
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:48,296
- At the tone, the time will be 5:11 p.m.
- Yeah.

385
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,797
That's what he said. Denver.

386
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,759
Jesus, no kidding?

387
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:58,014
Look. Listen. I gotta go. All right.
Thank you. Yeah, I owe you one.

388
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,434
Thanks, Joey.

389
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,647
- So, what'd he say?
- Yeah, he didn't really know much.

390
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,403
I'll tell you what. I'll give you $50 for it.

391
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,365
Fifty dollars?
I'm taking a bath at $100.

392
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,786
All right. Okay. Look.
I got like $64 right here.

393
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,414
It's an $800 coin, okay?
I'm not gonna sell it to you for $64.

394
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,792
If you wait for me, I'll get you 100 bucks.

395
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,418
I don't know.

396
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,172
Hey, buddy. I got 75 bucks right here.

397
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,591
Hey, I... Sorry. I need a hundred.

398
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,468
Hey, slick, nobody's talking to you.

399
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:37,637
Mind your own business, okay?
Come on.

400
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,847
Cash money, $80.

401
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,558
Look, if you give me a chance,
I'll be back with $100...

402
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,770
- How long will that be?
- I don't know. Catch a train. Come back.

403
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,981
This guy was getting ready
to call the cops.

404
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,565
- No, I was not.
- Why would you?

405
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,193
- This guy is making shit up.
- Hey, I got 110 here.

406
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:53,653
- Sold.
- No, no, no.

407
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,697
- This guy's got the cash.
- Don't do that.

408
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,992
- Take care of that. It's history there.
- Hey, you can't do that.

409
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,245
- Money talks. You lost. It's over.
- No, it's not over.

410
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,497
That's crap.
Where do you think you're going?

411
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:05,748
Back off, dude.

412
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,793
I'll back off
when you give me the JFK back.

413
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,254
Call the cops.
This guy just tried to rip me off.

414
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,548
This guy's a liar.
I did not rip anybody off.

415
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,844
Yes, you did. You come back in here,
your ass is grass. I got friends, buddy.

416
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,722
You hear me?
You double-dealing bastard.

417
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,141
I got friends!

418
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,939
You are so beautiful.

419
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:35,278
Hey, everybody. Next round's on us.

420
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,955
All right. You listening?

421
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,707
Can you keep a secret?

422
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,251
Yeah. Absolutely.

423
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,838
Okay, his name is Idi Abbassi.

424
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:57,342
He's 27 years old.
He's a Nigerian prince.

425
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:01,596
He's worth, conservatively,
$400 million.

426
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,390
The dictatorship
of Equatorial Uqbar Orbis...

427
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,642
...is detaining him
on trumped-up charges.

428
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,895
Now, the Abbassi family,
they're going crazy.

429
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,606
They will reward whoever helps them
get their boy back.

430
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,900
The hitch is
the banks have frozen their...

431
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,194
assets.
I'm talking Irish Sweeps tickets...

432
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,862
...a whole trunk full of them.

433
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:21,240
They're just sitting at O'Hare,
impounded in customs.

434
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,451
Now, I know what you're saying,
"So what?"

435
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,994
I can leave this as security.

436
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,789
But you got to understand,
this violin is my livelihood.

437
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,123
It's a valuable antique.

438
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,460
What do you mean it doesn't belong
to you? I'll pay 900 bucks for this.

439
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,380
- Cash on the barrel.
- I don't know. I hate to part with it.

440
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,007
- Been in my family for years.
- You can keep a secret?

441
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,134
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- You need a good front.

442
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,762
So you're gonna have the
most return on your dollars.

443
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,472
But I know this customs officer.

444
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,849
- Make it an investment.
- If the price is right.

445
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,519
I'm all about investments,
all about what's coming next.

446
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,772
Hey, kid, help me get my wife's car
out of this bad neighbourhood.

447
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,150
Sir, sir, could you help me?
Tell me, are these today's numbers?

448
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,528
Now, none of this
was strictly legal, right?

449
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,822
And the import taxes
would have been a killer.

450
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:04,867
He had to find a way to get money into
the country without anyone knowing.

451
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,037
He coated the cash
with this black stuff, vectrol paste.

452
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,958
And the only way to get it off
is with this special chemical.

453
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,545
- It's not cheap, but the upside?
- The upside is huge.

454
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,380
Can you keep a secret?

455
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,633
You know,
the guy in Dances With Wolves?

456
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,845
A guy like you,
who's got some money.

457
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,556
- Got some money to throw around.
- I know, "Who cares?"

458
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,058
No matter which one wins,
we're gonna get a piece.

459
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,769
- He's got a gambling problem.
- Nobody can come after you.

460
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,813
- You get the profit.
- The price is right.

461
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,106
It's a win-win for you.

462
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,943
- It's a lose-lose for everybody else.
- You tell the guy you've got a 14.

463
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,779
- He checks, realises...
- Why we're getting a consortium.

464
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:44,240
It's just gonna be a piece of the pie.

465
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,410
But you're gonna own
a full mountain range, guaranteed.

466
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,830
- Can you keep...
...A secret?

467
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,458
- Because I really...
...Really shouldn't...

468
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,876
Be telling you this.

469
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,811
Hey.

470
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,438
Hey.

471
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,442
You are not Kevin Costner.

472
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:21,986
I was last night.

473
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,864
Jesus.

474
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,867
Asshole.

475
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,995
I mean, seriously?

476
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:35,041
- Oh, Lucianne? Lucianne.
- What?

477
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,419
- He's not Kevin Costner.
- What? So who's this guy?

478
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:41,047
Not Kevin Costner's manager.

479
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,466
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay, okay.

480
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,717
Come on.

481
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,386
Get the hell out of this dump.

482
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,556
So are you sure he's not a manager?

483
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,100
Yes, Luci, I am sure.

484
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,146
- He said he was gonna give me his card.
- Does this look like a manager's place?

485
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,483
Can I interest you ladies
in some mimosas?

486
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,402
At least stick around long enough
to get dressed.

487
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,531
- Screw you.
- If you build it, I will come.

488
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,825
- Luci, come on.
- Okay.

489
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,327
Bye.

490
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,580
- Come on.
- That door sticks.

491
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,250
- Yeah, okay. I got it.
- Okay.

492
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,503
- Go. Go.
- Okay.

493
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,229
You have 15 messages.

494
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:24,984
This is Greta Muller.
I wanted to check to see if my will...

495
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,696
My name's Gary Albert Arnold.
I'd like to discuss making a...

496
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,074
Hi, Mr. McGill.
I'm calling on behalf of my mother.

497
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,035
She's in assisted living and...

498
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:38,581
Yes, Mr. McGill.
This is Manny Hollinger again.

499
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,335
- Hey, Mr. McGill.
- So, what's it gonna be today, pal?

500
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,921
I'm up for anything and everything.

501
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,717
Marco, I'm sorry. I gotta go back.

502
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,469
What?

503
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,223
It's been great.
And I appreciate your hospitality.

504
00:32:56,433 --> 00:33:00,895
But a week's gonna have to do it.
I gotta go home.

505
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,023
I already called in sick.

506
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,153
Come on, man. This is home.
You hate it out there.

507
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,863
What do you got to go back to?

508
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,741
My clients.

509
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,826
What clients?

510
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:19,455
What are you,
like a gigolo or something?

511
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,209
Marco.

512
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,338
I'm a lawyer.

513
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,298
What?

514
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:33,886
Honest to God. I do elder law,
which is like wills and estates.

515
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:37,682
- So you're ripping off old people?
- No, I'm not ripping off old people.

516
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,600
I'm not ripping off anybody.

517
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:43,396
Holy crap. Slippin' Jimmy's a lawyer?

518
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:49,151
No wonder you wanna go back.
I mean, you got to be king of the desert.

519
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,862
Driving around town
in a white Caddy making bank.

520
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:55,116
I'm not making bank.
I'm making a living, more or less.

521
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,409
A living?

522
00:33:56,618 --> 00:34:00,162
All due respect, you're a lawyer
and you're not making bank...

523
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,499
- ...you're doing it wrong.
- I'm building something. Takes time.

524
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,710
You're gonna build something,
build it here.

525
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,756
- Lawyers in Chicago make plenty.
- I don't know what to tell you, Marco.

526
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,342
- Chuck's in Albuquerque.
- Again, all due respect...

527
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,344
...Chuck's a stuck-up douche bag.

528
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:19,140
I hate to break it to you,
but he doesn't even like you.

529
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,477
He's my brother.

530
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,859
Okay. I get it.

531
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,695
Family. You gotta go back.

532
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,280
But...

533
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,456
Remember this?

534
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,585
The Rolex thing. Whatever happened
to the guy who used to sell us those?

535
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:52,381
Jin Kang? He got deported.
This is the last one.

536
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,341
I say we go for it.

537
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,470
- No.
- Come on. Last time, we did what, 600?

538
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,222
The hot streak we're on,
I bet we'd break a grand.

539
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:04,101
- I could lend you some cash.
- I don't need the money, Jimmy.

540
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,895
I need this.

541
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,939
Come on. You say you're happy
doing wills or whatever.

542
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,775
Good for you, man. Seriously.

543
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:15,070
But I gotta tell you,
standpipes ain't cutting it for me, man.

544
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,990
I got nothing, Jimmy.

545
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,951
Give me this.

546
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,413
Give me this, man.

547
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,041
- I can't do it.
- Come on. Give me this.

548
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,709
- Marco.
- Give me this. Come on.

549
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,461
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

550
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,505
- Hey.
- One last time. Come on.

551
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,173
I'm not being hypnotised.

552
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,801
- Okay. Come on. One more time.
- I can't do it.

553
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,762
- Just one more. One more.
- Hey, listen to me.

554
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,305
I'm listening. Come on.

555
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,248
Yeah.

556
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,793
- It's gotta come from the gut.
- Yeah.

557
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,461
Yeah.

558
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,923
Oh, that's crazy.

559
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,301
Just like a wolf. Go ahead.

560
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,344
No, deeper, deeper.

561
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:06,974
Yeah, and you do that right
at the moment of, you know, pure joy.

562
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,643
- Yeah.
- And it will escalate it...

563
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,564
- ...ten times. There's something...
- Hey.

564
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,025
- It's prehistoric.
- Hey. Hey. Look.

565
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,996
Fifty, two-hundred, four-hundred.

566
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,498
- Whose is it?
- I don't know.

567
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:35,711
There's gotta be 1000 bucks in here.
Somebody must have...

568
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,050
Oh, damn.

569
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,146
- Is he...?
- I don't know.

570
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:30,099
Hey, buddy, you with us?

571
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:36,605
Look, the guy's just had too many.
I say we move on.

572
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,691
You wanna split this?

573
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,776
Marco, you okay?

574
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,569
Marco?

575
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,991
- What, do you know this guy?
- Hey, call 911.

576
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,535
Call 911.

577
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,706
Hey.

578
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,090
I need an ambulance.
My friend's having a heart attack.

579
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,468
We're in an alley southeast
of LaSalle and Shermer.

580
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:10,097
No, I don't know.
He was like this when I found him.

581
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:14,143
Hey, hold. Marco?
Marco you with me? You with me?

582
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,895
- I screwed up.
- No, you did good, buddy.

583
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,189
Just hold on, all right?
They're on their way.

584
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,691
They'll be here in a minute.

585
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,361
- Jimmy, you know what?
- Save your breath. You're gonna be fine.

586
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,115
This was the greatest week of my life.

587
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,706
Hey.

588
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,876
Hey, hey, hey. Hang in there. Hey.

589
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,505
Hey, hey. Hey, wake up, man.

590
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,592
Come on. Marco, buddy.

591
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,512
Help!

592
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,391
Anybody.

593
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,520
Marco.

594
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,408
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Oh, hey, Bud.

595
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,494
Can I bum one?

596
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:25,839
Is that his?

597
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,925
Yeah.

598
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,470
- His mom gave it to me.
- I thought it looked familiar.

599
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,806
I figured I'd wear it today.

600
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,142
But I don't know.
I'm not a big ring guy, so...

601
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,189
Still. Could be worth
a couple of bucks.

602
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,038
Better head back.

603
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,332
See you inside.

604
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:26,316
- Hey.
- Is this Ferris Bueller?

605
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:27,901
Speaking.

606
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:32,114
I don't want to interrupt your big day off.
Just checking in. What are you up to?

607
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:36,368
- You know, burning down the place.
- I wouldn't expect any less.

608
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:42,124
So whatever it was,
did you get it out of your system?

609
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,960
- Yep, all gone.
- Good.

610
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,670
I want to run something by you.

611
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,840
The Sandpiper case,
it's getting too big for HHM.

612
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,259
Howard's decided to partner
with another firm.

613
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,303
Davis and Main, you heard of them?

614
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:59,558
- Sure, up in Santa Fe.
- Right. Well, they've heard of you too.

615
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,018
And they're interested.

616
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,353
They want to make an offer
contingent on an interview.

617
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,023
- They've got a partner-track position.
- Wait. What?

618
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,525
Partner track?
What are you talking about?

619
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,445
There's an office in Santa Fe
with your name on it.

620
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,657
Or there could be.
And you'd be working on your case.

621
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,830
Well, I... I don't even...

622
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,960
- Chuck wouldn't like it.
- Chuck has no say in this.

623
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,670
You wouldn't be working for HHM.

624
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,381
And Chuck can't tell
Davis and Main who to hire.

625
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:35,886
Why me? Is this like a tax write-off or
a charity thing? What's the angle, huh?

626
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,222
Jimmy,
we've been talking to your clients...

627
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,681
...the Sandpiper residents.

628
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,100
And they ask about you
every chance they get.

629
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,020
I don't know what it is,
but you have a way with them.

630
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,814
Hey. Old people love me.

631
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,985
So sounds good?

632
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:59,660
Kim, I can't imagine what you did
to make this happen. Thank you.

633
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,204
I didn't do anything much.

634
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:06,041
And believe it or not,
Howard's been pushing this too.

635
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,709
Good old Howard.

636
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,672
Listen, we're gonna be down in
Judge Murray's court on Thursday at 11.

637
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,715
The Davis and Main people
will be there.

638
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,093
It'd be the perfect chance
for you to meet them.

639
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,596
Thursday at 11. All right.
I'll be there. Thanks, Kim. Really.

640
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:21,348
I'll see you then.

641
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,529
All the originals
need to be copied and filed.

642
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,365
See, I've written right here
on the box, "copy and file."

643
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:42,077
- That's to make it as clear as possible.
- Got it, Mr. McGill. Anything else?

644
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:45,330
Well, on the grocery front,
almost everything was right this time.

645
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,249
- Great.
- Almost.

646
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,920
It's a small thing, but to my taste, the
Granny Smith apples are a bit too tart.

647
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,090
- Those are the green ones, right?
- Right. I prefer the red ones.

648
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,552
But not Red Delicious.
Those are generally tasteless.

649
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:03,181
Fujis should be in season.
It's not a major issue, but...

650
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,309
Fuji apples. Okay.

651
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,562
Oh, and I'd like to try soy milk.
So maybe a half gallon of that.

652
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,272
You got it.

653
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:15,360
Well, thank you, Ernesto.
I appreciate your attention to detail.

654
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,614
Do you need to write
any of this down?

655
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,450
Because it's okay if you do.

656
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,703
You know, just to be sure.

657
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,456
So Fuji apples.

658
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,727
- Hey, Ernie.
- Hey, how you doing, man?

659
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,314
Good. Good. So Howard's got you
looking after Chuck, huh?

660
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,692
- Yeah. It's a few extra bucks, you know?
- How's he doing?

661
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,944
Seems okay, like usual.

662
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,366
I'd say we could grab a beer, but they're
waiting on paperwork at the office.

663
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,951
- You know how it is.
- Don't I though?

664
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,745
See you, Jimmy.

665
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,997
See you around, Ernie.

666
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,163
You done business with him before?

667
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,291
Right.

668
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,795
Yeah. I'll be there.

669
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:27,951
Davis and Main and McGill.

670
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:33,623
Great to meet you.
Nice to meet you, gentlemen.

671
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,292
It's good to meet you.

672
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,043
Nice.

673
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:06,490
Well, that was quick. No charge.

674
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,116
Help me out here.

675
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:14,331
Did I dream it or did I have
$1,600,000 on my desk in cash?

676
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,167
When I close my eyes, I can still see it.

677
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,420
It's burned into my retinas
like I was staring into the sun.

678
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,964
No one on God's green Earth
knew we had it.

679
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,799
We could have split it 50-50.

680
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:31,097
We could have gone home
with $800,000 each, tax free.

681
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:33,225
Your point being?

682
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,894
Why didn't we? What stopped us?

683
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,856
I remember you saying something
about doing the right thing.

684
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,527
I don't even know what that means.

685
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,820
You want to know
why I didn't take that money?

686
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,948
Is that what you're asking?

687
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,741
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.

688
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:54,162
Me, personally,
I was hired to do a job. I did it.

689
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,164
That's as far as it goes.

690
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:00,377
Yeah. Well, I know what stopped me.

691
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,045
And you know what?

692
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:04,798
It's never stopping me again.
