1
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,277
It's really messed up.

2
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:37,036
Hey, hello. Habla English.
Hey, are you the son?

3
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,163
Grandson.

4
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,379
- Hit while driving.
- My leg.

5
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,555
The crazy old biznatch
ran over my brother.

6
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,642
It hurts so bad. It hurts so bad.
It hurts so bad.

7
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,187
- Look at that.
- It's this one.

8
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,524
She broke his leg, stood on the gas.
That's a hit-and-run.

9
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,776
She felonied me. That's a felony.

10
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,321
- We got the whole thing right here.
- Hold on. Let me talk to her.

11
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,615
- Start talking.
- Good.

12
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,288
- He can't put pressure on it.
- Need to lean on you.

13
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,750
- Es muy mal for my leg-o.
- Lean on this.

14
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,589
No, man, it really hurts.

15
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,761
Dude.

16
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,056
- Yes, sí, problema.
- And now dos problemas.

17
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,558
Dude.

18
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,649
- I don't know what you're saying, man.
- Dude.

19
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:53,070
Dude, we got a real problem here.
Yeah, sí, problema.

20
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,871
What're you gonna do
about this leg situation?

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,750
- I really need a doctor.
- Doctors ain't cheap, yo. It's gonna cost.

22
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,212
Either you or her,
somebody's gotta pay.

23
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,880
You want money?

24
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,590
- Yes.
- Yeah, damn straight.

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,511
Hit-and-run? It's no joke.
What are the cops gonna say?

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,556
Cops? They coming?

27
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,143
- Yeah, maybe.
- That's up to you, man.

28
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,980
- They could be looking at this tape.
- It's all up to you.

29
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,947
You called her "biznatch"?

30
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,825
- I didn't...
- Whatever. Hurry it up. I'm hurting.

31
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,745
Show us the green, or la policia
is gonna come and take Granny away.

32
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,914
She's gonna go to jail.
You want that?

33
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,793
That's right. Play it smart. Okay, good.
So let's talk dollar amounts.

34
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,378
For what you did...

35
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,132
No...

36
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,344
Biznatch.

37
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,877
Hey, get over here.

38
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,213
Yeah, my abuelita's.

39
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,758
Bring No-Doze, and tell Nacho
to bring his van.

40
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,502
Open up, officer of the court.
Open up in the name of the law.

41
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,466
Good afternoon, this...

42
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,391
Showing hands. I'm relaxed. Okay?

43
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,061
Non-threatening.

44
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,984
You move, and you're dead.

45
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,071
Got it.

46
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,407
Seems to be a misunderstanding.

47
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,535
Is there by any chance
a Betsy Kettleman here?

48
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,412
Not sure if this is a situation...

49
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,082
...where I should
or should not look you in the eye.

50
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,583
Now sit.

51
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,592
Who are you? Are you with
those red-headed scumbags?

52
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,470
My name's James McGill.
I'm an attorney.

53
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,266
I got a call from some clients,
something about an accident.

54
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,769
I did not get any details.

55
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,481
When I saw skateboards in your
front yard, I assumed they might...

56
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,326
Talk.

57
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,789
I'm gonna make an educated guess
what happened here.

58
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,584
My two clients, Frick and Frack,
the mopheads...

59
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:25,129
...were in a simple traffic accident.
A minor fender-bender.

60
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,339
They were on the wrong side
of the street...

61
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,841
...or didn't look both ways.

62
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,719
It could happen to anyone.

63
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,181
My clients, exhibiting
extremely poor judgment...

64
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,185
...followed your grandmother to this
delightful, well-tended home.

65
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:44,857
Now, at this juncture, I am deducing
that they said or did something...

66
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,233
...that crossed a line...

67
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,112
...and you, with some justification,
you put them in their place.

68
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,534
Based on the salsa stain there,
could've gone a couple ways.

69
00:08:55,744 --> 00:09:00,372
The bottom line, not to be morbid,
but if they're dead...

70
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,209
...I'm guessing that I'm...

71
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:06,962
I'm gonna...

72
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:10,507
Yeah, I'm gonna go with glass half-full
here and say they're not.

73
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,261
If they're still alive, why kill us?
Because of a misunderstanding?

74
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:18,599
Our own stupidity? Why mess up
your lovely abuelita's place?

75
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,645
Why jump to the nuclear option?
See, I'm saying keep it simple.

76
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:27,900
I will collect my moronic clients,
and, poof, we are gone.

77
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:32,363
Neither you nor your lovely abuelita
will ever lay eyes on us ever again.

78
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,033
Guaranteed.
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

79
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,039
Assuming, you know,
that they're still breathing.

80
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,386
You got a mouth on you.

81
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,180
Thank you.

82
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,518
Get up.

83
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,692
- That way.
- That way?

84
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,528
Yeah, yeah, sure. Why not?

85
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,715
So, I should cut them loose?

86
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,603
- It was him! It was all his idea!
- No, no, no!

87
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,064
You shut up!

88
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,818
- Say what?
- He wanted to scam you.

89
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,155
He said we could clear 2 grand easy.

90
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,909
You punking me?

91
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,213
Are you punking my abuelita?

92
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,342
He hit his head, he doesn't
know what he's saying.

93
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,645
For what?

94
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,774
For what are you getting 2 grand?

95
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,901
It was for going after your grandma.

96
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,862
For taking a header over her car,
then for bracing her.

97
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,656
It was him, I swear. It was the lawyer.

98
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,193
- Who are you? Why are you after me?
- I can explain.

99
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,822
You're gonna laugh, it's so...
I'm a lawyer. Check my ID, okay?

100
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,116
- I was running a scam...
- On my abuelita?!

101
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,660
Not on your abuelita. Not on you.

102
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,704
There's a woman named
Betsy Kettleman. I mentioned her.

103
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,999
Married to Craig Kettleman,
treasurer of Bernalillo County.

104
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,251
I wanted his business.

105
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,795
He stole a million and a half bucks
from the county.

106
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,257
He's gonna be indicted
for embezzlement any day now.

107
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,886
That's a good case for me.
A lot of publicity. I'll get my name out.

108
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,472
I thought if I had these two...

109
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,350
...run their little skateboard hustle
on Mrs. Kettleman...

110
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,310
...I could, you know, rescue her.

111
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,856
Come in, throw oil on troubled waters,
and get their business.

112
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:58,068
That was the plan. But it turns out
your lovely abuelita...

113
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,614
...she drives a car that is a whole lot
like the Kettle-mobile.

114
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:06,493
So these two geniuses ran their little
stunt on the wrong one.

115
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,537
So joke's on me.

116
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,206
Simple as that.

117
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,632
Where's he going?

118
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,968
Talk to me, okay?

119
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,639
Who do you think I am?
What is he getting?

120
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,227
I was running a scam to get a client.

121
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:37,191
I made a mistake, that's all this is.
Oh, jeez.

122
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,234
You don't need...

123
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,114
That's not... I'll talk, okay?

124
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,617
Tell me what you want to know.

125
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,204
Who do you think I am?

126
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,830
Hey, use your words, okay?

127
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,126
You know what I smell?

128
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,420
I smell lies.

129
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,592
- I smell pork.
- No, that's not necessary.

130
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,678
We know you're with the heat.
The question is, who?

131
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,932
- Local, FBI, DEA?!
- No, I'm a lawyer.

132
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,809
Just reach in my pocket right now.
Right there.

133
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,194
Truth.

134
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,157
That is the truth! I'm a lawyer!

135
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,243
Guys, I passed the bar!
Ask me anything!

136
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:33,413
Not contract law...
I'm down at the courts every day.

137
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,792
People know me.
I'm a known quantity. I am.

138
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,090
I'm Special Agent Jeffrey Steele, FBI.

139
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,134
- FBI?
- FBI. I'm undercover, okay?

140
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:51,431
You got me. I'm the tip of the spear.
Releasing me would be the smart move.

141
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,975
You hear that shit?

142
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,895
I told you the business was too good.

143
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,274
I knew it. I told you.

144
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,025
Can I?

145
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:11,201
- Okay, Special Agent Steele?
- Jeffrey A. Steele.

146
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,079
Okay, Agent Steele,
what business are we in?

147
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,665
- Business?
- You're investigating us, right?

148
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,875
For what? What did we do?

149
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,420
What do we sell?

150
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,964
- Drugs.
- What kind of drugs?

151
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:29,636
It's Title 21, Schedule II through
Schedule V, including Part B.

152
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,931
That's what we call them
down at the Bureau.

153
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,892
The task force is designated
Operation Kingbreaker...

154
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,771
Kingbreaker? That makes me the king!

155
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,275
Can I?

156
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,114
All right.

157
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:55,454
The next words out of your mouth
ought to be the truth.

158
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,497
You understand?

159
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,043
Who are you?

160
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,136
I'm James Morgan McGill, a lawyer
trolling for business. That's the truth.

161
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:15,307
- Now, you find a Bible, I'll swear on it.
- What about Operation Kingbreaker?

162
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:20,604
I made it up, okay? I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I don't know you. I don't want to.

163
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,357
This was a mistake.

164
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,317
It's my mistake. Okay?

165
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:29,279
I take full and complete
responsibility, but...

166
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,325
I don't know any of your names,
and I got a bad case of face blindness.

167
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,702
You let us go,
we'll forget this happened.

168
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,413
Guys, we're gonna forget, right?
Nod your heads.

169
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,290
Okay.

170
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,460
So if you'd just let us go...

171
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,631
I just... We wanna just go home.

172
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,605
I say cut him loose.

173
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,443
He said he was FBI. He admitted it.

174
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:12,823
You had your wire cutters on him.
He would've said anything.

175
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,867
You really see the FBI hiring
those two flaquitos?

176
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,414
Maybe.

177
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,545
Croaking a lawyer for no reason
is bad business.

178
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,964
He goes away,
someone's gonna look for him.

179
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,883
They walked into my house.

180
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,011
They disrespected my abuelita.

181
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,891
They called her "biznatch"
and they just walk?!

182
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,317
What about the lawyer?

183
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,197
He's giving respect.

184
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,160
Okay.

185
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:09,838
"James M. McGill,
a lawyer you can trust."

186
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,052
I know how to find you, James McGill.

187
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,890
- Understand what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

188
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,859
Up.

189
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,364
Okay?

190
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,368
Take him back to his car.

191
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:46,333
Thank you. This is good.
This is right. Thank you.

192
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,043
Come on.

193
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,213
What about them?

194
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,923
- Come on.
- Yeah, right.

195
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,218
- Come on.
- Yeah, right.

196
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,937
- Where you going?
- Can I say something?

197
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,105
- Where you going?
- Can you let them go?

198
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,900
- Just let them go.
- Are you stupid?

199
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,903
They don't deserve to die.
I put them up to it.

200
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,614
I don't deserve to die,
but they don't either.

201
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,450
I'm gonna skin them like javelinas!

202
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,914
Forget about them! They're insects!
Hey, think about their mother.

203
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,585
I spit on their mama!

204
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,880
She is a sweet little lady.
She's a widow.

205
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,385
She works hard, all day, every day,
just like her mother before her...

206
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,848
...from dawn till dusk,
scrubbing the floors of rich people.

207
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,933
She needs a cane to walk, you know.

208
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,979
She's got arthritis,
and still she works every day.

209
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:54,150
What? For herself?
No, for them. For these two.

210
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,361
Her boys, they're apples of her eye.

211
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:02,200
You say they don't deserve her?
Maybe so. But they're all she's got.

212
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,120
Now, you turn them inside out...

213
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,581
...I want you to think
about what happens to her.

214
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,292
That's on them. They should've
thought about that.

215
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,837
When I was at your abuelita's place,
you were gonna let them go.

216
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,299
The way I see it, that's because
you're tough, but you're fair.

217
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,801
You're all about justice.

218
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,970
That's what I'm saying.

219
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,433
- Justice.
- These two shit-for-brains, big-mouths?

220
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,060
You already beat
the living hell out of them.

221
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,605
You think they'll
ever forget today? Never.

222
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,317
Ten years from now, they're still gonna
be crapping their Jockeys.

223
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,403
- It's not enough.
- Okay, okay.

224
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,573
Then let's talk proportionality.
They're guilty.

225
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:47,078
Agreed. Now you have to decide,
what's the right sentence?

226
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,168
- Like a judge.
- Like a judge.

227
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,170
Ever hear of the Code of Hammurabi?

228
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,048
Let the punishment fit the crime?
Eye for an eye?

229
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,425
Eye for an eye.

230
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,677
- You want me to blind them.
- No, no.

231
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:07,182
- All they did was trash-talk.
- So I cut their tongues out!

232
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:13,772
Wait. See, I'm advising that you
make the punishment fit the crime.

233
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,192
"Punishment fit the crime."

234
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,319
Colombian neckties.

235
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:24,449
I cut their throats, and then I pull their
lying tongues through the slits!

236
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,370
- Biznatch!
- Or you could give them black eyes.

237
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,874
Black eyes? That ain't nothing.

238
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:36,670
That one there, holmes?
He already got a black eye, fool.

239
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:46,429
Stop helping.

240
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,391
Or you could sprain their ankles.

241
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,559
- Sprain?
- They're skateboarders, right?

242
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,853
That's how they run their scam.

243
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,983
They can't skate,
you hit them where they live.

244
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,902
I ain't spraining nothing, bitch.

245
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:04,239
I'm gonna break their arms,
then I'm gonna break their legs.

246
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,075
Arms? When did we get onto arms?

247
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,994
I'm cutting their legs off.

248
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:13,081
We could go that way,
but we were talking about breaking.

249
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,043
- We're heading in the wrong direction.
- Okay.

250
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,673
- Break their legs.
- How many legs?

251
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:26,094
- Two. They got two legs.
- One leg each.

252
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,929
One leg each?

253
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,685
One leg each. Total of two legs.

254
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:38,064
Hey, look, they can't skateboard
for six months...

255
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,191
...and they're scared of you forever.

256
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,987
You show everybody that
you are the man, but that you're fair.

257
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,364
That you're just.

258
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,752
One leg each.

259
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,885
That's tough, but it's fair.

260
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:13,099
All right, lay them out! I ain't got all day!
It's hotter than shit out here!

261
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,778
Quit moving!
You're only gonna make it worse!

262
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:32,619
Look! Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!

263
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,955
He said he had a broken leg,
now he's got one for real.

264
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,876
You, tell your mama you're sorry, bitch.

265
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,586
Other one.

266
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,214
Hey, look, it's backwards.

267
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:52,722
Check it out.
I'm gonna do this one real clean.

268
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,732
Walk home now, bitch!

269
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:07,654
Shut up! Shut up!

270
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,178
Here you go. Here you go.
Easy, easy. Save your breath.

271
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,723
You are the worst lawyer!
The worst lawyer ever!

272
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:40,395
Hey, I just talked you down from a death
sentence to six months' probation.

273
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,024
I'm the best lawyer ever.

274
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,736
Oh, my God!

275
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,977
Could you...? Could you...?

276
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,354
I'll be right back.

277
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,299
Ground yourself?

278
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,057
Jimmy, did you ground yourself?

279
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,202
I don't think you grounded yourself.

280
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,043
Jesus.

281
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,546
Jimmy, you didn't drive
like this, did you?

282
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,056
Oh, no.

283
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:09,771
No. I knew it.

284
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,913
Chuck.

285
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,959
Coffee?

286
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,629
Yeah, thanks.

287
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,633
- You're gonna have to take it black.
- Out of milk?

288
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,472
Sorry.

289
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,990
Why are you in that space blanket?

290
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,784
You brought your cell phone
in here last night.

291
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,037
It was in your pants pocket.

292
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,626
Sorry about that.

293
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,838
Where is it?

294
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,216
Outside. I threw it out the door.

295
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,144
How did I get here?

296
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,689
Your car's not outside,
so I'm assuming taxi.

297
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:08,699
Right, the bartender
wouldn't let me drive.

298
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,840
Why are you in that space blanket?

299
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,887
I told you, you brought your
cell phone into my house.

300
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:38,688
Chuck, did you...?

301
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:40,815
Chuck, did you read this?

302
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:43,276
Read what?

303
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,989
This bill, did you read it?

304
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,241
Emergency room bill.

305
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,995
I may have glanced at it.
It fell out of your pocket.

306
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,875
Hey, Chuck, listen.
I know how this looks.

307
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,796
I'm down to my last dime, and suddenly
I'm paying for broken legs.

308
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:08,801
But it's not that, I swear.

309
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:15,182
This represents
a good thing, ultimately.

310
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,101
Okay.

311
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:20,521
I'm not backsliding.
This isn't Slipping Jimmy.

312
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,064
Fine.

313
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,363
Take off the space blanket,
will you, please, Chuck?

314
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,365
It helps.

315
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,702
Take off the blanket.
I didn't do anything wrong.

316
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:38,289
It has nothing to do with that.
It was your phone.

317
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,629
Take off the space blanket.

318
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,341
Why?

319
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,805
Take off the space blanket, Chuck.

320
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,766
Come on.

321
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,392
Take off the blanket.

322
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,864
Thank you.

323
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,622
Front yard?

324
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:27,338
- Do you have any idea where it landed?
- No.

325
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,615
No.

326
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,118
No.

327
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,121
No.

328
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,289
No.

329
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:11,716
No. No. No.

330
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,221
What do you want?

331
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,766
Not to starve to death.

332
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,352
What do you say?

333
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,856
You got something for me?

334
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,297
It's showtime, folks.

335
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,063
Clovis, lawyer.

336
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,607
I'm gonna kill him.

337
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,193
Your Honour, I'm sorry.
I'll never do it again.

338
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,903
- Say what?
- Just...

339
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,906
Your Honour, I'm very sorry,
and I'll never do it again.

340
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,826
Okay, Mr. Pearson.
Up you go. All right.

341
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,540
I told you a suit, remember?
You want to look sharp.

342
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,376
That's a loaner, okay?
I need it back. Let's go.

343
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,046
- Petty with a prior.
- Kid took a slice of pizza.

344
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,715
The parents are a train wreck.
He was hungry.

345
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,425
- Petty with a prior.
- Come on.

346
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,604
- You're light on stickers.
- Come on.

347
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,272
- Five dollars.
- You serious?

348
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,024
You got four, you need five.

349
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,026
There's four 90-minute stickers.

350
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:58,155
- You've been six hours, five minutes.
- Takes ten minutes to walk down here.

351
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:01,826
Five dollars, or you go
get another sticker.

352
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,871
This makes you feel
real important, huh?

353
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,541
Not enough stickers? More stickers?

354
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:16,131
It's showtime, folks.

355
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:21,428
It's showtime.

356
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:49,498
- Petty with a prior.
- Prior will stay on his sheet for life.

357
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,917
Petty with a prior.

358
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,379
- You're overcharging him.
- Petty with a prior.

359
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,801
That lady up there?
She shorts me every time, okay?

360
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:05,139
This is not a me problem,
this is a you problem.

361
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,103
It's showtime.

362
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:14,857
It's from a movie.

363
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,325
Hey!

364
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,162
Okay, hold it.

365
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,501
- Petty with a prior.
- Misdemeanour shoplifting.

366
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,795
- Petty with a prior.
- Meet me halfway.

367
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,006
- Petty, with a prior.
- I can't do it.

368
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,091
- Petty with a prior.
- How about this?

369
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:44,386
I plead the kid to the sheet.
You give a continued sentence.

370
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,556
He gets six months.
He's still clean, file for dismissal.

371
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,935
Come on. This is how you want
to spend your time?

372
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,145
You can have the rest of these.

373
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,867
Berger, lawyer.

374
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,578
Mr. Berger, we've met before,
haven't we?

375
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,539
Mr. Edison, like the inventor?
I'm James McGill.

376
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:13,832
I'll be your lawyer.

377
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,543
Doesn't matter.
Judge has gotta see your mother.

378
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,672
Well, do you know anybody
who looks like her?

379
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,715
No, an uncle won't do it.

380
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:26,220
Okay, so a fire was started.
We all know that.

381
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,764
Freezing, shivering, as she is now.

382
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,600
In fact, wrote a book about it.

383
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,561
To make some cookies.

384
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,981
But because you...
Given her this name...

385
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,400
You can see that this man...

386
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,818
Chose...

387
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,153
A bonehead move.

388
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,381
You're like a troll under a bridge.

389
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,509
"You must have the stickers,
or you won't pass."

390
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,053
Troll alert here. Don't feed it.

391
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:24,445
Ladies.

392
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,071
Good evening, Ms. Nguyen.

393
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,825
- No mail.
- Hey, Vicki, Maggie.

394
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:10,199
You have zero messages.

395
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,389
- Customer.
- What?

396
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,391
For you, a customer. Waiting now.

397
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,561
Sure, sure. Give me a minute.

398
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:53,010
Welcome, welcome. My office is being
painted. Excuse the temporary quarters.

399
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,139
Cosy.

400
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,310
Just me.

401
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,062
Tuco freaked you out, huh?

402
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:09,610
It's cool. He doesn't know I'm here.

403
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,584
So...

404
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,462
...what can I do for you?

405
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:34,426
I've been thinking about
what you said out there in the desert.

406
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:37,971
Those people you were trying to scam,
how much did they steal?

407
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,685
North of a million
and a half bucks, I think.

408
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:50,192
So, they have a million
and a half bucks somewhere.

409
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,526
In what, cash?

410
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:56,281
I don't... Why are you asking me?

411
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,408
I'm gonna rip them off.

412
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:05,207
I like ripping off thieves. They can't go
to the cops. They have no recourse.

413
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,586
You point me at
where they have their cash...

414
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:13,340
...I'll pay you... What do you call it?
...a finder's fee.

415
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,635
Call it 10 percent, 100 large.

416
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,267
Why would you come to me for that?

417
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:29,022
You already tried ripping them off.
I'm gonna finish what you started.

418
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:32,693
I wasn't trying to rip them off.
I just wanted their business.

419
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,319
Okay.

420
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,073
I don't know where their money is.

421
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,200
Smart guy like you can figure it out.

422
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,203
Find out what I need to know,
nobody gets hurt.

423
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,622
We rip them off, easy money.

424
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:49,376
Look, I'm a lawyer, not a criminal.

425
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,299
You are shitting me.

426
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,301
I crossed a line.

427
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,846
I made a mistake.
I'm not doing that again. Not ever.

428
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:07,561
I got between you and Tuco. Think you'd
be here now if I kept my mouth shut?

429
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,606
And I appreciate that. I owe you.

430
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:15,777
And if you're ever in trouble,
God forbid, legal trouble...

431
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:19,906
...I will be there 24/7 as a lawyer.

432
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,828
- What's your angle?
- No angle.

433
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:30,000
And I'm not saying
anything about this to anybody.

434
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,711
As far as I'm concerned,
you're a client...

435
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,966
...this is a consultation, and everything
you just told me is privileged.

436
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,594
You rat, you die.

437
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,722
And that too. Yes.

438
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,622
For when you figure out
you're in the game.

439
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,584
I'm not in the game, I promise.
