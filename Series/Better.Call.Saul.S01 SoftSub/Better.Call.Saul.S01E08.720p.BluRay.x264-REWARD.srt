1
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:27,151
- Hey, Gene.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

2
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,821
- Trina.
- Hey, Jimmy.

3
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,950
- Got a package, Dan.
- Thank you.

4
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,372
How's it going?

5
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,124
What's up?

6
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,400
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

7
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,361
Jimmy, I'm really slammed.
Just tell me what you need.

8
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,365
What is it?

9
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,456
I can't open it.

10
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,813
So, what does it say?

11
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,532
"I must call to your
attention the newly passed...

12
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,827
...Environmental Impact and
Sustainability Assurance Act...

13
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,039
...a statute that as you know,
went into effect without any...

14
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,041
...ex post facto provisions in place."

15
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,627
- You got a second?
- Not really. I'm...

16
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,296
- It'll just take two seconds, I promise.
- All right.

17
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,175
What's this?

18
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,766
- Is this a joke?
- Nope. No joke.

19
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,061
You passed the bar?

20
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,438
Yeah. I did.

21
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,983
I thought if Kim can do it,
maybe I can too, you know?

22
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:35,196
So I got my last few credits
for undergrad from a community college.

23
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,282
They're not just for draft dodgers
and yoga classes, all right?

24
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,910
Then I found a law school
that would accept me.

25
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,038
I mean, it wasn't
Georgetown or anything.

26
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,916
The University of American Samoa.

27
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,837
- Oh, correspondence school.
- Well, I wasn't gonna quit work, right?

28
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,548
Nights. Weekends. You know.

29
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,802
They call it distance learning nowadays.
They're accredited.

30
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,055
Go, Land Crabs.
So you know, I did that.

31
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:05,059
And the bar exam's a mother.
I mean, for me, it was.

32
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,855
I failed it the first two times,
but I guess it's like losing your virginity.

33
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,315
Third time's the charm.

34
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:16,195
This must have taken you years.
And you kept it a secret all this time?

35
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,574
Why? You didn't come to me for help?

36
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:24,287
Jesus, Chuck. You're the busiest guy
I know. You're doing important shit.

37
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,460
- I don't know what to say.
- Are you proud of me?

38
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,299
Yes. Absolutely.

39
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,177
Thanks, Chuck. That means a lot.

40
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:45,725
Oh, hey. I was hoping, you know,
if you think it's appropriate...

41
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:51,480
...once I get sworn in
and everything, consider hiring me.

42
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,192
As what? Oh, a lawyer.

43
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,445
Obviously. Yeah.

44
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,699
That's a question I'm gonna have to take
up with Howard and the other partners.

45
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,786
You know, it's not my decision alone.

46
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,831
But how could they say no?

47
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,377
So much drive.
Jimmy, look what you've done here.

48
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,842
- I told those guys devil's food.
- Yeah.

49
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,969
- I will sue the store for you.
- Good.

50
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,556
- Remember us when you're all big time.
- I don't remember you now, Burt.

51
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,226
You representing mail room. You show
those upstairs jackholes how it gets...

52
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,980
Hey. What're you folks up to?
Having a party?

53
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,026
Just a little celebration on behalf
of New Mexico's newest attorney.

54
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,946
I heard. Jesus, Jimmy.
You're a regular Charlie Hustle.

55
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,989
- Congratulations, my friend.
- Thank you.

56
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,408
- Would you like some cake?
- Oh, here.

57
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,160
Don't mind if I do.

58
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,331
Really, really impressive, Jimmy.
We're all proud of you.

59
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,376
I hate to interrupt, but could you
give Jimmy and me a moment?

60
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,920
- Sure.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

61
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,718
Please, sit down.

62
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,009
Let's reassess in six months.

63
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,136
Thanks for understanding, Jimmy.

64
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,471
You want the door opened or closed?

65
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,223
Closed.

66
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,894
How's it going?

67
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,980
- Settling back in.
- Great.

68
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,983
So apparently they are ready for us.

69
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,612
Thanks. But I wanted to get some things
done before lunch.

70
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,863
And I'm still trying to...

71
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,532
Come on, Kim. You deserve this.

72
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,869
Come bask in the glow.

73
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,044
Thank you for coming. I appreciate you
making time in the middle of your days.

74
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,713
I'm pleased to announce
that working closely with...

75
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,174
...the Bernalillo County
District Attorney's Office...

76
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,677
...we've reached an agreement
for Craig Kettleman.

77
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,222
We believe this is a
just and fair outcome...

78
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,309
...and brings to a close an incident
Mr. Kettleman deeply regrets.

79
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,353
He is committed
to making amends...

80
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,687
Can I help you?

81
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,440
Yeah. I'm here to see Mrs. Landry.

82
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,069
Sign in right here, please.

83
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,739
- Are you a relative?
- Lawyer.

84
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,785
But I treat my clients like family.

85
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,914
- You know where to find her?
- Yeah. Thanks.

86
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,714
Hey. Good morning, folks.
Hi. Jimmy McGill.

87
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,802
Hey. Pick a card, any card.

88
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,887
All right.

89
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:56,433
How's it going there?
Good. Whoa, not so tight.

90
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,939
A little surprise from the card fairy.

91
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,650
Give me that squeeze.

92
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,738
Squeeze whatever you got that's below
the water that I can't see. Oh, yeah.

93
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:15,244
All right, Mrs. Landry. Just a few more
signatures and thy will be done.

94
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,079
Would you like another Hydrox?

95
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,874
No, thank you. I'm all Hydrox'd out.

96
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,376
Please help yourself
if you change your mind.

97
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,503
All right. That one.

98
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,465
Okay. And that one.

99
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,844
And that is it.

100
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,514
What a relief.
I should have done this years ago.

101
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:39,935
Well, people do tend to put it off.
But everybody should have a will.

102
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,188
Please tell your friends.

103
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:46,275
And that comes to $140.

104
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,069
And I'm happy to take cash or a cheque.

105
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,448
Or cash.

106
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,831
One moment.

107
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,179
Could you write me a cheque?

108
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:20,017
Well, it's been so long, I really don't
know if I have enough in my account.

109
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,687
I am so sorry. This is awful.

110
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,815
But all I have is $43.

111
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,070
- Okay.
- Now, I could ask for an advance.

112
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,905
I am so sorry.

113
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,407
- It's fine.
- I don't know what to say.

114
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,493
This is awful.

115
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,373
You could keep the will
until I get my allowance.

116
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,417
And that should only be
until the end of next week.

117
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,712
That's not necessary.
Here's my address.

118
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,423
Mail it to me when you've got it.
All right?

119
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:58,472
And why don't we...
We'll just make it an even 120. All right?

120
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,058
Thank you.

121
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,060
You have a nice day.

122
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,657
Excuse me. Allowance?
Your family has you on an allowance?

123
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:21,287
No. No. It's my money.
I just get it from Sandpiper Crossing.

124
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,039
- Five hundred dollars a month...
- I don't understand.

125
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,166
You should have
social security cheques...

126
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,085
...plus that pension we talked about.

127
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,797
- So how are you on an allowance?
- Well, the cheques go to Sandpiper.

128
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:36,176
And then they take out
my fees and my expenses.

129
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,596
Why don't you come on in?
I'm afraid I'm not explaining it very well.

130
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,060
I have statements here.

131
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,314
Somewhere. Somewhere.

132
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:53,277
So your pension and social security
goes straight to the Sandpiper people?

133
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,323
They take out...
They take out what they need.

134
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,493
And then I get my allowance. Here.

135
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,372
And all the rest
goes into my savings account.

136
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:10,753
It's really all very above-board.
A lot of places do it this way.

137
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,297
This is how they do it
for everybody around here?

138
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,426
Well, yes. They try to make everything
easy for us.

139
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:25,476
Mrs. Landry, are any of your
friends around who I could talk to?

140
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,729
And okay. I said, "What?"

141
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,857
So I went in the house,
I told the house...

142
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,151
I could not find...

143
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,160
In order to find out,
you have to look on the back.

144
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,079
Okay. And see this key.

145
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,832
See, you have reading glasses.
Could I borrow your glasses?

146
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,626
- Yes.
- Thank you.

147
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,129
Oh, these are gonna help me.
But I don't know if they'll do the trick.

148
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,091
So tiny.

149
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,843
Four. Ten. Twelve.

150
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,389
I think it might be Q-tips. I can't tell.

151
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,433
It's probably an accident, but we should
look into it, don't you think?

152
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,852
They're not doing this intentionally,
okay?

153
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,604
This could be a mistake.

154
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:15,526
If we correct the mistake, then you'll get
some money back. And it'll be fair.

155
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,487
Hey, Chuck.

156
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,283
My boxes. The ones I left...

157
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:36,088
Sandpiper Crossing.
Sandpiper Crossing.

158
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,799
- Did you do my wills?
- Yes, I did.

159
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,593
Hey, would you look at that?
Thank you.

160
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,887
Don't thank me.
This was a one-time thing.

161
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,890
And don't think I don't see
what you were doing here.

162
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,269
You wanted to play Tom Sawyer,
wanted me to paint the fence.

163
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,563
God help me, it worked.

164
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,567
You need help? Hire a paralegal.
Stand on your own two feet.

165
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,194
Yeah. Sure. I'll do that.

166
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,823
- You're not even listening to me.
- No. I hear you, Chuck, okay?

167
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,742
Self-reliance. Great stuff.
Would you look at this?

168
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,286
What did I just say?

169
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,622
Take a look, okay? Just right here.

170
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:15,169
Do you see what I see? All I'm asking
is for you to take a look. Please?

171
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,588
Sandpiper Crossing.

172
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,882
It's a retirement home, assisted living.

173
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,010
This is one of their invoices
they send their residents.

174
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,095
What exactly am I looking for here?

175
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,848
Nothing earthshaking.
Little things. Things like...

176
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,641
Like this right here.

177
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:34,480
Fourteen dollars for
code 118-62. What's 118-62?

178
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,772
I wonder.

179
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,027
How could you even read this?

180
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,529
It's like microfilm.

181
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:54,583
118-62 is facial tissue.

182
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,295
- Fourteen bucks for a box of Kleenex.
- Yeah. And I found others.

183
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,714
There's three and half dollars
for a roll of toilet paper...

184
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,716
...22 bucks for aspirin.

185
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,260
It's a clear pattern of overcharging.

186
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,888
Nothing huge
but adds up to real money.

187
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,935
I mean, here, look. This woman, she got
soaked for like 400 bucks last month.

188
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:16,104
And there's a pretty solid attempt
at concealment of that fact.

189
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,649
Which to my way of thinking,
makes it...

190
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,359
Fraud.

191
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,320
This was in work I did?

192
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,822
Yeah. You must have missed it.

193
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,536
Look, Chuck. I got lucky, right?

194
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,788
Even a stopped clock
is right twice a day.

195
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,791
This is no mom and pop outfit, okay?
I dug around a little.

196
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,418
They're owned by some
real estate investment trust.

197
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,547
I'm working on getting more info
but this could be big.

198
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,008
I mean, this could be
a big case, right?

199
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:49,555
Well, if it's more than a few errant
billings, and if it's systematic...

200
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:55,227
...and you establish a pattern,
it could be class-action.

201
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,688
What do I do now? I mean, what next?

202
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,941
Well, you need more information.
You don't want to go off half-cocked.

203
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,568
Full cock.

204
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:06,321
Okay. Now, I'm gonna head back there.
Thank you.

205
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,157
You're the best.

206
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,756
Back to see Mrs. Landry.

207
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,135
Okay.

208
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,638
- What gives?
- Sorry, sir. New policy.

209
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:35,058
We're concerned about
solicitation on the premises.

210
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,769
I'm not a gigolo
if that's what you're implying.

211
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,896
Legal solicitation.

212
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,609
We are obligated to protect
our residents from being harassed.

213
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,944
And we have the right to refuse entry.

214
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:51,366
I have clients in there now.
They have a legal right to meet with me.

215
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,870
Well, you'll just have to arrange
to meet them elsewhere.

216
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,669
Oh, come on, guys. Seriously?
You making Soylent Green back there?

217
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,174
All right. Okay. I'm backing away.

218
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,842
Yeah?

219
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,847
You know what?

220
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,976
Hey, this has gotten me
a little bit stirred up down there.

221
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:22,439
Can I use your restroom?
Please. I've got IBS.

222
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:24,983
Go ahead.

223
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,929
"To Sandpiper Crossing.

224
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,308
Clients of James M. McGill,
this is to inform you..."

225
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,852
Sir, are you all right in there?

226
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,604
"We believe that..."
"Breach of contract..."

227
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,776
Come on now, sir.
I've been very patient.

228
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,153
"Clear pattern of malfeasance..."

229
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,030
"Negligent infliction
of emotional stress."

230
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,241
Sir, I need you to finish up
and come out.

231
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,119
"Contact by the end of the week
or I'll be forced to move forward."

232
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,663
- I need you to finish...
- This is a demand letter...

233
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,040
...informing Sandpiper Crossing
of litigation...

234
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,543
...for defrauding my clients
through overcharging.

235
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,714
You're shredding in there. I'm not deaf.
I can hear you. Stop right now.

236
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,757
This here.
This makes it official, all right?

237
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,094
If you don't stop shredding now,
that's destruction of evidence.

238
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,012
Spoliation, that's what it's called.

239
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:40,100
And it's a felony. So call your lawyers
right now and tell them I said that. Me.

240
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,561
James McGill, Esquire.

241
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,564
I'm telling you, guys. Big mistake.

242
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,464
- Hey.
- Hey.

243
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,759
- Am I calling at a bad time?
- No. Not at all.

244
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,888
- How you doing?
- Pretty good. Getting by.

245
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,349
- How about you?
- Getting by.

246
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,435
It's good to hear from you.

247
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:28,231
Yeah. I've been... There's been
a lot going on. You know how it is.

248
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,400
Yeah. I know.

249
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,988
Listen, I was hoping maybe
you could do me a favour.

250
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,282
Do you think you could watch Kaylee?

251
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,744
It'd be during my shift,
the day after tomorrow.

252
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,705
I hate to ask,
but my regular sitter's down...

253
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,917
Anything you need, I'll be there.

254
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,295
You can get off work?
I don't want to impose or anything.

255
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,214
No. Anytime.

256
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,888
It's not an imposition.

257
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,640
Thanks.

258
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,725
Appreciate it.

259
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,977
Yeah. No problem.

260
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,773
- At quarter to 2?
- I'll see you then.

261
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,983
Okay.

262
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,834
Jesus.

263
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,508
Come on.

264
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,469
Where is it?

265
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,602
Goddamn it.

266
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:24,741
It's not like we're close to being done.
Can't you get somebody else to do it?

267
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,370
Right. They don't pay any of us
enough for this shit.

268
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,122
And it's going on and on.
And so I'm like:

269
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:34,793
"Why are you making
your problems my problems?"

270
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,170
Right. Like you don't have
problems of your own.

271
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,756
Exactly. That's exactly
what I'm saying. Thank you.

272
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,645
James McGill.

273
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,648
Mr. McGill, Rich Schweikart
of Schweikart and Cokely.

274
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,318
We're the firm representing
Sandpiper Crossing. How are you?

275
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,487
Quite well, thank you.

276
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:05,240
- How are you?
- Doing fine. Doing fine.

277
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,784
Sorry to call so late.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

278
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,911
No. No. No. It's fine.

279
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,788
It's just that you're whispering.

280
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,876
- I'm at the opera.
- What opera?

281
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,171
- Magic Flute.
- Mozart. Lovely.

282
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,215
Well, I'll try not to keep you.

283
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:27,512
We received something from you today
and we're not quite sure what.

284
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,264
It's a demand letter.

285
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,685
It was a little confusing
because it was written on...

286
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,729
Well, I had to write it quickly...

287
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:39,607
...because your clients were in the
process of destroying evidence.

288
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,527
Mr. McGill, if you're talking about
shredding documents...

289
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,864
...that's neither irregular nor illegal.
Every business does it.

290
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,992
You say potato, I say spoliation.

291
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,369
Maybe walk me through
what you're alleging here.

292
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,413
I believe it's all in the letter.

293
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,917
I'm not saying it's not.
But it's a bit hard to read.

294
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,045
Next time, I'd use double ply.

295
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:04,049
Let's not fixate on the medium, okay?
Let's look at the message.

296
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:08,720
Your clients are facing
multiple counts of elder abuse...

297
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,974
...and fraud, and deceptive
and unfair trade practises.

298
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,893
And that's just the start, okay?

299
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,520
I'm not a betting man,
but I'd bet I'll find more.

300
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,899
Mr. McGill,
are you related to Charles McGill?

301
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,901
He's my brother.

302
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,903
Yeah? How's he doing these days?

303
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,574
I fail to see the relevance of this.

304
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:33,328
The only reason that I made this phone
call was out of respect for Charles...

305
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,455
...on the off chance
you might be related.

306
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,667
My partner suggested to send a
Rule 11 letter and have you sanctioned.

307
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,795
But I didn't want to
jump to that immediately.

308
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,882
How about you stop trying to rattle
my cage and just respond to the merits?

309
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,133
This is my response.

310
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,261
You have no good-faith basis
to threaten litigation.

311
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,889
This is a shakedown
and we both know it.

312
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,643
Now, if you push this any further,
my hands will be tied.

313
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,939
I'm sorry for interrupting your evening.
Enjoy the Magic Flute.

314
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,067
Blow my magic flute.

315
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,362
Jimmy, what're you doing here?

316
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,324
Oh, Chuck. I'm sorry to...

317
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,827
...show up like this.
I just needed space to work.

318
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:23,164
What is all this?
What have you done to my dining room?

319
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,708
They were spoliating,
the Sandpiper people.

320
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,253
They wouldn't let me in.
I could see they were shredding.

321
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:31,631
- I wrote them a demand letter, I gave it...
- You broke into a nursing home?

322
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,092
- Assisted living.
- And you stole their garbage.

323
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,928
No, it was in public.
There was no lock, no nothing.

324
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,305
I just lifted the lid and there it was.

325
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:43,226
There's no reasonable expectation
of privacy in that situation, is there?

326
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,479
You can't say it's private
if a hobo can use it as a wigwam.

327
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,857
That's the standard, right,
if animals or vagrants can get in?

328
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,069
More or less, yes.

329
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,449
Okay, so this is all legal.
It's completely above-the-belt legal.

330
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,494
I just need to figure out
what they're trying to cover up.

331
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,622
You don't shred like this
unless you got something to hide.

332
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,582
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, come on, Chuck.

333
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,752
A lawyer shows up,
starts figuring out their little scheme.

334
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,089
And suddenly this?
No, it's not a coincidence. It's in here.

335
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,426
Well, at least it's not cross-cut.

336
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,886
Look, you won't even
know I'm here, okay?

337
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,014
I just need some space
and some quiet.

338
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,141
And I'll be out of your hair as soon as...

339
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,310
Stop. Stop. It's okay.
You can work here.

340
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,312
Thanks.

341
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,023
I don't mind the company.

342
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,401
You look like you could
use a cup of coffee.

343
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,987
Good God, yes.

344
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,281
I'll put it on.

345
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,240
Up, up. Up.

346
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,998
God's sweet sake.

347
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,712
Oh, good. You're up.

348
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,802
Well, Jesus, Chuck,
how long have I been asleep?

349
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,346
Chuck, how did you...?

350
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,475
I can't believe this.

351
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,688
Thank you. This is a huge help.

352
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,524
I felt like I was
shovelling snow in a blizzard.

353
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,776
Well, it gets better.

354
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,028
What's this?

355
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,905
It's your smoking gun.

356
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,867
It's an invoice for syringes.

357
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,702
Yes. From?

358
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,913
Morrissey Medical Supply.
Lincoln, Nebraska.

359
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,458
- So?
- Trust me.

360
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,043
Meanwhile, we need to
start pulling case law.

361
00:29:56,253 --> 00:30:01,340
Any precedent dealing
with 18 U.S.C. 1961 to '68.

362
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:08,306
Probably not a bad idea to pull
30-47-1 from NMSA. 1978.

363
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,225
I don't think that's gonna play, really.

364
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,394
But it's a good opening salvo for us.

365
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,730
Wait. "Us"?

366
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,316
We're working together on this?

367
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,277
That's up to you, Jimmy.

368
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:32,788
All right. All right. All right.
Let's get to work.

369
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,224
- Kim Wexler.
- Hey, gorgeous.

370
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,393
Oh, man.
Sweet talking right out of the gate.

371
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,563
You want something.
Make it fast. I want to go home.

372
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:01,150
Okay. Okay. Will you look
something up for me on Westlaw?

373
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,693
Please?

374
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,363
You're lucky I'm a pushover.

375
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,490
- All right. Hit me.
- Thank you.

376
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,618
Anything on Sedima v. Imrex.

377
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,746
Schlesinger v. Disney.
Holmes v. SIPC.

378
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,957
Whoa, slow down. Slow down.
v. Disney.

379
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,460
- Holmes v. SI...
- PC, yeah.

380
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:25,424
Anything on 5712,
one through 24, NMSA, 1978.

381
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,970
Okay. It would help if I knew
what you were looking for, here.

382
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,471
Anything. Everything.

383
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,640
You want me to just
read you the headnotes?

384
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,559
No. No. Print it. Full cases.

385
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:38,729
And any cases that cite to those cases.
Shepardise like the wolf's at the door.

386
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,482
Jesus, Jimmy.
That's gonna be thousands of pages.

387
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:45,444
Pretty please with sugar on top?
Come on. You owe me one.

388
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:49,657
Yes, I do. But this is gonna
take hours. And who do I bill it to?

389
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,702
Bill it to Howard.
I still remember his code, 1933.

390
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,662
Same year Hitler came to power.

391
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,748
You're not funny.
I'm not billing it to my boss.

392
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,917
How about yours? I'll pay you back.

393
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,712
Jimmy, this is three...
Four hundred bucks worth of printing.

394
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,507
The accountants will find it. I'll get fired.
Which sounds fun, but no.

395
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,135
Okay. Hold on a sec.

396
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,641
Hey. Kim can't print without a code.

397
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,685
Should I go there,
take notes, come back?

398
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,896
No, no. It'd take too long.
Use mine, 1868.

399
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,398
Yeah.

400
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,905
- 1868, use that. It's Chuck's.
- You're using Chuck's number?

401
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,616
Chuck know you're
using Chuck's number?

402
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,744
We're working on something.
Bring it over to his place after.

403
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,663
- You're a lifesaver.
- Wait. You're working a case together?

404
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,666
Yeah. Keep this under your hat.
But it's gonna be huge.

405
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,918
Maybe a class-action, even.

406
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:46,088
We think it will settle
for one, maybe two million.

407
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,383
How does that work?
Chuck's a partner at HHM.

408
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:54,305
I know Chuck's partnership agreement.
He can work with outside parties.

409
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,850
That clause is intended for
small-time stuff, pro bono cases.

410
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,771
So I'm bono. I'm very bono.
Chuck's a rock star. They'll work it out.

411
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,524
And Chuck can handle this?
Last time I saw him, he was...

412
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,610
Last time you saw him,
he wasn't himself, okay?

413
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,195
This is good for him.

414
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,783
- Okay.
- What?

415
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,495
I don't know. I'm just... Whatever.
I'll see you in a couple hours.

416
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,040
Okay. We're ordering
a pizza. I'll save you a slice.

417
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,978
Hey, you know, if you don't separate
those, you're gonna end up with brown.

418
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,565
- Hello?
- Hey.

419
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,235
We're in here.

420
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:54,573
We're playing sculptor.
She's Michel-angelina.

421
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:59,245
- How's work?
- Oh, you know. Work.

422
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,830
How'd it go?

423
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,958
Kid's a dream. She's easy.

424
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,336
And you better stay that way.

425
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,966
How you doing, sweetie, huh?

426
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,636
Well. I better be going.

427
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:19,890
Oh, wait. Hang on a sec, would you?
I wanna talk to you about something.

428
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,143
What's up?

429
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,566
I wanna know what
I should do with this.

430
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,694
I've been carrying it around for weeks.

431
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,321
Like, holding on to it.

432
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,866
Every place I put it feels wrong.

433
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,577
I thought about putting it
in the collection plate...

434
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:43,456
...but that seemed, I don't know...

435
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,333
Look, with Matty gone,
I have expenses.

436
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,919
And the death benefit helped, but...

437
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:54,800
What I wanna ask you is...
Can I spend this?

438
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,385
Stace...

439
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,889
...if this money helps you and Kaylee...

440
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:05,227
...if it does a single good thing in this
world, then you spend every penny.

441
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,938
It's a relief.

442
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,316
It'll help a lot.

443
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,865
Of course,
it's only a drop in the bucket.

444
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,707
I swear, everyone I know
has had problems with them.

445
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:30,753
I had one. The computer in the engine,
it locked in the middle of the Rockies.

446
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,048
Yeah, it decided I was
overheating and that was it.

447
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,509
Yeah. I couldn't get it fixed
for 100 miles.

448
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,053
I had to have it towed to Telluride.
It was unbelievable.

449
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,721
No.

450
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:44,308
No, it's the chip. It's the little...

451
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:49,063
Yeah. It's like 800 bucks,
not counting labour...

452
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,402
Hey, Mel, can I call you back?

453
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:08,833
Chuck, the Sandpiper has landed.

454
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,052
Gentlemen,
I'm Jimmy McGill. Welcome.

455
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:23,514
Rich Schweikart.
This is Alvin Reese. Phil Jergens.

456
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,933
Thanks for coming.
Whoa, I have to ask you.

457
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,102
Please leave electronics in the car.

458
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,688
Laptops, BlackBerries,
PalmPilots, watches.

459
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,315
If you lick it
and it goes... leave it here.

460
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,775
Why?

461
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,444
My brother Chuck
has a certain sensitivity.

462
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:40,739
It's a medical condition.
This is the price of admission.

463
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,285
Yeah, I heard about this.
Go ahead. It's fine.

464
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,706
There you go.

465
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,588
Make yourselves comfortable,
gentlemen.

466
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,131
I'll be right back.

467
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:08,017
Chuck, come on, buddy.

468
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,644
I'm...

469
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:15,399
- I don't know if I can do this.
- You can do this, all right?

470
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,318
These guys...

471
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:23,032
Those guys, they're nothing, okay?
They're the Pistons and you're the Bulls.

472
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:28,871
All right? All you gotta do is
sit there and look intimidating.

473
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,333
They're scared of you already.
And they should be.

474
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,793
You're Charles McGill.

475
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,671
Let's go. Let's go get them.

476
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,683
Hey. Do you remember me, Charles?
We were on a co-defence.

477
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,894
Church's Donuts v. Amendola?

478
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,190
It was, Jesus, nine,
ten years ago. Yeah.

479
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,609
Our guys were suing the other guys.

480
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:02,696
They were suing us right back. The city
had some grievance with everyone.

481
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,699
So we had to bundle, like,
four actions together.

482
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,826
I was sure that we were sunk. But you...

483
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,162
You quoted... What was it?

484
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,999
Addyston Pipe and Steel.

485
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,461
You turned it all antitrust and the whole
thing went away in summary judgment.

486
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:19,713
It was amazing. It was amazing.

487
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:23,467
I figured you'd be arguing in front
of the Supreme Court someday.

488
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:28,931
- Well, it's good to see you.
- Yeah.

489
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,936
All right. Well, let's get started.

490
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:40,234
We've read your revised demand.
It's quite a laundry list. Very creative.

491
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,485
Yeah, creative.

492
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:44,571
Like the way your clients
have been billing my clients.

493
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,282
Because that's like
Salvador Dali creative.

494
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,743
Cute. You know,
you're not gonna make this stick.

495
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,912
Setting aside evidentiary concerns...

496
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:57,126
You guys couldn't afford 10 bucks for a
padlock, that's on them. Public property.

497
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,879
Maybe a judge sees that your way.
Maybe he doesn't.

498
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,840
But the damages for elder abuse...

499
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,218
...the statute requires proof that
there was some undue influence.

500
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,555
Someone threatening the
residents of Sandpiper Crossing.

501
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,057
No one has claimed
there was a guy with a knife...

502
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,101
...telling them to
hand over lunch money.

503
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,562
There are a lot of
assisted living facilities out there...

504
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,063
...that may be disreputable.

505
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,857
But that's not the case with our client.

506
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:24,194
All their facilities, all 12 of them,
every single one, five-star rated.

507
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:28,115
You go to any one of them right now,
you'll see happy, healthy residents.

508
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:31,535
Sandpiper takes care of these people.
They don't bilk them.

509
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,662
But we looked into it.

510
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:37,791
And some of your clients have,
in fact, been overbilled.

511
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:41,712
It's an accounting error. It doesn't rise
to the level of fraud, not even close.

512
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:46,300
We've calculated the damages.
All told, it's $46,320.

513
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:50,262
So here's what we're prepared to do.

514
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,765
We're gonna make your clients whole.

515
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,768
A cheque for the 46 and change
right now.

516
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,436
And on top of that...

517
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,939
...we'll give you another
46K to cover your expenses.

518
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:05,110
So what's that, 92?
Let's call it $100,000 even.

519
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,531
We admit to no wrongdoing.
And your clients release all claims.

520
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,333
I think you're gonna need
to do better than that.

521
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,338
This was in your demand letter.

522
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,590
They're syringes. So?

523
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,925
I don't know if you know this...

524
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,969
...but that's a standard item
in an assisted living facility.

525
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,013
Correct,
but it's not what it is that matters.

526
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,264
It's where it's from.

527
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,518
Lincoln, Nebraska.

528
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,853
Go, Cornhuskers.

529
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,820
Since you're not picking up what
I'm putting down, I'll explain it to you.

530
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,865
Nebraska, although they both
begin with the letter "N"...

531
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:55,786
...actually turns out to be a
different state than New Mexico.

532
00:40:55,995 --> 00:41:01,792
So your client accepted shipments
across state lines for its enterprise.

533
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,045
In the U.S. mail, no less.

534
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,799
Are you trying to make this
a RICO case?

535
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,009
Like our client
is John Gotti or something?

536
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:14,638
You know as well as I do,
RICO's used mostly for business beefs.

537
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:19,143
Sedima establishes a pretty low
threshold for RICO provisions to kick in.

538
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,980
Interstate commerce is a bitch, huh?

539
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:27,192
Soon as we establish a pattern to...
What was your word? "Overbillings"?

540
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,904
I prefer the classic term of "fraud."

541
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:34,366
You're looking at treble damages
so your 100 grand...

542
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:37,077
...I think you know where
you can stick it.

543
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,918
Will you give us a moment?

544
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:01,351
Well, what number exactly
did you have in mind?

545
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,980
Twenty million.

546
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,940
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

547
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:11,361
- Oh, you can't expect...
- Twenty million dollars.

548
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,656
Or we'll see you in court.

549
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,048
- Twenty million?
- Didn't you hear them?

550
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:35,219
This is a big company.
Twelve separate facilities.

551
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,763
They can't possibly
all be in New Mexico.

552
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,683
This is potentially a multi-state
federal class action lawsuit...

553
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,228
...with a RICO kicker
at the penalty phase.

554
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,356
Twenty million, that's conservative.

555
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,691
Class cert, that's where we start.

556
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,694
I'll draft our complaint.
Try to get us a conditional one.

557
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,822
They'll try to pierce it. It should hold
long enough to start discovery.

558
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,033
And we need to get you
back on the grounds.

559
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:03,747
Quash this prohibition against you.
Some injunctive relief. Maybe a TRO.

560
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,795
Jimmy, do you want to get
started on the TRO?

561
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,129
Yeah. Yes.

562
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:41,493
It looks good.
No heartworm. No mange.

563
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:44,621
- Where'd you get her?
- Shelter.

564
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:48,166
Good. There's too many
puppy mills out there.

565
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,127
I had a dachsie in the other day.

566
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,005
Some douche bred her
so much, poor thing.

567
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:57,384
She just had one giant hernia for a belly.
Couldn't even walk.

568
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:01,388
Those people can go straight
to hell as far as I'm concerned.

569
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,852
Anything else I can do for you?

570
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,188
You still in touch with your people?

571
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,983
Depends on the type
of work you're looking for.

572
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,403
Your do's, your don'ts
Your wills, your won'ts.

573
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:20,699
Well, you tell me what you got,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

574
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,797
I signed up three more
clients at the mall today.

575
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:39,801
Jesus, those mall walkers,
those geezers are faster than you think.

576
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,514
I could sleep for a decade.

577
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,315
Did you get what I asked?

578
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,401
The code provisions.

579
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,236
Shit.

580
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:01,740
It's in the car.

581
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,578
Just give me a minute. I'll...

582
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,955
I'll go.

583
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,963
Where's the...?

584
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,665
Chuck?

585
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,765
Chuck?

586
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,517
Yeah?
