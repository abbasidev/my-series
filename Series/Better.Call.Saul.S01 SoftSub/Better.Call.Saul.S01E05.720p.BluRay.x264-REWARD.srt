1
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,244
Albuquerpue police. Hello?

2
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,802
We'd like to talk with you for a minute.
Could you open the door, please?

3
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,015
We know you're in there.

4
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,726
You're casting a shadow
through your peep hole.

5
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,772
All we wanna do is talk.
Would you please open the door?

6
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,983
I'd prefer not to, officers.

7
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:52,069
Sir, come on and open up.

8
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,697
I have a condition.

9
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:58,201
I can't go outside
or be exposed to what's out there.

10
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,995
You were able to steal
your neighbour's newspaper.

11
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,623
I didn't steal it. I left $5.

12
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,708
The cover price is 50 cents.

13
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:09,504
Did your neighbour consent
to sell you her paper?

14
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:11,964
She...

15
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,800
Isn't...?

16
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:21,682
Officer, let's talk about something
called "probable cause."

17
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,851
As I'm sure you know,
in New Mexico...

18
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,063
...there is a two-part test
to determine whether police...

19
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,774
...have an objectively
reasonable basis...

20
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:45,706
the situation as Mincey v. Arizona
pointed out...

21
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,125
...create an event...

22
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,428
Hey, Tommy,
come around here, would you?

23
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,557
And that's why the Tenth Circuit
Court of Appeals...

24
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,518
...ruled that a coercive order...

25
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,895
Check this out.

26
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:17,947
Requiring an individual
to leave his house is seizure.

27
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:23,035
And therefore protected
under the Fourth Amendment.

28
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,912
Right?

29
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,707
Whole lot of camp stove fuel.

30
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,586
- Guy sure sounds like a tweaker.
- See what he did to the breaker box?

31
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,922
Is he coming out, or are we going in?

32
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:48,185
You got ten seconds to open this door
or it's coming down, you hear me?

33
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,771
- Final warning.
- Okay, I'll let you in.

34
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,399
But leave your electronic
devices outside.

35
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,027
No phones, no walkie-talkies,
no flashlights.

36
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,905
Definitely, definitely no Tasers.

37
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,365
I can't emphasise that enough. Deal?

38
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,993
Or... Look, look, I'll give the paper back.

39
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,659
Yeah?

40
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,620
James McGill
to see Mr. Richard Sypes.

41
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,497
Ricky. Call me Ricky.

42
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,666
Come on in.

43
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,989
This is my assistant's car.

44
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,408
My Mercedes is in the shop.

45
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,662
Yeah, I ought to give him a raise.
You're right.

46
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,585
Jim, I saw you on the TV.
That billboard thing?

47
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,796
And I had me a pair of insights.

48
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,925
Insight the first:
You ain't afraid to put yourself out there.

49
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:47,221
And insight the second:
You believe in the real America.

50
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,266
Freedom. Self-sufficiency.

51
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,393
I do. I...

52
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,145
I really do.

53
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,232
When I see a man like you driving
that foreign shitbox of a car...

54
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,567
Well, see, actually...

55
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,696
it's a sign a good man
can't get ahead today.

56
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,865
It's a travesty, that's what it is.

57
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,035
Well, that may be, Ricky.

58
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:14,206
But I refuse to consider myself a victim.

59
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,962
You know, we are once again
at a point in our history...

60
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,798
...where the fly-swatting hand
of government...

61
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,676
...is crushing the spirit
of entrepreneurship.

62
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,472
Taxes, OSHA requirements.

63
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:34,935
The INS poking their big fat nose
into every mother-loving hire.

64
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,271
It's damned oppressive.

65
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,898
It's tragic.

66
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,192
It's un-American.

67
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,740
Jim, I think you are just
the lawyer I need.

68
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,366
Because I got me a case.

69
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,369
Major. I say, a major case.

70
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,539
Are you ready to clear your calendar?

71
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,712
Ricky, I'm all ears.

72
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,841
I want to secede
from the United States.

73
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,220
Now, I got 1100 acres of property here.

74
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,056
Self-sustaining
with solar power and wells.

75
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,560
A sovereign state immune
to the business-killing regulations...

76
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,189
...of the country
in which it geographically lies.

77
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,401
We are going to be America's
Vatican City.

78
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,823
Ricky...

79
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,991
...I'm your man.

80
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,956
Yeah. Let's do this.
Let's show them all.

81
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,213
Yes, we are doing this.

82
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,508
Now, it's not gonna be easy.

83
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,302
The government is gonna fight us
tooth and nail.

84
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:54,348
We could end up in the Supreme Court.
I'm talking thousands of man hours.

85
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,268
I mean, years of effort.

86
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,355
Are you ready for that?

87
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:02,982
Me?

88
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,025
I say bring them on.

89
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,236
Let's talk turkey.

90
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,529
What's your rate?

91
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,743
Four hundred and fifty an hour.

92
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,331
To hell with hourly.

93
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,041
I want you on retainer.

94
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,879
How about one million even?

95
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,548
Five hundred up front...

96
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,384
...and 500 when we're done.

97
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,096
A million? That seems...

98
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,182
...fair.

99
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,517
Would you like that in cash?

100
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,734
Tax-free and backed
by the full faith and credit...

101
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,862
...of the sovereign Sandia Republic.

102
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,698
It's...

103
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,119
Son.

104
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,873
You are getting in on the ground floor.

105
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,396
Mr. McGill, hi.
Thanks so much for coming.

106
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
Roland Jaycox. Roland.

107
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,983
Hey, Roland. Great to meet you.

108
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,319
- You can call me Jimmy.
- Jimmy, absolutely. Hello.

109
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,780
- Please, come on in.
- Well, thank you.

110
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,826
What was it like climbing that billboard?
Must've been pretty scary, huh?

111
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,954
Guy needed help, that's all.

112
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,374
You know? If I can do it, anybody could.

113
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,584
Well, my hat is off to you.

114
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,503
So here we are.

115
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,505
And patent law is something you...?

116
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,425
Oh, yeah. I do so many patent cases...

117
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,803
...I should probably just go ahead
and specialise already.

118
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,471
So, what do we got?

119
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,348
- I feel silly asking this.
- Yeah.

120
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,309
Before I show you my invention...

121
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,894
...you mind signing
a non-disclosure agreement?

122
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,272
You got it. No problem.

123
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,778
It's my idea of a lifetime. If Fisher-Price
or Playskool got their hands on this...

124
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,030
No worries.

125
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,165
You ready?

126
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,258
I may have seen one of these before.

127
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,926
Not like this.

128
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,597
This one has this little unit I've added.
This is my invention.

129
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,182
- Do you have children?
- No.

130
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,351
My wife and I have two boys, 4 and 6.

131
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,562
And let me tell you. Toilet training them?
Nightmare.

132
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,982
Both times. They just didn't
wanna use the commode.

133
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,568
So I wired a motion sensor
to a voice chip.

134
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:39,406
Well, no sense getting all technical,
but it's all about positive reinforcement.

135
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,909
Meet Tony the Toilet Buddy.

136
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,411
And when you sit down
to do your business...

137
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,330
...this is how he works.

138
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:56,215
Oh, yeah. That's the way.

139
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,889
Gosh, you're big. You're so big.

140
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,309
My goodness, look at you.

141
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,607
Fill me up, Chandler. Put it in me.

142
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,860
Chandler's my youngest. Loves it.

143
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,991
Give it to me, Chandler. I want it all.

144
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,666
Anyway, it goes on from there.
You get the picture.

145
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,877
Yeah. I...

146
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,880
Yeah.

147
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,758
So, what do you think?

148
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,597
It's a little sexual maybe?

149
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,100
Sexual? What does that...?

150
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,229
Suggestive, maybe?
Maybe that's a better word.

151
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,024
Look, I'm not saying this thing
won't make you rich.

152
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,069
Some wealthier Pacific Rim nations,
they'll love this.

153
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,946
The crazy bastards.

154
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,908
I created this for children.

155
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,244
- Children. Understand?
- Hey.

156
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:11,123
Viagra was originally invented
to treat hypertension.

157
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,292
Look how that turned out.

158
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,504
You're completely disgusting.

159
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,923
Buddy,
you're the one with the sex toilet.

160
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,383
Get off my property!

161
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,719
Know what?
I hope you do make a fortune.

162
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,598
Because Chandler's gonna need it
to help pay for his therapy.

163
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,219
I found the Alpine shepherd boy.

164
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,622
No, no, you just stay put.

165
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,916
I'll be right over.

166
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,796
Now, where were we?
Oh, would you like some more tea?

167
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,507
No. No, thank you. I'm fine.

168
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,384
Now, the shepherd boy Hummel...

169
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,803
...that's gonna go to your nephew
Clarence?

170
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,680
As long as he finishes college.

171
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,558
If he drops out, it goes to my niece
Raylene.

172
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,810
But then Raylene doesn't get the girl...

173
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,565
The girl with the geese, I know.
That would go to your cousin Helen.

174
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,651
So long as she never
remarries Frederick?

175
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,236
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

176
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,948
And no matter what,
I want the towheaded twins...

177
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:53,285
...to go to Reverend Laurence's
grandson.

178
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,412
Don't you mean Reverend Haynes?

179
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:59,916
Reverend Laurence's grandson
is going to get the lute-playing angel...

180
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,835
...because he was in the choir.

181
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,088
Very sharp, Mr. McGill.

182
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,091
And here I thought
all lawyers were idiots.

183
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,970
No, only half of us are idiots.
The other half are crooks.

184
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,433
- Aren't you a spicy one.
- Well...

185
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,103
If I were 40 years younger,
I'd have you buy me a piña colada.

186
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,731
Well, if you want me to draw up a DNR...

187
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,442
...I'll bring a blender
and some pineapple.

188
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,195
I knew I'd like you when I saw...

189
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,282
...how you saved that poor man
on the television.

190
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,285
Moxie is in such short supply
these days.

191
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,747
Yeah, well, I pride myself on my moxie.

192
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:43,335
Now, I hate to do this, but I do need
to bring up my payment.

193
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,756
And I'm sorry,
but I can't accept S&H Green Stamps.

194
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:53,679
Now, my fee is $140.

195
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,390
A hundred and forty.

196
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,102
I'll gladly accept 70 today...

197
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:04,272
...and 70 when I come back
with the completed documents.

198
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,335
Twenty, 40...

199
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,756
...sixty, 80...

200
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,676
...a hundred...

201
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,970
...and 20...

202
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,346
...forty.

203
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,017
Okay.

204
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,189
- Shall we continue, Mr. McGill?
- Yes.

205
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,234
Yes, we shall, Mrs. Strauss.

206
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,904
Put it on the nail, not the skin.

207
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:57,701
I can't help it if your toes are too small.
They should all be the same size.

208
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,537
Size of the big toe. That one I can do.

209
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,123
Yeah, that would be attractive.

210
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,042
So.

211
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,670
How's it go again?

212
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,716
"You're huge, Chandler.

213
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,343
You're a big, big boy.

214
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,804
Oh, where does it end?"

215
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,223
"Oh, don't stop, Chandler.

216
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,726
Don't stop!

217
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,895
Here it comes."

218
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,397
"Oh, what is that?
Is that a piece of corn?

219
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,648
No, no.

220
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,900
Did you eat corn?

221
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,610
- Is that a niblet I see?"
- Stop. Disgusting.

222
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,737
- No.
- Too much?

223
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,614
Hey, good times.

224
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,659
Even your lousy days are more
interesting than my good ones.

225
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,537
Yeah, we should definitely
do something about that.

226
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,418
Seriously, don't ever try
to make a living at this.

227
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,670
- Stick with the law.
- Yeah.

228
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,506
Because I'm really...

229
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,342
...lighting the world on fire
in that department.

230
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,719
Did two wills today.

231
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,181
Two wills, and I started a living trust.

232
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,599
Old people love me.

233
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,851
Maybe you got a future in elder law.

234
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,728
You think I could handle
all that glamour?

235
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,605
No, I'm serious.

236
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,399
I've thought about getting into elder law
myself.

237
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:15,529
I watched my grandmother at the end.

238
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,406
It's awful what people have to deal with.

239
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,450
Insurance companies.

240
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,287
My scumbag cousin stealing her savings
and her pain meds.

241
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,332
Getting old sucks.

242
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:30,168
Seniors need someone on their side.

243
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,886
- It's Howard.
- What the hell does he want?

244
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,725
Hi, Howard.

245
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,229
No. I mean, I haven't...

246
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,357
Oh, my God, when?

247
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:58,530
Yeah, okay.
I'll see if I can track Jimmy down.

248
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,366
I'll call you back. Sure.

249
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,496
It's Chuck.

250
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,509
Chuck. Chuck, you with me?

251
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,344
Chuck, hey, buddy, it's me!

252
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,722
Hey, can you talk to me?

253
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,309
Crazy sons of bitches.

254
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,811
Hey, hey, sir.

255
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,564
You can't do that.
All of this needs to stay on.

256
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,858
No, no. No electricity, you understand?

257
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,360
No, it needs to be on.
I'm getting security.

258
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,821
No, wait, wait. Wait, wait.
No, wait, wait.

259
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,073
- Why isn't that one going out?
- Stop.

260
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,992
- Damn it.
- Jimmy.

261
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,785
Just... Jimmy, wait a second.

262
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,288
Jimmy, think. What's the plan here?

263
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,457
Sir, sir?

264
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,167
Sir, I need you to get down.

265
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,502
What kind of torture chamber
you running?

266
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,839
- He's allergic to electricity.
- You heard the doc. Get down.

267
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,468
You might as well throw him
into a microwave. Don't touch me.

268
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,721
He is this patient's brother.
Please, listen to him.

269
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,185
- Now, hey.
- Let's go.

270
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,771
Hold on, hold on a second, Edwin.
Sir.

271
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,190
- You ready to calm down?
- His name's Jimmy.

272
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,775
And he is gonna calm down.

273
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:21,905
- Say the words, Jimmy. I need to hear it.
- I'm calm, okay? I'm calm.

274
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,908
Why don't you go wait in the hallway?

275
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,243
I'll call if we need you.

276
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,623
Okay, so tell me about the electricity.

277
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:36,461
Look, I know how it sounds,
but it's real. Oh, shit.

278
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,839
My phone. Stuff.
Anything with a battery in it.

279
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,175
- He can't have it near him.
- Hang on.

280
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,388
There's my phone. Okay, that's it.

281
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,224
Thanks.

282
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,564
Okay. What the hell happened?
Why is he here?

283
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,985
It started when Charles
stole his neighbour's newspaper.

284
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,903
What? He never leaves the house.

285
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,446
I don't have all the details.

286
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,865
Police found him
in a very agitated state.

287
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,243
He was confrontational
and incoherent.

288
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,328
How come you didn't call me?

289
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,038
Why did I have to hear about this...

290
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,916
...through my brother's
prick of a law partner?

291
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:18,420
The only contact information
we could find was a business card.

292
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,880
Jimmy, in my opinion...

293
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,468
...Charles should be committed
for 30 days of psychiatric observation.

294
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:29,639
As a family member, you can submit
a petition for him to be evaluated.

295
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,142
There's an excellent facility
in Las Cruces.

296
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,270
He can be there tomorrow.

297
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,440
I'd rather not.

298
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,276
Hey, buddy. Hey, I'm right here.

299
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,570
- Oh, hey, Chuck.
- Excuse me.

300
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:48,450
Mr. McGill, my name is Dr. Cruz.
Do you know why you're in the hospital?

301
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,454
The police kicked in my door.
No warrant.

302
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,955
No cause.

303
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,125
I wasn't incoherent.
They just weren't listening.

304
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,377
They Tasered me, Jimmy.

305
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,920
Oh, Jesus.

306
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,423
Kim?

307
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,761
- I'm sorry, I can give you privacy.
- No, no, no, that's all right. Stay.

308
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,222
Howard called me.
He's very concerned about you.

309
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:14,267
How are you feeling now, Mr. McGill?

310
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,228
Do...? Do you have a phone
or a pager...

311
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:21,107
- ...or anything with a battery?
- I don't think so. I...

312
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,405
Yeah.

313
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,616
Oversight. Sorry about that.

314
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,580
Can you tell me a little more
about your...

315
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,707
- ...situation?
- It's not a situation.

316
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,709
It's a condition.

317
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,128
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

318
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,632
For reasons unknown, my nervous
system has become sensitized...

319
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,885
...to certain frequencies
of electromagnetic radiation.

320
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,638
Your brother called it
an allergy to electricity.

321
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,681
Well, it's an oversimplification.

322
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,226
But it's essentially correct.

323
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:02,398
Electronic devices create
their own electromagnetic fields.

324
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,026
The closer I am to such devices...

325
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,821
- ...the worse my symptoms.
- Which are?

326
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,281
Burning sensation on my skin...

327
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,201
...a sharp, cold pain in my bones...

328
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,412
...muscle fatigue, heart palpitations...

329
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,081
...blurred vision...

330
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,624
...tinnitus...

331
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,752
...vertigo, nausea, shortness of breath.

332
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,379
- A general...
- It hurts.

333
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,713
Yes, it hurts.

334
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,259
When did you first experience
these symptoms?

335
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,139
- Must have been...
- You left the office 18 months ago.

336
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:38,268
Well, in that case,
must have been almost two years.

337
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,270
Two years? That's a...

338
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,981
That's a long time
to live with discomfort.

339
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,232
Well, there it is.

340
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,319
You think I'm crazy.

341
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,737
I never said that.

342
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,490
No, you didn't,
because you're very polite.

343
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,033
But you think it.

344
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,911
Otherwise you wouldn't
be talking about commitment.

345
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,039
- You find that idea distressing?
- Who the hell wouldn't?

346
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:04,127
I find it inappropriate for a person...

347
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,379
...suffering from a physical condition.

348
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,342
Anyone who's spent more
than a few minutes with me knows...

349
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:15,013
...that this isn't some kind of delusion.
Wouldn't you agree, Kim?

350
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,600
- Of course she does.
- Well, I'm not a doctor.

351
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,643
You've known me for a decade.

352
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:25,565
Have you ever seen me exhibit any sign,
any sign whatsoever, of mental illness?

353
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,901
See? If I thought for one second...

354
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,321
...you could cure me, believe me,
I'd jump at the chance.

355
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,282
All due respect,
psychiatry doesn't have the answers.

356
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,867
I'd very much like to try.

357
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,746
Section 43-1-11, part E3.

358
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,915
"The proposed commitment
is consistent...

359
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,125
...with the treatment needs
of the client...

360
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:48,004
...and with the least drastic
means principle."

361
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:52,342
Do you think subjecting me to this pain
for a month is the least drastic means?

362
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,928
Might as well spend a month
in a wood chipper.

363
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,934
I understand your frustration. I do.

364
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:05,021
You're obviously
a highly-intelligent man...

365
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,857
...in difficult circumstances.

366
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,653
May I ask you a question?
Just for my own interest.

367
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,904
Yeah.

368
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,031
How do you meet
the needs of daily life?

369
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,699
What do you do for light?

370
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,201
How do you prepare food?

371
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,664
I use white gas lanterns.
For cooking, I have a camp stove.

372
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:26,209
I have a large cooler
I keep filled with ice.

373
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,671
It's not ideal, but I make do.

374
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,464
I see.

375
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,049
Well, thank you.

376
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:37,262
Would you mind if I took a moment
to speak with your brother?

377
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,890
Make sure you still have your wallet
when you're done.

378
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,725
Funny guy.

379
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:43,977
Jimmy?

380
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,274
I wanna go home.

381
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,492
That was a dirty trick.

382
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,911
That wasn't a trick.
It was a demonstration.

383
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:06,541
This allergy to electricity isn't real.
It's a manifestation of something deeper.

384
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,378
I'm not saying it's 100 percent real,
but Chuck is smarter than you and me.

385
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,547
So we're not talking him out of this.

386
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,133
And I'm not sending him
to a rubber room.

387
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,302
No one is talking about rubber rooms.

388
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:20,013
- There are specialists...
- He's seen specialists.

389
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,598
The best doctors.
None of them helped. Not one.

390
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,475
So you're ready to give up?

391
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:28,730
Who's giving up, huh? I'm...
I'm the one doing the heavy lifting here.

392
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,983
That white gas?
Who do you think brings him that?

393
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,820
And milk, bread, toilet paper
and ice and every other thing he needs.

394
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,906
Is that helping or enabling?

395
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:44,162
If you testify in a custodial hearing,
he can get help. That's in your power.

396
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,707
To be committed involuntarily,
he has to be a danger to himself.

397
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,709
- Or others.
- And he is.

398
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,795
Coleman lanterns indoors?
A camp stove?

399
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,007
He could burn his house down,
or the entire neighbourhood.

400
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,218
And then you're looking
at a commitment of 10 to 20 years.

401
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,680
What if...? What if he just hurts himself
in a household accident?

402
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,891
How does he call for help?

403
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,854
You have the power
to help your brother.

404
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,023
Truly help him.

405
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:16,778
Ignoring this won't make it go away.

406
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,785
What would you do?

407
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,246
All I know is...

408
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,165
...he needs help.

409
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,428
Untie him.
I'm getting him out of here.

410
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,182
The nurse will bring you release forms.

411
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,073
Oh, boy.

412
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,410
- Jimmy? Kim?
- I found him.

413
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,871
- I thought I'd wait till you got here.
- Great.

414
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,374
- How's he doing?
- Better. Resting.

415
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,000
Good.

416
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,588
Jimmy, I want you to know
that I've talked to the DA...

417
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,467
...and he absolutely will not sign off
on any commitment papers.

418
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,803
This is a physical condition,
not mental.

419
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,515
Chuck is of sound mind.
I think we can all agree on that.

420
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,476
You're a real peach, Howard.

421
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,562
Of course you don't want
Chuck committed.

422
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,148
No, I don't. Why would I?

423
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,192
If Chuck were committed,
I'd become his legal guardian.

424
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,028
- And I'd cash him out of HHM.
- Jesus, Jimmy. Now?

425
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,738
You wanna hash that out here?

426
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,867
The tanning bed must have
melted your brain if you think...

427
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:49,078
- Guys, Chuck, that's why we're here.
- Yes.

428
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,496
Let's stay on point.

429
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:54,375
We're talking about the well-being
of a man whom we all love very much.

430
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:55,751
There's many factors.

431
00:29:55,961 --> 00:30:00,047
- Spite doesn't have to be one of them.
- I was on the fence till you showed up.

432
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,509
Thanks for helping me decide.
Wave bye-bye to your cash cow...

433
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,762
...because it's leaving the pasture.
I'm committing him.

434
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,019
Jimmy... Ji... Wait.

435
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:17,064
Jimmy, wait. Jimmy...
Jimmy, can you wait?

436
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:20,485
Jimmy, wait a second.
Listen, I agree that Chuck needs help.

437
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:24,322
And maybe it's the right thing to do,
but you can't do it like this.

438
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,867
I just wanna see
that son of a bitch sweat.

439
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,119
It's so obvious what he's afraid of.

440
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,206
I'm taking my brother home.

441
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,595
There you go, buddy.

442
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,348
Yeah, there you go. Okay, some steps.

443
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,684
One and two, and there you go.

444
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,436
Hey, you're home.

445
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,356
All right?
Everything's gonna be all right.

446
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,359
You want something to eat?

447
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,861
Some tea? Cup of tea?

448
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,530
Coffee.

449
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,616
Coffee. Coffee it is.

450
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,995
Jimmy, I'm gonna need my...

451
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,081
I don't... I... I...

452
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,416
Oh, it's...

453
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,503
Yeah.

454
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,297
Wanna talk about this?

455
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,049
Nothing to talk about.

456
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:11,345
You took the paper,
you saw this, you got sick.

457
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,390
What's your point?

458
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,186
Chuck, I think you got sick
because you saw this story.

459
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,356
Whenever you think
I've done something wrong...

460
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,692
...something questionable,
you get worse.

461
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,695
I didn't get sick because
I read about you in the paper.

462
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,946
I got sick...

463
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,950
...because I went out of my house
to retrieve the paper...

464
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,287
I'm too tired for this argument, Jimmy.

465
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,164
I've had it too many times.

466
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,043
You think this is the return
of Slippin' Jimmy, but it's not.

467
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,294
All right.

468
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,631
You think the billboard thing
was unethical.

469
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,051
But it was promotion.
It was advertising, that's all.

470
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,512
Which wasn't even allowed
until five Supreme Court justices...

471
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,265
...went bonkers
in Bates v. State Bar of Arizona.

472
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,101
But in any event...

473
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,481
...it's legal. If you wanna advertise,
that's your business.

474
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,399
"Business" being the operative word.

475
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,611
Because I have gotten business
off of this.

476
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,657
Legit business. Wills, trusts.

477
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:16,577
I'm kind of starting to specialise
in elder law.

478
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:17,995
- Elder law?
- Yeah.

479
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,873
The things the elderly have to deal with.
I mean...

480
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:24,085
...relatives coming after their savings,
telemarketers...

481
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:27,838
...reverse-mortgage scams.
I mean, getting old sucks.

482
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:32,551
Seniors need someone on their side,
so you're looking at him.

483
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,431
Oh, that sounds promising.

484
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,142
But it has nothing to do
with my condition.

485
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,770
Chuck, I'm gonna make you
a promise right now.

486
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,314
Not necessary, not requested.

487
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,983
Okay. The billboard
was a one-time thing.

488
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,986
I'm a good lawyer.
I just needed some razzmatazz.

489
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,906
You know, to get the ball rolling.
Some showmanship.

490
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,533
That's all it was. It's done now.

491
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:56,951
- It's over.
- All right.

492
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,662
From here on out,
I'm gonna play by the rules.

493
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,331
- As any lawyer should.
- Exactly.

494
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,583
There are clients out there
who need me.

495
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:08,254
I'm gonna give them the best
representation I know how to provide.

496
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:12,174
I'm on the up-and-up, okay?
I will be good.

497
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:16,929
Slippin' Jimmy, he's back in Cicero.
Dead and buried.

498
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,977
Okay.

499
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,897
We'll see.

500
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,024
Where you going?

501
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,610
Somebody's gotta make that coffee.

502
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,078
I'm sure the truth will come out...

503
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:44,707
...if indeed that's
what we're all interested in.

504
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,917
I know everybody in this courtroom...

505
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,879
...has strong feelings
about Nicholas Baron's past...

506
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:54,633
...but I submit he is not on trial here
for his past.

507
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:59,930
He is on trial for the murders
of Donald Kovack and Eddie Alonzo.

508
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,518
Single-breasted.

509
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,190
Light blue or cream.

510
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,150
It's blue.

511
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,820
Linen.

512
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,540
Simple. Single pocket.

513
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,953
Thank you.

514
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,577
Hello there.
James McGill, attorney at law.

515
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:48,038
- How are you this fine morning?
- I'm just fine. How about you?

516
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,375
Oh, very good. Play fair.

517
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:55,254
Oh, what do we got here? I see...

518
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,715
...a piece is trying to get away here.

519
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,174
Enjoy the Jell-O.

520
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,553
Get to the bottom.
Wait, who's the banker here?

521
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,306
That's the only one I wanna talk to.
There he is.

522
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,099
- How are you?
- Hey. I'm good.

523
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,893
Whoa, what a grip, young man.

524
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,562
Watch out, that's my will-writing hand.

525
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,647
- I'm quite strong, you know.
- Okay.

526
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,942
Hello, ladies. You look beautiful today.

527
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,236
All right over there?

528
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,822
Very good. Play fair.

529
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,073
No betting.

530
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,784
Wait a second, is that Veronica Lake?

531
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,203
Give me a hug, beautiful.

532
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,165
Yes. You look great today.

533
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,709
All right. No cheating,
no hiding the tablet.

534
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,003
Oh, what do we have here?

535
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,806
Hey, there he is. The man in the booth.

536
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,392
John Wilkes Booth. Booth Tarkington.

537
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,977
What you reading there?

538
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,814
The Complete Annotated Book of Rules
for Parking Validation?

539
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,066
No.

540
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,402
The rules for parking validation
are actually pretty simple.

541
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,738
Most people get it on the first try.

542
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,327
Well, you'll be pleased to know
I have the requisite stickers.

543
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,663
Be still my heart.

544
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,122
And...

545
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,376
...you can have this as well.

546
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,544
I'm doing elder law now.

547
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,463
"Need a will, call McGill."

548
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:24,301
So give me a call if you...

549
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:28,639
If you happen to know any elders.

550
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,435
- Good night.
- Couldn't have a bad one if I tried.

551
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,930
- Good night.
- Good night.

552
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,454
Have a good one.

553
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,835
He drove in from El Paso,
but he made good time.

554
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,051
Pick it up on pancakes.

555
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,235
- Eggs over-medium.
- Hash browns.

556
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,576
Eggs over, pick it up.

557
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:24,958
Don't be so silly.

558
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,461
- There's nobody around.
- You never can tell.

559
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,338
- Then I'll come in.
- I wouldn't.

560
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,090
- We're going to be late.
- Don't be bashful, Lucy.

561
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,885
I'm not bashful,
but I've never kissed you before.

562
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,012
And I don't think this is the place.

563
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:41,475
Gosh, if you knew how crazy I am about
you, you wouldn't hesitate. I can't sleep.

564
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:45,771
- Why don't you take some hot milk?
- I must be in love because I started...

565
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,431
Long way from home, aren't you?

566
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,684
You and me both.
