1
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,273
- Name?
- Charles McGill.

2
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,526
Client visit.

3
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:56,347
Here's Johnny.

4
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,141
Hey, I knew you'd come.

5
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,561
All right. You're a sight for sore eyes.
You're looking good.

6
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,021
- Jimmy.
- Sorry you had to come all this way.

7
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,357
- It's a long way, right?
- It's a long way.

8
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,109
Yeah. Sorry.

9
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,820
Only two things I know
about Albuquerque:

10
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,448
Bugs Bunny should've taken
a left turn there...

11
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,951
...and give me a hundred tries,
I'll never be able to spell it.

12
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,205
Anyway...

13
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:25,334
As you can see, I'm in a...
A bit of a pickle.

14
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,545
You certainly are.

15
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,090
Forget the property damage
and assault charges.

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,177
You face being labelled a sex offender,
Jimmy.

17
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,179
It will follow you for the rest of your life.

18
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,097
That is insane.

19
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,849
Okay?

20
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,144
That is a trumped-up load of horse crap,
Chuck. Come on.

21
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,022
Is that what I tell the judge?
"Load of horse crap"?

22
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,816
I'm not the lawyer here.
It was a Chicago sunroof.

23
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,695
Sex offender?
That's not even remotely a...

24
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,241
Let's talk strategy, okay?

25
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,829
Because I need you to work your magic
and make this whole situation go "poof."

26
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,123
You got a plan of attack?

27
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,710
Come on,
I know I haven't made it easy for you...

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,588
...but you are... You are the man.

29
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,301
Right? I know you've got a million
legal loopholes...

30
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,763
...that we can dance through,
big bag of tricks.

31
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,683
You know,
any clever technicalities, huh?

32
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:27,688
Reasonable-doubt-type stuff?
Come on, Chuck.

33
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:31,317
I haven't seen you in, what, five years?

34
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,029
We barely hear from you.
Now that you're in it up to your neck...

35
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,199
...you can't even call me yourself.
You have Mom call me?

36
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,994
Mom took it upon herself to call.
I was letting her know where I was.

37
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,622
- You didn't cry to her on the phone?
- What? No.

38
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,041
You didn't cry and beg Mom for help?

39
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:51,420
Wha...? Jesus.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?

40
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,715
I'm gonna cry on a payphone
in the middle of Cook County Jail.

41
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,425
Jesus.

42
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,889
Can we...?
Can we talk strategy here, huh?

43
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,725
Look...

44
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,938
I know I'm a lousy brother.

45
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,609
I'm a lousy brother, I'm a big screw-up.

46
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,612
And if I was just a better person...

47
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,198
...I would not only stop
letting you down...

48
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:23,244
You know what?
I'd stop letting me down.

49
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:28,875
And it's about time that I started
to make both of us proud.

50
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,794
- Am I right?
- Guard.

51
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,798
Wait. Chuck, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, you can't leave me, no.

52
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,135
If I don't get out of this, my life is over.

53
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,473
So long as you understand that.

54
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,725
Yeah.

55
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,771
Jimmy, if I do this... If.

56
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,567
Do not make a fool out of me.

57
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,653
I promise I won't.

58
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,196
Everything you're doing...

59
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,367
...everything you're involved with,
that's over.

60
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,037
Just tell me what to do.

61
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,956
Whatever it is, I'll do it.

62
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,418
Just say it.

63
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,338
Please, Chuck?

64
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,548
Help me.

65
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,144
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

66
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,276
Jimmy? What's...?

67
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,861
Jesus, what time is it?

68
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,407
Clock says 2, but I think
that might be Ho Chi Minh's time zone.

69
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,160
What? What's happening?
Is Chuck all right?

70
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,039
Yeah, Chuck...
Chuck is Chuck. All right?

71
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:16,459
Everything's all right.
I just wanted to call you.

72
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,335
So...

73
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,047
Hey. What you doing?

74
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,840
Jimmy...

75
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,676
No. I'm not talking dirty to you.

76
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,930
What? You think that's the only reason
I would call you at this time of night?

77
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,307
I mean, can we just...?

78
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,601
Give me a little bit of credit, okay?

79
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,770
And you're not talking dirty to me either.

80
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,021
Okay, bye.

81
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,481
- I knew it.
- I'm joking.

82
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,816
Just joking, having fun with you.

83
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:45,905
I am calling you tonight with quality,
PG phone conversation.

84
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:50,076
PG-13 at worst. Hand to God.

85
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:56,540
You know? But if you hang up now
and drive straight over...

86
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,419
...limited time only, I'm offering
a free pedicure and foot bath.

87
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,713
Is that right?

88
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:07,134
- Maybe next time.
- Hey. More for me.

89
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,681
You're probably swamped with work
anyways...

90
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,103
...what with that big, fat giant case
falling right into your lap.

91
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,604
Which case is that?

92
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:22,733
I don't know.
Some county official or something?

93
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,777
It was in all the papers.

94
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,571
- Craig Kettleman.
- Craig Kettleman.

95
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,784
Yeah. The primo client your dipwad boss
stole right out from under me.

96
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,285
Nobody stole anybody.

97
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,455
- The Kettlemans made a choice.
- So did the Donner party...

98
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,501
- ...when they took that shortcut.
- Come on. Hamlin is not that bad.

99
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,588
And I'm gonna be second chair
if it ever goes to trial...

100
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,841
...so be happy for me.

101
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:52,972
Hey, how much exactly
did Kettleman get away with?

102
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,600
Excuse me.
Innocent until proven guilty.

103
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,311
Excuse me,
but I'm a taxpayer in this county.

104
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,272
I think I have a right to know.

105
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,859
And besides,
it's not like I'm his lawyer or anything.

106
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,530
I have to go to sleep. So do you.
I know you have court in the morning.

107
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,117
He got away with a million,
million six, at least?

108
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,162
I'm not talking details
of a case with you. Good night.

109
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:20,082
Where did he stash all that dough?
Besides for buying that idiotic boat.

110
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,834
Hello? Guilty.

111
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,295
- Hanging up now.
- This guy is...

112
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,964
You know, he's probably a target.

113
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:31,093
Somebody might get some bad,
bad ideas.

114
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,555
You know, if Kettleman isn't careful
with that money, I mean...

115
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,974
...his whole family could be in danger.

116
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,642
What do you mean, danger?

117
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,607
- Jimmy, why would you say that?
- What?

118
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,903
You said the family
might be in danger.

119
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,447
I did? I...

120
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,909
I... I'm... I'm drunk.

121
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,703
So I'm just...

122
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:01,415
I'm thinking out loud.
I'm not spinning...

123
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,209
I'm spinning thoughts.

124
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,211
- You sure?
- Yeah.

125
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,463
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

126
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:13,719
So I will see you down
in the court bowels mañana.

127
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,055
Good night, Kim.

128
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,015
Good night, Jimmy.

129
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,402
I'm no hero.

130
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,970
Hello!
You've reached Team Kettleman!

131
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,598
- Please leave a message for Craig...
- Betsy...

132
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,475
- Warren...
- And Jo Jo...

133
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,852
after the beep!

134
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,494
Hello!
You've reached Team Kettleman!

135
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,162
Please leave a mess...

136
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,980
Hello?

137
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,402
Kettlemans, you're in danger.
You're in danger.

138
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,112
I'm sorry, what?

139
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,364
- Craig, who is it?
- I'm not sure.

140
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,033
Wait, say...? Say that again, please?

141
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,660
They know about your money.

142
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,579
- Watch out.
- Yeah, what are you trying to say?

143
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,586
This is a warning. You're in danger.
They're coming for your money.

144
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,382
This is a friendly stranger.
Your whole family is in danger.

145
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,467
The money.
They know about the money.

146
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,302
You have a terrible connection.

147
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,055
I'm warning you.
They know about your money.

148
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,308
- Be careful.
- Can you call back on a better line?

149
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,188
Kettlemans, you're in danger.
They're coming for your money. Bye.

150
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,784
What did he say?

151
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,953
- We're...
- In danger.

152
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,289
"They're coming."

153
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,124
Who...?

154
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,585
Who's coming?

155
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,749
Okay, how about this?
Time served plus counselling.

156
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,876
- Can't do it.
- It's his first offence.

157
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,212
- Can't do it.
- "Can't do it, can't do it."

158
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,215
- Would you work with me here?
- I'm listening, aren't I?

159
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,509
Well, you're kind of a captive audience.

160
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,178
What'd you eat for lunch,
the whole roast beast?

161
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:10,474
- Funny.
- Okay. Okay. Hear me out.

162
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:15,270
The 30 he's done, which is a 60 credit,
plus 60 additional days.

163
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,232
- Can't do it.
- Best offer.

164
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,860
Six months plus the time he's done,
halftime for good behaviour...

165
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,779
...out in 90, that's my final.

166
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,948
That's never gonna happen.

167
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,200
Come on. Now, are you joking?

168
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,161
Now, that is the best deal
you're gonna get.

169
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:35,624
I can't do it. The guy drove drunk into a
shopping centre and killed three people.

170
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,961
Shopping centre? Desmond Rojas.

171
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,129
Armed robbery, liquor store.

172
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,049
He assaulted a cashier
with a bottle of Kahlua.

173
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,761
Oh, I was thinking Darryl Redwood.

174
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,347
Yeah, okay, my bad. Desmond Rojas.

175
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,683
Okay, go. Start over.

176
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,353
I am not starting over. I'm busting
my nut here for 700 a throw...

177
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,565
...inhaling your B.M.
straight from Satan's bunghole...

178
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,818
...and you can't tell one defendant
from another?

179
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,405
Ninety days with good behaviour.
We're doing this.

180
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,073
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

181
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,993
Say it.
Say the words "I accept the deal."

182
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,662
Yeah, I accept... I accept the deal.

183
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,050
Good morning.

184
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,680
What do you mean, what did I mean?

185
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,476
No, I told you, I was drunk. I just...

186
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,398
Kim, why are you asking me this?

187
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,444
Oh, damn it. Here.

188
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,780
I'm in a real rush.
I didn't have time to get the validation.

189
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,824
Fine. Nine bucks.

190
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,413
I... I don't have it.

191
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,458
I have 5. Please?

192
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,210
You know the drill,
money or the validation.

193
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,213
Look, this is an emergency, okay?
A serious emergency.

194
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,882
I have to get out of here.

195
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,176
I promise,
on the souls of my forefathers...

196
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,553
...I'll get you the stickers
when I come back.

197
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:15,057
I will get you extra if you just let me go.

198
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,562
Fine. Fine. You're gonna make me
walk back and get the stickers...

199
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,649
...I will walk back and get the stickers.

200
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,235
I'm not making you do anything.
Those are the rules.

201
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,946
Hey, whatever helps you sleep at night.

202
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,953
Screw you, geezer!

203
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,347
Jimmy.

204
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,682
What brought you here?

205
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,477
Me? I was surfing the police scanner.

206
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,813
Heard there was big activity
out this way.

207
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,481
There's no business for you.

208
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,984
- Maybe next time.
- It was a home invasion?

209
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,028
- The Kettlemans okay?
- We don't know.

210
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,866
Neighbour was walking the dog
last night, saw the front door wide open.

211
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,953
Place is ransacked,
no sign of the family. There's no note...

212
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,247
...so we're still figuring it out.

213
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,498
I gotta get back.

214
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,002
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Good luck.

215
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,307
Why did you come here?

216
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,560
- I'm supporting a friend in need.
- You wanna be supportive?

217
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,855
- Tell me why you said those things.
- I'm reading tea leaves.

218
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,317
Same way I knew the Kettlemans
needed a lawyer. All that money.

219
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,736
It's logical somebody
would come after it.

220
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,156
So the same night you worry
about them, they disappear?

221
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,617
Yeah, it's crazy. It's Ripley's.

222
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,578
Jimmy.
It's not just Craig and Betsy Kettleman.

223
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,955
It's their two kids as well.

224
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,084
You would say something
if you could help find them, right?

225
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,633
I don't know what happened to them.
Really, I don't know.

226
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,679
The longer you stay, the more
explaining I have to do. Talk later.

227
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,809
Hey. You'll tell me
if there's anything I can do?

228
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,079
Everything is gonna be fine.

229
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,457
It's gonna work out. A-okay.

230
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,501
It's gonna be fine.

231
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,700
Nacho. Leave it.

232
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:08,206
Yes, I'm... This is the party
you spoke to the other day...

233
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,918
...and I sincerely want to help you...

234
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,422
...de-escalate your situation legally...

235
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,133
...and otherwise.

236
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:23,179
So call me at 146-8729...

237
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,765
...at your earliest convenience.

238
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,143
But soon. Please.

239
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,877
Nacho. Leave it.

240
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,880
Yeah, Nacho. Hi.

241
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:01,134
Just to clarify.
Look, I don't know anything.

242
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:05,680
I have spoken to no one
and there are no rats on this ship.

243
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,559
But for the sake of everyone involved...

244
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,354
...I would just like to open a dialogue.

245
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:18,026
So 146-8729.
Call me when you get this.

246
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,795
If I didn't say it before,
time is of the essence on this matter.

247
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:41,716
So I'm gonna hang up now
if you're trying to call.

248
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,512
There's no call waiting here
if you get a busy signal.

249
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:50,850
146-8729. Just keep trying. I'll be here.

250
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,064
I can put out this fire, if there is a fire.

251
00:21:56,691 --> 00:22:00,944
By hope of hopes,
this is all a big misunderstanding.

252
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:05,031
146-8729.

253
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,675
Hello?

254
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,302
Hello?

255
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,473
Nacho? Nacho.

256
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,257
Walking. Just walking.

257
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,511
Strolling along.

258
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,571
Oh, thank God. Help. Help.

259
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,240
- Down.
- Show us your hands.

260
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,826
- You guys are cops?
- Show us your hands.

261
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:18,706
Officers, you're making a mistake.
My name's McGill, James McGill.

262
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,710
I'm an attorney. Easy. Easy.

263
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,507
- It's his lawyer.
- Whose lawyer?

264
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,354
You sure he asked for me?

265
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,648
Going in or what?

266
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:53,950
Hey.

267
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,539
You asked for me and I have come.

268
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,334
I want to tell you, this was a wise move.

269
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,212
Very smart, because I'm here to help.

270
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:10,133
Everyone, all parties, but mostly you.

271
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:17,515
Those two detectives,
they just gave me an earful...

272
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:21,936
...and what they were telling me is...

273
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,439
It's problematic.

274
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:29,777
I'm gonna pitch it back to you
so I know we're on the same page.

275
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,030
A neighbour lady
saw a suspicious van...

276
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:36,242
...parked across the street from the
Kettlemans' house two nights in a row.

277
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,705
She wrote down the license plate.
It was your license plate.

278
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:46,044
Cops tracked your van and you,
searched it...

279
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,046
...and found blood on the floor.

280
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,883
So here we are.

281
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:03,519
They're calling the FBI in on this,
which makes it federal.

282
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,773
That's a bad thing, Nacho.
That's very bad.

283
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,610
But if you tell me where the family is,
if you give them up now...

284
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,946
...full cooperation, deep remorse...

285
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:19,202
...I feel very good about knocking
your sentence down to the minimum...

286
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,412
...18 years.

287
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,710
They take this good-behaviour thing
very seriously...

288
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,547
...so start here, right here.

289
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,927
Tell me the family is okay.

290
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,805
Tell me the kids are okay.

291
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,064
You wanna tell me your thoughts
and weigh in?

292
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:52,735
Does this sound like a plan
that you can get behind?

293
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:57,907
You miserable piece of shit.

294
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:01,995
You set me up.

295
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,454
I what?

296
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:07,583
You gave my score to another crew
and now you're setting me up.

297
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,378
What the...? What?
Did the cops beat you?

298
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,922
You're talking like
a person with head trauma.

299
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,092
- You think you're funny?
- You had nothing to do with this?

300
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:19,429
That was your van outside the house.
You weren't there?

301
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,557
Yeah, I was there.

302
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,350
I was casing the place.

303
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,438
Figuring out the best way in and out,
what time they went to bed, all that.

304
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,941
They were fine when I left. That's it.

305
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,485
You had nothing to do
with the Kettlemans?

306
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,739
I was never in the house.

307
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,535
What about the blood in your van?

308
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:47,290
They DNA my ride, all they're gonna find
is the blood of your skate rat twins...

309
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:52,086
...plus whatever piss and shit
you leaked out when you were in there.

310
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:56,007
Nobody's been
in the back of that van since.

311
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,803
I don't understand.

312
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:05,266
Here's what I understand, counsellor.

313
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,979
I told my plan to one other person.

314
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,564
One.

315
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,191
You.

316
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,654
Now here I am under arrest. Go figure.

317
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,742
I don't know anything about a setup
or another crew.

318
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,373
You know what? I don't even care.

319
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,334
The cops are out there now
poking into my business...

320
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:36,005
...and if they find something
on me or my partners, for real...

321
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,257
...it's gonna be bad for you.

322
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,635
Really bad.

323
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,472
Bad?

324
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,723
Bad as in...?

325
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:49,477
You get me out of here today...

326
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,188
...or you're a dead man.

327
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,502
Oh, hey.

328
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,088
I asked if you knew anything.

329
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,007
You didn't tell me you were
representing the suspect.

330
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,718
- I didn't know at the time.
- He give up anything?

331
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,305
- What?
- Did he tell you where the family is?

332
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:28,141
He doesn't know.

333
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,852
What does that mean?
He gave them to somebody?

334
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,896
- He doesn't know. He didn't do it.
- Give me a break.

335
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,232
Guys, can you give us just a minute?

336
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,321
Jimmy, that family is in real danger.

337
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,991
You don't have to stand behind
client privilege.

338
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,242
I'm not.

339
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:49,704
These people can be buried in a box
sucking air through a straw.

340
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,706
I'm sorry if that's where they are.

341
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,876
- But my guy didn't do it.
- How are you so sure?

342
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,004
You know what you're gonna do?

343
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,173
You're gonna get
your special CSI people...

344
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,049
...and test the blood from that van.

345
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,386
I guarantee you one billion percent
it's not the Kettlemans'.

346
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,180
Whose is it?

347
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,932
It's not the Kettlemans'. Just test it.

348
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,478
That'll take weeks, if we can even
get a sample to compare it to.

349
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,980
Well, isn't that convenient?

350
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,649
You've got an innocent man
in there right now...

351
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:22,028
...who I demand you release
with an apology.

352
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:26,449
There are no other suspects. There's
no evidence that points to anyone else.

353
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,160
I wanna see the scene.
You are missing something.

354
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,162
Screw you, "missing something."

355
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:35,500
No, detectives, I...
I think that's a good idea.

356
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,418
- A good idea?
- Yes.

357
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,004
We should invite Mr. McGill
to the house.

358
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,924
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

359
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,016
So, what'd we miss?

360
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,874
This is the son's room, Warren.

361
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,710
Twelve years old.

362
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,562
Jo Jo's room.

363
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,690
She's 7.

364
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:54,537
All right, you wanted me to crack,
mission accomplished.

365
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,290
But I'm telling you,
my client didn't do this.

366
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,126
Varga was outside
the night the family disappeared.

367
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,377
That is a fact.

368
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:05,256
Advocate for the guy all you want
after we get these people back safe.

369
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,967
In the meantime, help us.

370
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:09,760
Where's the doll?

371
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,013
Where's the what?

372
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:15,933
Got little shoes, bunch of clothes,
table and chairs, hairbrush...

373
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:18,394
...but where's the doll
that goes with this?

374
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,647
In every picture of this girl,
she's holding the same doll.

375
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,567
- So where's the doll?
- What does it matter?

376
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,988
Doll is gone, girl is gone, which means
doll and girl are most likely together...

377
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,906
- ...which means...
- I have no idea.

378
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:35,620
Which means the kid wasn't dragged
out of the house, ipso facto.

379
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,455
Wait. What are you saying?

380
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,375
Maybe the Kettlemans
kidnapped themselves.

381
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,632
- That's it. You're done. Let's go.
- It makes sense.

382
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,592
How? Why would they do that?

383
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,386
They stole million dollars plus, right?

384
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,139
You wanna get away
with that cash, what do you do?

385
00:32:55,349 --> 00:33:00,186
Run? No, you can't.
If you run, everyone knows you're guilty.

386
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,731
But if you're kidnapped,
you're a victim. Right?

387
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,442
They staged this to throw everyone off.

388
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,444
You are looking in the wrong place.

389
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,781
Who knows how many miles
into Mexico or Canada they could be?

390
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,991
You gotta put the word out.

391
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,995
Oh, come on,
you don't think it's possible I'm right?

392
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,331
It's possible. Unlikely.

393
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,042
- Unlikely?
- All their cars are here.

394
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,128
There's no record of a taxi
or car service to the house.

395
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,839
They didn't get on any planes
or buses or trains.

396
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,800
- You checked all that?
- Yes.

397
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,552
The doll, it's not news.
We saw it was missing.

398
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,347
- So where is it?
- The girl was scared, crying.

399
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,767
Bad guy lets the kid take the doll
to shut her up.

400
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,604
What? You don't think that's possible?

401
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,442
I need to talk to you alone.

402
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,613
I've gotta tell you something,
and promise not to be upset.

403
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,866
- No way am I making that promise.
- I called the Kettlemans.

404
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,703
After I hung up with you,
I gave them a warning call.

405
00:33:58,912 --> 00:33:59,954
A warning call?

406
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,790
I was worried my guy Varga
was going after their money...

407
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,041
...and he was.

408
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,420
He was gonna rip them off.
I deduced it from a conversation we had.

409
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:11,340
It was lawyer-to-client, so there was,
you know, confidentiality issues.

410
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,344
But I called the Kettlemans
anonymously to warn them.

411
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,804
Anonymously? You did...?

412
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,349
Oh, God, you didn't...? You didn't
do the sex robot voice, did you?

413
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,309
I did the tube and the whole thing.

414
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,439
Which probably scared the living shit
out of them and they took off.

415
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,817
Which, you know, file that
under unintended consequences...

416
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,069
...but you believe me now?

417
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,241
Great. Now we have to find them.

418
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:41,454
Or better yet,
get the cops to let Varga go...

419
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,999
...because right now my ass
is on the highway to the danger zone.

420
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,333
Why are you in danger?

421
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,295
Nacho Varga,
he didn't kidnap the family...

422
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,547
...but he's a bad guy.

423
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,633
He's a very bad guy,
and if the cops keep pushing him...

424
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:58,179
...they're gonna find something.
That happens, Nacho blames me...

425
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:02,183
...then his guys turn me
into a meat piñata.

426
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,686
- Jimmy, tell the police.
- No way I'm gonna rat on this guy.

427
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,897
I will never be safe.

428
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,692
I have to convince the cops I'm right,
to stop looking at Nacho...

429
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:15,863
- ...and catch the Kettlemans on the run.
- And if they never catch them?

430
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,116
The Kettlemans?
You've met these people, right?

431
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,951
They're not exactly masterminds.

432
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,454
They will be caught
if the cops are looking.

433
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,456
So you tell them to, would you?

434
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,125
The FBI too.
I heard they're getting in on this.

435
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:31,629
- Why would the FBI listen to me?
- Hamlin. They'll listen to him.

436
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,297
A.P.D., at least.

437
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,925
You talk to Howard,
you explain things to him.

438
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,385
He has clout with these people.

439
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,929
What, is that a no, or...?

440
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,349
Hamlin will never agree to it.
The Kettlemans are our clients.

441
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:47,436
- This would mean incriminating them.
- See? This is why people hate lawyers.

442
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,940
It's Hamlin's call,
and Hamlin will never agree.

443
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,318
And even if it were up to me,
you know I couldn't.

444
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,989
- I'm sorry, I just...
- I get it.

445
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,121
- Where are you going?
- Gonna talk to Nacho...

446
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,833
...try to make him see reason.

447
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,668
To beg.

448
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,135
Come on.

449
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,180
Come on.

450
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,483
Right. Yeah, hey.

451
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,986
I was a jerk, okay?

452
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:43,117
So I will pay you what I owe you plus
interest if you just let me come through.

453
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,417
I suggest you find parking
somewhere else.

454
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,878
Somewhere else, as in where,
somewhere else?

455
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,337
Not my concern.

456
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:59,049
Actually, this is your job,
so by definition it's your concern.

457
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,843
So pump out the ticket...

458
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,846
...and open the stupid gate already,
please.

459
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,348
I mean, I don't have time for this.

460
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,567
All right.

461
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,073
Great. I'm gonna park right here.

462
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,659
I don't think you wanna be doing that.

463
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,872
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do,
you got a poop-filled diaper in there?

464
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,749
You gonna throw it at me?

465
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,044
Are you gonna gum me to death,
huh, geezer?

466
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,472
We're talking about a family.
Mom, dad, two kids.

467
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:51,060
Lawyer's got this theory about them
staging this, running off with the money.

468
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,896
- Know the story?
- County treasurer embezzled funds.

469
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,314
I read the paper.

470
00:37:55,523 --> 00:38:00,778
We got this gangbanger dead to rights.
Only problem is your guy over there.

471
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,990
He needs to help us get
his scumbag client to talk.

472
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,159
So, what do you say? You on board?

473
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,244
Help us do some good.

474
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,165
Sure.

475
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,793
- Okay, you assaulted this man.
- Give me a break.

476
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,545
- I barely touched the guy.
- You laid hands on him.

477
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,464
Finger. I laid finger on him.

478
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:23,300
Whatever your interpretation,
it was still assault.

479
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,929
This gentleman is willing to not
press charges if you help us out.

480
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,182
Get your client to tell us
where he has the family stashed.

481
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,060
Guys, I'm the definition
of a broken record on this.

482
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,938
Nacho is not your man, comprendo?

483
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,191
Nobody took the Kettlemans.
The Kettlemans took themselves.

484
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:43,362
You gonna keep playing that line,
it's gonna go rough.

485
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,531
You know what? Do your worst.

486
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,284
- All right, let's go. To booking.
- Yeah. Sure. Fine.

487
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:53,497
- Perfect end to a perfect day.
- Wait a second. I changed my mind.

488
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:56,125
- I'm sorry, what?
- I don't wanna press charges.

489
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,044
We talked about this.
You wanna press charges.

490
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,047
- No. No, I don't.
- What are you doing, buddy?

491
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,299
I thought you had our backs.

492
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,386
No, I don't think I said that, buddy.

493
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,015
So, what, you get a chance
to do the right thing and you puss out?

494
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:14,810
Yeah. Well, I guess it's my loss.

495
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:21,650
Hey, Cagney, Lacey, when you realise
how wrong you are about all this...

496
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,280
...I'll take an edible arrangement
as a sorry, heavy on the pineapple.

497
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:34,329
Hey. Hold up. How come you let me
off the hook back there?

498
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,750
I'm going back to work.
Why don't you quit while you're ahead?

499
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,962
I refuse to believe you have something
resembling a heart inside your body.

500
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:45,049
You're not gonna have a heart
in about five seconds.

501
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,843
Don't tell me, all right?
I know why you did it.

502
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,179
Yeah? Why's that?

503
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,475
Because you believe me.
That family kidnapped themselves.

504
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,395
All right, I believe you.

505
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:03,984
I knew it. I knew it.
Finally, someone believes me.

506
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:06,487
- Why do you believe me?
- I heard the details.

507
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,573
- Your story makes sense.
- Of course it does.

508
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:14,078
Devil's advocate, like the cop said, the
Kettlemans' cars are still at their house.

509
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,414
No record of them leaving.
How'd they get out of the country?

510
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:21,126
They didn't. Odds are they didn't
get out of the neighbourhood.

511
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,586
Come again?

512
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:27,674
Look, when I was still on the job
back in Philly, we had this case.

513
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,760
Hold up, hold up. Now, wait.

514
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,472
"On the job," as in,
you were a cop on the job?

515
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,266
This bookie disappeared
after the Super Bowl.

516
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,102
Cowboys-Steelers.

517
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:42,189
Took $6 million in bets and skipped town
when things didn't go his way.

518
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,192
Everybody thought he was
on the beach in the Bahamas...

519
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,404
...or dead in the Jersey Pine Barrens.
Wasn't the case.

520
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,534
He was two doors down from
where he lived in a foreclosed house.

521
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,870
Hid there for six months
without anyone suspecting him.

522
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,914
But why? Why not run?

523
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,792
That's what everybody expects.

524
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,586
It's human nature
to wanna stay close to home.

525
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,924
And if this Kettleman figured out
how to do it, that's what he did.

526
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,013
Nobody wants to leave home.

527
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,228
Okay? Let's do this. And...

528
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,840
Hey, it's me. Listen to this.

529
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,929
You hear that?
I found your dumb-ass clients.

530
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,933
It's a long story.

531
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,728
Look, I'm taking them
back to their place.

532
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:54,232
We'll meet you there.
Give me a couple hours.

533
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,073
That was great, guys.

534
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,575
I think we have time
for one more before bed.

535
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:04,826
Do we have to?

536
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,121
Oh, hey, I don't know about you,
but I would love a little...

537
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,248
..."John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt."

538
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:14,086
You know what? Let's really have
fun with this one, okay, Kettle-team?

539
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,546
- Let's do this. And...
- Here's Johnny!

540
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,468
Hey. Hey, Warren. Hey, Jo Jo.
Sorry about that.

541
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,303
I'm your Uncle Jimmy, all right?

542
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:27,349
Now, your parents are gonna take you
down the mountain back to your house.

543
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,226
That sound good?

544
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,270
- They're excited.
- Mr. McGill, can we talk about this?

545
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,564
No, we can't. Okay? You're done here.

546
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,692
Pack up your stuff
because we're heading back.

547
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,987
- Civilisation awaits.
- Finally.

548
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,907
Look, please,
can we just talk this through?

549
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:46,910
Not an option. You do this
on your own recognisance...

550
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,371
...or the cops drag you by your heels.

551
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,125
- Let's go. Kettlemans, time to ship out.
- No. No.

552
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:57,379
- Yes, you are. This is happening.
- No. No, this is not happening!

553
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,713
Yes, Kettlemans.

554
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,967
- No! No!
- Yes, you are doing this now.

555
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,901
Yeah.
