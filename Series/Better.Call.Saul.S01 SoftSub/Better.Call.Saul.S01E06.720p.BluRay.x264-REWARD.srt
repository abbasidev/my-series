1
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,624
Mike.

2
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,880
- Hey.
- Hey.

3
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:33,551
- Thanks for coming.
- Oh, yeah. Of course.

4
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,268
I'm just parked across the street, so...

5
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:47,565
- Okay. I was just gonna hit the...
- Yeah, sure.

6
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,693
- I'll meet you out front.
- Okay.

7
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,504
Janitor.

8
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,173
Anybody here?

9
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,869
- Higher.
- Higher? Okay, you asked for it.

10
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:10,291
Oh, sweetheart.
All right, come on down.

11
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,251
Pop-pop's getting tired.

12
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:17,381
Don't "aw" me. You take a little break.
A little break.

13
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,050
Go on.

14
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,975
- A good kid.
- Yeah, she is.

15
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,313
So how do you like it...

16
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,899
...out west?

17
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,110
I like it. Wide-open spaces.

18
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,695
Yeah.

19
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,282
- Different, anyway.
- Yeah.

20
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,243
How you doing?

21
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,289
I'm... Yeah, I'm okay. You know?

22
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,792
Adjusting.

23
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,419
And Kaylee?

24
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,798
Yeah, she's settling in.

25
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,426
She still asks about him.

26
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,137
"Where's Daddy?"

27
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,306
She just misses him.

28
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,184
Yeah.

29
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,772
How long you in town for, Mike?

30
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,983
I'm here...

31
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,695
...for the duration, indefinitely. I'm...

32
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,406
I'm better.

33
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,574
And I'm sorry it took me so long.

34
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,912
But I'm not like I was.
I'm back. I'm solid.

35
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,792
I wanna be here for you,
for Kaylee, for my family.

36
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,255
That's good.
I'm glad to hear you're better.

37
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,092
What?

38
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,220
What is it, honey?

39
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,849
Mike, I gotta ask. I mean...

40
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:54,228
...I know I just need
to move on from this...

41
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,647
...but I keep thinking about something.

42
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,234
- About what?
- How before Matty died...

43
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:05,156
...like for a few weeks there,
he was different.

44
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,324
Different how?

45
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,369
Different, I don't know.

46
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,912
Moody, you know?

47
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,666
He barely ate. He wasn't sleeping.

48
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,961
He snapped at me
about the stupidest things.

49
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,464
I started to think
something's up at work...

50
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,591
...or someone's sick,
something like that.

51
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,177
But he wouldn't talk to me.
He clammed right up.

52
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,306
Cops aren't real touchy-feely,
you know that.

53
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,475
No.

54
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,435
No, they're not.

55
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:39,315
No, but this wasn't the normal
"tough guys don't cry" crap.

56
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,026
This was more. I mean...

57
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:46,822
Did you notice? I mean, did you
feel anything like that from him?

58
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,533
No. As far as I remember,
he seemed okay.

59
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,535
He seemed okay to me.

60
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,872
Well, I started to think I...

61
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,792
I don't know.
I didn't know what to think.

62
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,421
But then three days or four,
I don't remember...

63
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,091
...but before he died,
there was this phone call.

64
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,886
Two-thirty in the morning,
I wake up and Matty's not in bed.

65
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,723
And I hear him.
He's talking downstairs.

66
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,769
So I go to listen
on the stairs where he couldn't see.

67
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,396
He gets intense.

68
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:24,026
Like, he'd be screaming
if he wasn't whispering, you know?

69
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:28,322
Matty didn't get worked up.
He'd let things go.

70
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,910
But this, I mean, he was angry.
He was really angry.

71
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,579
What was he saying?

72
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,415
I couldn't make it out.
It was something about...

73
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,711
I don't know. I couldn't hear it.

74
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,798
But the next morning I called him out.

75
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,175
"What the hell was that about?
What's going on?"

76
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,719
And he wouldn't talk to me.

77
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,430
But I think...

78
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,059
I think he was talking to you.

79
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,605
- Me?
- I mean, who else?

80
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,611
For one hot second I thought
maybe he was catting around...

81
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,238
No, he wouldn't do that.

82
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,574
No, I know. I know that.

83
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,535
But you? He knew he could call you
anytime he had a problem.

84
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,704
You were thick as thieves,
the two of you.

85
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:22,084
And there was something in his voice.
It was how he was talking.

86
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,587
It makes me think it was you.

87
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,006
Stace, I don't think it was.

88
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,467
I can't recall any late-night
heart-to-hearts with him.

89
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,136
Not around then.

90
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,723
Maybe it was a CI, or a case.

91
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,850
Listen...

92
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,270
...I know what you're doing.
Replaying it over and over.

93
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,772
Thinking, "If I'd noticed this,
or changed that...

94
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,400
...maybe I could've done something."

95
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,987
You don't think
I haven't had those thoughts? I do.

96
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,907
Every day.

97
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,369
You gotta quit
beating yourself up like this.

98
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,124
Matty's gone.

99
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,170
And that's really all there is to it.

100
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,052
Yeah.

101
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,431
I guess that's that.

102
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,356
It's getting on,
I gotta get Kaylee her dinner.

103
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,442
Put her to bed.

104
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,653
Oh, yeah.

105
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,241
Okay.

106
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,454
Well, if you want me to drop by
and keep an eye on her...

107
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,332
I wanna help.

108
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,386
See you around.

109
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,462
Where to?

110
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,590
"Francisco."

111
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,967
Yeah.

112
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,886
- You know this town?
- Yeah, sure.

113
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,221
How well?

114
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,227
You sew this up yourself?

115
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,396
Not bad.

116
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,148
Bet there's a story there.

117
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,942
- Isn't there always?
- Yeah.

118
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,653
All right, a little sting here.

119
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,615
Okay. That ought to do it.

120
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:03,287
Now, you're gonna wanna take it easy.

121
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,164
Keep it clean.

122
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,291
Keep it dry.

123
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,170
Let it heal. There's a Walgreens
couple blocks over on Louisiana.

124
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,339
Maybe go get yourself a sling.

125
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,467
- You don't have one?
- Sorry.

126
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,094
Got a cone
you could put around your neck.

127
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,139
It's about the same, right?

128
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,185
- So it's gonna be 500?
- Five hundred.

129
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:31,190
I can throw some pills in for the pain.

130
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,442
This stuff's essentially Vicodin.

131
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,278
I can give it to you for 25 a pill.

132
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,030
Maybe drop the price to 15...

133
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,574
...for something
a little less human-centric.

134
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,702
I'm an aspirin man.

135
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,164
Tell you what.
Take a couple on the house.

136
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,042
In case you change your mind.

137
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,339
- You new in town?
- Yeah.

138
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,258
Passing through or sticking around?

139
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,511
Why?

140
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,596
No reason.

141
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:07,184
It's just if you're relocating
to the land of enchantment...

142
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,269
...I know people.

143
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,647
I could get you some work.

144
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,109
I am not looking for that kind of work.

145
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,781
But thanks.

146
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,869
Don't know why it has to be this way.

147
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,956
Could've been friendly.
Could've talked in your house.

148
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,500
You really want the formal treatment?

149
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,252
Lawyer.

150
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,962
Come on, Mike.

151
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,550
It's just a couple of questions.
Ain't nothing but a thing.

152
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,301
Lawyer.

153
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,345
You're not under arrest.

154
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,682
Did anybody here say "arrest"? No.
You wanna walk, walk.

155
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,519
But I gotta say, I expected more
cooperation from you on this.

156
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,770
Cop to cop.

157
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,732
Lawyer.

158
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,785
Fine. What lawyer?

159
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,754
Ehrmantraut,
who's got him and where?

160
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,590
That way.

161
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,217
Hey, fellas, how you doing?

162
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,888
James McGill.
Here to see my client.

163
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,224
- What?
- You look like Matlock.

164
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,896
No, I look like a young Paul Newman
dressed as Matlock.

165
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,314
Where's my guy?

166
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,489
- Say hello to Barney Fife.
- Wrong show, but thanks for playing.

167
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:51,038
So, what happened?
Mayor didn't give you enough stickers?

168
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,250
You wanna tell me
what we're doing here?

169
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,711
Oh, here's your coffee.

170
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,339
Hope it's good to the last drop...

171
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,466
...because I'm billing you
the full hour for it.

172
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,051
That's for you.

173
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,762
Oh, that's very thoughtful.

174
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,517
You serious?
Why'd you have me bring it to you?

175
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,560
All right, here's what's gonna happen:

176
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,146
Those two cops out there
are from Philadelphia.

177
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,940
They've come a long way to see me.

178
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,859
When they come in here,
we're all gonna have a little chat.

179
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,110
When it's over, the young one...

180
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,488
...who's been writing
in his little notebook...

181
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,075
...he's gonna take it and put it
in his jacket, and when he does that...

182
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,328
...I want you to take that coffee
and spill it on him.

183
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,747
Little accident, that's all.

184
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,250
And why, pray tell, would I do that?

185
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,211
Because I'm asking you to.
It's the only reason you're here.

186
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,172
So I'm here because
you want me to assault a police officer?

187
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:47,469
I am asking you to take a few ounces
of lukewarm coffee and spill it on him.

188
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,014
I doubt that satisfies
the definition of "assault."

189
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,059
But, hey, you're the lawyer.

190
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,812
Right, how silly of me.

191
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,524
All you want is for me to aid and abet
you ripping off that guy's notepad...

192
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,901
...because that's what
you're doing here, right?

193
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,529
What, are you nuts?
You can't be serious.

194
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,740
Hey, I hate to remind you of this,
but you owe me one.

195
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,493
The assist I gave you
with the missing persons problem.

196
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:12,995
One good turn and so forth.

197
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,081
You want a good turn?
Here's you're good turn, okay?

198
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:21,295
I'm gonna behave like an honest to God,
law-abiding, licensed attorney.

199
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,089
Clearly you need one
with whatever the hell is going on.

200
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,759
Those two jokers out in the hall,
I'm gonna make sure they dot their I's...

201
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,762
...and cross their T's.
Everything square and aboveboard.

202
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,850
That's what I'm gonna do and you're
gonna be happy as hell that I'm here.

203
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:39,062
But this little Juan Valdez
bump-and-dump? No.

204
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,981
Not gonna happen.

205
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:46,612
Hey, gentlemen,
we're prepared to indulge you.

206
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,825
Detective Escalara will be sitting in
with us as per A.P.D. policy.

207
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,120
- Okay with you, right?
- Fine with me.

208
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,538
Okay.

209
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,125
You got your lawyer, Mike.
Can we talk already?

210
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,585
Great.

211
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,755
So like we said, we're here looking
into this Hoffman and Fensky thing.

212
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,382
Yeah, whatever you can tell us.
Anything at all.

213
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,134
Hold on, hold on.

214
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:13,472
Hoffman, Fensky. Fill me in.

215
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,100
Assume I know absolutely nothing
about my client here, all right?

216
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,353
- Start at the beginning.
- Jesus, seriously?

217
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,022
Look, don't let Mr. Ehrmantraut's
dancing eyes...

218
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,233
...and bubbly bon vivant personality
fool you.

219
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,071
He's actually, believe it or not,
somewhat taciturn.

220
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,741
Shall I fan you gently
so you don't go into shock?

221
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,453
Start at the beginning, okay?
We're talking Book of Genesis.

222
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,038
Okay, Mr. McGill.

223
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,832
As you probably gathered,
we, Detective Sanders and I...

224
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,293
...work for the Philadelphia
Police Department...

225
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,587
...as did Mr. Ehrmantraut
for nearly 30 years.

226
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,173
Philadelphia? Go, Eagles.

227
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,260
Mr. Ehrmantraut had a son, Matt,
he too was with Philly P.D.

228
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,180
He was a rookie officer
with about two years on the job.

229
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,766
- He was a good cop.
- Yes, he was.

230
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,311
About nine months ago,
he responded to a shots-fired call...

231
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,480
...in some west-side rattrap.

232
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,066
Matt went in with his partner,
Officer Troy Hoffman.

233
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,027
They had Sergeant Jack Fensky
backing them up.

234
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,530
Unfortunately, things got out of hand.

235
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,117
The three of them were ambushed
and Matt didn't make it out.

236
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,453
Now, Hoffman and Fensky returned fire
but the shooter got away.

237
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:23,083
We chased a few leads, shook up
the usual suspects, came up short.

238
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,003
I'm very sorry to hear it.

239
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,465
Anyways, we kept beating the bushes,
kept coming up dry...

240
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,509
...until three months ago.

241
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,388
That's when Hoffman and Fensky turned
up dead in a vacant lot out in Nicetown.

242
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,141
Again, an ambush of some kind,
it looks like.

243
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,477
And with whoever killed Matt
out there in the wind, we're thinking...

244
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,271
Well, it's our operating theory...

245
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,398
...that Hoffman and Fensky
were mixed up in something.

246
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,191
Some bad business.

247
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,985
And maybe that got Matt killed.

248
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,362
Yeah, sorry,
I gotta do my lawyer thing here.

249
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,323
What does my client
have to do with any of this?

250
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,201
Mike, this is a Hail Mary.

251
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,870
Beyond that.

252
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,207
I mean, if we had any hard evidence
or leads, we wouldn't be out here.

253
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,878
Is there anything you can tell us about
what Hoffman and Fensky were into?

254
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,339
Yeah, help us out, Mike. Help us
catch the bastard who killed Matty.

255
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,387
I don't know much
about Hoffman and Fensky.

256
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,807
They were Matt's people.
I'd see them around sometimes.

257
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,101
I saw them in a bar the night they died.

258
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:27,856
It was McClure's, maybe The Red Dog.
Probably McClure's.

259
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,192
Were they drinking with anyone?

260
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,652
It's a cop bar.
They were drinking with everyone.

261
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,740
- You see them with anyone in particular?
- I couldn't tell you. I was...

262
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,284
You know how I was.

263
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,411
How you doing these days?

264
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,247
Feeling like I crawled out
from the bottom of a bottle...

265
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,374
...and working hard to stay there.

266
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,376
Although, I've gotta say...

267
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,880
...doesn't help much
dredging up the past like this.

268
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,883
Let me ask you.

269
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,010
When did you come out here
to Albuquerque?

270
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,763
It couldn't have been too much later.

271
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,515
I think it was the very next day.

272
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,268
Yeah? The day after Hoffman
and Fensky died, huh?

273
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,272
You didn't think to stick around
once you heard the news?

274
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,317
I don't think I heard the news
till I was west of Kansas City.

275
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,362
Still, you didn't come back
for the funerals, correct?

276
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,989
Even though
Hoffman was Matt's partner.

277
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,535
You remember anything
about that night at the bar?

278
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,912
Did you talk to Hoffman
or Fensky at all?

279
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,624
Sorry, I got nothing.
They weren't my people.

280
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,837
I'm sorry you guys took a flyer on me.
I wish it had paid off.

281
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,090
That it? We done here?

282
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,133
We're done here, yeah.

283
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,177
That wasn't so hard, huh?

284
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,428
- Thanks, Mike.
- Yeah.

285
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,098
We're probably gonna kick around
for another couple days...

286
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:47,477
...in case you think of something.
I've never been out west before.

287
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,730
Oh, hey...

288
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,148
Shit.

289
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,776
- I'm sorry. Sorry. Got any paper towels?
- Come on.

290
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,321
- Hey, I got it. I got it. Thank you.
- Sorry.

291
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,301
Oh, for the love of...

292
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,470
You gotta do that right here?
Right in front of me?

293
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,056
What's so important in there...

294
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,310
...that we had to pull
that third-rate Marx Brothers routine?

295
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,395
You really wanna know?

296
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:34,441
And risk getting a piece
of an obstruction rap? No, thank you.

297
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,903
Anything else you wanna ask?

298
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,781
How'd you know?

299
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,867
Know what?

300
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,162
That I would do that. That...

301
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:53,877
How did you know
that I would spill that coffee?

302
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,464
What the hell is that?

303
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,343
What's "heh-heh-heh"
supposed to mean, huh?

304
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,431
Okay, great, you're the strong
silent type. Hooray for you.

305
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,558
But in case you missed it...

306
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:12,437
...your friends from Philly back there,
they think you killed two cops.

307
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,857
Yup.

308
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,873
Yeah, it's me.

309
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,792
We need to talk.

310
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,967
You call the cops?

311
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,346
- What?
- Philadelphia P.D. Did you call them?

312
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:29,973
- Yeah, I did.
- Why?

313
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,267
I told them I heard about
Hoffman and Fensky...

314
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,019
And what?

315
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,895
You don't think it's strange?

316
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:40,150
First Matt, then not six months later,
his partner and his sergeant?

317
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,902
Yeah, I called them,
to help catch Matty's killer.

318
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,738
Mike, what if the same person...?

319
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,532
What if the piece of shit
who got Matty got them too?

320
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,201
And what exactly did you tell them?

321
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,454
- I told them...
- You tell them Matt was dirty?

322
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,080
- Is that what you told them?
- I...

323
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,834
How could you possibly think that?
That's your husband, your child's father.

324
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:01,087
I didn't say that.
I told them I found money.

325
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,797
After Kaylee and I moved here...

326
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,009
...when I was unpacking,
it was in the lining of an old suitcase.

327
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,179
Matt must have tucked it away in there,
because this was cash.

328
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,849
Five, 6000, from God knows where.

329
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,060
I mean, we were basically
paycheque to paycheque.

330
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,603
Where the hell did he get it?

331
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,606
Why didn't you ask me?
Why didn't you come to me?

332
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,232
I couldn't.

333
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,151
I knew what it would do to you.

334
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,071
First he's murdered,
and then for you to think...

335
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,158
I mean, it would burn you to the ground.
There'd be nothing left.

336
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,660
And you wouldn't talk to me.

337
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,288
Every night you were
drinking yourself unconscious...

338
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,333
...like you were the only one
who lost him.

339
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,044
I don't care. He was dirty,
he was clean, I don't care.

340
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:45,215
All I want is for whoever killed Matty
to rot in a cell for the rest of their life.

341
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,968
Then I want whatever's left of them
dumped in the trash. That's what I want.

342
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,262
I don't care where it leads,
what it uncovers.

343
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:56,601
I mean, what difference would it make
if he was anything?

344
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:00,271
I'd still love him. I'd still miss him.
He'd still be gone.

345
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:04,442
- Matt wasn't dirty.
- Well, so be straight with me.

346
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,194
Right now, this is it, Mike.

347
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,947
What was that phone call
before he died?

348
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:13,118
- Don't bullshit me.
- That was between me and my son.

349
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,620
So you're admitting it was you?

350
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,205
He wasn't dirty!

351
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:21,417
Goddamn you, you get that
through your head!

352
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:25,338
My son wasn't dirty!

353
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,175
Keep your mouth shut.
Let him cry it all out, okay?

354
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,137
- Hey, Mikey.
- Young Hoffman.

355
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,930
- Mikey boy.
- My brothers.

356
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,975
- How you doing?
- Brothers.

357
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,436
Good to see you too.
It's been a minute.

358
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,483
I know. I know it was you.

359
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,097
Closing time, Mikey.

360
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,726
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

361
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,562
How about I give you a lift home?

362
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,441
I'm fine.

363
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,360
I can't let you drive. Get you a cab?

364
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,904
No, I'm good, I'm good.

365
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,906
Don't worry.

366
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:23,701
Anyway, I sold my car, so I'm walking.

367
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,244
Thank you.

368
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,291
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

369
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,711
- You ever been?
- Nope.

370
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,254
Well...

371
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,092
...that's where I'm headed.

372
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,343
Tarantulas, they got.

373
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,221
That's a big minus in my book.

374
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:48,226
Well, I will be on the lookout.

375
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,936
You take care, my friend.

376
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,729
Take care.

377
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,223
Hey, Mike.

378
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,851
Mikey.

379
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,690
You want a ride?

380
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,067
I'm walking.

381
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,987
Pull over here.

382
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,830
- What you doing out here?
- Come on, let us drive you.

383
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,999
It's colder than
my ex-wife's tit out here.

384
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,376
- Come on, come on.
- I'm walking.

385
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,044
Come on, don't be an ass.

386
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,671
- Let us take you home.
- Get in the car.

387
00:29:58,881 --> 00:29:59,922
It's cold out here.

388
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,176
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, Mike.

389
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,844
Come on.

390
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,889
Okay, easy.

391
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,266
We're gonna have you home
in no time.

392
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,977
Oh, God.

393
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,064
What are you doing?

394
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:20,860
Hey, that's mine.

395
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,032
Hey, now, we don't want you
to shoot your foot off now, do we?

396
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,675
Hey, Mikey.

397
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,469
Mikey, you with us?

398
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,179
What?

399
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,848
Really tied one on good
back there, buddy.

400
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,308
Shit, yeah, he did.

401
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,728
Put it away like they were fixing
to bring back Prohibition.

402
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:00,900
Hey. Hey, back at McClure's
you were talking out your ass.

403
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,985
"I know it was you."

404
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:07,198
What's that supposed to mean, huh?
You think you know what?

405
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:12,036
Got something you wanna get off your
chest? Something you wanna say to us?

406
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:15,122
You killed him.

407
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,751
You killed Matty.

408
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,130
And you killed him for nothing.

409
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:29,720
You killed him because you were scared
of what you thought he might do.

410
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,057
You got him in that crack house...

411
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,894
...and you staged it.

412
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,482
Made it look like a junkie with a gun.

413
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,742
But it was you.

414
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,539
And I know it was you.

415
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,379
And I'm gonna prove it.

416
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,372
Help me get him out of the car.

417
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,806
- What?
- Come on.

418
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,018
There you go. Watch your head.

419
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:04,482
All right, come on, Mike, huh?
One, two, one, two, buddy.

420
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,986
Now, you wait there one second.

421
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:12,114
We're gonna work this
whole thing out, okay, Mikey?

422
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:18,037
- What do we do now?
- Hey, grief, it's a bitch.

423
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,209
He couldn't live with it,
Matt dying the way he did.

424
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,837
It's too much for the old man,
so Mike here decided to eat his gun.

425
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:30,216
It's tragic, but anyone
could see this coming.

426
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,093
He's drinking himself to death.

427
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,178
We're doing him a favour.

428
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:35,930
Smart.

429
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,225
It's what I would've done if I were you.

430
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,869
You let some things slide,
you look the other way.

431
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:28,042
You bust a drug dealer who has more
cash than you'll ever earn in a lifetime.

432
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:33,214
Some of it doesn't make it
back into evidence, so what?

433
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,926
You took a taste.
So did everyone else.

434
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,679
That's how you knew you were safe.

435
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,559
It's like killing Caesar.

436
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,771
Everyone's guilty.

437
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,149
Matt wasn't dirty.

438
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,486
I was.

439
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,281
Everyone was in that precinct.

440
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,158
That's how it worked.

441
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,036
You turn in your buddy...

442
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,455
...you're screwing yourself.

443
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:11,043
You go along to get along.

444
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,464
And you went along.

445
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,513
I did.

446
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,057
Yeah.

447
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,685
I did.

448
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:33,232
Okay, but you said Matt didn't.

449
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,900
No.

450
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,361
Not Matt.

451
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,991
Fensky got to Hoffman early.

452
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,077
Kickbacks from some gang or another.

453
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:47,538
Protection, basically.

454
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,207
And Hoffman went to Matty
and offered to cut him in.

455
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,210
Only fair, right? They were partners.

456
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,382
And Matt did what you would think.

457
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,260
He agonised.

458
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,805
And then he came to me.

459
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,267
Wanted to go to the IA,
do the right thing, shut them down.

460
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,811
Oh, my God, and you let him?
That's why he got killed?

461
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:15,024
- He was gonna turn on those guys?
- No, no.

462
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,111
I told him...

463
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,617
You know what a cop fears most?

464
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,621
More than getting shot,
more than anything.

465
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,206
Prison.

466
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,168
Getting locked up
with everybody you put away.

467
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:39,632
You threaten a cop with that,
you make him dangerous.

468
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,467
That's what I told him.

469
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,844
I talked sense.

470
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,723
No one was getting hurt.

471
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,311
But if you go to the IA,
if you even look like you're going...

472
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,856
He had a wife.

473
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,858
A kid.

474
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,527
Responsibilities.

475
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,115
Take the money,
do something good with it.

476
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,207
I tried.

477
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,001
I tried.

478
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,880
But he wouldn't listen.

479
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,094
My boy was stubborn.

480
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,556
My boy was strong.

481
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,143
And he was gonna get himself killed.

482
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,563
So I told him...

483
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,776
I told him I did it too.

484
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,654
That I was like Hoffman, getting by.

485
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,532
And that's what you heard that night.

486
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,159
Me talking him down,
him kicking and screaming...

487
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,787
...until the fight went out of him.

488
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,707
He put me up on a pedestal.

489
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,256
And I had to show him...

490
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,510
...that I was down in the gutter
with the rest of them.

491
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,224
Broke my boy.

492
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,563
I broke my boy.

493
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:24,319
He went to Hoffman, he took the money,
but he hesitated.

494
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,780
Even looking like you're doing
the right thing...

495
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,950
...to those two,
meant that he wasn't solid...

496
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,745
...that he couldn't be trusted.

497
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,501
I got Matty to take the money.

498
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,759
And they killed him two days later.

499
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:55,476
He was the strongest person
that I ever knew.

500
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:00,314
He'd have never done it,
not even to save himself.

501
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,234
I was the only one.

502
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:10,491
I was the only one that could get him
to debase himself like that.

503
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,330
And it was for nothing.

504
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,626
I made him lesser.

505
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,963
I made him like me.

506
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,679
And the bastards killed him anyway.

507
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,618
Hoffman and Fensky...

508
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,832
...if they killed Matty...

509
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,544
...who killed them?

510
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,588
Pop?

511
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,133
What happened?

512
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,973
You know what happened.

513
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,310
The question is...

514
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,774
...can you live with it?
