1
00:00:04,514 --> 00:00:05,514
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck. Here's what's
been going on in my life lately.</i>

2
00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:07,515
I'm a little worried about our cover.

3
00:00:07,726 --> 00:00:09,551
I think it's time for us to make love.

4
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:12,971
I own a deli in the mall and I often think
about meats and cheeses.

5
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:16,353
You do know we're just spending
the night together for cover, right?

6
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:19,933
By now, I'd say I'm pretty familiar
with the concept of faking it, so...

7
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:22,688
You're interested in that Lou girl,
aren't you?

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,483
Sarah is my...

9
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:25,815
- Girlfriend.
- Mm-hm.

10
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,113
You and me,
our thing under the undercover thing...

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,901
...is this ever going anywhere?

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,909
- No.
- We need to break up.

13
00:00:36,117 --> 00:00:39,236
You know, like fake break up
our pretend relationship.

14
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:00,422
Hey!

15
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,095
Excuse me, can I get some help?

16
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:25,851
Four, three, two, one.

17
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,301
- Bingo.
- Hey.

18
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:30,149
I'm sorry. I'm on a break.

19
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,643
Great news, pal.
I am free this evening for a meal.

20
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:38,818
I'm thinking about surf and turf.
Half-meatball, half-tuna sub.

21
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:41,478
Then, boom!
"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. "

22
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:43,398
- Oh.
- Me and you. Sniper.

23
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:45,067
On my back, watching me. Oscar Delta.

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,945
I would love to,
but I have plans tonight.

25
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:49,695
Don't sweat it, me too. Slammed.

26
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:54,030
<i>- What are you and the lady doing?
- Uh, actually, the lady and I are no más.</i>

27
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:55,532
It's over.

28
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:57,697
Ah, man, I knew this would happen.
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:57,873 --> 00:01:59,533
Damn it! Women can be so cruel.

30
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:03,573
You know, as a matter of fact,
I'm the one who did the breaking up.

31
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,619
She just wasn't the right girl for me.

32
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:09,044
Right girl? Are you out of your mind?
She's the hottest piece we're gonna get.

33
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:13,209
Listen, I didn't really see a future
for Sarah and I, ultimately.

34
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:16,381
And so I didn't wanna waste
any more time.

35
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:22,382
Beg for her back, Charles.

36
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:25,513
Go.

37
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:30,588
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

38
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:31,846
What's going on in there?

39
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,887
Uh, just a little thing
I call Operation Devastation.

40
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:36,727
Explain.
Okay.

41
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:38,561
My boy is about to dump
the wiener chick.

42
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:40,514
- What? No way.
- What? Don't lie, you liar.

43
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,480
I'm not lying. All right, relax.

44
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:44,066
She wasn't the right girl.

45
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:46,225
- What?
- Yeah.

46
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:50,945
Right girl? What does that mean?

47
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:54,399
Look, Chuck.

48
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:58,520
I've been thinking about our breakup,
and I'm not so sure it's the best idea.

49
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,779
Miss me already, huh?

50
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:02,701
Well, just, you know, for the cover.
It makes things easier.

51
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:05,198
Then I guess your job's gonna be
a little bit harder.

52
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,497
Look, I'm sorry if you thought
there was something between us.

53
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:14,165
It's very common in these situations
to perceive a connection that isn't there.

54
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:15,454
Of course. I get it.

55
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:17,285
It's the old story, you know.

56
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,038
Guy gets supercomputer in his brain...

57
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:21,203
...beautiful CIA agent
is sent to protect him.

58
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:24,090
Then she tells him under truth serum
that she's not interested.

59
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:27,789
I get it. But for me, the emotional
rollercoaster is a little much.

60
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,878
So I think I'd rather find something
a little less common...

61
00:03:31,052 --> 00:03:34,052
...like say, I don't know, a, uh...
A real relationship.

62
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,919
Okay, Chuck, if that's what you want,
then I'm gonna have to sell it.

63
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:48,510
You okay?

64
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:51,932
Sarah?

65
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,226
- Heart breaker.
Dream maker.

66
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,559
- Love taker.
- Don't you miss the aroma, Chuck?

67
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,608
Check this out.

68
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:03,816
Hey, buddy.

69
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:06,525
Heard about what happened.
Are you okay?

70
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:08,025
Yeah, I'm fine, Lester.

71
00:04:08,197 --> 00:04:09,692
- Thanks for asking.
- No problem.

72
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:12,438
Now that you're done with Sarah,
mind if I take a crack at her?

73
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:13,862
Hey, swing away, champ.

74
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,074
You bet, brother.

75
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:19,239
Where you going? Don't run from me.
We need to talk about our emotions.

76
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:21,447
I'm sorry. You're gonna
have to weep without me.

77
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:23,864
- I got a date.
- What? Get out of here. Already?

78
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,203
Good for you, hot shot.

79
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,833
- With who?
- Just someone I met.

80
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,491
She makes sandwiches. Deli owner.

81
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,495
Okay, hold on a second. A pro?

82
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:34,960
Sixteen is up.
Yeah, right here.

83
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:37,914
- Who ordered the capicola?
Right here.

84
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,170
Seventeen.

85
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:41,917
Thank you.

86
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:43,586
Hi.

87
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,341
<i>I don't
like the idea of this breakup at all.</i>

88
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,548
<i>- What the hell happened?
- She got dumped.</i>

89
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:55,844
We decided that it would be best
for Chuck to date a civilian.

90
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:59,432
It will help secure his cover
in the event that someone IDs me.

91
00:04:59,645 --> 00:05:01,636
<i>- Because she got dumped.
- Let me get this straight.</i>

92
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:04,308
<i>Some woman comes in
and starts dating the asset...</i>

93
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:06,348
<i>...and this doesn't strike you
as suspicious?</i>

94
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:09,773
It's not completely unfeasible.
He is a reasonably charming guy.

95
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:11,063
<i>I've heard enough.</i>

96
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:15,860
<i>I wanna know everything about
this woman before she gets too close.</i>

97
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,283
Wait, wait, wait.

98
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,621
Wow, it's, uh... It's been a while
since I've done that.

99
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,155
Ha, ha. Me too.
I think I tweaked my neck.

100
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,037
Well, it, uh, wouldn't be
an official Chuck Bartowski date...

101
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:43,411
...if the woman didn't leave injured
in some way.

102
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:50,163
I don't usually do this
on first dates...

103
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,965
...but do you wanna come inside?

104
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:55,083
Yeah.

105
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,750
I'm about to make you
a very happy man.

106
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:10,048
Oh, my God.

107
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:11,306
It's so good.

108
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,095
That is so amazing. Wow.

109
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:16,518
- Did you really like it?
- Oh.

110
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:18,930
Oh, like it? Yeah.

111
00:06:19,106 --> 00:06:21,478
Yeah, I like it. I love it. L...

112
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:33,562
What's wrong?
You don't like it?

113
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:36,189
- It's the chopped liver, isn't it?
- Huh? What?

114
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:39,035
What? No, no, I...
No, it's amazing.

115
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:40,488
It's amazing. You're...

116
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:44,988
You're amazing. What is, uh...
What is that?

117
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:47,405
- What?
- The invite thing.

118
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:50,825
Oh, it's nothing.

119
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:55,500
Some invitation for a party
at, uh, Club Ares.

120
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,579
Who's Stavros Demetrios?

121
00:06:58,255 --> 00:07:00,495
My ex, he owns the place.

122
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:02,500
- Why? Do you know him?
- No, not really, no.

123
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:04,297
Good. You don't want to.

124
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,957
He thought I was dating some guy
and he trashed his car.

125
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,043
- Threatened to kill him. Ha.
- Ha.

126
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,840
The last thing you want
is that lunatic in your head.

127
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,107
<i>Stavros Demetrios.
A handsome playboy.</i>

128
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:53,864
<i>Owns and operates
a number of L.A. Clubs.</i>

129
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,240
I don't think he's handsome.

130
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:58,408
<i>He's the son of Yari Demetrios,
the shipping magnate.</i>

131
00:07:59,207 --> 00:08:02,408
What do you mean by playboy?
What kind of intel do we have on that?

132
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,456
<i>What we have is information...</i>

133
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,162
...that a volatile package
is coming to Los Angeles.

134
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:10,710
The cargo is time-sensitive, which
knowing the Demetrios family ties...

135
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,873
...to the Middle East
could mean a weapon.

136
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:14,921
Chuck, we need you
to get close to Stavros.

137
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:17,581
See if you flash on anything related
to the shipment.

138
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:20,089
What? You want me to get close
to my girlfriend's ex?

139
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,929
How do you want me to do that?
I don't wanna get her involved.

140
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:25,460
Why don't you
and your girlfriend hit Club Ares?

141
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,128
I hear it's supposed to be all the rage.

142
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,346
- How's my breath?
- Like the ocean.

143
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,593
Aye, aye, captain.

144
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,302
Are you kidding me?

145
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,149
Everybody in this place is scoring.
Chuck's onto his second lady.

146
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,939
What do we got? Nothing.

147
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,307
I don't know about you...

148
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:52,350
...but I intend to make the most
out of the seeds I've been planting.

149
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,904
What are you talking about?

150
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:55,731
I'm gonna tag Anna.

151
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:58,312
Are you kidding? You make me sick.

152
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:00,033
I'd rather get with Morgan.

153
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:10,997
- Hey, Larry. What can I get for you?
- Lester.

154
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:13,999
I wanted to say I was sorry
to hear about you and Chuck.

155
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:19,287
And if you needed someone to talk to,
I'm here for you.

156
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:22,118
That's very sweet. Thank you.

157
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:24,543
Wanna catch a movie? Grab a bite?

158
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:29,548
You're asking me out
a day after I broke up with your friend?

159
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:35,342
All's fair in love and war, Sarah.

160
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:39,004
- You know what you seem like to me?
- Mm?

161
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:44,763
A man who knows what he wants.

162
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:48,348
Sure, you know,
we could go through all the motions.

163
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,388
Coffee, movie, dinner.

164
00:09:51,563 --> 00:09:54,184
Or we could just skip
all of that nonsense...

165
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,350
...and I could just devour you
right here.

166
00:09:57,983 --> 00:10:00,022
Mm. This should hold us.

167
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:03,315
It's... It's an interesting, uh, thought.

168
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:06,398
Let me think
about that proposition. L... Oh!

169
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,278
Oops.
Your feet seemed to have slipped...

170
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:10,114
Is that Jeff, uh, calling me?

171
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,606
I will be right there, Jeff.

172
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:14,651
I'm just gonna...

173
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:16,284
What about that movie?

174
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:21,286
Hey, Lou!

175
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:27,457
Hi.

176
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:31,535
Hi. Nice to see you again.

177
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,085
You know, he's a great guy.

178
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:36,541
Yeah, um, I've had the same opinion
so far too.

179
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:39,127
It's not an opinion. It's a fact.

180
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:41,289
Don't hurt him.

181
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:43,750
Okay. Wasn't planning on it.

182
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,631
Thanks for the heads up, though.

183
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:56,806
Excuse me?

184
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:59,014
Hi, do you know
where I could find Chuck?

185
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:01,142
Ah, the sandwich maker.

186
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:04,803
- I have heard so much about you.
- Thank you. Ha.

187
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:08,639
- And I must be...?
- The guy who works at the Buy More?

188
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,481
Close. Morgan Grimes?

189
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,683
Chuck's best friend, soul mate.

190
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:14,395
- He hasn't mentioned me?
- Sorry.

191
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,230
Probably means he doesn't think
you're gonna be sticking around.

192
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:19,975
- Ha, ha!
- Hey, here you are.

193
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:21,691
- I'm glad you two finally met.
- Yeah.

194
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:24,817
- Hmm. I brought you some lunch.
- Oh, thank you.

195
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,614
Mm, I smell salami.
Black olive tapenade?

196
00:11:28,827 --> 00:11:31,992
Okay. This might actually have a shot
at working out.

197
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:36,453
Well, Morgan-approval.
That's very big.

198
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:38,989
I seem to be getting that
from all angles today.

199
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,787
- Just had a moment with your ex.
- Did you?

200
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,288
Yeah, she's, uh... She can be
a little overprotective sometimes.

201
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:48,958
But speaking of exes, um...

202
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,458
...I was thinking maybe we could go
to that party thing at Ares tonight.

203
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:54,753
No. You know what?

204
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:56,254
Trust me, it's a bad plan.

205
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:59,005
Look, sooner or later
he's gonna find out about me...

206
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,674
...and I'd rather
just make the peace now.

207
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,504
Charming, handsome and brave.
That's a combination I'm not used to.

208
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,217
Yeah. Ha, ha.

209
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:10,964
It's a little... Little new for me too.

210
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:17,604
We're only on our second date
and already I'm lying to her.

211
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:19,645
Relax, it's dating in L.A.
Everyone lies.

212
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:22,849
We're gonna be tapped into the
club's surveillance. All we need is audio.

213
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,514
This has an RK-7 mini-mike
that works up to 20 feet.

214
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:29,642
I want you to keep it
as close to Stavros as possible.

215
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,730
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding me with this?

216
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:33,565
I can't wear this.
This looks ridiculous.

217
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:36,532
The alternative is
we join you on your date.

218
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,408
Fine.

219
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,362
- Earwig.
- It never stops with you people, does it?

220
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:49,037
Aren't you forgetting something,
Romeo?

221
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:50,535
Oh, of course.

222
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:52,332
Let me guess, this is equipped...

223
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:55,416
...with some kind of microscopic,
infrared tracking device...

224
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:58,371
...that determines
her mother's communist affiliations?

225
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:01,041
No, idiot. It's so you can get laid.

226
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,838
I usually... I'm sorry,
I get more respect at the door.

227
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,345
You know, I come here a lot.

228
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,053
Always here on Monday nights.

229
00:13:25,228 --> 00:13:27,599
And then Tuesdays at Hyde.

230
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:30,303
I'm on the circuit.
You know, I do my thing. Heh.

231
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:33,765
- I can't hear a word that you're saying!
- Ha, ha. What's that?

232
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:35,808
<i>I love this song. Do you wanna dance?</i>

233
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:40,394
No, I normally, uh, require some social
lubricant before entering a dance floor.

234
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,396
Hello, sweetheart.

235
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:44,066
<i>Stavros.</i>

236
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,655
Uh, this is Chuck.

237
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:46,979
Chuck, Stavros.

238
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,072
- Hi.
- Cool pin.

239
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:51,280
I'd wear mine but I left it in the '80s.

240
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:53,941
- Ha-ha!
- It's just... Yeah, I kept mine.

241
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:55,405
Nice to see you.

242
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:57,284
Whoa, whoa, where are you going?

243
00:13:57,495 --> 00:13:59,986
- Let me buy your new friend a drink.
- No, thanks.

244
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:02,784
<i>- Um...
Have the drink, Chuck.</i>

245
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:06,076
- Yeah, maybe... Maybe just one.
- Good, VIP on me.

246
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:14,708
Ha! Way to own the noobs, Morgan.

247
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,000
Use your deep impact perk.

248
00:14:17,216 --> 00:14:19,706
Don't back-seat perk me.
I know when to use my perks.

249
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,040
I have to tell you...

250
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:25,296
...I think you're one of the best
"Call of Duty 4" players in the store.

251
00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:27,845
Really?

252
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:33,338
You know,
I heard what you said to Jeff.

253
00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:36,801
And I think
that you should not fight it anymore.

254
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,888
Just sort of, um, succumb to your
desire, you know, just...

255
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:44,558
Morgan, what are you doing?

256
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,148
- I thought you wanted me.
- Because I said I prefer you to Jeff?

257
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:51,898
I'd take Lester over Jeff.
Doesn't mean I'm into that loser.

258
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:53,943
But you'd take me over Lester, right?

259
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:57,521
Listen, can you keep this
between me and you, please?

260
00:14:57,698 --> 00:15:00,070
You know, don't tell anybody?

261
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:14,783
Ah. That's aged 10 years in oak.

262
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,161
Can you taste it, Jack?

263
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,292
Chuck. And, uh, yes,
I think I did taste it.

264
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:24,911
Although that also could've been
a piece of my liver.

265
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,038
A piec... I love this guy.

266
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:28,335
He's a charmer.

267
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:32,249
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

268
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:34,839
Can I get you something?
Can I get some more wine?

269
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:37,962
Oh, don't do that, Jack.
You don't wanna get on her bad side.

270
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,425
- Fiery Italian.
- Stavros.

271
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,760
Think I'll tell him
about the trip to Meccano...

272
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:44,925
...where you threw a lamp at my head?

273
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:47,382
I still have the scar.

274
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:49,845
I thought you said
she threw it at your head?

275
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:52,847
She did.
The scar is from the makeup sex.

276
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:54,935
She's a tiger. Grr!

277
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:56,771
<i>Get on with it, Chuck.
- Um...</i>

278
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,807
...so Stavros, uh,
you're in the club game.

279
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:02,849
Don't worry about it.

280
00:16:04,235 --> 00:16:07,853
- You seem nervous, relax.
- Oh. I'm not.

281
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:09,814
Ooh, you got a small neck, huh?

282
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:11,815
- Thank you very much.
- Like a chicken.

283
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:14,819
He does have a small neck.

284
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:17,279
Maybe I should go in.

285
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:20,198
Same bit with you, huh?

286
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:23,823
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You need me to spell it out?

287
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:26,701
All right.
You fall for the guys you work with.

288
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,741
First Bryce, now our boy Chuck.

289
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,953
Bryce was a mistake,
and I haven't fallen for Chuck.

290
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:34,035
Hmm. Yeah, whatever you say.

291
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:36,748
And just so we're clear, sister:
Not interested.

292
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:40,125
<i>Have you ever snapped
a chicken's neck, Chuck?</i>

293
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,956
- Can't say that I have.
- It's much easier than you would think.

294
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:46,214
- That's it, I'm going in.
- Hey.

295
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:47,707
No. Hey.

296
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:49,504
Walker!

297
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:53,799
Chuck...

298
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:57,296
...isn't that your ex-girlfriend?

299
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:02,434
Yes, it is. Yes.

300
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:06,551
Sorry. Uh, she's having
a hard time letting go.

301
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:09,855
It's happened to me before, a lot.
I better go talk to her.

302
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:12,265
I'll be right back. I'm so sorry.

303
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,441
I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

304
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,103
Hey, what are you doing here?

305
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,979
I wanted to make sure you're okay.

306
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:20,939
I'm on a...
I'm on a date, okay?

307
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:23,443
It's just... You're ruining it right now.

308
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:26,438
I'm fine! I'm fine!

309
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:29,326
- Just... Just go.
- Okay, fine.

310
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:32,321
But your girlfriend is leaving.

311
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:34,324
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

312
00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:35,574
Excuse me, excuse me.

313
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:36,945
Hey, where are you going?

314
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:39,868
You've spent the entire night
either with my ex or yours.

315
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,117
This date is over, okay?
I'm out of here.

316
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:43,828
- Lou, wait.
Excuse me.

317
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:45,329
No, no. Lou.

318
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:47,205
Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.

319
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:58,665
Excuse me.

320
00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:02,291
Casey. Casey, Stavros' father, Yari,
just walked in.

321
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,669
He's heading towards his son.
Get the mike closer.

322
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:06,506
I need to hear what they're saying.

323
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:12,309
Chuck, get over there. Now.

324
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,552
<i>Damn it, Chuck.
What are you waiting for?</i>

325
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,059
Okay. Excuse me.

326
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:22,396
I beg your pardon.
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

327
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:25,523
I literally was just in there.
Like, two seconds ago.

328
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:31,313
Okay, Chuck, this is it.
Get the mike closer.

329
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,606
Okay, you know what? I probably...
I was over there, so I'm gonna...

330
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:44,906
Thank you.

331
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,786
Four o'clock.

332
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:48,662
Tomorrow afternoon. San Pedro.

333
00:18:48,872 --> 00:18:52,240
<i>The package is time-sensitive,
so if it expires we are all dead.</i>

334
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,291
Gotcha.

335
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,502
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

336
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:01,166
Lou, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

337
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:03,626
Great. Great.

338
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:07,704
Nice work, Chuck.

339
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,751
We know when and where
the package is coming.

340
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,048
Mission accomplished.

341
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,217
How was the date?

342
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:17,920
Is it me or does our government
never want me to have sex again?

343
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:24,976
Charles Bartowski, second message.
Look, I totally screwed up.

344
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:28,261
I'm more than comfortable blaming it
on the alcohol or global warming...

345
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:31,187
...or my obscure allergy to neon.

346
00:19:31,397 --> 00:19:33,186
But, hey, hopefully, I'll talk to you soon.

347
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:35,431
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

348
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,267
Damn it.
You made me gave her a "bye-bye. "

349
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,767
What? She won't talk to you?
Want us to cut her power?

350
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:41,769
- Smoke her out?
- Wow. That's very romantic.

351
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:45,146
Why don't you just club her over
the head and drag her out by her foot?

352
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:48,190
- I'll handle this one without the NSA.
- You did a good job.

353
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,736
We're going to the docks
to intercept the package.

354
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:52,188
You need me to go?

355
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:55,782
Yeah, you know, if crap hits the fan,
we could use you, chicken-neck.

356
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,150
Chuck. Chuck.

357
00:19:57,328 --> 00:20:00,578
- What'd you hear about last night?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

358
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:03,283
I made a move on Anna,
and she shot me down, so I...

359
00:20:03,457 --> 00:20:05,663
What, Anna? Really?
I didn't know you liked Anna.

360
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,791
What's like got to do with it?
You have a girl, I should have a girl.

361
00:20:09,002 --> 00:20:10,993
Uh, occasionally, on planet Earth...

362
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,668
...men will consider their feelings
for a woman before jumping atop them.

363
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:20,175
Yeah, she's kind of cute in a freaky,
little tiger-ish kind of way, you know?

364
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:22,712
That's not my problem, dude.
What if she tells everyone?

365
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:24,427
I was starting to get some cred here.

366
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:28,637
<i>Anna is very cool. I'm sure
that your rep is very secure, ese.</i>

367
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:33,679
No, they're talking about me.
You see this?

368
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:35,343
I'm ruined, dude.

369
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:38,516
Okay, you got me. Ha-ha-ha!

370
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,725
Yeah, fun time at my expense.

371
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:42,602
Look, I tried to kiss Anna.

372
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:44,852
She dissed me, all right?

373
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:48,269
I feel like a fool.

374
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,233
Are you happy now?

375
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:53,898
Morgan, we were laughing about Chuck
getting dumped by the deli girl...

376
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:56,820
...after he dumped the wiener girl.

377
00:20:58,071 --> 00:20:59,696
Kind of poetic?

378
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:01,145
You tried to kiss Anna?

379
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:03,442
- Why?
- Dude, how could you?

380
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:04,945
I got dibs on Anna.

381
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:07,862
I'm right here, you disgusting pig.

382
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:15,954
I realize that this is dangerously close
to bordering on stalker status, but, uh...

383
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:17,915
Look, I don't really care about that.

384
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:20,159
Oh, look,
maybe you're calling me right now.

385
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:23,666
I don't know. Maybe I should hang up
and just give you the chance to...

386
00:21:23,836 --> 00:21:27,833
Okay, okay. Um, so you know,
if you get a sec, you can call me back.

387
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:30,295
Okay, bye-bye.

388
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:32,757
Won't call you back?

389
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,497
I, uh...
Yeah, I think her voicemail's broken.

390
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:37,301
It's very, very common.

391
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:39,635
I wanted to apologize for last night.

392
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:43,882
I suppose I jumped the gun a little and
I didn't mean to interfere with your date.

393
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:47,631
Not sure it qualifies as a date when
you're bugged with CIA microphones...

394
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,893
...and infiltrating an arms importer,
but, hey, I'm new at this.

395
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:54,767
Well, it's hard to have a real relationship
in this line of work.

396
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:57,558
Apparently it's hard
to have a fake one as well.

397
00:22:02,026 --> 00:22:04,183
Well, if it's any consolation...

398
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,395
...I never felt like our time together
was work.

399
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:11,900
Oh, uh, gerber daisies. Lou's favorite.

400
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:14,072
- How do you know that?
- CIA.

401
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,450
I had them check flower deliveries
to her addresses from the last five years.

402
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,276
Good tip.

403
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:27,079
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

404
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,364
Excuse me. I beg your pardon.
I'm so sorry.

405
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,865
Wait. Lou can I talk to you?
Just one second.

406
00:22:32,043 --> 00:22:33,122
I'm busy.

407
00:22:33,294 --> 00:22:35,451
- Who had the parm and proscuitto?
- Me.

408
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,080
There you go.

409
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:39,578
- Twenty-seven!
- Yo, yo right here.

410
00:22:39,796 --> 00:22:42,369
You wanna talk?
Get a number like everybody else.

411
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:44,339
Who's got 28?

412
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:47,842
Twenty-eight. Twenty-eight.

413
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:49,836
Who's holding 29? Twenty-nine.

414
00:22:50,011 --> 00:22:51,802
- Right here.
Twenty-nine!

415
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,769
- Federal agent! Down on the ground.
Don't move.

416
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:09,477
Get the bomb squad in here.

417
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:11,438
Let's go!

418
00:23:17,652 --> 00:23:18,766
Number 43.

419
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:21,434
Right here.
What do you want?

420
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:23,356
Forty-four. Who's holding 44?

421
00:23:23,572 --> 00:23:26,192
- Forty-four.
- I have 44. Yes, yes, yes.

422
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:28,980
Please, I'd like to speak to Lou,
please.

423
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,737
Buddy, it looks like you're gonna
have to take another number.

424
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,784
- Forty five. Who's got 45?
- Right here.

425
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:46,325
Forty-seven up.

426
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:55,464
You sure that's a good idea?

427
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:56,912
Yeah, why not?

428
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:58,750
Bomb in there, we're all gonna go.

429
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:00,634
Might as well enjoy a last smoke.

430
00:24:06,597 --> 00:24:08,173
It's all clear.

431
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:11,264
Agent Casey,
you better take a look at this.

432
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:15,257
What the hell?

433
00:24:15,435 --> 00:24:17,226
Someone knew we were coming.

434
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:26,979
Ninety-six? Anybody got 96?

435
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:34,648
I just wanted to apologize
about last night and explain...

436
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:37,317
I'm working. You want a sandwich?

437
00:24:38,449 --> 00:24:42,314
- Yeah, I'll take a sandwich.
- Great. What will you have?

438
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:43,993
- You carry wheat bread?
- We do.

439
00:24:44,202 --> 00:24:46,324
Why don't you grab
a couple slices of that?

440
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:51,322
Now toss them
and grab the seedless rye.

441
00:24:51,498 --> 00:24:53,739
And while you're at it,
grab some pastrami.

442
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,623
End cut, none of that lean crap.

443
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,871
A man with high cholesterol. Sexy.

444
00:24:58,335 --> 00:25:00,291
- Is that it?
- Oh, I'm just getting warmed up.

445
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:01,575
- Coleslaw.
- On the side?

446
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:03,668
- On the top, lather it on.
Swiss?

447
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:07,126
- Munster.
- Is that it?

448
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,213
After you shut it down and grill it.

449
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,085
This is a hot sandwich, sweetheart.

450
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,414
In the Reuben family.

451
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:21,053
These are for you.

452
00:25:21,223 --> 00:25:22,681
They were alive at one point.

453
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:27,009
Gerber daisies, they're my favorite.

454
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:30,144
I'm sorry if I acted like a jerk
last night. I was really nervous.

455
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:32,013
Shut up, Chuck.

456
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:36,516
He had me at pastrami.

457
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,149
Who are these people? How did they
find out about the shipment?

458
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:51,522
I've no idea.

459
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:54,230
If anything goes wrong
with this shipment, we are dead.

460
00:25:55,786 --> 00:25:57,030
These people will kill us.

461
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:59,034
What is coming in
that is so important?

462
00:25:59,245 --> 00:26:01,320
I don't know!
And I don't wanna know.

463
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:04,656
Our job is to make the delivery,
not ask questions.

464
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:10,042
Now, you find out who this belongs to
and bring him to me.

465
00:26:24,676 --> 00:26:26,336
Morning, handsome.

466
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:27,755
Nice work last night.

467
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:29,207
Hey, lover boy.
- Aah!

468
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:31,504
Hasn't that mirror suffered enough
already?

469
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,094
I am in the bathroom, okay?
Is there nothing sacred to you people?

470
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:36,682
Just the right to bear arms.

471
00:26:39,393 --> 00:26:41,350
You two look terrible.

472
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,807
Well, we were up all night
explaining to our bosses...

473
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:47,893
...why we raided a cargo freighter filled
with air and a surveillance camera.

474
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,099
The tip you gave us
was compromised.

475
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,724
- Someone set us up.
- I think it was your sandwich maker.

476
00:26:54,986 --> 00:26:57,025
Are you kidding me? Lou?
Please, come on.

477
00:26:57,196 --> 00:27:00,396
You guys don't want me to date
for national security reasons, fine.

478
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:04,864
But I think this is pathetic.
And quite frankly, beneath you, Sarah.

479
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:09,572
This was taken at the docks
after your date.

480
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:16,325
I'm sure she has a perfectly reasonable
explanation for this.

481
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,448
Good. Can't wait to hear it.

482
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,992
Keep it. We have plenty more.

483
00:27:27,422 --> 00:27:30,207
Everyone is talking about you
trying to hook up with Anna.

484
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:33,001
The guys at the Sbarro
even named a pizza after you.

485
00:27:33,174 --> 00:27:35,580
No sauce, no toppings.
Nothing but pure cheese.

486
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:37,004
It's called "The Loser. "

487
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:39,085
Mm, let's grab a slice.

488
00:27:40,553 --> 00:27:42,296
I'm ruined.

489
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:52,515
Chuck, our intel says Lou should
be meeting Stavros behind the club.

490
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:55,893
You guys are being paranoid.
There's no way Lou's showing up here.

491
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:57,521
Now you're miked.

492
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,268
Great.

493
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,015
Great. Thanks a lot.

494
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,274
And what will the sandwich police
be doing on this stakeout?

495
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:09,106
Here we go. We got company.

496
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:17,480
Oh, my.

497
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:20,652
Believe us now?

498
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,035
- No. As a matter of fact, I don't.
- Hey, Chuck, wait.

499
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:29,365
- No, damn it. I'm going after him.
- They have us on tape.

500
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,747
They recognize either one of us,
we blow the whole operation.

501
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:38,742
Thank you, Stavros.
Oh, my pleasure.

502
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:41,960
So your friend, Chuck,
where did you meet him?

503
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,289
He works at the Buy More
across from the deli.

504
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:46,291
I took my phone in to get fixed.

505
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:48,257
- Why?
- Nothing.

506
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,382
He just seems like a great guy.

507
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:52,794
I'll be back with the rest.

508
00:28:56,555 --> 00:28:58,678
Well, hello, Lou.
If that is in fact your real name.

509
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:00,348
Chuck, what are you doing here?

510
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,131
- What are you doing here?
- None of your business.

511
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,554
Were you following me?

512
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:06,511
- Have you been spying on me?
- Hold on.

513
00:29:06,686 --> 00:29:08,596
Don't try and turn this around on me.

514
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:11,604
I'm not the one smuggling, you know...
What is this?

515
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:15,187
What is this?
Illegal things when my boyfriend...

516
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:23,272
Is that...? What is that?

517
00:29:23,488 --> 00:29:25,279
<i>Portuguese cured soprasetta.</i>

518
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:28,442
What'd you think
was gonna be in there?

519
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:33,323
I, uh, didn't quite know. I just saw you
with Stavros and I suspected the worst.

520
00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:36,867
Right. Well, congratulations,
your suspicions have been confirmed.

521
00:29:37,037 --> 00:29:39,326
- I'm a smuggler. Ooh.
- Shh.

522
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:41,655
You should keep that down.
Someone will hear you.

523
00:29:41,874 --> 00:29:45,038
I know it's illegal. There's
no additives or preservatives in it.

524
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,918
It takes 10 days to clear customs
and by then, it's gone bad.

525
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:50,207
Okay? Don't get me started
on that FDA crap.

526
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:54,126
- I can't hear. I'm going in.
- No, give him a minute.

527
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:57,914
- Can't go in every time he breaks a nail.
- Just cover the front.

528
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:03,126
I'm sorry, Lou.
I made a really big mistake.

529
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,466
Looks like I did too.

530
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:23,308
- Hey, what happened?
- I blew it.

531
00:30:23,481 --> 00:30:26,054
- Again.
Yes, you did, Chuck.

532
00:30:26,274 --> 00:30:28,728
You most definitely blew it.

533
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:42,985
Why did you come in?
I had the situation under control.

534
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,324
Yeah, I can see that.

535
00:30:49,538 --> 00:30:51,328
Damn it.

536
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:59,410
So I assume you have a plan
to get us out?

537
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:01,909
Right now Casey's tracking
your GPS device in your watch.

538
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:04,832
A SWAT team will be here
any minute.

539
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:08,170
Yeah. About the watch...

540
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:13,040
Idiot.

541
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:15,424
Lou was incriminating herself.
I didn't want her in trouble.

542
00:31:15,595 --> 00:31:16,874
Always the romantic, huh?

543
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:18,504
- Jealous?
- It was foolish.

544
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,637
Do you think the CIA is interested
in a deli-meat smuggler?

545
00:31:21,806 --> 00:31:24,177
Well, excuse me
if I'm not Mr. Perfect Spy.

546
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,425
We can't all be Bryce Larkin,
now can we?

547
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:29,269
- Oh, who's jealous now?
- Jealous of you and Bryce? Never.

548
00:31:29,477 --> 00:31:31,137
- Said everything?
- More or less.

549
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:35,101
Good. Now shut up.
You're sucking up all the air.

550
00:31:50,072 --> 00:31:52,562
Sorry I jammed my tongue
down your throat.

551
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:54,400
No worries, Morgan.

552
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:57,824
Look at the lone wolf.
The wolf does it right.

553
00:31:58,036 --> 00:32:00,323
You know, just jumps around
from mate to mate.

554
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:01,616
Never settles down.

555
00:32:01,788 --> 00:32:04,194
This way, he never gets hurt.

556
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:08,531
Maybe, but lone wolves
are also lonely.

557
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:34,843
Food and Drug Administration.

558
00:32:36,516 --> 00:32:38,140
How can I help you?

559
00:32:38,308 --> 00:32:41,178
We know about the illegal meats
you've been importing, miss.

560
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:44,802
FDA's been running a task force
against the Demetrios family.

561
00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:47,137
You're going down for 10 to 20
in a federal pen.

562
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:48,807
- For salami?
- For guns.

563
00:32:49,523 --> 00:32:52,192
- Guns?
- Demetrios family's been shipping guns...

564
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,601
...which means, we can nail you
for aiding and abetting terrorists.

565
00:32:55,818 --> 00:32:57,443
Or you can help us.

566
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:00,941
Uh, what would I have to do?

567
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:04,653
Give me the dock number where you're
receiving your shipments from Stavros.

568
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,408
Dock 14B, the northwest pier.

569
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,277
Thanks.

570
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:13,573
By the way, miss.

571
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,485
Your pastrami's delicious.

572
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:21,581
Time is of the essence,
so I will cut to the chase.

573
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,703
We've a very important delivery
that's about to be picked up.

574
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,540
We need to know
who else knows about it.

575
00:33:28,629 --> 00:33:29,909
- Okay, I'll talk!
- No, Chuck.

576
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,712
We... We know all
about the imported salami.

577
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:36,414
And... And we're cool with it, man.

578
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:39,586
The real crime is that it's illegal
to begin with. Honestly.

579
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,251
- There's no need for torture, Yari.
- Ha, ha.

580
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:44,835
Mr. Bartowski,
I'm not gonna torture you.

581
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:47,011
Great. Great, we're on the same page.

582
00:33:47,224 --> 00:33:48,882
- I'm gonna torture her.
No. No, no.

583
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:51,671
We're not on the same page anymore.
Not even the same chapter.

584
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,132
No, no. Please don't.

585
00:33:57,312 --> 00:33:59,470
You killed a whole family
outside of Garava.

586
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:03,016
You stole their heirlooms.
You sold them except for that watch.

587
00:34:03,232 --> 00:34:04,691
How you know that?

588
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:11,521
Your name is Vladimir Snell.

589
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:15,110
Last year you were paid $40,000
to kill a man named Leo Koloff.

590
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:16,822
You told me we were paid 20.

591
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:19,107
He's lying.
He'll say anything to get out.

592
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:21,649
He knows about everyone.
He knows everything.

593
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:25,031
And you owe me money.

594
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,246
Well, that settles that.

595
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:33,498
So if you will kindly tell me
who else knows about our shipment.

596
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:35,326
The package is here.

597
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:39,662
Berth 19. We got five minutes
until it expires, sir.

598
00:34:43,506 --> 00:34:45,130
All right. Let's go.

599
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:48,254
We'll just have to kill them.

600
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:52,713
There's a weapon in the shipment.
Some kind of chemical bomb.

601
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:54,712
We have to get to it before it blows.

602
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:14,597
I'll hold the fort.
You go get the bomb, go!

603
00:35:17,442 --> 00:35:20,478
The bomb's at Berth 19. Chuck,
I want you to get far away from here.

604
00:35:20,694 --> 00:35:23,396
- I'm coming with you.
- You're not going near a live bomb.

605
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:26,854
Do you know how to defuse a bomb?
Do you have an Intersect in your head?

606
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:28,982
Hey, Chuck! Wait!

607
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:44,362
Dad, up the stairs. Go!

608
00:35:53,255 --> 00:35:54,997
Go, Dad. Go.

609
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:07,088
Hey! It's over, Yari, drop the weapon.

610
00:36:07,304 --> 00:36:10,173
Okay, you got me.

611
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:21,558
It's Tommy. We have a problem.

612
00:36:21,728 --> 00:36:25,096
The package has been intercepted.
We're gonna have to clean things up.

613
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,190
Here, help me out.

614
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:59,825
Okay. Okay, Intersect.

615
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,199
Flash.

616
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,292
Show me how to do this.

617
00:37:03,462 --> 00:37:04,919
- Did you flash?
- No, nothing.

618
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:08,004
Come on, come on, come on, baby.
Don't fail me now.

619
00:37:08,214 --> 00:37:10,336
That's enough.
Run, I'll stay to defuse it.

620
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,253
- No, I'm not leaving you here.
- Go. That is an order.

621
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:15,293
No.

622
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:18,592
- I said go.
- Oh, I see.

623
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:20,837
You're gonna shoot me
to prevent me being blown up?

624
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:23,337
- Great plan.
- Why are you so stubborn?

625
00:37:23,514 --> 00:37:26,431
I consider this a moment of courage.
Don't know where it's coming from.

626
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,090
- You just bring out the worst in me.
- And you in me.

627
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:35,639
It was nice knowing you.

628
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:08,197
Well, the good news is we're alive.

629
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:14,284
And the bad news is that this is kind
of an uncomfortable moment right now.

630
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,911
It's completely comfortable
on my end.

631
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,838
Just saying.

632
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:32,971
Hey.

633
00:38:35,764 --> 00:38:39,013
Look, I know that you are so sick
of hearing this...

634
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:44,342
...but I am really sorry
if I've acted like a jerk.

635
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:47,303
Chuck, I know
who you really work for.

636
00:38:49,023 --> 00:38:51,690
That you're an undercover agent.

637
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:53,979
How do you...?

638
00:38:54,192 --> 00:38:56,764
Casey from the Food and Drug
Administration came to see me...

639
00:38:56,942 --> 00:38:58,982
...explained that you were an informant.

640
00:38:59,194 --> 00:39:01,944
Right. My cover has been blown.

641
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:03,733
I'm an agent for the FDA.

642
00:39:03,905 --> 00:39:07,071
Can I ask you a question?

643
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:10,659
This whole time,
did you ever really like me?

644
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:12,278
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

645
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:16,234
Let's try that
for the first time since we met. Ha.

646
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:19,620
Lou, you are everything
that I'm looking for.

647
00:39:21,123 --> 00:39:22,783
I just can't look right now.

648
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:28,241
Well, thank you for being honest.

649
00:39:28,462 --> 00:39:30,785
The next time my phone breaks,
I'm going to Large Mart.

650
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:33,043
- Oh, that... That hurts.
- Ha.

651
00:39:33,256 --> 00:39:35,164
- And the next time you're hungry...
- No, no.

652
00:39:35,382 --> 00:39:37,872
Take it to the Wienerlicious.

653
00:39:38,051 --> 00:39:41,216
I'm really gonna miss
the Chuck Bartowski.

654
00:39:41,385 --> 00:39:42,795
So am I.

655
00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:46,386
Hey, Lou.

656
00:39:46,554 --> 00:39:47,633
Yeah?

657
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:50,672
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

658
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,757
Secret agent or not...

659
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:56,016
...that was the best kiss
I've had in a long time.

660
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:05,853
Hey, Morgan. Can I borrow a pen?

661
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:07,809
He is so whipped.
- Pathetic.

662
00:40:07,984 --> 00:40:09,230
Ridiculous.

663
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:11,935
Whipped?

664
00:40:12,111 --> 00:40:13,772
Oh, yeah.
I got a girlfriend now, Chuck.

665
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:16,353
Ha-ha-ha! Anna?

666
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:18,856
She couldn't resist
my animal magnetism.

667
00:40:19,073 --> 00:40:22,442
I almost feel bad for the kid.
She never stood a chance, you know?

668
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:24,526
Anyway... Hey!

669
00:40:24,703 --> 00:40:27,323
You and Lou, this Friday,
we'll double date.

670
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:29,404
- Lou and I broke up.
- What?

671
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:31,655
You're a free man?

672
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:34,829
Anna. Hey, listen, it's, uh...

673
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,624
It's Morgan. It's over.

674
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:41,126
We had a good run,
but the lone wolf has to run free. Okay?

675
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,086
Chuck and Morgan Train is on...
Chuga-chug.... Track. Ha, ha.

676
00:40:45,297 --> 00:40:46,542
Yeah, not really though...

677
00:40:46,715 --> 00:40:49,833
...because I'm gonna get back together
with Sarah, I think.

678
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,540
You couldn't say this
10 seconds ago, huh?

679
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,128
Anna? Honey? Sweetie?

680
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:57,962
Gotta go.

681
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:09,132
Whoever shot Yari
was here to pick up this package.

682
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:11,184
Someone who didn't want Yari
to talk.

683
00:41:17,524 --> 00:41:19,065
It's all clear.

684
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:21,106
Looks mean, but it's non-lethal.

685
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:24,436
That timer wasn't a fuse,
it was measuring an oxygen supply.

686
00:41:24,654 --> 00:41:26,361
Captain?

687
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,285
Captain? Decoding completed.
All systems stable...

688
00:41:41,704 --> 00:41:44,159
<i>This is Sarah. Please leave a message.</i>

689
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:45,790
Hi, it's Chuck.

690
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,742
<i>Of course it's me. It's me. It's Chuck.</i>

691
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:51,865
Look, I was just wondering
if you wanna go out on a date tonight.

692
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:56,539
<i>And by date, I mean no GPS,
and no mikes...</i>

693
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,919
...and no chaperones.
It would just be us.

694
00:42:06,844 --> 00:42:08,587
Oh, my God. Bryce.

695
00:42:08,762 --> 00:42:10,968
Didn't I kill him?

696
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,173
<i>I'm thinking
maybe we could hit up Sbarro.</i>

697
00:42:18,393 --> 00:42:21,346
They just named a new pizza
after Morgan, and, uh...

698
00:42:21,561 --> 00:42:24,015
<i>...you know,
I kind of wanted to support him.</i>

699
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:28,930
<i>So... Okay.</i>

700
00:42:29,348 --> 00:42:30,391
Bye.
