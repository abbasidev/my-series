1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,490
Okay. Keep it going, Chuck.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,277
Head in the game. Comeback time.

3
00:00:06,493 --> 00:00:08,152
How do I like my eggs?

4
00:00:08,327 --> 00:00:09,654
What's up? Poached.

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,572
- Yeah, baby.
- I don't even know why I play this game.

6
00:00:12,744 --> 00:00:15,827
Any day now, buddy. Come on.
Don't rush me, okay?

7
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:18,654
Six, okay. Easy, easy.

8
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,653
My all-time favorite pet?

9
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,703
Um, cocker spaniel.

10
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,621
- Peaches.
- Who got Peaches?

11
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,828
Wrong. Incorrect.

12
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:32,747
It was a springer spaniel
named Peaches 2.

13
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:36,375
Not to be confused with the original
Peaches who got hit by a car.

14
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:38,876
I think we can just give it
to Sarah, Morgan.

15
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:41,122
- Yeah.
- Yeah, fine, fine.

16
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:44,049
I'll say anything next time
and I'll just take a point.

17
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:46,166
<i>You told me the original Peaches
ran away:</i>

18
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:49,093
- She did, she did.
What are you doing, Morgan?

19
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:53,171
"Most humiliating childhood nickname"?

20
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,633
I promised Morgan
I would never say it out loud.

21
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:00,011
Okay, um, "Organ. "

22
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:03,139
Oh, boom.
You see what I'm talking about?

23
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:04,884
What's it say? What's it say?

24
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:07,465
Organ, Organ, boom.

25
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:09,842
Yeah, move me up a spot.
- Okay.

26
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,933
Victory battle.
Keep it moving.

27
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:14,137
Here we go.
Okay, big money, big money.

28
00:01:14,313 --> 00:01:15,854
No Whammy, no Whammy.

29
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:21,262
- Next, next, next.
- "Most dangerous situation ever"?

30
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:26,056
- Um...
Doesn't know it.

31
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:30,482
I don't know, fixing a flat tire
on the side of the freeway?

32
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:32,353
Good guess.

33
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:33,649
Sunburn.

34
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:35,688
I was 9 and we were on
a family vacation...

35
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:39,652
...and my sister and I put on baby oil
instead of sunscreen.

36
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:42,615
We ended up looking like
two little blond lobsters.

37
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:47,282
Know how that feels.

38
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:50,282
I know.

39
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:55,694
Okay, most hated person ever?

40
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:59,078
- It's so easy.
- Total give me, dude.

41
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,829
- Harry Tang?
Harry Tang?

42
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:06,246
- Come on.
- I don't know, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,917
It's okay, it's a stupid game.

44
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:10,871
Well, no, no, hold on a second.
No, it's Bryce Larkin.

45
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:12,628
How could you not know Bryce Larkin?

46
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:15,083
Dude pretended to be his buddy,
sexed up his girl...

47
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:16,962
...and got him kicked out of Stanford.

48
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:20,498
- Lf Chuck is Solo, Larkin is his Fett.
Okay, okay.

49
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,044
Do you understand?
- No point, no point.

50
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:25,208
Understood.
Yeah.

51
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:27,790
- See you in a bit.
- Take your time.

52
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:34,304
Well, we did great tonight.

53
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:37,720
Yeah, you know, I like to win,
but, uh, Morgan clearly has an edge.

54
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:41,263
When he started to list off my favorite
31-derful flavors of ice cream...

55
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:43,969
...in descending order,
that was a little much.

56
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:47,924
- Yeah, he's like the Intersect on you.
- Yeah, I wish I could access your file.

57
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:49,430
Know everything about you...

58
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,641
...but the stupid thing
doesn't work like that.

59
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:55,267
- Well, you could always just ask me.
- What, really? L...?

60
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,720
Um, okay. Yeah.

61
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:03,186
Well, I mean, I know that you and Bryce
worked together...

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,146
...but how close were the two of you,
exactly?

63
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:10,187
Uh, well, Bryce was my partner...

64
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:13,900
...but we were never really friends,
if that's what you're asking.

65
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:15,861
Right, right. So your relationship...

66
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:18,650
...you'd say was more like,
"You, hey, get that bad guy. "

67
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,898
Or "Nice judo chop. "
Or "How about them Redskins?"

68
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,402
- Or something like that.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:24,780
When you're undercover,
you're still you...

70
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:26,652
...but the details are different.

71
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:30,110
There were a couple of those questions
we could've done better with.

72
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:31,945
Which ones?

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,993
You know, those questions.
The questions.

74
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:38,871
- The sex questions?
- There you go.

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,866
Morgan did well with those too.

76
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,447
Well, what exactly is our cover
for that topic?

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,075
Uh, we're taking it slow.

78
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,375
Right, yeah.
We're being prudent, aren't we?

79
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:57,880
Oh, you meant walk Sarah to her car.

80
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,423
Makes sense, I don't have a car.

81
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:24,790
I knew it was you.
You always telegraph your punches.

82
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:26,871
Bloody nose says otherwise.

83
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:29,456
- Your cover?
- Carina.

84
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:32,248
- You?
- Sarah, Sarah Walker.

85
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:35,918
So, Sarah Walker,
what brings the CIA to Los Angeles?

86
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:39,747
Same thing that brings
a DEA agent like yourself, a job.

87
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,463
Well, whatever it is, it looks boring.

88
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,955
All right, Carina, what is it?

89
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:47,292
If you're here,
it means you need something.

90
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:52,176
- A diamond.
- Wow, you, uh, looking to settle down?

91
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:54,263
No, I'm gonna steal one.

92
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:57,970
And you're gonna help me.

93
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:05,423
Well, couldn't you just have called?

94
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:04,704
Guys, guys.

95
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:08,327
Did you know that there is an undercover
DEA agent out in the courtyard?

96
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:10,376
- Relax. We know.
- Oh.

97
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:12,786
<i>- Should I go?
He can stay.</i>

98
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:14,833
Uh, who are they?

99
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:16,713
Seen-but-not-heard,
we're being debriefed.

100
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:18,873
<i>The diamond is heavily guarded...</i>

101
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:21,337
<i>...inside of Peyman Alahi's
Malibu compound.</i>

102
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,539
- Are they with us?
- Shh!

103
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:26,464
<i>Mr. Alahi is an international
financier for the opium cartel...</i>

104
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:30,127
<i>...which is why the Drug Enforcement
Administration asked us to cooperate.</i>

105
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:32,384
You'll assist Carina
in acquiring the rock.

106
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:33,676
- Acquiring?
- Shh!

107
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:36,218
<i>You'll take Chuck
to Alahi's compound...</i>

108
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,428
<i>...to get his Intersect data
on his alarm system.</i>

109
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,597
Set up the grab for the following day.

110
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:44,969
Sir, Carina is a tremendous
field agent...

111
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:49,016
...but we can't trust her.
Chuck is way too valuable.

112
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,683
<i>Alahi has friends
outside the opium trade.</i>

113
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:54,386
We've received intel
that he plans on moving the stone...

114
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:57,398
...within the next 72 hours.
- Uh...

115
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,439
I've had dealings with Carina
in the past too.

116
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:02,773
Uh, ahem,
she can be a bit of a wild card.

117
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:05,556
We're aware of what happened
in Prague, Agent Casey...

118
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,569
<i>...which is why you and Agent Walker
return the diamond to us.</i>

119
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:11,108
Under no circumstances
should Carina be entrusted with it.

120
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:13,064
What happened in Prague?

121
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:16,694
L... I don't need to know.

122
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:20,025
Hmm.

123
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:23,194
- So this is your team?
- My team.

124
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,859
Oh, hello, Casey.
Nice to see you with your pants on.

125
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:29,743
And, uh, who might you be?

126
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:33,155
I'm Chuck, the new guy.

127
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:35,364
- Really?
- He's an analyst.

128
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,952
- Hey, Chuck.
- Another member of your team?

129
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,792
Uh, no, that's Morgan.
Chuck's best friend, he's a civilian.

130
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,041
Hey, Morgan, this is my friend Carina.
We used to work together.

131
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:47,086
- Hello.
- Madame Carina.

132
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,792
<i>And I say Madame Carina, right?</i>

133
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:52,494
And she goes,
"A pleasure to meet you, sir. "

134
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:55,796
But it's her eyes.
Man, her eyes say everything.

135
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:57,169
- Like what?
- Like "Martin. "

136
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,213
- Huh?
- She kind of got my name wrong.

137
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,623
She goes "Martin" instead of "Morgan. "

138
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,006
- It's completely fine, though.
- Tang's coming.

139
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,339
Okay, gotta go.

140
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,672
Morgan wasn't made to mix
with the opposite gender. Unlike me.

141
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,342
How are you supposed to get
any female friction action...

142
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:14,007
...with him third-wheeling you?

143
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:15,639
What does that even mean?

144
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,508
- Sex.
- Can't you just say that?

145
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,471
Yeah, I mean, I could.
It's just it lacks, uh, flavor.

146
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:28,721
I can guess what Casey's doing here,
but, uh, what about this Chuck guy?

147
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:31,183
What is he analyzing? You?

148
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:33,681
Our cover is boyfriend-girlfriend.

149
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,473
Speaking of.
I'm sorry to hear about Bryce.

150
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:43,142
Thanks.

151
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,268
It's, uh, been hard...

152
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:47,899
Of course, getting dead
is an occupational hazard.

153
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,444
So, what's the assignment here,
anyway?

154
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:52,106
It's top-secret.

155
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,272
So I guess
I'll just talk to Chuck myself.

156
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,198
Well, that's not happening, either.

157
00:09:57,825 --> 00:10:00,112
Hey, Carina. Come on.

158
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:03,697
- Carina.
- And where do you think you're going?

159
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,070
I need two eyes
on the revolving wieners. Hear me?

160
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:14,246
Hey, Carina.

161
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,029
- Excuse me, do you work here?
- Oh, uh, yeah.

162
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,409
Uh, we met this morning at Chuck's.

163
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:23,460
- Martin.
- Oh, right.

164
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:25,535
- Have you seen Chuck?
- Chuck?

165
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:29,336
Now, where is he?

166
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,118
Oh, my God,
she is way too good for him.

167
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,040
She's too good for this store.

168
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:37,747
Isn't there a nicer establishment
where beautiful people can shop?

169
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,128
Hi.

170
00:10:41,343 --> 00:10:42,505
- Okay.
- Talk to you later.

171
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:45,166
- She's sweet.
Hey.

172
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:48,342
Chuck, you have to fix me up
with Carina.

173
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:50,261
No, I mean...

174
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:52,463
I don't think that's a good idea,
Morgan.

175
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:54,471
Chuck, I know what a third wheel is.

176
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:56,301
I know it's me.

177
00:10:56,516 --> 00:11:01,222
Give me a chance here, man.
Let me be a fourth wheel for once.

178
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:02,632
Or any other even number.

179
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:05,970
- What do you think you're doing here?
- Getting to know your team.

180
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:09,477
If I'm gonna trust them with my life,
I wanna be certain they're the best.

181
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:12,978
Wait, you don't think I'm good enough.
That's it.

182
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,477
Yes.
- No, no, I just...

183
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,725
Chuck, if you can get Sarah, that means
just about anything's possible.

184
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,983
- Mm-hm.
- Let me spread my wings here, man.

185
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,229
Fine, fine, I'll see what I can do.
But no promises.

186
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:28,987
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

187
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:32,023
Have the girls gotten hotter around here
or is it just me?

188
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,606
Well, this is my op, and my rules.
You're gonna do exactly what I say.

189
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:37,104
We'll see about that.

190
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:40,152
Sarah. Hey, sorry to interrupt.
Hi, Carina.

191
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:42,898
- Can I just talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

192
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:47,780
I need to ask you a favor,
and feel free to say no.

193
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:50,444
And by that I mean, say no.

194
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:53,574
But, uh, could you fix Morgan up
with Carina?

195
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:58,826
Make sure you really exaggerate "no"
so they can lip-read it.

196
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:02,948
They're a little lame,
but I think they can crack "no. "

197
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:05,285
You know, that is a great idea.

198
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,373
No, it's no. "No" is the answer.
You're supposed to say "no. "

199
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:14,044
- Think this can pierce through bone?
- You want my help with your mission?

200
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:15,839
I believe those were your orders.

201
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:18,794
Then I need your help
to protect Chuck's cover.

202
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,967
You're going on a double date,
with Morgan.

203
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:23,545
Small price to pay.

204
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,420
Which one of these geeks is Morgan?

205
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:28,302
Green shirt.
Oh.

206
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:34,046
Well, that will be fun.

207
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:37,172
Easy, girl, easy, girl, easy.
Take it down.

208
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:42,261
You guys are so cute.

209
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:45,597
Really, you're like
the cutest couple ever.

210
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:48,055
Oh, well...

211
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:50,393
Thanks, yeah. We're doing good.

212
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:52,846
Good?
I'd say we're doing very good, sweetie.

213
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,394
Well, I stand corrected.

214
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,518
So, um, how did you two meet?

215
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:00,524
At work, I guess. Right?

216
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:01,849
- Yeah?
- Yeah, work.

217
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:03,853
Sarah came with a broken cell phone...

218
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:07,483
...like a modern-day damsel in distress.
- I guess you're right.

219
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:10,226
A lot of people who meet at work
end up dating.

220
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,026
Uh, so do you guys
wanna watch a movie or something?

221
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:18,944
Good idea, sweetie.

222
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,617
Yeah, that's a great...

223
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:23,612
- I rented that, um, penguin movie...
- No, no, no.

224
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,824
Movie's a terrible idea,
don't you think?

225
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:29,492
I think that people don't take
enough time to get to know each other.

226
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:30,861
All I wanna do tonight...

227
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,992
...is find out everything there is to know
about Carina. Ha, ha.

228
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:36,916
Oh, really? Like what?

229
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:43,034
Were you always this hot? Or did you
just, like, recently find your hotness?

230
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:45,536
You're so cute.

231
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,371
Man, dude, Carina is really into me.

232
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:54,417
- Yeah, seems that way, doesn't it?
- What does that mean?

233
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:56,629
- What?
- Well, the way you said that.

234
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:59,669
"Seems,"
like why wouldn't she be into me?

235
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:02,380
No, no, no.
I'm sure that she's into you.

236
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:03,922
Really?

237
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,637
You know, you don't have to be
so hands-on with Morgan.

238
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,126
You said I'm on a date.

239
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:13,554
- This is me on a date.
- You're gonna give him the wrong idea.

240
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:16,220
Oh, come on.
I'm just giving the kid a thrill.

241
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:19,841
I mean, this place is like
if a yawn could yawn.

242
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,058
How do you stand it?

243
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:26,342
- I'm good here.
- Yeah, right.

244
00:14:27,897 --> 00:14:30,682
Who's up for a hot slice, huh?

245
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:33,055
<i>Penguins are generally monogamous...</i>

246
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:36,018
<i>...and continue to nest
in the same location...</i>

247
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,396
<i>...often with the same penguin partner
from the previous year.</i>

248
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:42,271
- You like to travel?
- With someone fun.

249
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:43,565
- Shh!
- You shh!

250
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:45,562
<i>13-year couplings
have been observed.</i>

251
00:14:45,737 --> 00:14:47,314
Sorry.

252
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:51,068
- Where were you last?
Argentina, okay?

253
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:53,688
Now will you shut up?
They're almost to the Antarctic.

254
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:57,777
<i>It may include blocks of sounds
and vocalizations.</i>

255
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:01,401
Do you wanna get out of here, go to
Chuck's room? Somewhere private?

256
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:13,832
<i>Hey, dude.</i>

257
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,783
Uh, did Carina call about me yet?

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,043
No, Morgan, it's the middle of the night.
She hasn't called yet.

259
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,085
Uh, when do you think
it's cool to call her?

260
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,205
<i>- You know...
- I am asleep.</i>

261
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:32,712
Not true, because here we are talking.

262
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:35,751
Right, you know what I mean? Ahem.

263
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,632
Chuckie?

264
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:40,421
Okay, okay, you know what?

265
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:43,878
Listen, listen, she has not called
in the time that it's taken me...

266
00:15:44,054 --> 00:15:45,547
...to pick up and hang up.

267
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:48,721
Leave me alone, Organ.

268
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,343
And hello to you too, ma'am.

269
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:56,262
Yes, I am, uh,
the on-call Nerd Herder...

270
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:59,552
...for all Nerd Herd
computer emergencies.

271
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:01,967
And what is your room number?

272
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:12,231
Hey, Chuck.

273
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:16,266
Use your feet.

274
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:20,938
Where's, uh, your computer?

275
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:24,692
I don't have one.
I lied to get you over here.

276
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:29,071
- Why would you do that?
- Because I know you're with us.

277
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,444
Who's, uh, us? Who is with us?

278
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:36,906
Oh, thank you. Ha.
But no thank you, I...

279
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:39,608
You can't access my file
to know about Argentina...

280
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:42,737
...unless you get a G-6 clearance
or higher.

281
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:45,202
Cheers to spying.

282
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:52,453
I hope you like what you see.

283
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,999
I should probably call Sarah.
Sarah should probably be here.

284
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:00,162
I think that it would be important
for her to know.

285
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:03,207
You're not much of a spy, are you?

286
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:07,504
I don't know how many more clothes
I can, uh, take off.

287
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,956
But if Sarah were here...

288
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,960
...I couldn't seduce you.

289
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,583
Unless, maybe,
you're into that sort of thing.

290
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:19,749
Hmm?

291
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:21,504
You know, just one...

292
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:29,049
Or maybe I'm wrong
and you're already sleeping with Sarah.

293
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,888
Are you sleeping with Sarah?

294
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:37,465
- You know that a gentleman never...
- Oh, got it.

295
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:42,136
Well, that makes sense,
considering Bryce.

296
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,646
Bryce, Bryce?
What are you talking about?

297
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:49,304
What, you don't know about Bryce?

298
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:53,607
Bryce Larkin? Her boyfriend.

299
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,269
We'll go in undercover as party guests
and locate the diamond.

300
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:05,733
- Where's the diamond?
- Well, that's your job, Chuck.

301
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:09,354
The Intersect knew about Peyman Alahi's
connection to the opium cartels.

302
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:11,653
- So you want me to steal the diamond?
- No, later.

303
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,606
Today, we just get in, we find it
and we get out and that's it.

304
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:19,198
- Right, get in, get out. Got it.
- Are you okay?

305
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:20,779
Yeah, fine. Why?

306
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:24,700
Well, you just seem a little,
I don't know, something.

307
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,946
- Are you sick?
- Nope, fine.

308
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:28,746
Oh, one last thing. At the mansion...

309
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:31,487
...I need you to do me a favor
and stick by my side.

310
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,950
- Why's that?
- Well, Carina, she likes to improvise.

311
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:36,785
And things can get sticky fast.

312
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:38,874
She likes trouble and she looks for it.

313
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:42,458
You know, one time in Pakistan,
I really had to save her...

314
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:47,039
Okay, it doesn't matter. But the point is
that Carina is not to be trusted.

315
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,416
Oh, Sarah, you have no idea
how happy I am to hear you say that.

316
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,963
What is it? Why?

317
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,625
- Well, Carina said something last night...
- Last night?

318
00:18:59,844 --> 00:19:01,006
Oh, right.

319
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:03,751
Well, she put a call
into the Nerd Herd after-hours number.

320
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,549
- And I was the one who was on-call.
- What did she tell you?

321
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:09,052
Miss Walker, your break is abutting
the 25-minute mark.

322
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:11,973
Ahh, one second, please.

323
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:15,347
- What did she say?
- I mean, it doesn't matter if it's not true.

324
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,969
Just tell me.

325
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:22,096
Something about Bryce and you.

326
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:24,470
You know, being together.

327
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:31,272
I'm sure whatever you're discussing
is a matter of national security...

328
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:33,770
...but the ketchup vat
isn't going to refill itself.

329
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:37,439
Did you know that 55 percent
of accidents occur in the kitchen?

330
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:41,191
And I'm sure most of them
are accidents.

331
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,768
It's not true, right?

332
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,645
You and Bryce, that's not true, right?

333
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:50,696
It was complicated.

334
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,194
I thought you were supposed to be
good at lying.

335
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,166
You know what? This is ridiculous.
I'm buying the next suit.

336
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:14,699
I can see my own boxer shorts
through my pants.

337
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:18,500
Well, I think you look very sexy.

338
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:23,285
Listen, I'm sure
Sarah's warned you about me.

339
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:25,952
That I improvise, take risks.

340
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:28,287
She might have mentioned
something about that.

341
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:29,958
Did she also mention my record?

342
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:32,752
How I took down the Quintana Gang
in Colombia?

343
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:36,588
- So trust me. Got it?
- Mm-hm.

344
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,507
Great. Now, see that man over there?

345
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,336
Peyman Alahi.
His house, his party, his diamond.

346
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,712
- For now.
- Wait.

347
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:49,130
Are you talking about
Señor Wookiee over there?

348
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:53,006
Heh, heh. Just, uh, grab a drink
and, uh, look casual.

349
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:54,968
Okay, okay.

350
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:58,680
There's a southern egress
with two armed guards.

351
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:01,307
And by the garage exit, three more.

352
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:04,313
Why did you tell him about Bryce?
You compromised my cover.

353
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,642
We're on a mission here.

354
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:09,477
Try keeping your private life
and work life separate for a change.

355
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:12,972
Hey, we okay? How are you?

356
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:16,185
Uh, yeah, I'm cool. I'm cool.

357
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,897
Um, so I count six SVB-54
explosion-protected security cameras...

358
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:23,612
...with infrared surveillance.

359
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,273
- Did you have a flash?
- Di...?

360
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:29,110
No, they sell them at the spy shop
in the Buy More plaza.

361
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,818
Hey.

362
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:36,862
You got a light?

363
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,028
Studies indicate that smoking
can be hazardous to your health.

364
00:21:41,454 --> 00:21:42,532
Pick up a paper.

365
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:47,280
From the '60s.

366
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,030
Thermal-imaging cameras,
north and west walls.

367
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:57,411
Yeah, someone really doesn't want us
getting in there.

368
00:21:57,586 --> 00:21:59,791
Let's go for a little stroll.

369
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:05,287
So I'm guessing
if this was you and Bryce...

370
00:22:05,464 --> 00:22:07,586
...you'd be breaking into
the bedroom, huh, Sarah?

371
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:10,460
Chuck, now's not the time.
Okay.

372
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,634
Oh, that's awesome.

373
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:36,226
There you are.

374
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:38,515
You know,
I really think we should go now.

375
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:40,269
Just 30 more seconds.

376
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:45,594
So you like my diamond?

377
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:50,019
Oh, yeah. Uh, it's really pretty.

378
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:53,682
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Oh, I'm really sorry.

379
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:55,685
But the door was unlocked.

380
00:22:57,236 --> 00:22:59,477
And, uh, who are you?

381
00:23:01,405 --> 00:23:03,443
- Pretty girls call me Peyman.
- Hi, Peyman.

382
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:04,734
- Hey, Peyman.
- I'm Carina.

383
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:07,567
This is Sarah.
And this is our brother, Chuckie.

384
00:23:07,783 --> 00:23:09,026
- Yo.
- Brother?

385
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:13,279
More good news for me.

386
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,817
So, what would I have to do
to get this thing on my finger?

387
00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:22,783
It is said that he who owns
the Nadan-I-Noor rules the world.

388
00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:24,324
Wow. Ha, ha.

389
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:28,078
So, what if, like,
someone tried to steal it?

390
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,788
It's impossible to steal.

391
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:37,169
Because if touched,
the vault will seal itself off.

392
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:38,955
The gas will fill the room.

393
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:43,623
And after that, my security team
would eliminate the threat.

394
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,840
But me,
I'm more of a lover than a fighter.

395
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:59,382
Wow, you know,
I saw some really cool paintings outside.

396
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:02,506
- Can I have a look?
Sure.

397
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:05,128
- Like this one?
- Oh, yeah.

398
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:09,172
Oh, you got a nice pair of eyes
amongst other nice pairs.

399
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:20,431
Um, the guy wearing the fur sweater...

400
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:24,018
...failed to mention
one fairly significant security detail.

401
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,977
- Like what?
- Twenty thousand volts of electricity...

402
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:30,811
...protecting the stone.
- Hmm, problematic.

403
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:32,441
How you gonna fix that?

404
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:35,476
- I'm sorry, you're asking me?
- Well, yeah.

405
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:37,478
Sarah told me you have this big brain.

406
00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:40,143
So for our follow-up mission,
what do you recommend?

407
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:42,313
Now that we know there's a trap...

408
00:24:42,488 --> 00:24:45,653
...I might use compressed air
to knock it off the pedestal.

409
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:49,777
The dude liked to paint naked girls.
I mean, I can't say I blame him.

410
00:24:49,992 --> 00:24:52,481
- Like what?
- Like, I don't...

411
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,236
You know, something like...

412
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,651
Oh, that would work.

413
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,703
Carina.

414
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:01,366
- Carina, Carina, what are you doing?
- Improvising.

415
00:25:03,164 --> 00:25:04,278
I got it.

416
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:14,703
Hey, this was only recon.

417
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:16,121
Hey.

418
00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:20,620
Just like Little League.

419
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,338
I got, I got it, I got it.

420
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:29,508
- What were you thinking?
- Bad guys approaching fast.

421
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:31,672
I made a split-second decision.

422
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:36,626
- I was doing us a favor.
- Stop doing me favors.

423
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:38,007
Oh, go there, there.

424
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:41,760
Excuse me, pardon me.
Your shoulders looking a little red there.

425
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:47,557
- Thank you.
- Carina improvised.

426
00:25:47,725 --> 00:25:49,799
She snatched the diamond.
Meet us on the beach.

427
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:51,433
I'm on it.

428
00:25:52,477 --> 00:25:53,590
What the...?

429
00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:00,972
Huh.

430
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,805
- Hey, Carina, what now?
- You two run for it.

431
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,601
Give me the stone.
You can double-back and get me out.

432
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,274
What? No, she's lying.

433
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,853
- Chuck, trust me.
- You... Remember what I said.

434
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:14,026
Oh, yeah?

435
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:19,315
Which lie are you referring to?
It's so hard to keep track these days.

436
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,022
- What?
- Thanks, Chuck.

437
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:30,357
- You planned this?
Catch you later.

438
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:47,159
Oh, my God.

439
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:52,497
Get in.
Get in the front, go.

440
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:58,287
Okay, come on. Go, go, go.

441
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:01,412
I have to be able to trust you
on a mission.

442
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:03,913
No matter how you're feeling
about me personally.

443
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,959
How am I supposed to know
Carina has a remote-controlled jet ski?

444
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:11,673
- It's not usually an option in real life.
- Our orders were to bring the diamond in.

445
00:27:11,884 --> 00:27:13,793
What's she gonna do?
Is she gonna sell it?

446
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:18,296
No, she's a gamer. She'll give it to her
bosses, move up the DEA's covert ranks.

447
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,262
What are you doing?

448
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:25,638
Can't believe I have to work
my stupid hotdog shift.

449
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:28,471
If I call in sick again, I'll get canned.

450
00:27:38,604 --> 00:27:40,181
- What?
- Don't be mad.

451
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:43,065
- Well, you left us to die.
- I knew you'd get out of it.

452
00:27:43,648 --> 00:27:46,896
You're burning a bridge.
The CIA is gonna have your ass for this.

453
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:49,977
Well, I gotta run. Thanks again.

454
00:27:51,027 --> 00:27:53,232
- You go to work, I'll get the diamond.
- What?

455
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:55,684
NSA magic.
I've put a trace on her phone.

456
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:57,900
Wherever she's going, I'm going.

457
00:28:00,447 --> 00:28:04,857
- Eyes up front, soldier.
- L... What are you...? I was looking...

458
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:13,489
Carina?

459
00:28:23,874 --> 00:28:25,746
Can I help you, sir?

460
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,457
Damn it.

461
00:28:35,462 --> 00:28:36,742
- Carina.
- Martin?

462
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:38,835
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

463
00:28:39,047 --> 00:28:41,287
I'm so glad I found you here.

464
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:43,830
Wow, you look fantastic. I just...

465
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:50,665
Wow.

466
00:28:50,843 --> 00:28:53,000
Hi. I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

467
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:54,843
- This is great.
- Sorry I didn't call.

468
00:28:55,053 --> 00:28:58,385
It's just not gonna work out.
I've got this old relationship thing.

469
00:28:58,554 --> 00:29:00,380
Oh. You wanna talk about it
over coffee?

470
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:04,089
- One for each of us, I'll treat.
- I can't. It's just... It's too soon.

471
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:10,342
Hello, Casey.

472
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,681
Where's the diamond?

473
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,017
Love the competitive spirit, Johnny,
but I don't have the diamond.

474
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:19,179
I'm not in the mood
for any of your games.

475
00:29:19,397 --> 00:29:21,969
- Give it to me now.
- I don't have it, I swear.

476
00:29:22,148 --> 00:29:26,014
If I did, I'd give it to you.
Go ahead, look anywhere you'd like.

477
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:30,438
In fact,
maybe you should just start with me.

478
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,611
Chuck.

479
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:49,280
I haven't heard from Casey in an hour
so I'm going to Carina's hotel.

480
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:51,692
I need you to stay home tonight,
got it?

481
00:29:51,869 --> 00:29:53,659
- You don't want my help?
- Not tonight.

482
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:56,946
- So I'm off the team.
- No, Chuck, just benched.

483
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:59,872
But we're gonna have to talk about
what happened.

484
00:30:00,747 --> 00:30:02,158
Oof.

485
00:30:02,332 --> 00:30:06,908
- Someone got a headache tonight?
- Yeah, yeah, that would be me.

486
00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:12,742
Xbox? Where's Sarah?

487
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:15,539
Oh, we had a fight,
you don't want to hear about it.

488
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:17,750
Wow, fight, my man.
It's, like, your first fight.

489
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:20,078
That's kind of a big deal.

490
00:30:20,256 --> 00:30:22,331
Wonder what our first fight
would have been like.

491
00:30:22,507 --> 00:30:24,961
I mean, I know it's stupid,
but it's Sarah's fault.

492
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:27,504
I never would've done it
if she told me the truth.

493
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:29,714
You're not even listening to me,
are you?

494
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:33,168
No, sorry. I stopped listening
when it wasn't anything about Carina.

495
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:37,044
And how she kissed me,
and then dumped me.

496
00:30:37,555 --> 00:30:40,304
Cari...? You kissed Carina?

497
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:44,346
Yeah, man. At her hotel.

498
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:46,389
On the lips.

499
00:30:47,142 --> 00:30:50,307
But I guess she has some
past relationship or something?

500
00:30:50,476 --> 00:30:52,848
I don't know, man. Whatever.

501
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,846
Her loss.

502
00:30:57,354 --> 00:30:58,433
You want another one?

503
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:01,521
Hells yeah,
I can feel a bender coming on.

504
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:05,313
- All right, one grape soda coming up.
- Thanks, bud.

505
00:31:05,483 --> 00:31:07,521
Oh, I got the new
"Stealth Underlords" game.

506
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:09,192
I was gonna surprise Carina...

507
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,359
...but that's another thing
she'll be missing out on, so pfft.

508
00:31:12,527 --> 00:31:15,610
- Lf you wanna grab it, it's in my bag.
- Sure.

509
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,447
Oh, Chuck?
Can I get some more pizza?

510
00:31:18,614 --> 00:31:22,028
- Because I just... I'm feeling a little...
- Got it.

511
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:24,355
- Hey, Chuck.
- Yes, Morgan.

512
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:28,315
You know what,
if our relationships don't work out?

513
00:31:28,701 --> 00:31:32,151
Okay,
because we got each other, don't we?

514
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:35,400
- That's really, really sad.
- I know.

515
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,700
Wow.

516
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,538
It's, uh, just like Prague, huh?

517
00:31:56,755 --> 00:31:59,291
Oh, that's very, very funny. You're...

518
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:00,744
What are you doing?

519
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:03,293
Smile.

520
00:32:25,183 --> 00:32:29,558
He who owns the Nadan-I-Noor
rules the world.

521
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:35,725
Okay.

522
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:37,562
Sarah. Hey, oh, hey, thank God.

523
00:32:37,731 --> 00:32:40,018
I know that you're mad at me
right now, okay.

524
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,477
Wait, you know this is Chuck, right?
Okay, good.

525
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:43,727
Good. Okay, listen.

526
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:46,389
The diamond that we stole,
it is not a drug diamond.

527
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:49,732
It's not a drug diamond.
It belongs to an Afghan terrorist group.

528
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:53,518
I could get into details but point is,
it's more dangerous than we thought.

529
00:32:53,695 --> 00:33:00,193
Chuck, find Carina and tell her
to bring me the diamond. Please.

530
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,199
Hey, Morgan buddy, long story,
but I'm gonna have to go ahead and...

531
00:33:09,577 --> 00:33:12,695
Hey, listen, go ahead
and take whatever you want, okay?

532
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:16,742
I keep a little cash in my sock drawer.
And by little, I mean spare change.

533
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,579
Pizza? Absolutely, help yourself.

534
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,413
It's behind me on the counter.

535
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,702
This? You want this.

536
00:33:22,874 --> 00:33:26,490
I can't actually give you this.
Because it's not mine to give, really.

537
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,326
Ow!

538
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:43,211
- Carina?
- Fine, it's me.

539
00:33:43,383 --> 00:33:46,417
The mask is so Martin wouldn't ID me.
Now give me the diamond.

540
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:49,047
Wait, no, no.
I need your help, Sarah's in trouble.

541
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:52,088
Sarah's fine, she's very resourceful.
Now, the rock.

542
00:33:52,887 --> 00:33:56,384
You're just gonna cross your fingers
instead of helping your friend?

543
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:58,469
Come on, you know this thing of ours?

544
00:33:58,681 --> 00:34:01,763
We're all in it for ourselves.
It's what we do.

545
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:03,837
It's not what Sarah does.

546
00:34:06,934 --> 00:34:10,183
And if she would have thought that
in Pakistan...

547
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:13,517
...then you wouldn't be alive right now
to have this conversation.

548
00:34:14,855 --> 00:34:16,099
You want it? Here you go.

549
00:34:17,397 --> 00:34:20,017
But with or without you,
I'm gonna go help Sarah.

550
00:34:22,942 --> 00:34:24,019
Just hold onto it.

551
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:27,024
In case I change my mind.

552
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:30,357
Dude, what's the ETA on my pizza?

553
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,231
Uh, Buddy,
I gotta go pick up some more.

554
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,442
And your grape soda's
on the kitchen floor.

555
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:40,400
- Who do you work for?
- Tiffany.

556
00:34:40,574 --> 00:34:43,028
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

557
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,689
You didn't just take
that diamond from me.

558
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:49,733
I was holding it for a friend of mine.
A very grouchy, dangerous friend.

559
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:52,152
Does he like your new look?

560
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:54,237
Normally I don't mind women
being rough...

561
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:57,783
...but that was very rude.

562
00:34:57,997 --> 00:34:59,906
Watch the one with the clovers.

563
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,953
I don't get it, Chuck.

564
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:11,160
I thought you and Sarah
were on the outs.

565
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:12,415
I made a mistake.

566
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:16,045
I'm still getting used to how you guys
need to lie about who you are.

567
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,588
I'm feeling like a knife fight.

568
00:35:20,048 --> 00:35:22,503
You analysts don't know
what it's like for us field agents.

569
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:25,425
But it's our job. We shed identities
like people shed clothes.

570
00:35:25,635 --> 00:35:28,088
In your case, that's quite often.

571
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,378
We try them on, like them or leave them.
It doesn't even matter.

572
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:34,263
So you don't let anyone know
who you really are?

573
00:35:34,763 --> 00:35:38,509
Can't. Might have to leave them
in 5 minutes or shoot them in the head.

574
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:42,553
Trust me, a spy doesn't want you
to know anything about them that's real.

575
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,594
No matter who you are.

576
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,138
You carry the diamond,
I'll act as intermediary.

577
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:53,934
And listen, if we're still alive afterwards,
how about we go back to my room?

578
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:57,265
Kind of stuck back
on the still-alive part.

579
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:19,399
Told you smoking
can be hazardous to your health.

580
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:28,527
Do you have what I want?

581
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:30,238
Maybe.

582
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:33,951
Maybe I pawned it for front-row tickets
to Justin Timberlake.

583
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,036
Why do you always
have to provoke people?

584
00:36:39,748 --> 00:36:41,657
Show me the diamond.

585
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:46,328
I have it, I have it.
It's right here, I have it in this.

586
00:36:46,836 --> 00:36:48,744
Just get... There it is. Here's your...

587
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:51,201
That's your... I have it right there.

588
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:53,534
- Now give it to me.
- No.

589
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:55,995
I know that I'm new to this...

590
00:36:56,214 --> 00:37:00,126
...but I'm pretty sure that this is the part
where I do what the man says.

591
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:02,589
He didn't say please.

592
00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:07,919
Now, if you want it so badly,
try taking it away from me.

593
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:12,001
Look around you.
Everyone in the room is with me.

594
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,503
What are you gonna do, fight us all?

595
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:23,803
- All by yourself?
- She's not by herself.

596
00:37:45,735 --> 00:37:47,727
Ma'am. Miss.

597
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,572
Gotta hide it, gotta hide it.
Gotta hide it.

598
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:15,663
Open the door.
Open the door, open up!

599
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:26,332
Wait, wait, wait.

600
00:38:26,961 --> 00:38:28,917
- You know where this goes?
- No.

601
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:31,499
Well, neither do I.
So step back or I let it go.

602
00:38:34,214 --> 00:38:35,588
Now what?

603
00:38:36,298 --> 00:38:39,214
I'm not really sure.
I hadn't thought it through that far.

604
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:53,046
- What?
- What?

605
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:05,224
<i>Capturing the Nadan-I-Noor diamond...</i>

606
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:07,551
<i>...has dissolved
Peyman Alahi's credibility.</i>

607
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,595
<i>His network has fallen apart.</i>

608
00:39:09,812 --> 00:39:13,854
We were able to thwart the purchase
of $26 million of surface-to-air missiles...

609
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:16,103
<i>...the terrorist group
was planning on buying.</i>

610
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:20,227
No diamond, no cash, no sale.
Job well done, people.

611
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:28,146
You didn't.

612
00:39:29,696 --> 00:39:32,398
- Well, this was fun.
- Yeah, goodbye, Carina.

613
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,440
Working with you has been...

614
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:37,740
- Well, let's never do this again, hmm?
- Thanks, Johnny.

615
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,816
Maybe next time
you can shake it up a bit...

616
00:39:39,992 --> 00:39:42,481
...and pull the four-leaf clovers
out of the rotation.

617
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:48,196
Well, you know,
as much as I hate your methods...

618
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:50,238
...there's never a dull moment, right?

619
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:53,531
Well, if you want a dull moment,
just check out your cover life.

620
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:55,578
Well, you know,
we have our adventures.

621
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,904
Right.

622
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:59,281
Oh, uh, dinner tonight?
So we can talk?

623
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:02,120
- Pizza?
- Sounds good.

624
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:05,668
Sure you don't wanna come back
to my hotel room?

625
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:06,867
Um...

626
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:13,660
...as flattered and intimidated
as I am by your proposition...

627
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,333
...why me?

628
00:40:15,507 --> 00:40:18,458
Well, you're sort of cute-ish.

629
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:22,842
But, um, the real reason is
I love taking what Sarah wants.

630
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:25,589
What? Me?

631
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:27,468
No, Sarah... Sarah doesn't want me.

632
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:31,092
Yeah, she probably
doesn't even know it herself yet.

633
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,506
But, um, I do.

634
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,063
Hey.

635
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,441
Vegetarian. No olives.

636
00:41:04,444 --> 00:41:06,814
It's the only thing
I know about you that's true.

637
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:08,936
You don't like olives.

638
00:41:10,696 --> 00:41:12,154
Thank you.

639
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:15,028
- Come in.
- Thank you.

640
00:41:19,116 --> 00:41:22,151
Look, I'm sorry about the beach.

641
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:23,571
You're absolutely right...

642
00:41:23,743 --> 00:41:26,660
...I shouldn't let my feelings
affect the mission.

643
00:41:27,037 --> 00:41:29,158
And, um...

644
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:34,330
...if you and Bryce,
if you had a thing...

645
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:37,580
...well, that makes sense.
He always got the great girls.

646
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:43,959
I just wish I knew
something real about you.

647
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,915
Can't you just tell me
just one true thing?

648
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:53,285
Just one?
Like, where did you grow up?

649
00:41:53,464 --> 00:41:55,290
Or if that's too much, I get it.

650
00:41:55,465 --> 00:41:57,752
I get it, if that's too much,
what's your name?

651
00:41:57,924 --> 00:42:00,248
What's your real name?

652
00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:05,217
Middle name.
What's your middle name?

653
00:42:05,386 --> 00:42:08,054
Can't you just tell me
your middle name?

654
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:20,595
I'm gonna go and get the napkins.

655
00:42:25,687 --> 00:42:27,512
It's Lisa.

656
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,300
My middle name is Lisa.
