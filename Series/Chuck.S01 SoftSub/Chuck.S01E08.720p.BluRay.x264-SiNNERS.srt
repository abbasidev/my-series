1
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,216
Who are you?

2
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm a poisoner by trade.

3
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:15,806
Specifically speaking,
I'm your poisoner.

4
00:00:16,412 --> 00:00:18,593
Do you know where the codes are?

5
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:20,762
No. I told you.

6
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:25,104
Okay. We're gonna try that again.

7
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:27,685
Do you know where the codes are?

8
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:31,655
Yes.

9
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:34,533
How did you make me do that?

10
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:36,991
My poison starts as a truth serum.

11
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:39,163
Your assignment is simple,
Mr. Whitney.

12
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:42,290
Just get me my codes.

13
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:45,836
You have approximately three hours,
give or take, before you die.

14
00:00:45,944 --> 00:00:47,709
As soon as I have my codes...

15
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:52,086
...I'll give you the antidote.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,806
- Ready?
- We're in over our heads.

17
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:56,295
- It's time.
- It's not dangerous?

18
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:57,757
- I'm an inch away.
- I'm scared.

19
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:01,221
Let's go over it again.
Make sure we have our bases covered.

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,858
God, who'd have thought going out
with my sister and her boyfriend...

21
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:08,981
...would make me so freaked out?
- Last night we saw a movie.

22
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:11,991
- What was my snack?
- Sprinkled Milk Duds over your popcorn.

23
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:14,400
- What was I wearing?
- Blue top, little buttons.

24
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:16,451
- You like that one?
- I like all of them.

25
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:19,243
- What movie were we...?
Hey, why is this door locked?

26
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:20,952
What are you doing? Aah!

27
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:24,621
Wow.

28
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:25,918
Girl on top.

29
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:28,925
Miss Walker, when Herr Wienerlicious
signs your paycheck...

30
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:32,675
...I doubt he's factoring in
make-out breaks with your boy toy.

31
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:37,098
I'm sorry. I had to act fast.

32
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,474
Hi.

33
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:48,277
I press the button,
and nothing happens.

34
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:51,938
- Is it fully charged? Because...
- My entire life is in this thing, okay?

35
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,738
Names, places, dates,
times, music, photos, recipes.

36
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,530
Wow, oh, boy, you cook too?

37
00:01:56,642 --> 00:02:00,080
What if I lose everything?
You know, I can't start from scratch.

38
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:03,038
I can't be the person I was
before this thing came along.

39
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,416
I'm freaking out.

40
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:06,083
Listen to me, uh...?

41
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,706
- Lou.
- Lou? Really, Lou?

42
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,422
I wouldn't put...
This is kind of my world, you know?

43
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:14,347
This is what I do,
and I do it pretty good.

44
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,840
So trust me.

45
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:19,799
Okay, go.

46
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,392
I know I'm totally spazzing out.
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,937
It's just a little overwhelming
to even consider...

48
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:26,437
No, no, no, don't go there.

49
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:28,146
Come back. Go to a happy place.

50
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:31,980
Is there something you think about that
quiets the voices that are in your head?

51
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:33,652
Um...

52
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:39,284
Turkey, Muenster cheese...

53
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:40,744
...egg bread, grilled.

54
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,462
- Was that a sandwich?
- Yeah, they're my passion.

55
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:48,835
It sounds pretty delicious.

56
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:52,336
I own a deli in the mall.
I often think about meats and cheeses.

57
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:54,172
Ah, yes. Who doesn't?

58
00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:58,758
Look, I, uh... I promise you
that if you come back tomorrow...

59
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:01,344
...your phone will be all fixed up
and good to go.

60
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,642
- Really?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,357
Thank you so much.

62
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:06,683
It's been nice talking with you, Chuck.

63
00:03:06,798 --> 00:03:08,182
Yeah, you too, Lou.

64
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:11,894
That rhymed.
I didn't actually mean for that to rhyme.

65
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,533
- I'm sorry. Okay.
- Okay.

66
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:20,284
Mind cheater.

67
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:23,164
Saw you.

68
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,451
Saw me what?

69
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:26,253
Saw you what? Are you kidding me?

70
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:28,748
Mind cheating
with the broken-phone girl.

71
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:30,633
And why wouldn't you?

72
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,047
Her hair looked so much like licorice.

73
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:36,428
I wanna chew on it
till I make myself sick.

74
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:40,387
But you, well, gee whiz, Chuck,
you already have hair to chew on.

75
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,011
What? What the hell
are you talking about?

76
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,146
Name Sarah ring a...?

77
00:03:47,423 --> 00:03:48,904
Hot blonde with two big bells?

78
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,030
Just because you didn't
do anything with licorice hair...

79
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:57,775
...doesn't mean you didn't want to.

80
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:01,325
Think about that. Mind cheater.

81
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:03,207
Don't.

82
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:05,626
- Saw you.
- Get out.

83
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:16,307
<i>Your assignment is simple,
Mr. Whitney.</i>

84
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,100
My codes. Still here.

85
00:04:31,886 --> 00:04:36,901
And also a crab hand-roll for the lady.

86
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:40,288
Light wasabi, but "light" light,
as if you just washed your hands...

87
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:43,292
...and only the residue
of previous orders remains.

88
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:45,874
Didn't realize
how old-fashioned you were, Chuck.

89
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:49,422
Because I was ordering food for my girl?
I just know what she likes.

90
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:51,590
You sure do. Thanks, sweetie.

91
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:52,881
Welcome, sweetie.

92
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,675
No, old-fashioned,
how slow you guys are taking things.

93
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:56,927
- Devon.
- What?

94
00:04:56,995 --> 00:05:01,049
You guys are joined at the hip, but that's
not where you're supposed to be joined.

95
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:03,850
It's like the east wing of our apartment
took a vow of celibacy.

96
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:06,479
That is none of our business.

97
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:08,731
- Um, edamame?
- Oh, your sleeve.

98
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,732
- Shoot.
- Are you ever gonna retire that sweater?

99
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,523
- Hope not.
- It's my lucky sweater.

100
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,030
More like my lucky sweater.

101
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,114
Was wearing it the first time I met Ellie
in epidemiology class.

102
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:22,616
He told me that L. L. Bean must've
stolen the color from my eyes...

103
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:24,287
...so it really belonged to me.

104
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:31,217
Thank you for dinner.

105
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:39,386
Well, you guys wait here, I'll get the car.
I found a space around the corner.

106
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,348
Hey! Hey, easy.

107
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:51,735
Sir? Can you hear me?

108
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:53,697
What's your name?

109
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:55,153
Can someone call an ambulance?

110
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:58,155
Can you hear me, sir?

111
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:00,827
Shallow respiration, thready pulse.
Chuck, Chuck.

112
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:02,286
Check for medical ID.

113
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,125
Help me, please. Help me.

114
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,957
Just relax.
We're doing everything we can.

115
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,005
That's my sister.

116
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:14,709
Eleanor Fay Bartowski,
saving that dude's life.

117
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,982
That's my sister,
saving that bad dude's life.

118
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:23,868
Hey, do you think Ellie's okay?
Should I call the hospital again?

119
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:26,202
You've called 10 times
in the past 20 minutes.

120
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:28,667
Yeah, I know,
but what about sweaty nuclear guy?

121
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:29,918
What if he hurts her?

122
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:32,796
Come on, people saw Ellie at the ER.
She's gonna be fine.

123
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:35,425
Hey. You spending the night?

124
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:38,800
My little pep talk
must've inspired you guys. Mazel tov.

125
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:42,600
Yeah. Uh, actually, Sarah's just
hanging out till Ellie gets home.

126
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,099
Why? She's a doctor, Chuck.

127
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:45,394
Emergencies happen.

128
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:49,184
When somebody asks, "Is there a doctor
in the house?" That's our cue.

129
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:53,104
- I'm gonna make coffee. Want some?
- Absolutely.

130
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:55,274
Listen, I know it's been a while...

131
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:59,496
...since you've taken your, uh,
bike out for a ride, you know?

132
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,830
But it is time
to oil up that rusty chain...

133
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:05,497
...hop on that seat
and start pedaling away, bro.

134
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:07,372
You never forget how to ride, okay?

135
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:10,333
Lock it out. Come on.

136
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,003
Nice.

137
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:14,719
Oh, hey. There she is.

138
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,014
- Hi, honey.
- Ellie! Oh, my God.

139
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:18,806
Oh, my God. You're okay.

140
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:21,010
Oh, my God, you're fine. You're fine.

141
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:22,722
Why wouldn't you be fine?

142
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,977
Why wouldn't she be fine?
What happened?

143
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:26,982
We tried everything. Nothing worked.

144
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:31,942
I think he was poisoned
or had an allergic reaction or something.

145
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,277
I'm going to bed.

146
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:34,984
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

147
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:36,909
- Good night.
Sleep tight.

148
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:38,240
Night.

149
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:41,704
I'm getting way too comfortable
lying and sneaking around.

150
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:44,115
I'm starting to feel
that that is my real life.

151
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:46,963
It's all to be expected.
It's an existential spy crisis.

152
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,702
It used to be all compartmentalized:
Chuck world and spy world.

153
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:52,082
When I watched
those ambulance doors close...

154
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:55,592
...and my sister was behind them
with that sweaty, nuclear-spy freak...

155
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:57,174
...my worlds collided.

156
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:58,759
I put Ellie's life in danger.

157
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,095
No. That guy was sick with or without
the Intersect in your head.

158
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,227
Spy world or no,
Ellie helped that guy...

159
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:06,805
...because that is
what she is trained to do.

160
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,064
Yeah, I guess so.

161
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,033
There's something else
I have to talk to you about.

162
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,828
- What's that?
- I'm a little worried about our cover.

163
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,575
I think it's time for us to make love.

164
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,578
That's hot coffee.

165
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,585
<i>The Intersect was correct...</i>

166
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,088
<i>...in identifying Whitney.
Subject had nuclear intel.</i>

167
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,385
<i>However, Bartowski incorrectly
perceived Whitney as a threat.</i>

168
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,597
- Chuck's not wrong very often.
- But he's annoying all the time.

169
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,387
<i>Whitney was a programmer
for a top-secret project.</i>

170
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,812
<i>Code name: Sanctuary.</i>

171
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,355
<i>When Whitney disappeared...</i>

172
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,901
<i>...so did the Sanctuary data
on the computer chip.</i>

173
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,656
Wait, so whoever has the chip...

174
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,944
...essentially has a skeleton key
to our nuclear facilities?

175
00:09:58,057 --> 00:09:59,571
<i>Precisely, Agent Walker.</i>

176
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,237
<i>In the wrong hands,
this is potentially catastrophic.</i>

177
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,159
<i>Casey, bring Chuck to the morgue.</i>

178
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,332
<i>Maybe there's a clue only he can see
to ascertain Whitney's cause of death.</i>

179
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,128
<i>Agent Walker,
search the body for the missing codes.</i>

180
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:14,756
<i>Maybe there's a chance
he still has them on him.</i>

181
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:24,060
Dude. This is weird,
you're back from lunch on time.

182
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,519
Man, Big Mike's working me
to the bone, dude.

183
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:29,477
He's got me on some extra assignment,
says it's super-secret.

184
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:32,143
Don't tell me, because if you do,
it's not gonna be a secret.

185
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:35,820
Wants me to help Harry Tang's wife
pick out a gift for their anniversary.

186
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,985
Well, that's great.
I mean, he trusts you.

187
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:41,576
Dude, I don't have time for this.
I'm a very busy man-boy.

188
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:44,625
Morgan, think of it as an opportunity
to learn something...

189
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:49,335
...you'd otherwise never know
about our freakish leader.

190
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:52,873
- Okay.
- Yeah.

191
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:57,923
Ms. Harry Tang?

192
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:00,974
Thick Mike say
you help me pick prize for Harry.

193
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:02,389
Yeah. Hi, I'm Morgan.

194
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:06,096
Shh. Big secret.
Poopie-Cat is the jealous type.

195
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,596
Keep it under your head.

196
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:10,568
Any idea what Harry wants?
I buy him plasma TV.

197
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:12,059
Biggest you got.

198
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,938
Okay. I'm gonna go
draw up the paperwork.

199
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:17,192
Oh! Harry be so happy!

200
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:20,743
Give me some sugar, sugar.

201
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,113
This'll be helpful to us one day, Jeffrey.

202
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:25,782
Meet me in
the home-theater room tomorrow night.

203
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:28,244
Knowledge is power.

204
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:31,957
My mom used to say,
"Knowledge is powder. "

205
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:34,419
You don't talk about your mom much.

206
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:38,461
She's doing a stretch
up in the state pen at Chowchilla.

207
00:11:38,827 --> 00:11:41,339
Thank you so much.
- Move, move.

208
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:49,726
- Hey.
- Hey.

209
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,517
Okay, just give me the verdict, Chuck.
I can take it.

210
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,854
- You sure?
- Lf you're teasing me, please stop.

211
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:57,155
If you're not teasing me,
don't lie to me.

212
00:11:57,222 --> 00:11:58,606
Good as new-ish.

213
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:00,988
I don't believe you.

214
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:04,034
You can learn a lot about a person,
uh, through their cell phone.

215
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:07,328
For example, I saw that you listed
your nana first, under "A Nana. "

216
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,412
Heh. Thank you.

217
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:12,210
- Hey, yeah.
- You really saved my ass, Chuck.

218
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:14,547
You love your Nana,
and have the mouth of a trucker.

219
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:16,260
You're a very complicated woman.

220
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:18,587
I brought you something, for fixing it.

221
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,508
Thanks.

222
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:21,714
Uh...

223
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:26,104
- A sandwich?
- It is, uh, the sandwich.

224
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,811
Turkey, Muenster, egg bread.

225
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,854
I'm even gonna call it
the Chuck Bartowski.

226
00:12:32,925 --> 00:12:35,817
I can't believe you're gonna
name a sandwich after me.

227
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:40,367
You know, you should come by the shop
sometime and taste it fresh.

228
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:45,249
Yeah. Yeah. Ahem. Yeah.

229
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:46,953
Yes, I'd love that, Lou.

230
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:49,370
This is kind of the biggest honor...

231
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:51,082
- Sarah.
- Hi.

232
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:52,923
I'm Sarah.

233
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:57,756
Lou. Lou is her name.

234
00:12:57,827 --> 00:13:01,928
This is Lou.
I was fixing Lou's phone for her, Lou.

235
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:04,509
Who's that? That's Sarah.

236
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,101
Yeah, she said that. Uh, who's Sarah?

237
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,814
Sarah is, hmm...

238
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,483
What's the best way to describe?

239
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,902
Sarah is my...

240
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:17,736
- Girlfriend.
- Mm-hm.

241
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:19,534
Nice to meet you.

242
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:23,072
Nice to meet you, Sarah.
Uh, you should refrigerate that.

243
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:26,741
Because it'd be a shame
for the Chuck to make you sick.

244
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:29,830
Yes, absolutely, I... Great idea.

245
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:36,082
Uh, there's more to the Mason Whitney
incident than we thought.

246
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,512
Let's go, Chuck.

247
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:40,926
This is just a storage room.

248
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,259
They just happen to store
people in this room.

249
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:46,306
People who are no longer breathing
and who are refrigerated.

250
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:48,681
Man up, Bartowski.
Gotta store them somewhere.

251
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:51,811
Better than stacked up on a curb
like garbage, right?

252
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:55,936
Eyes on the prize.
Getting any flashes?

253
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:57,491
Good Lord, the man is naked.

254
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:00,908
Appears rigor mortis has set in too.

255
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:09,537
- You find anything?
Nothing yet.

256
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,043
No codes.

257
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,166
Hang on a second. What is this?

258
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,175
I appreciate you taking the time...

259
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,087
...to answer my questions,
Dr. Bartowski.

260
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,462
Not at all.

261
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:25,097
Okay. Now, did the deceased
hand anything to you?

262
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,350
No.

263
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,848
Say anything specific to you?

264
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:31,184
He just asked me to help him.

265
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:34,651
Did you hide anything for him?

266
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:39,656
- I beg your pardon.
- Did he transfer anything to your person?

267
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:45,324
Uh, I've told you everything I know,
officer. I'm sorry if I can't be more help.

268
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:46,656
That's all right.

269
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:48,537
I think we have everything we need.

270
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:52,330
If you don't mind, I'd just like to get
a quick photo for the records.

271
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:01,217
Bug.

272
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:04,385
All right. Uh...

273
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:09,223
Actually, just gonna
move your hair back a bit.

274
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:12,685
There's a certain protocol
required for the framing.

275
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:18,196
Now, say, "Cheesecake. "

276
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:19,820
Uh, ha, cheesecake.

277
00:15:25,478 --> 00:15:27,124
What is it?

278
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:30,413
The guy was poisoned.
Toxic derivative of Pentothal.

279
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:33,250
Initially, the subject becomes
uncontrollably truthful.

280
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:35,624
After it accumulates
in the occipital lobe...

281
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:39,087
...victim suffers from unconsciousness
and eventually death.

282
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,255
- What's the time line on this thing?
Can't say.

283
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:43,464
Could be a couple hours.

284
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,639
Could be minutes,
depending on the concentration.

285
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:51,848
I just need you to sign this affidavit
and we'll be all done.

286
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:10,869
Love the new welcome mat,
Mrs. Heditsian.

287
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:13,335
Good to see you. Did you go biking?

288
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:16,670
If I think of anything else,
I will be sure to let you know.

289
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:18,048
I'm sure you will.

290
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:22,508
Have a good day, sir.

291
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:26,343
Huh. Tiniest cop I've ever seen.

292
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:40,942
Uh-uh. You know the rules, Walker.

293
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:43,610
Not while the green's
out of the machine.

294
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:46,245
Your parents did a real number on you,
didn't they?

295
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:48,243
Yes, they did.

296
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:50,789
Come here.

297
00:16:53,987 --> 00:16:57,258
I just wanted to make sure
we're all set for tonight's mission.

298
00:16:57,323 --> 00:17:00,927
Yeah. I mean, it's been a while
since I've slept with someone.

299
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:03,969
Not slept with someone,
but slept with...

300
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:07,061
It's actually been a while
since I've done either one, so...

301
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,185
Chuck, listen,
I know this is kind of uncomfortable.

302
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,558
- It's fine.
- It's just that we have to do it.

303
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,977
- I mean, not do it...
- I got it.

304
00:17:15,092 --> 00:17:19,063
- So we don't blow our cover.
- I got it, I got it.

305
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,739
Okay.

306
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:26,997
Lou! Hey.

307
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:29,879
Hey, hey. Hey, wait, wait, wait.

308
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:32,915
Lou, listen.
About earlier with Sarah, I can explain.

309
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:35,967
Forget it. You don't have to be single
to fix a phone.

310
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:37,837
Maybe our signals just got crossed.

311
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:39,174
No, no, not at all.

312
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:42,389
That's kind of what I'm trying to say,
they weren't crossed.

313
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:46,549
You know, Sarah and I, me and Sarah,
that whole thing, it's really very...

314
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,474
It's complicated.

315
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:53,319
Well, is she your girlfriend or not?

316
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:55,729
Well, yeah, sort of, kind of.

317
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:59,488
Hard to explain. I really, really,
very badly wish that I could explain.

318
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:03,657
Listen, if you're not gonna tell me
the truth, I'll tell you, okay?

319
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:05,325
I like you.

320
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:07,575
I like almost everything about you.

321
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:10,420
I think you're cute, you're funny.

322
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,502
Our vast height difference
intrigues me.

323
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:16,457
- Wanna know what I don't like?
- Very, very much.

324
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:20,259
I think anyone who cheats on his
girlfriend is a big, fat, stupid jackass.

325
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,715
Exactly. I concur.

326
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:25,933
Of course you do,
which is why I like you.

327
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:30,356
Why don't we do this, okay?

328
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,021
If your situation
ever gets less complicated...

329
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:37,354
...you just let me know, okay?

330
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:38,907
Okay. Yeah.

331
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:42,524
- Let me. I can get that.
- I got it.

332
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,612
Have a great day. Drive safe.

333
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:51,664
<i>Meet me in
the home-theater room tomorrow night.</i>

334
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:53,498
Again.

335
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:55,128
You sure, Harry?

336
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:56,960
- You've watched it 20 times.
- Again!

337
00:18:58,782 --> 00:19:00,797
<i>Oh, my little pancake.</i>

338
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:03,760
<i>Meet me in the home-theater room
tomorrow night.</i>

339
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:05,559
Again!

340
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:07,436
<i>Oh, my little pancake.</i>

341
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,934
<i>Meet me in the home-theater room
tomorrow night.</i>

342
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:16,650
Let's watch it again.

343
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,221
Ellie let me in.

344
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,603
Wow, Chuck.

345
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:54,016
What do you think
is gonna happen here tonight?

346
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:57,737
Why? What do you think I think?

347
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:00,189
Well, I don't know.
The candles and the music.

348
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:04,447
I mean, you do know we're just spending
the night together for cover, right?

349
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why would I
possibly think anything else?

350
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:12,410
By now I'd say I'm pretty familiar
with the concept of faking it, so...

351
00:20:13,985 --> 00:20:16,760
<i>We've gotta
take this assignment seriously.</i>

352
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:18,628
<i>Okay, I'll lose the music.</i>

353
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,884
You can change in the bathroom.

354
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:24,558
That's okay.

355
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,608
What? You give me crap
about lighting some candles...

356
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,850
...and you come in wearing that?

357
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:36,062
What, this? This is part of my cover.

358
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:37,894
It doesn't cover a thing.

359
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,071
What if Ellie or Awesome
were to walk in?

360
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:42,733
This is what a girlfriend would wear
to seduce her boyfriend.

361
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:45,034
I'm just being professional.

362
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:49,375
Yeah, the world's oldest profession.

363
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:52,034
Oh, right. Well, that's real nice.

364
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:55,048
What is the matter with you
tonight, anyway?

365
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:07,886
<i>Wanna watch some TV, babe?</i>

366
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,387
<i>No, read a book.
Fine, I've got work to do.</i>

367
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:14,521
You think Chuck's gonna seal the deal
with Sarah tonight?

368
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,522
Gross. You're talking
about my brother.

369
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:18,404
He's got your genes, babe.

370
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:22,025
And I ought to know, the Bartowskis
are very passionate people.

371
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:26,779
Remember the last time we spent
the night at your parents' house?

372
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:29,323
I found them
bouncing around in the Jacuzzi.

373
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:31,878
Whoa, brain stamp.

374
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:35,372
Shoe doesn't feel so great when
it's on the other foot, now does it?

375
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,968
And you know what? You know what?

376
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,712
What's up with the porno shorts, huh?

377
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:47,889
I mean, clearly, Mrs. Heditsian
likes to enjoy all the hills and valleys...

378
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:51,763
...but really, really, they leave,
like, nothing to the imagination.

379
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:59,186
Okay. Babe, your, uh...
Your mood tonight is super honest.

380
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:01,319
And I think that's awesome.

381
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:04,364
And then there's that.

382
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:09,573
<i>"Awesome. " Everything is
so freaking awesome!</i>

383
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:13,458
Let me tell you, if everything is awesome
and there is no un-awesome...

384
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:15,711
...then awesome is just mediocre.

385
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,878
When is the last time
you did something nice for me?

386
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:21,924
Bought me something for no reason,
just because it's Monday?

387
00:22:21,993 --> 00:22:23,176
Calm down, babe.

388
00:22:23,244 --> 00:22:26,136
We're starting to sound like them,
aren't we?

389
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:29,352
A little.

390
00:22:33,922 --> 00:22:35,650
Are you okay?

391
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:38,146
Is there anything
you wanna talk about?

392
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:50,041
What exactly are the rules with our...?
Like, you know, our thing?

393
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:53,543
What do you mean?

394
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:56,545
What I mean...

395
00:22:57,488 --> 00:23:00,676
Hypothetically speaking,
are we allowed to see other people?

396
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:04,381
Well, uh,
our cover is boyfriend-girlfriend...

397
00:23:04,453 --> 00:23:06,301
...so tactically
that would be challenging.

398
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:08,967
Plus any prospective date
would have to endure...

399
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:13,310
...a rigorous vetting process
to determine her motivation.

400
00:23:14,256 --> 00:23:16,068
Wouldn't her motivation be love?

401
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:18,644
Ideally, but you're a very important
piece of intelligence.

402
00:23:18,718 --> 00:23:20,696
You have to be handled
with extreme care.

403
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:23,108
Well, that sounds very nice.

404
00:23:23,181 --> 00:23:26,488
Chuck, I don't have to be a spy
to piece together the clues here.

405
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:30,871
You're interested in that Lou girl,
aren't you?

406
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:32,575
Well...

407
00:23:33,901 --> 00:23:35,629
<i>Come on, babe. Get back in bed.</i>

408
00:23:35,736 --> 00:23:37,833
<i>I think I'm just gonna sleep on the floor.</i>

409
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:40,216
<i>Chuck, we can't compromise our cover.</i>

410
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:42,628
<i>Well, you know what?
I feel compromised already.</i>

411
00:23:45,454 --> 00:23:48,725
I have known him
since the day he was born, obviously.

412
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,262
When people would ask him
what he wanted to be...

413
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:53,931
...he would always say the same thing:
"A big boy. "

414
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:56,558
- How cute is that?
- Ellie, you're killing me here.

415
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:58,813
And now he is a big boy.

416
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:02,773
And I can tell that he is
because he is with a big, big girl.

417
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:05,869
Sorry, guys.
Don't mean to muck up your mojo.

418
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:07,741
- Tried to stop her.
- Is she drunk?

419
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:10,447
You need a haircut.
It's making funny animal shapes.

420
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,915
Let's go, babe.
These two need their privacy.

421
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:15,964
When you were 7, that burglar
stole money from your piggy bank.

422
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:17,211
That was a lie. It was me.

423
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,761
At the time, I felt it was very important
for me to have a New Kids fanny pack.

424
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:23,217
Ellie, are you okay?

425
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:26,764
Have you done anything
out of the ordinary?

426
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,889
Words taste like peaches.

427
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,139
Okay. We're gonna go now.

428
00:24:31,252 --> 00:24:34,855
Let you kids get back
to doing whatever it is you're doing.

429
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:36,650
Have fun, all right?

430
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:42,863
Sorry to bother you folks.
Can you spare some milk?

431
00:24:42,973 --> 00:24:45,365
Moo juice coming right up.

432
00:24:48,102 --> 00:24:50,033
Casey, what are you doing here?

433
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:52,326
Getting some crosstalk.

434
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:53,618
Why? What from?

435
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:56,708
Those pajamas make you look like
Dennis the Menace's father.

436
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:05,841
Ellie. Ellie, Ellie.

437
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:21,780
Well, she was poisoned.

438
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:40,417
Hey. Pulled the video surveillance.

439
00:25:40,532 --> 00:25:43,839
A man posing as an officer
exposed your sister to the poison.

440
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,588
Why would anyone wanna hurt Ellie?

441
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,971
She doesn't know any nuclear codes.
She doesn't even want a microwave.

442
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:54,605
Good news. The person who poisoned
her is still looking for the intel chip.

443
00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:56,649
No, no, no,
there is no good news, okay?

444
00:25:56,715 --> 00:25:59,571
My sister was poisoned
by the same stuff as the dead guy.

445
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:03,648
Medical teams are trying to identify the
poisoning agent to create an antidote.

446
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:07,402
There's no time! If it's the same poison,
Ellie's only got a few hours.

447
00:26:07,517 --> 00:26:09,698
Look, this is easy.
We gotta find the codes.

448
00:26:09,812 --> 00:26:12,407
We get the bad guy to trade us
for the antidote.

449
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:13,700
We do this in our sleep.

450
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:16,037
Even if we knew where they were,
that's not practical.

451
00:26:16,152 --> 00:26:19,174
Can't risk the bad guy
endangering millions for the one.

452
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,169
This is my sister we're talking about.
We can't sit around and watch her die.

453
00:26:24,828 --> 00:26:29,309
Okay. The only clue we have so far
is the bug that we found on Ellie.

454
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:32,521
Soundproof box. Don't want
the bad guy knowing we're onto him.

455
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:35,098
We got a team working
on reversing the tracking signal.

456
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,561
- What are you doing?
- Found the codes.

457
00:26:37,673 --> 00:26:39,403
Can't believe
where Whitney hid them.

458
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:43,113
I'm gonna keep them on the lady doctor
until we can move them safely.

459
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,030
Now the bad guy's gonna come to us.

460
00:26:49,102 --> 00:26:50,286
Not bad, Bartowski.

461
00:26:52,147 --> 00:26:54,578
Do that ever again, and I'll kill you.

462
00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:01,011
I'm gonna fix this, Ellie. I swear.

463
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:05,097
Look, I know that you think
I'm just Chuck...

464
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:08,219
...your screw-up little brother.

465
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:10,932
But there's a lot about me
you don't know.

466
00:27:14,796 --> 00:27:16,727
See, I'm...

467
00:27:18,676 --> 00:27:21,186
I'm also Chuck,
the guy with all these...

468
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,236
...important government secrets
in my brain.

469
00:27:25,765 --> 00:27:28,907
I can make this better.
I will make this better.

470
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,336
Everything is so different now.
Everything is so different now.

471
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,167
I used to be able to come to you
and ask your advice about anything.

472
00:27:40,822 --> 00:27:43,631
And now my whole life is like a lie.

473
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:58,684
Went downstairs
to get Ellie's sweater from her locker.

474
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:01,030
Her lucky sweater.

475
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:03,196
She could use it.

476
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:05,693
Thanks, Devon.

477
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,928
Freeze!

478
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,653
Okay.

479
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,234
I've got what you want:

480
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:25,532
The antidote
to save your doctor friend.

481
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,236
Give it to her, she might live.

482
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:32,245
Just trade me for the codes.

483
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:35,626
Or I can poison all of you...

484
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,583
...and force you to tell me
where you've hidden my codes.

485
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:42,331
And then you will die too...

486
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,798
...just like the doctor.

487
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,140
Your choice.

488
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:49,762
I found them! I found them!

489
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,804
The codes are on the necklace.
I found them.

490
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,224
The vial.

491
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:09,620
Wait, wait!

492
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,949
Hey!

493
00:30:41,552 --> 00:30:44,063
Casey, wait. What about Chuck?

494
00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:47,319
- Here.
- No. No, it's for Ellie.

495
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:50,372
There's no debate, it has to be you.
You're the Intersect.

496
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:53,748
I won't take it
knowing that Ellie will die without it.

497
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:55,953
You're a good person,
but I got a job to do.

498
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:57,872
Take it
before I shove it down your throat.

499
00:30:57,985 --> 00:31:00,166
- Okay, fine, fine, I'll do it.
- Thank you.

500
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:03,171
I'll pretend to take it,
then I'll run to my sister's room.

501
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:06,132
- Why did I say that out loud?
- It makes you tell the truth.

502
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:09,224
I'll put a gun to your head and
threaten to shoot if you don't take it.

503
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,763
- Would you shoot me?
- No.

504
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:13,017
Don't waste the bullet.
We're already dead.

505
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:14,931
I'm saving my sister.

506
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:24,112
Hey. Hey, sis.

507
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,533
There's some more.
There's some more.

508
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:45,427
You know, if I had a blog,
this would be a really big day for me.

509
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:48,004
Do my laundry. Check.

510
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:50,472
Save my sister's life. Check.

511
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,758
Save my own life.

512
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,806
Final entry.

513
00:31:55,127 --> 00:31:58,601
I am so sorry about all of this.

514
00:31:58,923 --> 00:32:00,855
It's okay. It's okay.

515
00:32:00,968 --> 00:32:03,443
It's not ideal, but I've lived
a pretty good life.

516
00:32:03,511 --> 00:32:06,950
I mean, how many guys can say
they landed a helicopter...

517
00:32:07,015 --> 00:32:09,195
...and saved the lives
of innocent people?

518
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:12,201
Courageous and honorable members
of the U.S. Military.

519
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:16,331
And the silver lining is now I don't have
to work out my five-year plan again.

520
00:32:16,442 --> 00:32:19,581
Streamlined that down
to about five hours.

521
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:39,067
Bad guy's name is Riordan Payne.
Used to be an Olympic gymnast.

522
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:42,522
Now he sells hard-to-find items, like
nuclear codes, to hard-to-find people.

523
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,524
People wanna spend cash
on these codes.

524
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,776
- They're not gonna get the chance.
- Why not?

525
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,739
Because this thing's
gonna lead us right to him.

526
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,890
- I got it, I got it.
- I got it.

527
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:16,518
Well, who's better at it?

528
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:18,358
- I am.
- She is. Damn truth serum.

529
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,402
God, you're so pretty.

530
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,121
And, Casey, your jaw was chiseled
by Michelangelo himself.

531
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:38,169
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

532
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:48,883
Yes? Who is it?

533
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:53,228
The NSA, CIA, and me,
who's a little tougher to explain.

534
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:57,519
We all have our skill set.

535
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:00,978
Freeze!

536
00:34:02,176 --> 00:34:05,067
My partner would rather shoot you
than let you get away.

537
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:07,318
You called me your partner.

538
00:34:08,057 --> 00:34:10,995
- Where are the codes, son of a bitch?
- First, the antidote.

539
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:15,292
Actually, I was just about
to enjoy a little antidote myself.

540
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:19,125
What kind of host would I be
if I didn't offer you some as well?

541
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:26,297
Careful there. I haven't killed anyone in
a little while, I'm getting a little hungry.

542
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:41,149
No, no, wait, wait,
don't, don't, don't.

543
00:34:41,257 --> 00:34:43,319
- What, did you have a flash?
- No.

544
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:46,111
No, I've just read
tons of comic books.

545
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:50,871
The villain always samples it first.

546
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:56,621
Good one, Chuck.

547
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:59,462
All right.

548
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,768
Very unsportsmanlike.

549
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,313
I like it.

550
00:35:21,007 --> 00:35:25,275
The antidote's in the cabinet,
bottom right shelf.

551
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:26,528
Key is in my pocket.

552
00:35:26,637 --> 00:35:28,865
Codes are in my right shoe.

553
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:38,244
No, wait, wait, wait. Not yet, not yet.

554
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:39,999
Why? What's the matter?

555
00:35:40,068 --> 00:35:42,415
Nothing, it's just that this...

556
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:47,629
...will probably be the last chance
that I have to know the truth.

557
00:35:48,828 --> 00:35:50,805
I know you're just doing your job here.

558
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:53,812
But sometimes it feels so real,
you know?

559
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,304
So tell me...

560
00:35:57,295 --> 00:35:59,688
...you and me, us...

561
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:06,778
...our thing under the undercover thing,
is this ever going anywhere?

562
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:17,745
I'm sorry, Chuck.

563
00:36:20,777 --> 00:36:22,341
No.

564
00:36:29,495 --> 00:36:31,093
Got it.

565
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:34,849
Got it. Thank you for being honest.

566
00:36:36,835 --> 00:36:40,059
Even though I guess you don't really
have a choice in the matter.

567
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:48,777
Not bad.

568
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,410
<i>We've received the codes.</i>

569
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,461
<i>Our weapon sites
are more secure than ever.</i>

570
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,499
<i>Congratulations on a job well-done.</i>

571
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:03,252
Trying to have sex with my wife.

572
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,916
I'm gonna kick your ass.

573
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:13,548
Okay, Morgan Grimes.

574
00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:17,892
You mess with the bull,
you get the horns.

575
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:27,823
<i>Major Casey,
who's infiltrated the home-theater room?</i>

576
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:32,493
I see nothing out of the ordinary here.

577
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:34,366
Carry on, Bartowski.

578
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:35,863
Stay right where you are.

579
00:37:35,938 --> 00:37:39,128
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you gonna do with him?

580
00:37:39,192 --> 00:37:41,040
We'll take care of it.

581
00:37:41,443 --> 00:37:43,008
You're good, Tang. Very good.

582
00:37:43,072 --> 00:37:45,133
- I am?
- Of course you are.

583
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,342
I know you've been onto us
for a while now.

584
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:48,842
But you nailed us this time.

585
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:50,260
- I did?
- Of course you did.

586
00:37:50,328 --> 00:37:53,968
You've always known that Sarah and I
worked undercover for the government.

587
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:57,311
I knew it. I knew Bartowski
couldn't bag anyone as hot as blondie.

588
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,561
Never mind Bartowski.

589
00:37:58,629 --> 00:38:01,520
He's small potatoes.
Just a pawn we used to lure you here.

590
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:03,936
- I'm the big potato?
- You're the big potato.

591
00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:06,530
We're requesting
you relocate to Oahu.

592
00:38:06,595 --> 00:38:09,819
Await further instructions
on how to aid your country from there.

593
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,153
- I'm gonna be a spy?
- No.

594
00:38:12,226 --> 00:38:13,741
That would give a name to it.

595
00:38:18,274 --> 00:38:19,956
Wow.

596
00:38:20,109 --> 00:38:23,084
Leave the Buy More.
I never thought this day would come.

597
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:26,586
Don't know what it is about this place,
but it gets under your skin.

598
00:38:26,658 --> 00:38:27,841
Yeah.

599
00:38:29,953 --> 00:38:32,928
Proud to serve my country
in any way I can, sir.

600
00:38:40,422 --> 00:38:42,269
Hey, Big Mike, you wanted to see me.

601
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,564
Thanks for your help with
Harry Tang's wife. Did me a huge favor.

602
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:47,399
Yeah, just doing my job there, sir.

603
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,821
- Oh, and Grimes.
- Uh-huh.

604
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,526
Change the address
on Tang's plasma delivery.

605
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,822
Send it to their new place in Oahu.

606
00:38:53,894 --> 00:38:55,327
- Oahu?
- Heh.

607
00:38:55,395 --> 00:38:58,704
Tang got himself
a taste of the sweet life.

608
00:38:58,817 --> 00:39:01,874
Manager of some pineapple factory.

609
00:39:01,944 --> 00:39:05,085
Wait, so we're free?
No more Harry Tang?

610
00:39:05,197 --> 00:39:07,674
- I'm not the only one glad to see him go.
- No.

611
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:11,381
I know he can be tough, but use
your discretion with this information.

612
00:39:11,495 --> 00:39:15,218
I got so many secrets crammed in here,
fire marshal wants to shut it down.

613
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:20,474
Had no choice but to give Harry Tang
the assistant-manager position.

614
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:26,650
Felt so damn guilty
about diddling his wife...

615
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:29,108
...for the past six months.

616
00:39:29,222 --> 00:39:32,909
No, I will not miss the man at all.

617
00:39:34,644 --> 00:39:36,623
But I will forever dream...

618
00:39:37,898 --> 00:39:40,458
...about the lady Tang.

619
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:22,082
Oh, hey.
I didn't know you were coming by.

620
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:25,878
Um...

621
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:29,549
Sarah, you know
when you think you're gonna die...

622
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:32,806
...and your whole life
is supposed to flash in front of you?

623
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:36,466
That didn't exactly happen
for me yesterday.

624
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:41,937
In fact, mostly it was
just a list that I saw.

625
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,436
A list of stuff that I haven't done...

626
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:46,938
...and things
that I haven't had a chance to say.

627
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:49,234
So today...

628
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:53,450
...I wanna start
crossing things off of my list.

629
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:58,667
And this is the first thing
that I promised myself that I'd do.

630
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,047
We need to break up.

631
00:41:08,658 --> 00:41:09,962
What?

632
00:41:10,036 --> 00:41:13,175
You know, like, fake break up
our pretend relationship.

633
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:21,775
I just can't do this anymore,
you know?

634
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:25,237
The longer we go, the longer
we keep trying to fool people...

635
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:27,564
...into believing
that we're a real couple...

636
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:32,240
...the person I keep fooling
the most...

637
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:35,074
...is me.

638
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,470
- Yeah?
- I meant to ask you...

639
00:41:58,543 --> 00:42:01,733
...when you were affected, did you say
anything to compromise yourself?

640
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:03,561
Uh, no.

641
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:08,901
But if I hadn't been trained
to withstand Pentothal, I might have.
