1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,613
Chinese.

2
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:07,031
Chinese?
Oh, yeah, man.

3
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:09,489
It's what an evening
with Morgan's all about.

4
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,447
You didn't forget to tell her, did you?

5
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:18,955
No, no, no, of course not, no.
She's looking forward to it all week.

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,833
"Oh, when are we gonna hang out
with your funny friend?"

7
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:24,203
- She says that? Good, good, good.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,743
Make sure her head's in the game.

9
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,783
This is her shot to prove she has
something to bring to this relationship.

10
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:30,705
- Feel me?
- Nothing but feeling you.

11
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:31,952
Good, good, good.

12
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:35,578
An evening with Morgan will begin
at 7 sharp. Bring your A game.

13
00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:37,491
Love you, pal.

14
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:41,407
- An evening of Morgan.
- Okay, so here's the thing.

15
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:42,956
Uh, he's my best friend.

16
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:46,205
And I haven't gotten to spend
any time with him or Ellie this week...

17
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:48,530
...and so he really
wanted us to hang out tonight.

18
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:50,330
For an evening of Morgan?

19
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:54,037
I thought being stationed in Khyber Pass
for six months was brutal.

20
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:57,489
If you're so sad about not being
included, Casey, you could say so.

21
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:59,413
Dinner with you and Morgan.

22
00:00:59,582 --> 00:01:03,030
I'd rather Afghani warlords
bleed me from my liver.

23
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,245
- He's a happy person.
- Mm-hm.

24
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:10,532
I appreciate that about him.
And he works hard, so...

25
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:35,579
WOMAN

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,528
An evening with Morgan
will consist of three acts.

27
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:44,163
Act One: Dinner.

28
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:45,788
What are we having?

29
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:48,907
A little delicacy called sizzling shrimp.

30
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:53,027
We're gonna pack our bellies so full,
you're gonna make a seal jealous.

31
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:54,948
Wow, sounds like quite a night.

32
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:56,948
Oh, and that's just the beginning.

33
00:01:57,123 --> 00:02:01,282
Dinner will be followed by a screening
at Chuck's of the greatest kung-fu film:

34
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:03,577
<i>Enter the Dragon.</i>

35
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:05,489
Prepare to die, my bearded friend.

36
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:07,536
Bring it, bring it, come on.

37
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:09,205
What are you doing? Ow! Okay.

38
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:12,163
And the third act can only be found
here in Chinatown.

39
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,409
There he is. Be cool.

40
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:14,990
Hey, wait a minute.

41
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:18,820
- I thought you were off this stuff.
- Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Chuck, all right?

42
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,496
Daddy needs his fix, you know?

43
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:21,861
Dude.

44
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,989
You know how I feel
about fireworks.

45
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:27,694
You know what? To defeat fear,
one must embrace fear.

46
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,995
I'd rather embrace my limbs.
Specifically all of them.

47
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:33,196
- No fireworks, no sale.
Aw!

48
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:35,867
Can I say something?
This evening gets an asterisk, okay?

49
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,994
At least we still get
our shrimp though.

50
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,746
Aw, no, no, you gotta be kidding me.
They can't be closed.

51
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:47,490
An evening of Morgan
has to at least include sizzling shrimp.

52
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:49,779
Morgan, it's okay.
We'll do it another time.

53
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:53,237
No, no, I got this, I got this.
Lucky for us, I got connections.

54
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:56,162
Well, we gotta give him points
for effort.

55
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:03,160
My friend, Juan, he's a dishwasher.
Leaves his key for me, so...

56
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,285
Gotta make this quick. Ellie's waiting.

57
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:12,323
Ha, ha! Hear that sizzle?
It's like the sound of angels' laughter.

58
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:14,404
Wait here.

59
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:31,283
That waitress. She's Mei-Ling Cho,
Chinese intelligence.

60
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:33,113
Never set foot on U.S. Soil before.

61
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,201
- Sizzling shrimp anyone?
- My God.

62
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:38,778
Well, you can just call me Morgan, babe,
but I appreciate the enthusiasm.

63
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,658
Is this the woman you saw?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:44,150
- Read through these.
- Ah!

65
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,367
Twice. Let us know
if you flash on anything.

66
00:03:46,537 --> 00:03:48,777
Call the director.
We got a priority code orange.

67
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:51,407
Uh, guys? Is there any way
this can wait until morning?

68
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,949
I kind of have a priority code
Ellie and Morgan.

69
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:55,779
They're waiting for us for dinner.

70
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:57,411
China's top spy is in Los Angeles.

71
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:00,067
We don't know why she's here
or what she's planning to do.

72
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:02,776
You, my friend, may be the only one
who can figure that out.

73
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:04,488
That's your priority. Copy?

74
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:05,865
Copy.

75
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:47,361
Hey, sis. Morning.

76
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:49,492
Mm-hm.

77
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:51,119
Or not.

78
00:04:51,286 --> 00:04:52,779
Could you pass the Berry Loops?

79
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:55,821
Are you sure
you don't want any sizzling shrimp?

80
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,073
Right.

81
00:04:57,245 --> 00:05:00,824
- We have a whole lot of that left over.
- Because I got back late last night.

82
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:04,940
- Ha. This is the point I'm trying to make.
- And you're making it very well.

83
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:07,199
It's one thing to let shrimp
go to waste...

84
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:10,237
...it's another to stand me up,
but to leave me with Morgan?

85
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:12,573
And I feel terrible about that,
believe me. I do.

86
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,575
You know how much
I adore sizzling shrimp.

87
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:17,191
And you. More specifically you.

88
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:20,367
It just,
Sarah wasn't feeling well, and...

89
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:22,194
Oh, well, what is it? I'm a doctor.

90
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:28,034
I believe, uh, she had a spastic colon.

91
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,446
- Yuck.
- I know.

92
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:32,949
A girl that beautiful
with a colon that spastic.

93
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:35,572
- Well, you know what tomorrow is.
- Absolutely, yes.

94
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:38,493
It's very own October version
of Mother's Day...

95
00:05:38,702 --> 00:05:40,076
...and I wouldn't miss it.

96
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:41,944
I should hope not,
but then again...

97
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:45,484
...I never figured that you would pass
on sizzling shrimp either.

98
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:51,070
Spastic colon, what the...?

99
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:03,360
I went over the Department of Defense
files on Mei-Ling this morning.

100
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:04,909
Sorry, no flashes.

101
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:07,067
Maybe you'll flash
on something tonight.

102
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:09,910
- Tonight?
- We're running a surveillance op on her.

103
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:12,441
We're gonna tail her,
see if you flash on anyone.

104
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,069
Might tell us why she's here.

105
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:16,945
My first stakeout. Okay. Okay, yeah.

106
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:19,192
What do I need to bring?
Sweater, light jacket?

107
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,649
You just bring that computer
in your head, huh?

108
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:24,824
Okay, I have a lot more to offer
this team other than the Intersect.

109
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:27,440
For instance, what are we doing
for tunes tonight?

110
00:06:27,618 --> 00:06:29,490
I can make a stakeout mix.

111
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,823
John, need all the green shirts
in my office on the double.

112
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,660
Mm. Have fun.

113
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:37,991
That's really not fair. Ah.

114
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:41,572
Sales are down, people.

115
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:44,029
There's too much horsing around.

116
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:47,033
And what this team needs
is some good old-fashioned motivation.

117
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:49,405
I couldn't agree with you more,
big man.

118
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,319
Twenty-four-hour sales competition.
Starting now.

119
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:55,566
First prize: IPhone.

120
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,323
Second prize:
Large pizza, two toppings.

121
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:01,282
- Third prize...
- Don't even say small pizza.

122
00:07:01,492 --> 00:07:04,159
Because that's not a prize,
that's a punishment.

123
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,235
When I eat a small pizza and not only
am I still hungry, I'm angry.

124
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,613
You wouldn't want me hungry
because then I get cranky.

125
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:12,693
Then I get a little mean.
Then I kind of get sleepy.

126
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:15,480
- Third prize is you get to keep your job.
- Oh.

127
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:17,945
Last prize: You're fired.

128
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:20,949
Doesn't sound like
much of a prize either, am I right?

129
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:22,782
Let me show you the deluxe model.

130
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,695
Okay, now, supposedly this baby
makes delicious milkshakes.

131
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:29,065
You probably wanna hold off
on the calories, huh?

132
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:31,321
So let me show you
the exercise equipment.

133
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,323
It's actually right over here, so...

134
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:36,063
It's for the game?
Buy the big screen, man.

135
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:38,488
Game's over, return it.

136
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,235
Break it.
Kick a freaking hole in the thing.

137
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,195
Money back guaranteed, dude.
We'll even pick it up for you.

138
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:49,781
This is crazy. I know I'm the salesman,
but how much you want for your shirt?

139
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,481
I've been looking for something to go
with my beard, and this thing is just...

140
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,105
You know what?
Let me see the label? Could I ju...?

141
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:59,323
Grimes, you are the worst salesman
I've ever seen.

142
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:01,820
Vultures are circling. Get it in gear.

143
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:08,199
We're in trouble, Chuck. Harry Tang's
plan to eliminate us has gone into effect.

144
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:09,687
- Sales competition?
- Yeah, man.

145
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:12,443
Think you can carve out
about an hour after work, help me?

146
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,855
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

147
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:17,896
I'm sorry, buddy, no can do,
I already made plans with Sarah tonight.

148
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:21,522
Okay, all right. Uh, tomorrow,
me and you, a little Morgan time, huh?

149
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,406
I've got Mother's Day with Ellie.

150
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:27,112
I can only miss that if there was
a major national emergency.

151
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:29,315
So to speak. Ahem.

152
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:32,199
Listen to me, Chuck. Dude.

153
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:35,234
It's me, all right?
Now I'm begging you here.

154
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:39,401
I'm on my knees, you know?
Hat in hand, that sort of thing.

155
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:41,902
Help me, Chuck Bartowski.
You're my only hope.

156
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,065
Okay, okay. I'm gonna go out
with Sarah tonight.

157
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:47,694
I'm gonna wrap that up early
to get back and help you...

158
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:51,361
...and then I'll hang out
with Ellie tomorrow.

159
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,693
Yeah. Yeah, I think
I can make that work.

160
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:57,028
I knew I could count on you, bro.

161
00:08:58,657 --> 00:08:59,984
I hope so.

162
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:07,394
Hey, we got a bogey at 6 o'clock here.

163
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:16,109
Excuse me, someone send in
an order for sizzling shrimp?

164
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:19,196
- A Mr. Carmichael?
- Yeah, yeah. That's me.

165
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:21,065
That's me. I'll take that.

166
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,811
Thank you very much.
You go ahead and keep the change.

167
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,696
- Oh, thank you.
- Have a good night.

168
00:09:27,365 --> 00:09:30,279
What?
It's for Morgan, I called it in.

169
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:34,821
The idea behind a stakeout
is to remain inconspicuous, you moron.

170
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:37,520
Uh, hello? That's why I used an alias.

171
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:42,236
Hey, I think we have some company.

172
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,936
Who's that?
- Old Ironside is Ben Lo Pan.

173
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:50,401
He's the local big shot businessman.

174
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:52,030
Owns, like, half of Chinatown.

175
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:00,944
And there's Mei-Ling.

176
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:06,068
We're on.

177
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:10,655
She's gonna get ahead of us.
- No, we're good.

178
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:13,655
Always leave a 30-yard cushion
from your target on a tail.

179
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:17,312
- She's following Ben Lo Pan's limo.
- Oh, a tail on a tail.

180
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:19,396
Does that mean
like a 60-yard cushion...

181
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:23,020
...or would you say that regular tail rules
apply in this situati...?

182
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:51,232
Glocks and a crotch rocket.
My kind of gal.

183
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:03,480
Those aren't glocks.
They're Chinese army issue pistols.

184
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:05,112
She's not here on a spy mission.

185
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,603
She's here to assassinate
the guy in the wheelchair.

186
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,154
- You sure?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

187
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:11,644
Locked away in the brain here.
I mean, I'm not bragging.

188
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:14,352
- Intersect's doing the heavy lifting.
- We can't wait for cops.

189
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,812
By the time they get here, Mei-Ling
or Ben Lo Pan may be dead, or both.

190
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:19,895
Mei-Ling could be a part
of larger operation.

191
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,855
We need her alive.
Find out what she knows.

192
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,696
We catch her?
Chinese spy has a lot we'd love to hear.

193
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:26,979
All right, Chuck.
Pull the car around front.

194
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:29,311
What, oh, around the front?
Okay, then what do I do?

195
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,727
- Stay in the car.
- My four favorite words.

196
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:34,064
Hello.

197
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:37,022
- Chuck's not here, Morgan.
- My four favorite words.

198
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:41,236
- Get out.
- Not favorites.

199
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:42,862
But at least we're dialoguing.

200
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:45,441
He's on a date with Sarah.
I'll tell him you stopped by.

201
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:48,225
I would appreciate that.
He's supposed to be helping me now.

202
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:52,149
If I don't become a better salesman
by tomorrow night, I could get fired.

203
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:56,267
Although, I guess I could just crash here
until I land on my feet.

204
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,727
As inspired
as that makes me to help you...

205
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:01,688
...I would rather
just change the locks.

206
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:06,143
- I'll let myself out.
- Now my four favorite words.

207
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:18,354
I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you.
Aah, don't eat me. Aah!

208
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,733
Ha, ha. Well, you're dead.

209
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:22,527
Come on.

210
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:29,649
Stakeouts are kind of fun.

211
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:35,852
Floor's crowded. You see her?

212
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,776
No.

213
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:40,400
Hey, you on the list?

214
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,943
- Hands in the air. Now.
- Easy. Federal agents.

215
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,817
- Against the wall.
- Come on, you're making a big mistake.

216
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:52,186
Your boss is in danger.

217
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,231
Gun!

218
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:20,518
<i>Go to Tommy from Kodogo Park.</i>

219
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:24,356
<i>Doctor Stu, he has some questions
about his fantasies.</i>

220
00:13:28,486 --> 00:13:30,109
- They think we're with her.
- What?

221
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:34,024
They think we're with her.
No kill shots.

222
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:35,433
I hate playing nice.

223
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,103
Gunshots. Gunshots.

224
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:42,936
Listen to Sarah, stay in the car.

225
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:54,643
<i>They're cheerleaders together.</i>

226
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:56,228
Hey, the wheelchair guy.

227
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:59,062
<i>Let me just tell you right now,
that's normal.</i>

228
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:03,271
Let me help you get out of here.
- Help me. A lady is trying to kill me.

229
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:05,559
- My car, this way.
- Yeah, whatever, come on.

230
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:25,353
Here. Here you go.

231
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:27,849
Here's your guy.

232
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,853
- Why is he tied up?
- Throw him in the trunk.

233
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:32,312
The trunk?

234
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:37,017
That's not very nice.

235
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:38,935
Why would you...?

236
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,484
Whoa! Whoa!

237
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:48,517
- Where are they taking him?
- I don't know!

238
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,062
- You work for him?
- What? No, no!

239
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:51,390
Wait. Hold on a second.

240
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:54,933
I was just trying to help
an old guy in a wheelchair...

241
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:57,100
...who puts people in trunks.

242
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:02,481
You idiot. That old man is Triad.

243
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,482
Chinese mafia.

244
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:07,098
That was my brother
he threw in the trunk.

245
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:09,515
Your brother? You were trying to...

246
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:12,815
Rescue him. Until you got in the way.

247
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:14,726
Federal agent. Drop your gun.

248
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:16,400
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop!

249
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:18,478
- Chuck, are you okay?
- Yeah.

250
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,848
- Are you hurt?
- No.

251
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:21,525
What the hell just happened?

252
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:23,683
She was just trying
to rescue her brother.

253
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:25,941
I guess I was wrong.

254
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:29,065
I blew it.

255
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:41,232
- What, are we carpooling now?
- Just heard back from Washington.

256
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,106
They confirmed Mei-Ling's story.

257
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,060
Her brother Lee Cho's
a low-level bureaucrat from Beijing.

258
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:48,811
<i>He was kidnapped on a business trip
to L.A. By local Triads.</i>

259
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:50,815
The Chinese received a ransom call...

260
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:53,940
...asking for the release
of a Triad captain in Beijing.

261
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:55,352
They refused.

262
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,392
<i>Mei-Ling was here on her own.</i>

263
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,806
<i>Her government never signed off
on a rescue op.</i>

264
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:01,357
<i>What's the connection?</i>

265
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:05,186
The feds suspected that he had
Triad roots but they could never prove it.

266
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:08,143
- Okay, so what do we do now?
- Nothing. We stay out of it.

267
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:12,020
Hold on. I watched that guy get stuffed
in a trunk because I got it wrong.

268
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,556
We're not gonna start
an incident over someone...

269
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:17,897
...not even the Chi-Coms care about.
Let it go, Chuck, huh?

270
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:20,063
Sarah, I screwed up, okay?
It's my fault.

271
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:23,184
- Her brother's gonna die. It's my fault.
- No, it's her fault.

272
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:26,025
She went off the grid
and she disobeyed orders coming here.

273
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,721
But her superiors didn't even give her
a choice. Come on.

274
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:31,732
Sarah, I would have done
the same thing if it was Ellie.

275
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,566
Minus the
shooting-apart-the-club part.

276
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:36,435
I know how you feel.

277
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:38,723
It was hard for me too
when I first started.

278
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,684
But the truth
is we can't save everyone, Chuck.

279
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,347
Big Mike must not have been clear
about how a sales competition works.

280
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:06,349
The idea here, Morgan,
um, is to sell things.

281
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:08,355
I can't get fired.

282
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:12,600
How will I eat?
I'll starve on the soup line.

283
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:15,683
I hate soup.

284
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:17,350
All right? Soup is not a meal.

285
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:19,598
It's hardly an appetizer,
for God's sake.

286
00:17:19,815 --> 00:17:21,853
- Can I have your locker?
- I call his windbreaker.

287
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:24,554
- Fine, but I get his name tag.
- Fine.

288
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:25,845
Can I say something?

289
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:27,262
You guys need me, okay?

290
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,142
With me gone, someone else
is gonna be the butt of all the jokes.

291
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,645
Let me tell you something, Jeff,
you don't wanna carry that mantle.

292
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:37,763
- Maybe you do wanna carry that mantle.
- We'll take that mantle. Yes.

293
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,772
You're not gonna let me
take the bullet on this one, right?

294
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,310
- Yes.
- Absolutely. Nice knowing you.

295
00:17:50,315 --> 00:17:51,807
Nerd Herd. Bartowski speaking.

296
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:53,391
<i>MAl-LING:
I'm looking at you.</i>

297
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:56,646
Oh, yeah, you're looking at me
right now. Ha-ha-ha. Who is this?

298
00:17:56,815 --> 00:18:00,227
<i>Let's just say you owe me
for ruining my rescue operation.</i>

299
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:04,802
<i>- Mei-Ling.
- Put your hand down.</i>

300
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:07,648
<i>If you signal your friend,
it's the last thing you'll ever do.</i>

301
00:18:07,856 --> 00:18:09,562
<i>By the way, nice mustard stain.</i>

302
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:18,147
<i>- Where are you?
- Not near the sorority girls.</i>

303
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:19,807
Uh...

304
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:23,812
<i>- What do you want?
- Triads put a clock on my brother's life.</i>

305
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:26,227
<i>He dies in nine hours
if I don't do something.</i>

306
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,847
Okay, yeah, about that, about that.
Listen, I'm really, really sorry.

307
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:33,553
And if there's anything that I can do
to make up for it...

308
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:35,105
<i>Help me rescue him.</i>

309
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:37,725
I'm a dead man.
I'm last place in the sales competition.

310
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:39,348
You do not help me, I get fired.

311
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:41,389
<i>One word to him,
you're a dead man too.</i>

312
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:45,551
Not now, Morgan, please. I have a really,
really upset customer. Zip.

313
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,301
Listen to me, listen to me.
I'm a Good Samaritan.

314
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,187
I just helped the wrong guy.

315
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:52,808
I help people run computers,
not rescue operations.

316
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,599
<i>I tailed you. You have a team
watching your every step.</i>

317
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:57,928
<i>Which means you can help
and you will.</i>

318
00:18:58,105 --> 00:18:59,895
<i>I'll be in touch soon.</i>

319
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:01,686
Hello? Hello?

320
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:03,762
- Want a hot dog?
- Huh?

321
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,259
It's an emergency.

322
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,346
So I've been thinking
a lot about last night.

323
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:12,143
And you guys were talking about
how the spy could be valuable to us.

324
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:14,884
So I was thinking,
what if we could convince her to...

325
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:17,730
...I don't know, like,
give up some secret stuff or...?

326
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:21,102
- You mean defect?
- Yes. People do that thing all the time.

327
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:24,311
<i>The Hunt for Red October, uh,
White Nights.</i>

328
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,599
Gregory Hines, Baryshnikov,
dancing their way to freedom?

329
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:29,851
Well, as long as you've done
serious research.

330
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:34,556
You get her to defect,
I'll help rescue her brother personally.

331
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,268
- Why are you bringing this up?
- Well, she sort of just called me.

332
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,889
She called you?

333
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:42,384
- Where?
- At the Buy More.

334
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:45,223
I think she might've been in the store.
She knew my every move.

335
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:47,683
She even knew
that I had mustard on my tie.

336
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,477
What? Hey, where...?
Hey, wait a minute.

337
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:58,432
Hey, hey, Morgan, hey, buddy.

338
00:19:58,604 --> 00:20:01,886
Listen, I'm really sorry about last night.
I got home really late.

339
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:04,053
Don't sweat it, man.
Just my livelihood at stake.

340
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:06,096
What about tonight?
Maybe after Mother's Day?

341
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,727
Working double shift. It's my last chance
to make enough sales to not get fired.

342
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:12,685
Thanks though, pal.

343
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,426
Chuck.
- Aah! What?

344
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,802
There's a delivery
you need to sign for.

345
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:18,679
Great. Thank you, Jeff.

346
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:30,010
- Where's Chuck?
- Storage cage. Signing for a delivery.

347
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,848
- But deliveries come at 6.
- Guess they got here early, dude.

348
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:40,142
Oh, hey. I think that's for me.

349
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,601
Please tell me that's not real.
The gun, not the clipboard.

350
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,424
Real enough?

351
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,018
Listen, listen, they agreed to help
if you would just defect.

352
00:20:54,228 --> 00:20:56,136
- What?
- It's really not that bad here.

353
00:20:56,312 --> 00:20:58,386
Chinese food's good.
You tried sizzling shrimp?

354
00:20:58,603 --> 00:21:00,890
- Drop the gun, drop it.
- Oh, oh! Oh!

355
00:21:01,062 --> 00:21:02,554
- Let go.
- Shoot me, I shoot him.

356
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,007
Hey, hey, I got an idea.

357
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:06,551
How about a new plan
that involves less shooting?

358
00:21:06,728 --> 00:21:10,010
- You agreed to help if she defected.
- I would never.

359
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:13,428
Why? Loyalty to your government,
that left your brother for dead?

360
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,843
If I defect,
I can never go back to China.

361
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:18,016
I will never see my brother again.

362
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:22,306
And if you don't, you'll lose him forever.
And you don't want that.

363
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:27,218
Guys, promise Mei-Ling you'll help
rescue her brother if she defects, please.

364
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:29,350
Please?

365
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,517
Promise. Now let the kid go.

366
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:34,344
How do I know I can trust you?

367
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:36,102
You don't have any other choice.

368
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:40,675
Oh! Okay.

369
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:45,644
This is the floor plan
of Ben Lo Pan's estate.

370
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:49,307
My intel says they're holding my brother
here, near the center of the mansion.

371
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,595
Getting out's gonna be the real trick.
Lo Pan's got a private army of guards.

372
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:55,925
When those alarms go,
they're gonna be on us like...

373
00:21:56,102 --> 00:21:58,306
Thank you, Casey.

374
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,924
- Hey, what up, sis?
- Oh, good.

375
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:04,595
Did you defrost the chicken?

376
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,600
You know that I did.
And you know why?

377
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,595
Because it's Mother's Day,
and I am here for you.

378
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,257
Ha, ha. Prodigal brother returns.

379
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:14,758
- You need some help? Ha-ha-ha.
- Yes. Thanks.

380
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:17,548
So this will be fun. Just you and I.

381
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:19,682
- It's been a while.
- It's been too long.

382
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:21,842
But tonight is about
brother-sister bonding.

383
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:23,097
You know, catching up.

384
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:25,970
Catching up, by the way,
with no distractions.

385
00:22:29,893 --> 00:22:32,891
And as soon as I answer this call,
I will turn it off, I swear.

386
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,306
<i>- Hello.
- It's Casey, get over here.</i>

387
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:37,432
<i>I wanna see if you flash on anything.</i>

388
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:39,719
- What was that?
- Nothing, nothing.

389
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:42,216
It's Casey. John Casey, my co-worker.

390
00:22:42,435 --> 00:22:45,800
He needs some help
with, uh, decorating tips.

391
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:47,635
Like color swatches? I could help.

392
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:49,889
No, no, no, you don't wanna...

393
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,260
No, that's very thoughtful.
I appreciate that, but he's a guy's guy.

394
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:54,673
He wants a man's opinion.

395
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:59,390
He's a hunter, and he doesn't
quite know which deer to mount on...

396
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,839
Eww, God.

397
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:05,058
You have couple of hours before dinner.
I need to focus on the kitchen, anyway.

398
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:07,424
- You sure?
- Yeah. Oh, you know what?

399
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:11,216
Why don't you take him
some of my special guacamole?

400
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:13,467
You know, like,
as a housewarming gift.

401
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:14,721
That...

402
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,428
Wow, thank you, sis.
That's really thoughtful of you.

403
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:19,265
Keep it away from Sarah, though.

404
00:23:19,434 --> 00:23:22,598
This is definitely not good
for her spastic colon.

405
00:23:23,142 --> 00:23:25,678
Yes, got it, right. Yeah, the spastic...

406
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:27,343
Okay.

407
00:23:27,517 --> 00:23:29,757
Okay. I promise I will be back by 8.

408
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:31,889
I promise.

409
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:37,798
Hi. Hey, I brought Ellie's secret recipe.

410
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:40,340
Trying to help out any way I can.
Can't really stay.

411
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:43,515
All right, there are 10 guards
stationed at these points...

412
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:45,176
...here, here and here.

413
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:48,343
The security cameras are TKX-50's.

414
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:51,219
A little outdated,
but they're equipped for remote access.

415
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:53,880
Either of you familiar with them?

416
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,137
I am.

417
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,221
Yeah, uh, we used to sell them
at the Buy More.

418
00:23:58,392 --> 00:24:01,058
I did a bunch of installs a few
years back. Pretty easy to access.

419
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:02,925
Good. Every warm body helps.

420
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,091
Sorry, me? No, no, no.

421
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:08,383
Look, as much as I wish
that I could help you, I can't.

422
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,384
I made plans with my sister,
they are non-negotiable.

423
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:16,509
But I know you wouldn't be in this mess
if it weren't for me.

424
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:20,256
I wanna be with my sister and you
obviously wanna be with your brother.

425
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:23,591
We're like one big wacky
trans-Atlantic family. Heh.

426
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,473
I owe you. I'm in.

427
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:29,344
Okay, fine. But you don't leave the van
under any circumstances.

428
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:32,307
I just need to be home by 8
if that's at all possible.

429
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:51,381
<i>Chuck. Chuck.</i>

430
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:52,885
<i>Chuck, am I coming through?</i>

431
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,344
<i>Yep. I gotcha.</i>

432
00:25:22,557 --> 00:25:24,880
Oh, hey, we have liftoff.

433
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:33,920
- Oof! Half a Big Gulp. New record.
- Ahh.

434
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,006
I am Spartacus.

435
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:40,880
- Hey, guys. Uh, kind of need your help.
Oh.

436
00:25:41,098 --> 00:25:45,044
Last in the sales competition,
Chuck not here to bail you out this time?

437
00:25:45,223 --> 00:25:46,420
Why else would I be here?

438
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,677
You know, by helping you out,
aren't we...?

439
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,839
Aren't we messing
with the laws of nature?

440
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:54,795
I mean, the weak die
and the strong prevail.

441
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:57,301
- Who are we to play God?
- Mm-hm.

442
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,221
Yeah. Um...

443
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,594
...I'll give you half my pizza
if I get second place.

444
00:26:02,223 --> 00:26:03,420
The wounded raccoon.

445
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,507
Don't know what that is,
but whatever works.

446
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:09,679
Whatever... Let's do it.

447
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:17,926
That's a great product, huh? It's
two gigs of memory, extended warranty.

448
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:19,555
Yeah, it's a little pricey.

449
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:21,589
But you know what? I'll take it.

450
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:23,631
It's a gift for my sick nephew.

451
00:26:23,806 --> 00:26:26,757
Oh. Sick nephew, huh?

452
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,175
Um...

453
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:32,424
Tell you what. Don't tell anybody,
but it's on sale at Large Mart.

454
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:34,049
Save yourself 50 bucks.

455
00:26:34,764 --> 00:26:38,260
You'd give up a sale
just to save me $50? That's so sweet.

456
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,214
- Ah, just...
- You know what? Here.

457
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:42,919
Call me sometime, for coffee.

458
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:47,547
Wow. I will. Coffee is... Sounds great.

459
00:26:47,722 --> 00:26:49,429
Look at the little man.

460
00:26:49,597 --> 00:26:51,220
So weak. So pathetic.

461
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:54,970
And you wonder why you're last in sales
and about to get fired.

462
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:57,847
Maybe if you spent your time
selling merchandise...

463
00:26:58,014 --> 00:27:01,214
...instead of trolling for phone numbers,
you wouldn't be flat broke...

464
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:04,173
...and living with your mother,
and be forced to pick leftovers...

465
00:27:04,347 --> 00:27:06,384
...out of the garbage
so that you can eat.

466
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:12,336
- Can I have my number back, please?
- Thing... Well...

467
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:14,297
Let me just...

468
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,843
- Are you kidding me, what was that?
Ahem.

469
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,133
The wounded raccoon.

470
00:27:22,305 --> 00:27:25,303
You humiliate the salesman
in front of the customer, like so...

471
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:27,213
...which I thought we did very well.

472
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,504
The customer feels so bad,
they'll buy anything.

473
00:27:29,722 --> 00:27:31,096
It's the "pity sale. "

474
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:33,550
Always wondered if it worked.

475
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:36,755
- Guess not.
- No, it does not, it does not. Wow.

476
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,506
Shall we?

477
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:43,339
<i>Listen,
the guards are looking at a static loop.</i>

478
00:27:43,555 --> 00:27:46,506
<i>You're our eyes, Chuck. If you see
trouble coming, you let us know.</i>

479
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,298
Got it, let's just
make this quick. 7: 15 is my curfew.

480
00:27:49,513 --> 00:27:52,215
<i>Okay, we're going inside.
Chuck, what do you see?</i>

481
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:54,793
Uh, let's see...

482
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:58,799
Okay, I've got one guard
by himself at the security monitors.

483
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,505
<i>Thank you.
- Oh.</i>

484
00:28:02,804 --> 00:28:04,380
Aah! Oh! Oh! Ow.

485
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:07,552
Good... Good work,
but let's not get cocky, huh, team?

486
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:09,628
<i>Shut up, Chuck. What's next?</i>

487
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:12,340
Right, right. Looking...

488
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:14,925
Looking, looking...

489
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:19,469
Okay, okay.
I've got three guards in the kitchen area.

490
00:28:19,637 --> 00:28:20,964
<i>We see them.
- Be careful.</i>

491
00:28:21,137 --> 00:28:23,377
They're bigger than the first guy.

492
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,962
Whoa, ahh.

493
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:30,635
Hiyah!

494
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:33,007
All right. Kicking butt.

495
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,177
<i>"Don't get cocky"?
- My bad. Professional faux pas.</i>

496
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:48,671
Wait. Hey, hey, what happened?
I lost all visual on the security cameras.

497
00:28:48,845 --> 00:28:51,250
Guys? Guys?

498
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,468
<i>All I can see is what Casey's
lipstick camera is picking up.</i>

499
00:28:54,637 --> 00:28:58,382
Put down the book, Ironside.
Hands up.

500
00:29:03,928 --> 00:29:06,251
Guys, if you're seeing this,
you might wanna run.

501
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,677
You think?

502
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:11,380
Perfect timing, Mei-Ling.

503
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,215
<i>Your government has just refused
my final offer for your brother.</i>

504
00:29:20,386 --> 00:29:22,875
Hopefully,
they will change their minds...

505
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,844
...now that I have two American agents
to barter with.

506
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:29,967
Oh. Sarah?

507
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:32,043
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no.

508
00:29:51,678 --> 00:29:53,336
Chuck, don't talk.

509
00:29:53,552 --> 00:29:54,796
<i>I can't hear you, go home.</i>

510
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:58,258
Repeat. Go home, do not call
the cops, don't do anything. Go home.

511
00:29:58,427 --> 00:29:59,801
Casey?

512
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:03,044
Casey?

513
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:10,582
They're taking them
to the Bamboo Dragon.

514
00:30:12,094 --> 00:30:15,045
Okay, okay. All right.

515
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,630
What are the rules for tailing?
Tail rules.

516
00:30:17,802 --> 00:30:20,670
Thirty, 30 yards. Or was it 30 feet?

517
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:23,546
I should've taken notes.
Oh, God.

518
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:59,249
Ellie's gonna kill me. Sorry.

519
00:31:00,343 --> 00:31:02,215
- Yo, yo, yo. Come here.
- Ah, no, thanks.

520
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:05,750
- Check it out. Just look at this.
- All right, what do you got?

521
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,089
Hey, Chuck, it's Ellie.

522
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:14,127
Well, you've officially missed
Mother's Day.

523
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,968
Which is a first, I might add.

524
00:31:17,134 --> 00:31:19,919
I don't know what happened
to you tonight.

525
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:23,340
Or in general.

526
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:27,040
You know, the least that
you could have done was call, but...

527
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:31,377
Anyway, um, forget it. Bye.

528
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:34,754
Let me guess,
Chuck's not here, right?

529
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,584
That is becoming
common around here.

530
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,086
Yeah. Tell me about it.

531
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:40,878
I can't believe
Chuck missed Mother's Day.

532
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:43,420
You know, all I wanted was for him
to meet a great girl...

533
00:31:43,592 --> 00:31:46,163
...and he finally did,
and now I never see him.

534
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:50,383
You know, maybe we should sit Chuck
down, force him to break up with Sarah.

535
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:53,259
Dump her completely.
Who needs her? Ha, ha.

536
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:55,837
Kidding. Kidding, kind of.

537
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,539
It's not that I'm not happy for him.
I just miss him.

538
00:31:58,717 --> 00:31:59,996
No, I get it.

539
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:01,965
Chuck's been through
some tough times.

540
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:04,669
Kicked out of Stanford
and then Jill breaking up with him.

541
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:07,674
You know.
You got him through all that.

542
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:12,131
And no one knows
that better than he does, believe me.

543
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:18,460
How are things at work?

544
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:21,342
Oh, awful.
Thank you for asking, yeah.

545
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:25,336
There's this, uh, sales competition,
and I'm pretty much last.

546
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:29,625
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Same thing I always do.

547
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,502
- Get fired.
- Are you sure that you wanna do that?

548
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,629
Truth is, Chuck and I always complain
how boring the Buy More is.

549
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,461
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go to Big Mike,
do the only honorable thing left to do.

550
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:41,788
What's that?

551
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:45,338
Well, what any respectable warrior
like Bruce Lee would do.

552
00:32:45,508 --> 00:32:47,664
Fall on my sword.

553
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,547
Hari-kari.

554
00:32:50,508 --> 00:32:53,708
- Fire myself.
- You mean resign?

555
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:55,998
Yeah, okay.
That sounds better, I guess.

556
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:07,829
Oh, God.
Please let me keep my fingers.

557
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:11,171
Come on, come on. Oh, God.

558
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:14,920
Okay, okay, okay.

559
00:33:15,716 --> 00:33:16,829
Okay.

560
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:20,041
Ah! Oh. Okay, okay.

561
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:38,829
- Aah!
- Shh!

562
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:40,583
You can yell at me later.

563
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:52,713
This is the part where we hide.

564
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:06,708
Ahh.

565
00:34:12,798 --> 00:34:14,339
Ben Lo Pan's getting away.

566
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,459
Wait here, huh? Wait here.

567
00:34:23,256 --> 00:34:24,583
Uh-uh.

568
00:34:27,006 --> 00:34:30,621
Forget it, Ben, it's Chinatown.
You ever see that movie?

569
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,005
Ellie. Ellie, I'm so, so, so sorry.

570
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:57,380
What happened, Chuck?
Were you kidnapped or something?

571
00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:01,369
Me? Heh. No, no, no.

572
00:35:01,547 --> 00:35:03,870
- I, uh... I went over to Casey's...
- Ha, ha.

573
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:07,958
I went to Casey's, Chuck.
No one was there.

574
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,413
- Oh.
- When did we start keeping secrets?

575
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,664
You know what? Look,
If you'll just let me explain...

576
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,836
There's no need. I figured it out.

577
00:35:17,797 --> 00:35:19,587
I know.

578
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:21,914
You do?

579
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:25,703
You haven't had a girlfriend
for a long time, and you're in love.

580
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:29,705
Yeah.

581
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:32,625
- I am?
- But lying to me?

582
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:36,702
Missing our most important day,
like you're in high school.

583
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,001
Do you even know that
Morgan's about to be fired?

584
00:35:39,213 --> 00:35:41,500
Ellie, I can't apologize enough. I...

585
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,709
Everything that you're saying is right.

586
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,541
I guess that I'm just so, um...
I'm so head over heels...

587
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:49,751
...that I'm not thinking straight,
you know?

588
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:53,411
I know that this is the first big thing
to happen to you in a while.

589
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,711
And you feel like your life
isn't going anywhere.

590
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,254
And your job's not either...

591
00:35:58,463 --> 00:36:01,580
...and you're not Superman out there,
saving the day.

592
00:36:01,755 --> 00:36:04,077
But you're a good person, Chuck.

593
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:07,081
You're a good brother
and you're a good friend.

594
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:11,374
Don't lose that.

595
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:17,917
Do you think maybe that we could,
uh, reschedule Mother's Day?

596
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:19,545
For, like, tomorrow?

597
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:22,041
I know that that
is ridiculously unorthodox.

598
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,045
I get that, and I know it's my fault
that we even have to do it...

599
00:36:25,213 --> 00:36:30,498
...but, uh, I mean, it is our holiday.

600
00:36:31,254 --> 00:36:34,335
So I think
we could make up our own rules.

601
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:38,208
If I say yes, you'll be there?

602
00:36:38,421 --> 00:36:40,079
I promise.

603
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:43,375
You know, if there's anything
going on with you.

604
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:45,951
Life, girl, job...

605
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,877
...you can come to me.

606
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:02,249
<i>Yep.</i>

607
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,410
- What's that?
- My letter of resignation.

608
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:26,033
- You get another job?
- No.

609
00:37:26,586 --> 00:37:29,253
Didn't think anyone else
was stupid enough to hire you.

610
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,375
- So, what's up?
- I'm last in the competition.

611
00:37:31,545 --> 00:37:35,704
Yeah, I know it's a shock that I'm last,
but here we are.

612
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,748
I now fall on my sword.
Head high, dignity intact.

613
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,993
- It's the Shaolin way.
- Hey, Morgan.

614
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,456
There's a whale online
demanding to see you.

615
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:46,453
A fish is calling?

616
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:48,702
No, you bearded buffoon.
A big spender.

617
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:51,627
She wants to see you at checkout.

618
00:37:56,836 --> 00:37:58,626
- Ellie?
- Hey.

619
00:37:58,794 --> 00:38:01,247
I know what I'm getting
Chuck and Devon for their birthdays.

620
00:38:01,419 --> 00:38:03,244
So I figured
I'd do some shopping early.

621
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:07,492
That'll be $ 733.42, ma'am.

622
00:38:07,669 --> 00:38:09,956
- Did anyone help you?
- He did.

623
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:13,494
I love you.

624
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,285
Uh, uh.

625
00:38:19,461 --> 00:38:21,783
Big man. Not quitting, no.

626
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:24,283
Good. You're my only Hispanic
on the sales team.

627
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,163
You quit, the affirmative action goons
will be all over my ass.

628
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:31,874
Okay. Well, listen, I sold
over $ 700 worth of stereo equipment.

629
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:33,371
Puts me in second place.

630
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,625
Means somebody owes me a pizza
with two toppings.

631
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:39,199
- Pizza's for me, partner.
- Do I get an iPhone?

632
00:38:39,419 --> 00:38:42,251
I don't even get a free iPhone.
You think I'd give you jerks one?

633
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:44,041
- No prizes?
- And no one's getting fired.

634
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,746
The competition
was to get you bums to work harder.

635
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:49,916
- Looks like it worked.
- Yeah, but, I...

636
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:07,697
Look, I'm sorry, guys.
I know that you wanted me to go home.

637
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:09,452
But I just couldn't, you know?

638
00:39:09,668 --> 00:39:12,073
We just turned
one of China's top spies.

639
00:39:12,293 --> 00:39:15,824
And you helped save her brother.
So good work, Chuck.

640
00:39:18,293 --> 00:39:20,367
Well, I... I better be going.

641
00:39:20,585 --> 00:39:23,417
I've got my own family reunion
to attend.

642
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:30,786
Thank you, Chuck.

643
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:37,082
Oh, yeah, hey, don't mention it.
You're welcome. Ha.

644
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:41,031
Uh, but before you go,
would you mind, uh, signing this?

645
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:45,120
- What is it?
- Says I was off-site fixing your computer.

646
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:49,500
And that you were satisfied with
the level of customer service I provided.

647
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:57,619
- Hey, Chuck.
- Morgan? Morgan, what are you d...?

648
00:39:57,792 --> 00:40:00,281
Buddy, I know that I haven't been
around lately and...

649
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:03,457
Or really been the best of friend,
but, uh, Ellie and I have this...

650
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:08,199
- Mother's Day, man. I know, I get it.
- It's okay, it's okay.

651
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:10,123
- I invited him.
Huh?

652
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:11,453
Yeah, yeah.

653
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:15,666
Told you he's gonna come walking
through that door. He's such a good kid.

654
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:19,080
- Let me get some glasses.
- What, uh...?

655
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,329
We bonded over
an "I miss Chuck" moment.

656
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:23,616
- Did you? Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

657
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:26,115
- Where's Awesome?
- He couldn't get off work.

658
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:28,828
But that must be Sarah.

659
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:30,321
What? You invited her too?

660
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,115
Well, I mean, she's your new best gal.
How could I not?

661
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:36,578
Ellie, you know
you'll always be my best gal.

662
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:38,948
Don't take this the wrong way,
Chuck, but I hope not.

663
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,999
Yeah, Morgan and now Sarah.
It used to be just the two of us.

664
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,582
Well, we're growing up.

665
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:47,365
- Hey.
- Ellie invited me.

666
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:50,326
She, uh, insisted that I come.

667
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,581
So, uh, Mother's Day...

668
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,456
Yes, Mother's Day, that's right.

669
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,574
You don't really know.

670
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:05,452
Mother's Day is the anniversary
of the day our mom left us.

671
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:08,618
Our dad was here,
but he was never really here.

672
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,578
So now every year,
we celebrate the day...

673
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:14,119
...we learned
how to take care of ourselves.

674
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,698
And rely on each other.

675
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:21,617
Mm. Oh.

676
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:24,908
I think, um...

677
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:28,033
I think we're gonna need
some more champagne.

678
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:34,534
I heard you came in second place,
thanks to Ellie.

679
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:37,077
Chuck, I've been slow
playing her for years, you know?

680
00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:39,286
And just sort of waiting
in second position...

681
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:42,325
...until she pretty much
couldn't resist me anymore.

682
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,412
- Is that right?
- Yeah, yeah.

683
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:46,620
I would like your blessing
before I marry her.

684
00:41:46,832 --> 00:41:49,865
Oh, well, you know,
whatever Ellie wants...

685
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,114
I know. But are you ready
to be my brother-in-law?

686
00:41:52,332 --> 00:41:54,323
Have a few Morgan Bartowskis
running around?

687
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,289
Or Ellie Barettas.

688
00:41:57,457 --> 00:42:01,782
I'd change my name to Baretta for her.
She deserves a last name that cool.

689
00:42:01,998 --> 00:42:05,446
Like Ellie MacGyver, or
Ellie Headroom, Ellie Rambo.

690
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,448
- She's behind me right now, isn't she?
- Mm-hm.

691
00:42:08,082 --> 00:42:09,907
- Heard everything?
- Pretty much, yeah.

692
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:13,406
Okay. I guess I'm going home.

693
00:42:17,373 --> 00:42:18,535
I can't believe it.

694
00:42:18,707 --> 00:42:22,154
For 12 whole hours, my best friend
and my sister actually got along.

695
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,079
A Mother's Day miracle.

696
00:42:24,534 --> 00:42:25,575
Happy Mother's Day.
