1
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:15,882
What the...?

2
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,173
Where do you think you're going?

3
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:28,971
I mean,
you just don't think I can let you...

4
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,735
Excuse me?

5
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:06,634
Is there a trick to getting
some help around here?

6
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:08,832
Other then being charming
and beautiful, no, ma'am.

7
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:12,727
I need to know which of these to buy--
the 3000-Z or the 3000-ZX.

8
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,627
Excellent question.

9
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:16,126
Uh, you need to talk to one
of our green shirts about that.

10
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:17,224
I can actually call one to assist you.

11
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:18,124
I'm not a salesman.

12
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:19,322
I'm actually part of the nerd herd.

13
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:21,320
You must be so proud of yourself.

14
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:23,418
I wouldn't go so far as to say proud.

15
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:30,010
So sorry.

16
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:32,609
One minute.

17
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,606
I'll be right back.

18
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:48,394
Mystery crisper.

19
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:49,492
Guys, sorry, sorry to break up...

20
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:50,991
You want in?
It's gonna cost you five bucks.

21
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:52,490
What's going on?

22
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:54,087
Final round. Mystery crisper.

23
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,686
Mystery crisper!
Mystery crisper!

24
00:01:56,477 --> 00:02:00,782
The great crisper,
where employee food goes to die.

25
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:01,581
Pull the shield down.

26
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:04,578
Guys, there's going to be a riot on
the sales floor if you don't get back to work.

27
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,577
Chuck, shut up.

28
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,274
There it is.

29
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,174
Come to daddy.

30
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,071
He's got it?

31
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:14,370
He's the man, the man.

32
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:22,161
He wants his weapon.

33
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:35,748
Morgan is so awesome.
He can eat anything.

34
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:43,541
Bartowski.

35
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:44,641
Yeah!
Yes!

36
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,338
I need to see you in my office.

37
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,036
I-I was just on my way.

38
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:53,532
Daddy mad, Chuck.
Daddy mad.

39
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:55,830
Might as well kiss
that promotion good-bye.

40
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:00,924
- Get in here, Bartowski.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:04,022
Tell me...

42
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,018
What's the best part of
being buy more brass?

43
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,618
The power?

44
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:10,215
The money?

45
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:11,314
The ladies?

46
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:12,213
The medical.

47
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:15,110
I couldn't give a rodent's behind
about this job.

48
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,109
But this...

49
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:18,407
My body is my temple.

50
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,305
And I must treat it as such.

51
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,403
Is that...
Is that all, sir?

52
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:24,802
'Cause I-I really should, uh,
get back to work.

53
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:26,900
- No, that is not all.Sit down.
- Okay.

54
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:33,693
There's a guy coming in here
from corporate to interview you

55
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:36,091
and Tang for the assistant manager spot.

56
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:39,688
Now Tang's has the charm of a prostate exam.

57
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:41,686
For some reason, people seem to like you.

58
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:44,581
If the HR guy likes you, the job is yours.

59
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:45,781
So is the medical.

60
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:47,180
Don't screw up.

61
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:48,779
I'll, uh, I'll do my best.

62
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,777
Make sure Morgan does his best, too.

63
00:03:50,768 --> 00:03:53,573
That kid is gonna be the anchor
around your neck, Bartowski.

64
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:04,663
What, we don't have
enough actual cobwebs already?

65
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:07,061
I'm getting ready for
our annual Halloween party.

66
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:09,158
What time are you getting here?

67
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,157
Oh, you know what, I might be late.

68
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:15,453
They finally scheduled that
promotional-interview thing for that afternoon.

69
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:17,750
We can just make it an
assistant manager party, too, then.

70
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,748
Sure, yeah,
if you feel like jinxing it.

71
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:22,845
You're just finally growing up,
aren't you?

72
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,941
Do you think that this year
would be a good time for you

73
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,641
and Morgan to have separate costumes?

74
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:30,638
Excuse me,
but what's wrong with our costume?

75
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,035
Um, I'm sorry, but the whole
two-man-sea-cucumber-thing is kind of creepy.

76
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:38,032
First of all, it's a sandworm, okay?

77
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,530
Shai-Hulud, to be specific.

78
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:43,127
And second of all, dune fans have been going
nuts over our costume since the eighth grade.

79
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:44,126
Yo.

80
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:45,325
Chuckster.

81
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:47,523
Guess what I am?

82
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,220
You're...

83
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,219
Naked?

84
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,119
I'm Adam.

85
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,217
You know, like Adam and Eve, Adam.

86
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:54,416
Wait till you see my snake.

87
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:56,314
I don't want to see your snake.

88
00:04:56,506 --> 00:05:00,210
Devon, Chuck here has
an interview on Wednesday.

89
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,407
That is outstanding.

90
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:06,903
I gotta...
Excuse me.

91
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:08,901
Hello?
Hello?

92
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm getting tense!

93
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,599
You know I don't like being tense.

94
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,897
How can I help you relax, big Mike?

95
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,296
Find that jackass Morgan.

96
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:17,494
Your buddy's supposed to be working
a double shift today and went AWOL.

97
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:25,885
Hey, hey, buddy, Morgan.

98
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:26,984
- Where you been? What's up, buddy?
- Yes.

99
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:29,181
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you.

100
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:31,579
I, uh, I picked up the sandworm costume
from the dry cleaners.

101
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,577
The ranch dressing from last year
totally came out, so we're all good.

102
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,074
You ready to win another
buy more costume contest?

103
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:40,870
No.No, no, 'cause you're
supposed to be at work, buddy.

104
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:43,968
Dude, I got ten big ones riding
on this quote-unquote video game,

105
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,265
so can I just have, uh...

106
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,465
This guy's been handing me my ass all week.

107
00:05:48,455 --> 00:05:50,261
Time to return the favor.

108
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,956
It's over. Your reign is over.

109
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:08,344
- Uh, Morgan.
- Yeah, buddy?

110
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,142
Morgan, this guy is dangerous.

111
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:13,740
Well, Morgan's dangerous, Chucky.
Morgan's dangerous.

112
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:19,833
Oh, what a baby.

113
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:21,732
What a loser.

114
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:24,729
How did you find me?
How did you find me?

115
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,827
Who else knows I'm here?

116
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,726
Who do you work for?

117
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:27,726
No one.No one.
Let me go.

118
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,524
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.

119
00:06:29,316 --> 00:06:30,624
I know you're a spy!

120
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:31,822
Your watch?

121
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:33,021
I designed that watch for the CIA.

122
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:39,215
Are there other agents waiting for me outside?

123
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:41,114
Are there other agents waiting for me outside?

124
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,711
You're not sneaking away from me.

125
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:45,109
Wait, whoa, whoa.

126
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,908
You still owe me ten bucks!

127
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,004
Morgan!
Morgan!

128
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:54,001
Whoa, hey, you still owe me ten dollars!

129
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:31,797
Hey.

130
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:33,795
Um, is Sarah here?

131
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,094
She's waiting in your room.

132
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:36,093
Is everything okay?

133
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:37,591
Said she had a surprise for you.

134
00:07:37,383 --> 00:07:39,189
Get in there, slugger.

135
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:41,188
Hey.

136
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:44,884
Who is this Laszlo character?
He just ID'd me as an agent.

137
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:47,281
Relax. We're looking into him.
And you did the right thing.

138
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:48,480
I... I didn't do anything.

139
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:49,679
I just flashed on the guy.

140
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:52,877
You followed protocol, and I'm going to
check in with you first thing in the morning.

141
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,775
Wait, wait.Wait, wait,
hold on, hold on. Wait, um...

142
00:07:55,864 --> 00:08:00,569
Look, if it's cool with you,
could you hang out for a little while?

143
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,765
Look, awesome and Ellie think that I'm...

144
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:07,462
Kind of getting lucky in here,
and I wouldn't want to disappoint...

145
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:09,361
Them.

146
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:17,353
Uh, how long do you want me to stay?

147
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:19,351
42 minutes and 15 seconds?

148
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:21,949
Arcade fire's first album.

149
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,746
It's like an auditory aphrodisiac.

150
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:27,742
You're not really ready for it yet.

151
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:30,940
Here we go.

152
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,139
And...

153
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:47,724
Why were you waiting for me
in my room, anyway?

154
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:50,620
Well, I wanted to surprise you.

155
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,916
Uh, it's, uh, it's us at comic-con.

156
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:57,514
What do you think?

157
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:00,212
It's...
It's great.

158
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:04,708
But we've never actually
been to Comic-Con, have we?

159
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:07,704
Wow, we...

160
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:10,202
We actually look like a real couple.

161
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:12,201
Well, we are a real couple.

162
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:15,896
We're just a different sort of a couple.

163
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:20,294
That we are.

164
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:30,583
You!

165
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,978
What do I have to do to get timely
intel out of you, Bartowski?

166
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,477
Look, I briefed Sarah last night, all right?

167
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:38,376
Oh, I bet you did, slugger.

168
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:42,771
I thought we were all supposed to be
part of the same team here, huh-- team Chuck.

169
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:44,370
We are, but I'm starting to feel like the guy

170
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:46,866
who always gets picked last,
and I do not like feeling like

171
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:48,565
Team Chuck's little fat kid.

172
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:51,962
Okay, you know what, the next time I have a flash,
I'll come straight to you, all right, Casey?

173
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:53,760
What did you tell Laszlo?

174
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,561
Nothing.

175
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,656
He asked me where I got my watch,
and I told him my girlfriend gave it to me, okay?

176
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:01,253
So you compromised yourself and agent Walker?

177
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:03,050
Bang up job, Chuck.

178
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:09,046
And so now you and your son
are ready to video-chat.

179
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:11,143
Thank you, young man.

180
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:14,640
You've been-- great heavens!

181
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,932
This is a whale-tail.

182
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:26,730
Notice this illusive creature,
seen here frolicking in her natural habitat--

183
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:29,027
- any sudden movement would-
- Give me, give me this.

184
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:30,026
Come on, come on.

185
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:31,324
Get, shoo, shoo, shoo.

186
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:33,023
Have fun, go find the video games.

187
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:34,722
What was that about, man?

188
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:36,319
Come on,
I was this close to closing a sale.

189
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:37,517
No.You know what you are, Morgan?

190
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:40,216
You are this close to getting
fired for sexual harassment.

191
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,212
What happened, Chuck?
You used to be cool.

192
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:44,112
I-I used to be cool?

193
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:46,010
When was that?
When we were 13?

194
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:48,008
Well, I'm sorry to go changing on you, buddy.

195
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,404
But if you hadn't noticed,
we are now chronologically-speaking, adults.

196
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:53,703
So, unless you wanna work retail
for the rest of your life,

197
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:56,300
and by the way, drag me down
with you in the process,

198
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:58,298
I would suggest that you grow up.

199
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:10,287
"Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

200
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:14,283
"Couldn't help but notice the way
you handled that, uh, Morgan situation.

201
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:17,480
That was most impressive, Chuck.

202
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:18,778
That's great, that's great.

203
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,177
You gave me goose bumps.

204
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:20,978
Super, Jeff.

205
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:41,357
The intersect was correct to alert us.

206
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:43,055
We've been looking for Laszlo Mahnovski

207
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:46,253
since he escaped from Los Robles
national labs last month.

208
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:47,252
Who is he?

209
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:49,549
Weapons designer.
Government brain.

210
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,147
The target graduated college age 14.

211
00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:54,445
Ph.D. at 17.

212
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:58,441
Been with us ever since, working for
a clandestine engineering subcontractor.

213
00:11:58,232 --> 00:12:01,538
Laszlo's not the kind of asset
we can afford to lose to our enemies.

214
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:03,137
Grade-A egghead.
Got it.

215
00:12:03,228 --> 00:12:04,535
What do you want me to do with him?

216
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:06,633
Bring him in.
And take caution.

217
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,132
What, is he gonna hurt me with his mind?

218
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:10,430
Well, here's what he did to his handlers.

219
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,415
Nice try, buddy, but, uh,
Halloween's tomorrow, okay?

220
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:27,713
Or today, or today.

221
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:29,611
It could be today if you want it to be today.

222
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,709
I didn't kill anybody.

223
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,008
Look, I-I never said you did.

224
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,307
Then why am I on the FBI list?

225
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:35,306
I don't know.
Just calm down.

226
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:36,504
I was framed, okay.

227
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:38,602
You have to believe me.
I am not a murderer.

228
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:41,100
Okay, okay.
I believe you.

229
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,300
But, FYI...

230
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,796
You're kinda acting like a murderer.

231
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,928
You told the undercover agent about me,
didn't you?

232
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,826
He's talking to Pentagon operations
right now.

233
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:55,024
I tapped into the encrypted video feed
at the store.

234
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,621
I helped design that home theater system.

235
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:58,420
Look, I-I-I don't know-- gun!

236
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,317
Get it.Get it.
Get it.

237
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:03,814
I got it, I got it.
I got it.

238
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,607
Is that a water gun?

239
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,206
No.

240
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:15,604
I'm pretty sure it's dripping on my face.

241
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,397
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:26,094
Name's Laszlo.

243
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:28,491
And I need help.

244
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:30,390
What the hell am I supposed to do?

245
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:31,389
You're on the inside.

246
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,587
You have access.

247
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,783
Look, unless you help me clear my name,
they're gonna keep chasing me.

248
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:37,082
You're my only hope.

249
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:38,981
But first...

250
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,076
I could really use some pancakes.

251
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:55,765
Hey, where's Chuck?

252
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:58,263
Shouldn't you guys be practicing your snake dance?

253
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,360
It's a sandworm, and...

254
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:06,655
Chuck's not here, 'cause he's probably off doing
something really mature like seeing an opera.

255
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,553
Or reading.

256
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:10,551
Come on, babe, let's help the little guy out.

257
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:12,548
What else did you make for the CIA?

258
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:14,047
Whatever the jobs called for actually.

259
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,445
I mean, if an agent wanted
thermal-vision ray bans

260
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:19,742
I'm the Guy they call.

261
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:22,139
You're like a real-life Q?

262
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,838
You know.

263
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:28,134
You know Q.

264
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:30,732
The guy who used to make
all the gadgets for Bond, Q?

265
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:32,630
Bond was that spy-guy, right?

266
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:34,928
What, have they been
keeping you in a frigging' cave?

267
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,625
Underground lab actually.

268
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:42,520
For the last 10 years,
all I did was work in that lab pretty much.

269
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:43,919
Well, that and play video games.

270
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,817
But, uh...

271
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:46,916
No friends, no family.

272
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:50,812
No bond.

273
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:53,908
No wonder you blew up all your
research and busted out there.

274
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,207
That's just inhumane.

275
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,807
So what kind of work do you do?

276
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:59,804
You know, it's kinda, it's kinda,
uh, complicated.

277
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:01,201
Right, but you gotta be
some kind of a genius.

278
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,001
Or prodigy?

279
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,798
I mean feds don't bother
recruiting somebody,

280
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:09,794
guarding them with undercover agents,
unless you're super-good at something?

281
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,593
What are you super-good at?

282
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:15,689
Let's just say I'm a computer-guy.

283
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:19,484
Ellie, let me ask you a question.

284
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:22,482
Am I the kind of person you'd categorize as...

285
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:24,081
Immature?

286
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,476
- Do you really want me to answer that?
- Yes.

287
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:30,075
Be straight with me.
Fire away both barrels.

288
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:33,271
Would you mind stepping in the kitchen
for a moment, Morgan?

289
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,569
I'll handle this one, honey.

290
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:44,161
Ellie's room.

291
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:54,851
There comes a time in every man's life
when he reaches, well, a crossroads.

292
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:57,348
A time when he must ask himself...

293
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,347
Am I a tucker?

294
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:01,743
Talking about your shirt, Morgan.

295
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,543
I wasn't always a tucker, you know.

296
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:06,140
Then one day, it just happened.

297
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,738
How do you, how do you know it's time?

298
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,537
You just feel it.
Go ahead.x

299
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:11,035
Tuck her in.
See how she feels.

300
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:11,835
I don't know.

301
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:15,530
No, I'm, I'm just kinda happy
with how my shirts hang there.

302
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:16,330
Come on.

303
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,529
You're safe in here.

304
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,128
Tuck her in.

305
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,826
- I don't if I'm, I-
- do it. Mm-hmm.

306
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:30,815
I don't know, I-I kinda feel like my,
my junk's out there for the whole world to see.

307
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:32,913
Maybe that's the point, Morgan.

308
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:34,813
Maybe that's the point.

309
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:39,208
If there's one thing to being a man,
it's always speaking your mind.

310
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,307
Whatever the cost.

311
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:42,405
Always be direct, open and honest.

312
00:16:42,196 --> 00:16:45,401
When I was 12, I hid under Ellie's bed,
so I could watch her undress.

313
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:46,700
Excellent.

314
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:48,499
What are you looking at?

315
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,299
Your hair.

316
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,197
It's time to tame the mane, buddy.

317
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:53,295
Let's talk product.

318
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:56,392
- I gotta finish the job.
- I'm sorry.

319
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,089
Hey, who's that handsome guy
in the mirror?

320
00:16:58,682 --> 00:16:59,889
This is great.

321
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,284
I mean just being able to
sit in a coffee shop and talk.

322
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:05,683
Just talk.

323
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,281
With somebody who knows what
it's like working for the company.

324
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:11,876
You know, if I had to do it over again,
I never would have gone to that pier.

325
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:13,276
What pier?

326
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,673
I was 11...

327
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:17,172
And...

328
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:21,867
Some agent saw me playing Tetris at an arcade.

329
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:24,065
So he asked me if I can take all these tests.

330
00:17:23,857 --> 00:17:26,663
The next thing I know,
he's offering to pay my way through school.

331
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:28,961
My parents, like,
they didn't know what to do with a kid

332
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:30,459
whose IQ is higher than both theirs combined.

333
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,157
So they signed me over.

334
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:36,653
And that's when I became property of
the united states government.

335
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:40,451
Sweet story, huh?

336
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:44,245
I'm a little, I'm a little strapped.

337
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:47,543
You know how government work pays.

338
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:48,443
Dude, yeah.

339
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,940
No, no, no, no,
don't even worry about it.

340
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:52,538
Here.
Here's an IOU.

341
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:54,836
Thanks.

342
00:17:58,123 --> 00:18:00,630
Chuck, listen you can't tell
your handlers you ever saw me.

343
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:02,029
What? Why?

344
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:04,427
They can help you, Laszlo.
They're the good guys.

345
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,224
There's no such thing in this business.

346
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:07,624
I mean, you don't believe me?

347
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:09,122
Go home and search your room.

348
00:18:08,914 --> 00:18:12,319
See what kind of bugs
your good guy handlers planted on you.

349
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,813
From now on, you should trust your handlers
precisely as much as they trust you.

350
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:22,052
What the hell are these?

351
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,349
Seems you already know, Chuck.

352
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,346
I can't believe you've been prying
into my most intimate moments...

353
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:29,844
You know what?

354
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:33,341
I swear to god, if I find out you've been
spying on my sister, I will kill you, Casey.

355
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:34,440
Intimate moments?

356
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:37,038
Not really an issue thus far.

357
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:41,335
At least, not in the sense of
traditional two-person intimacy.

358
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:42,034
He-he-he.

359
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:43,930
Do you have any idea
how violated I feel right now?

360
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:44,929
You feel violated?

361
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:47,128
No, no, no, my ears feel violated.

362
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,524
'Cause they have to listen to you and
that moron Morgan yammering on for four hours

363
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,521
about what sandwich You're gonna take
if you were stranded on a deserted island.

364
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:55,420
What are you nuts?

365
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:57,319
Nobody was talking about
sandwiches for four hours.

366
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,118
Come on.

367
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:01,514
Think about it-- this is a desert island, Morgan.

368
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:03,712
Mayonnaise simply doesn't fare well in the tropics--

369
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:05,510
Oh, yeah, but define sandwich.

370
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:07,907
'Cause technically you can put anything
between two slices of bread.

371
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:09,806
For instance, could I bring...

372
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:12,104
a Jessica Alba sandwich to said desert island?

373
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:13,304
I-I suppose.

374
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:16,700
Well, I'll have you know,
I stand by my mayonnaise theory.

375
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:19,597
And you're still a giant douche
for spying on me like that.

376
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:23,192
Well, if it's any comfort, Chuck,
we planted those bugs to protect you.

377
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,691
How did you find the surveillance, anyway?

378
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:27,889
Oh, a little birdie named Laszlo told me.
What?

379
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:29,887
You contacted Laszlo and didn't tell me?

380
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,085
I'm sorry, Casey.

381
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:33,284
Did I violate your trust?

382
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:47,069
Willkommen to wienerlicious.

383
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:51,266
I'm sorry, but we're geschlossen--
and that's German for "closed.

384
00:20:53,456 --> 00:20:54,863
"that's really adorable.

385
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,962
Nice cover, agent Walker.

386
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,961
You've a sec?

387
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:03,555
Hello, Chuck.

388
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:07,651
What did you tell your handler?

389
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:08,750
I told him you were innocent, okay?

390
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,750
I told him, I thought you were innocent.

391
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,847
And I think the best thing for
you to do is go and turn yourself in.

392
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:12,646
They can help you.

393
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,945
Forget it, Chuck.

394
00:21:14,535 --> 00:21:15,544
It doesn't even matter.

395
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:16,442
Of course it matters.

396
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,441
Isn't this what you wanted?

397
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,739
They went through the trouble
of framing me for murder.

398
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:21,537
What's going to happen
when they get me back?

399
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:22,537
A slap on the wrist?

400
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:24,235
There's got to be someplace
you can hide me.

401
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:26,733
Just for tonight.

402
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:29,730
There is one place.

403
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:32,628
So this kid just escaped?

404
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:36,323
Look, we tried everything we could to
prevent this whole thing from happening.

405
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:38,221
And what exactly is this?

406
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:42,718
A mentally unstable weapons designer, off his meds,
and currently running around Los Angeles.

407
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,816
And how do you know all this?

408
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:45,215
Laszlo was my asset.

409
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,913
I was the one who found him.

410
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:49,711
I was the one who trained him, and I'm definitely
the one who's going to be bringing him back.

411
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:52,507
Look, I'm just going to be
completely straight with you, Walker.

412
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:55,904
We believe that he is looking to make a bomb.

413
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:59,700
And god help whoever's in his way
when Laszlo decides to go off.

414
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,198
Welcome to buy more.

415
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,997
How can I be of assistance?

416
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,971
This is great!

417
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,868
I'll be out before you guys open.

418
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:20,364
And if everything works out,
you will never see me again.

419
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:22,663
Thank you, Chuck, for everything.

420
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:23,961
I really appreciate it.

421
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:25,060
Yeah, definitely.

422
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:27,258
Good luck disappearing, Laszlo.

423
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,157
Yeah.

424
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:30,755
Oh, and I hope you don't mind,
I kind of helped myself to the...

425
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:32,852
To the Bond oeuvre.

426
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,552
Oh, check you out.

427
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:35,850
A view to a kill?

428
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:38,348
That's a bold choice.
Why? Is it a good one?

429
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,444
Oh, dude, Christopher Walken
playing some evil Nazi villain?

430
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:44,942
Grace Jones as some
android rage sex assassin?

431
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:47,239
I think, actually, on second thought,
I'm going to stay for the beginning.

432
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:48,337
Sit.

433
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,733
Who is it?

434
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:57,229
Uh, it's my handler, Sarah.

435
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:58,428
Chuck, you got to turn it off.

436
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,026
Please, Chuck, she could be tracking us.

437
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:03,922
You don't understand.If you turn me in to your handlers,
it's like signing my death warrant.

438
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:09,118
Give me your watch.

439
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,417
Why?
Give me your watch.

440
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:11,915
I need to disable the transponder.

441
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:13,914
Disable the transponder?
transponder

442
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:15,812
Yeah, but how would you do that?

443
00:23:23,795 --> 00:23:24,903
Here you go.

444
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:31,596
You were right about the bugs, by the way.

445
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:32,896
God knows what they put in my car.

446
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:34,094
I've got a pretty good idea.

447
00:23:34,486 --> 00:23:36,992
I broke into it earlier, disabled the GPS.

448
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:38,190
How did you...

449
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,587
You designed my car.

450
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:41,587
Just think, Chuck.

451
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:46,183
Right now, there is no one in the
entire world who knows where we are.

452
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,276
come on, Chuck.Pick up the phone.

453
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:53,575
Hey, it's Chuck.

454
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:54,674
I'll call you right back.

455
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:55,673
damn it.

456
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:59,470
Chuck, I want you to go to your car,
lock the doors and wait for me.

457
00:24:03,257 --> 00:24:04,365
What did I tell you?

458
00:24:04,457 --> 00:24:07,662
Max Zorin is one of the greatest bad guys of all time.

459
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:11,857
You think Walken was the bad guy?

460
00:24:13,148 --> 00:24:14,556
What, are you kidding?

461
00:24:14,347 --> 00:24:17,253
I mean, he did try to sink California into the Pacific ocean.

462
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:18,252
What do you think?

463
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:20,450
Don't you get it, Chuck?

464
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,047
Zorin is like us.

465
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,643
The Nazis used him for his superior gifts
the way our government uses me and you.

466
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,741
I don't...
Too bad Zorin didn't have this home theater system.

467
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:31,339
Screw flooding Silicon Valley.

468
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,636
Do you know what we can do with this system
if we really wanted to, Chuck?

469
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:36,734
Watch more movies?

470
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:39,232
I haven't had a chance to play with
this bad boy since I designed it.

471
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,624
What is that?
Strategic air command.

472
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:52,218
We keep a fleet of B-2s in Guam,
kept on nuclear alert, just in case.

473
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:56,614
What are you doing?

474
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:58,413
Putting my tax dollars to work, Chuck.

475
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:01,411
Would you like to play a nice game of thermonuclear war?

476
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,310
What about Texas?

477
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,805
What did Texas ever do that was so great?

478
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:09,902
Nine hours...

479
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:12,000
Maybe we should pick somewhere closer?

480
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,297
In honor of max Zorin...

481
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:16,996
Let's see how fast they get to San Francisco.

482
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,091
Hey, hey, hey!

483
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:22,290
Um...

484
00:25:22,082 --> 00:25:24,588
What about, let's watch Goldfinger, huh?

485
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:27,386
What's it about?

486
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:32,780
Uh, again, it's about this bad, misunderstood guy
who just wants to blow up the world.

487
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:34,878
It's right up your alley;
I think you'll really like it.

488
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:39,574
We can always play later.

489
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:40,372
We can!

490
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:41,672
We can play...

491
00:25:41,864 --> 00:25:43,970
Bomb, bomb, bomb...

492
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:45,467
Thing later...

493
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:47,166
I'm going to go get us some more popcorn.

494
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,365
So, here, why don't you...

495
00:25:48,157 --> 00:25:49,563
You go ahead and start without me.

496
00:25:49,355 --> 00:25:52,162
And-and, uh, I'm going to be right back.

497
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,357
You have 34 new messages.

498
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:57,257
Chuck, it's Casey.

499
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:58,156
Call me.

500
00:25:59,147 --> 00:26:00,754
You think this is funny, Chuck?

501
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:04,050
If you don't call me back in the next ten seconds...

502
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:07,048
Tie it in a knot and shove it straight up...

503
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,543
Chuck, I want you to go to your car,
lock the doors, and wait for me.

504
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:18,936
Where are we headed?

505
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:20,934
I thought I asked you to turn your phone off.

506
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:21,833
Who were you talking to?

507
00:26:21,624 --> 00:26:22,932
My handler, okay?

508
00:26:22,723 --> 00:26:24,531
She was just checking in.

509
00:26:24,323 --> 00:26:25,529
You shouldn't have done that, Chuck.

510
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:27,427
You should not have dragged them into this.

511
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,126
I'm not responsible for what happens now.

512
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:33,023
You sold me out...
You sold me out!

513
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:35,419
No, no, no, no.
I just didn't want you to get hurt, okay?

514
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:36,618
Look, relax.

515
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,517
Just relax, everything is going to be cool.

516
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:56,002
Everything is not going to be cool.

517
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,787
What the hell?

518
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,165
You're going to kill us!
You're going to kill us!

519
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,445
Well, Chuck, it's been fun.

520
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:58,840
Don't...

521
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,236
Oh... Oh!

522
00:28:37,643 --> 00:28:38,751
Hey.

523
00:28:39,043 --> 00:28:40,350
You look nice.

524
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:41,650
Thanks.

525
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:42,848
I feel like crap.

526
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:44,445
I screwed up.

527
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:48,142
I severely pooched the Laszlo situation last night.

528
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:49,741
Yeah, well...

529
00:28:49,731 --> 00:28:52,437
Today, you have a job interview.

530
00:28:53,328 --> 00:28:57,134
Do you think I care about making
lower management at a buy more?

531
00:28:56,926 --> 00:28:57,833
Are you kidding me?

532
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:01,829
I aided and abetted the escape of
the next Ted Kacyzski, Sarah.

533
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,629
I just...

534
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:07,223
I can't believe that I was so wrong about that guy.

535
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:08,723
No wonder you bugged my room.

536
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,121
I'm an absolute idiot.

537
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:19,213
You know, just because you trust people,
it doesn't make you an idiot.

538
00:29:19,803 --> 00:29:22,209
Yeah, well, I should've trusted you guys a little more.

539
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,606
I'm sorry.

540
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:32,000
Well, Casey got a signal on your car,
and somehow the GPS got turned back on

541
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:33,799
and Laszlo was heading east.

542
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:35,397
So, I'll call you from the road.

543
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:37,595
And don't worry, we're going to bring him in, Chuck.

544
00:29:38,984 --> 00:29:40,492
Good luck today.

545
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:00,974
Morgan!

546
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:04,969
I don't know who you're supposed to be,
but that's the most kick-ass costume ever.

547
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,968
I'm sorry, Michael.

548
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,266
Is it Halloween?

549
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:09,166
I didn't realize.

550
00:30:11,753 --> 00:30:13,061
Morgan, hey.

551
00:30:13,252 --> 00:30:16,957
You up for a little mystery crisper holiday edition?

552
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:20,254
I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about, lester.

553
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:21,753
Jeffrey.

554
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:25,749
Hey, Morgan, buddy, where were you this morning?

555
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:26,947
I thought you wanted a ride in.

556
00:30:27,638 --> 00:30:28,945
Why are you all dressed up?

557
00:30:28,737 --> 00:30:30,344
Why are you all dressed up?

558
00:30:30,436 --> 00:30:32,244
I have a job interview today.

559
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:34,639
Bully for you, Chuck.
What?

560
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,837
You think you're the only one at the
buy more who cares about looking professional?

561
00:30:39,627 --> 00:30:40,934
Typical.

562
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,232
I never, I never said anything...

563
00:30:49,218 --> 00:30:50,326
Boo!
Ah!

564
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,023
Did I scare you, Chuck?

565
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:57,119
You better be scared, 'cause I'm about
ready to kill me a job interview, partner.

566
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,116
Ka-pow!

567
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:24,492
Laszlo is not headed east.

568
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:25,891
He's going to the Santa Monica pier.

569
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:27,090
Yeah, you don't say?

570
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:29,088
We just found the GPS in downtown.

571
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,285
Laszlo ripped it out and stuck it under a big rig.

572
00:31:31,077 --> 00:31:32,684
Look, he was casing the arcade.

573
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,083
It's where he was first recruited.

574
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,782
There's a huge Halloween party there every year.

575
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:36,582
I think he's going to blow it up.

576
00:31:36,373 --> 00:31:38,079
Where do you think you're going?

577
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,878
Um... It's you.

578
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:41,576
Hey, hey, big Mike, i...

579
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,174
Can i... Can I borrow another herder?

580
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:43,874
All the herders are out.

581
00:31:43,665 --> 00:31:45,873
You've got an interview this afternoon, or did you forget?
No.

582
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,070
I-I just... I'm...

583
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:48,170
Something came up.

584
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:50,168
Is that something more important
than being assistant manager?

585
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:52,965
Is it more important than
handing over your promotion to Tang?

586
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:55,662
Please, Chuck. Is it more important
than big Mike's relaxation?

587
00:31:55,553 --> 00:31:58,959
Look, big Mike, there are just some things
in life that are more important than the buy more.

588
00:32:02,148 --> 00:32:04,054
You mean, like fishing and danish?

589
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:13,146
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

590
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:13,945
I beg your pardon.

591
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:21,937
Bartowski?

592
00:32:23,926 --> 00:32:26,734
Excuse me,
you-you in the Gordon Gecko costume.

593
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:28,530
Have you seen Chuck Bartowski?

594
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:29,730
It's time for his interview.

595
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:32,427
I actually don't know where Chuck's
been keeping himself these days.

596
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:33,927
So-sorry.

597
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:39,620
I guess your boyfriend
just couldn't take the heat, huh?

598
00:32:41,111 --> 00:32:43,217
I'm sure he's got a perfectly good excuse.

599
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:44,216
Sure he does.

600
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:48,912
First Chuck bails on you and
your stupid space-penis costume.

601
00:32:48,903 --> 00:32:52,308
And then, he doesn't even have
the stones to show up for his interview.

602
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:53,207
What a loser.

603
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,105
Even by your standards.

604
00:32:55,096 --> 00:33:00,900
If I were you, I'd start interviewing
for a new best friend, ma-ma-ma...

605
00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:02,099
Morgan.

606
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,397
Let me ask you something.

607
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,695
What do you know about Chuck Bartowski?

608
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,288
You're not Bartowski.

609
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,984
Actually, I'm-I'm here to
interview on my friend's behalf.

610
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:17,584
Look...

611
00:33:17,376 --> 00:33:19,082
Please, please, just hear me out, okay?

612
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:21,780
I know that the virtues that make for
a good buy more manager are the same virtues

613
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:23,179
that make for a best friend.

614
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,474
Now, uh, Chuck and I may have our differences,
but I can tell y05 this about him.

615
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:29,472
Chuck is-is brave.

616
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:31,471
Chuck is loyal.

617
00:33:31,262 --> 00:33:33,868
You know, Chuck can quote wrath of khan word-for-word.

618
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,367
And Chuck is courageous.

619
00:33:35,258 --> 00:33:40,262
Chuck's got a wicked vinyl collection,
and Chuck has the wisdom to not eat garbage

620
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:41,860
from the break room Crisper.

621
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:48,054
If you want my open and honest and direct opinion,
the best man for this job

622
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:50,053
is a man by the name of Chuck Bartowski.

623
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,446
Some speech.

624
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,444
Chuck Bartowski sounds like a hell of a guy.

625
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:00,244
He is.

626
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:04,239
When he comes in tomorrow,
he'll be working for one...

627
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,237
Harold Tiberius Tang.

628
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:07,836
God help you all.

629
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:28,016
I meant to tell you earlier about
your car's self-destruct function.

630
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:31,213
One of my more inspired designs.

631
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:32,613
Laszlo, listen.

632
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,712
Relax, Chuck.

633
00:34:33,802 --> 00:34:34,911
She's all yours.

634
00:34:42,694 --> 00:34:43,702
What did you just do?

635
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:45,299
You just armed a bomb.

636
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,297
That would have taken me hours to
get through the fingerprint recognition system.

637
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:49,895
Why are you doing this?
What?

638
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:50,695
Blowing stuff up?

639
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:52,292
That's what bad guys do, Chuck.

640
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:55,491
Besides, how else was I going to punish
them for what they did to me?

641
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:01,884
Yeah?
Hey, someone just armed the herder to self-destruct.

642
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:03,782
Yeah.I know.

643
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:05,181
It was me.

644
00:35:10,104 --> 00:35:11,412
Disarm the bomb right now!

645
00:35:11,203 --> 00:35:12,111
You disarm the bomb!

646
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,210
How?

647
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,408
Cut the wire.

648
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:18,804
which one?
The red one.

649
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:21,902
You got to cut a wire, Chuck!

650
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:23,300
What if I cut both of them?

651
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:24,898
Oh, like Sean Connery in the end of Goldfinger?

652
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:26,896
What did you just say?

653
00:35:26,788 --> 00:35:27,895
Cut the wire, Chuck.

654
00:35:27,687 --> 00:35:30,294
The other night, you said
you'd never seen Goldfinger, so,

655
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:31,992
how would you know what Bond
does at the end of the movie?

656
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:33,989
Cut the wire, or we're dead.

657
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,588
You lied to me, Laszlo.

658
00:35:36,478 --> 00:35:41,082
You knew I'd believe you when
you said you just wanted to live a normal, peaceful life.

659
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:45,279
And you knew that I'd believe you about
ducting the wire, but you were wrong, Laszlo.

660
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,878
Chuck!
Wait! Wait! Stay back!

661
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,176
Cut the red wire, Chuck!

662
00:35:57,758 --> 00:35:59,065
you're under arrest.

663
00:36:02,553 --> 00:36:03,662
Come on.

664
00:36:15,141 --> 00:36:16,549
I liked it a little bit, all right?

665
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,248
All right, now, how do i...

666
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:21,544
hey, Chuck.

667
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,936
Nice costume, Chuck.

668
00:36:29,028 --> 00:36:32,034
And what are you supposed to be?

669
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:34,032
Oh, that's right.

670
00:36:34,124 --> 00:36:36,130
You're my employee.

671
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:40,226
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

672
00:36:40,018 --> 00:36:42,025
You did hear I got the job.

673
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:44,023
Uncontested.
Yeah.

674
00:36:43,814 --> 00:36:45,221
Nice work, Harry.

675
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:51,116
Anyhow, now that you're here,
I wanted to talk to you about some organizational ideas

676
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:52,814
I had for the nerd Herd...

677
00:36:53,804 --> 00:36:55,112
Chuck, where are you going?

678
00:36:55,603 --> 00:36:56,811
Chuck?

679
00:36:56,602 --> 00:36:58,309
Chuck, I will not be ignored!

680
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,709
Did Morgan ever find you?

681
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,305
I thought the guy was going to lose it.

682
00:37:01,097 --> 00:37:02,105
No.I-I know.

683
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:05,302
He was really looking forward to
the buy more costume contest.

684
00:37:05,094 --> 00:37:07,500
I'm talking about what he did for you.

685
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:12,594
Giving the whole big speech to try to
talk the hr guy into giving you the job?

686
00:37:14,385 --> 00:37:15,793
Morgan did that?

687
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:18,289
And then someone went
and stole his bike.

688
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,887
I mean, what kind of loser
would steal a guy's bike?

689
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:28,480
Look at you two.

690
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:24,826
I didn't think you were coming.

691
00:38:24,817 --> 00:38:25,825
I'm sorry.

692
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:27,024
I got held up.

693
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:30,321
Listen, Morgan, I think you
should be the head this year.

694
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,418
Really?

695
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:46,505
Chuck? Chuck, honey? Honey?

696
00:38:46,296 --> 00:38:47,704
He's in the back.

697
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,402
Hey.

698
00:38:50,193 --> 00:38:51,302
How did it go?

699
00:38:51,093 --> 00:38:55,397
Uh, the short version is that I didn't get the job.
What?

700
00:38:55,188 --> 00:38:57,495
I kind of skipped out on the interview.

701
00:38:57,486 --> 00:38:58,893
It was my fault.

702
00:38:58,985 --> 00:39:00,393
Hel-lo.

703
00:39:00,184 --> 00:39:04,187
I, uh... I had a personal emergency,
and Chuck really came through.

704
00:39:03,979 --> 00:39:07,585
He probably wouldn't admit it,
but your brother is kind of a hero.

705
00:39:12,972 --> 00:39:14,179
Would you excuse us?

706
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:19,374
Hey, uh, buddy, you mind if...

707
00:39:19,165 --> 00:39:20,772
You mind if we take a little five minute break?

708
00:39:20,563 --> 00:39:22,770
Dude, are you kidding me? Take ten if you need it.

709
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,667
So, uh, where did you get the costume?

710
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:29,164
The CIA can make anything.

711
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:32,961
What are you...
What are you doing?

712
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:35,257
Uh... Smile.

713
00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:38,056
Smile.

714
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,051
I, uh...

715
00:39:41,842 --> 00:39:48,647
I wanted to give you a new photo of us,
and I figured that it should be something real.

716
00:39:48,438 --> 00:39:49,445
Chuck!

717
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:51,643
Sandworm! Sandworm! Sandworm!

718
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:52,941
They're calling for the worm, bro.

719
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,139
Sandworm! Sandworm! Sandworm!

720
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:56,538
I'll, uh... I'll see you outside.

721
00:40:03,423 --> 00:40:04,430
What were you guys, uh...

722
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:05,529
What were you guys talking about?

723
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:07,327
Oh, nothing.

724
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,226
Just, uh, you know.

725
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:16,518
Sarah was just telling me that if she were
stranded on a desert island, she would bring roast beef.

726
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:18,217
She didn't say roast beef.

727
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:19,116
Oh, she totally...

728
00:40:18,907 --> 00:40:22,312
she completely said roast beef.
oh, that's terrible.

729
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:24,811
Oh, that's a terrible sandwich,
it's a terrible sandwich.

730
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:28,407
You know, she's smart, and she's sexy,
and kudos on her costume, looked fantastic,

731
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:30,305
but who brings roast beef to a deserted island?

732
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:32,004
That's a terrible choice.
