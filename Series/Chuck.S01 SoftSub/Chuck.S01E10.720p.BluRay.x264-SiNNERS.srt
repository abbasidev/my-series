1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,367
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few
things that you might need to know.</i>

2
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:08,409
- It's hard to say goodbye.
- Bryce Larkin is a spy?

3
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,911
A rogue spy.
Did he try to contact you?

4
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:12,749
He... He sent me an e-mail.

5
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:16,473
Bryce sent me a database of
government secrets in my brain...

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:20,973
...keeping me in a constant state of fear,
danger and anxiety.

7
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:23,689
You and Bryce. That's not true, right?

8
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:25,488
It was complicated.

9
00:00:25,657 --> 00:00:27,652
It was nice knowing you.

10
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:32,911
It's Tommy. We have a problem.

11
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:36,258
The package has been intercepted.
We're gonna have to clean things up.

12
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:37,971
Oh, my God. Bryce.

13
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:09,523
I'd like to speak with Chuck.

14
00:01:11,452 --> 00:01:13,412
What did he say?

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,991
It sounded like...

16
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:18,047
Chuck!

17
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,883
Where's Bartowski?

18
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:25,682
Chuck!

19
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:27,981
<i>This is Sarah, leave a message.</i>

20
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:29,231
Hey. Hey, it's Chuck.

21
00:01:29,404 --> 00:01:32,610
Uh, look, if you could just call me
whenever... Any time...

22
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:34,246
Are we playing hide and seek?

23
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:36,324
Is that Sarah? Did she call?
I hope she called.

24
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:38,828
You have been really weird
since breaking up with her.

25
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:41,379
Like full-on stalker-mode
crazy guy here.

26
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:43,296
Kind of like the old Chuck,
funny enough.

27
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:45,301
<i>Message recorded.</i>

28
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:47,221
Thanks, buddy.

29
00:01:47,397 --> 00:01:49,058
What am I here for? Am I right?

30
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,311
Come on. Open up to Uncle Morgan.

31
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:54,444
It's complicated, buddy.
It's just... It's complicated.

32
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:57,076
Yeah, no. Listen, man.
You like her, she likes you.

33
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:59,207
Yeah, dude. Wow, I'm... I'm confused.

34
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:01,788
Like, I thought it wasn't going anywhere,
that it was over.

35
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:05,504
And then we had this... This moment.

36
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:12,603
This really, I mean, great moment.

37
00:02:14,448 --> 00:02:16,823
And then in the moment
right after that...

38
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:20,497
...I realized what a huge mistake it was
to break up with her.

39
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:33,567
I'm... I'm actually gonna leave now.

40
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:34,767
No. Hey.

41
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:37,486
Uh, quick question. It's cool
if Anna comes to Thanksgiving?

42
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:40,069
Yeah. You know how Ellie loves
big Thanksgiving dinners.

43
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,575
- See?
- Is Ellie gonna be there?

44
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:45,708
Well, yes, because Chuck
lives at Ellie's apartment.

45
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:48,210
- I know that.
- She makes all my favorite dishes.

46
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:51,724
Like stuffing with apple chips,
and sweet potatoes and marshmallows.

47
00:02:51,894 --> 00:02:53,555
And I know that too.

48
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,565
- I'm sorry. Is there a problem?
- Not yet.

49
00:02:58,198 --> 00:03:00,525
Ow. Ha, ha. Ow. Ow.

50
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:02,745
She scares the crap out of me.

51
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:04,292
What is that about?

52
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,666
- She's got this idea I'm in love with Ellie.
- Because you are.

53
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:11,296
- Why does everyone know that?
- Because that's what you tell everybody.

54
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:14,181
I don't know what to do, man.
I'm in love with two women.

55
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:18,272
Bartowski. Grimes.
Does no Tang mean no work?

56
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:22,366
Bartowski, round up your team.
Grimes, stay close.

57
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,114
Some of you are new, so listen up.

58
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,835
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

59
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:29,163
Do any of you know
what happens after Thanksgiving?

60
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:32,379
The tryptophan wears off,
and it's time for the liquor to kick in?

61
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:35,475
No.
I'm talking about Black Friday, people.

62
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:37,437
The biggest shopping day of the year.

63
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:40,730
When regular housewives
transform into a crazy mob...

64
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:43,148
...blinded by door prizes, sales...

65
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:46,116
...and the urge to get
the Christmas shopping done early.

66
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,459
On Friday, I'm reassigning you nerds
to crowd control.

67
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,172
Be here tomorrow for training.

68
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:52,623
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.

69
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:56,138
So wouldn't we, as a store, be closed?

70
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:58,802
- You got a key, work it out.
- Chuck.

71
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:00,690
Grimes. You know the drill.

72
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:03,269
Get these geeks trained
and ready for action.

73
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:04,991
Yes, sir.

74
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,577
Hey, relax, Chuck.

75
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:12,879
Things are, uh...
Things are looking up for you.

76
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,129
- Really?
Oh, yeah.

77
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:16,011
And how would that be?

78
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:21,179
Turn on your heart light,
buddy. Let it glow. Let it glow.

79
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:28,402
I don't, uh...
I don't wanna play Beckman here...

80
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:31,749
...but if, uh, you don't start answering
my calls...

81
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,251
...then super-secret-spy-resource Chuck
Bartowski does kind of go to waste.

82
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:38,837
- Did you flash on something?
- No.

83
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:42,553
No, I was calling about other stuff. You
didn't happen to listen to my messages?

84
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,224
- Chuck, we have to talk.
- No, wait. Can I say something first?

85
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:47,646
- No.
- It's the kiss, right? Ha.

86
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,200
It is. It's gotta be the kiss.

87
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:52,575
First of all, I know that the moment
was very life-or-death-ish.

88
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,502
Normally, I would run from a situation
like that. You, on the other hand...

89
00:04:56,674 --> 00:04:58,918
You, um...

90
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:01,422
You, uh... You kissed me,
which was just...

91
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:05,269
Um, but the thing is,
that I'd like to talk about...

92
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,352
...is I'd like to invite you
to Thanksgiving.

93
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:09,653
But we'd need a cover for that.

94
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:12,946
So really,
what I'm trying to ask you is, uh...

95
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:16,292
...are we back together?

96
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:19,037
Chuck, Bryce is alive.

97
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:25,885
Sarah, you told me Bryce was dead.

98
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:28,141
I read his obituary.

99
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:30,561
We went to his funeral.

100
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:32,443
How is this possible?

101
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:34,612
We don't know, Chuck.
He won't talk to our people.

102
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,461
- Not even you?
He hasn't seen either of us.

103
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,587
- Why?
- Because he asked for you.

104
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,931
We wanna know what happened to him.
We think he'll talk to you.

105
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:49,307
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on a second.

106
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:53,697
You want me to go in there
and ask him what exactly?

107
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:55,409
Just so we're on the same page.

108
00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:57,738
Hey, Bryce, why did you send me
the Intersect?

109
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:01,917
Why did you choose my life to ruin?
How exactly do I start that conversation?

110
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,212
Just talk to him, okay?
Be a friend. You're good at that.

111
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:08,843
Remember,
he's a rogue CIA-trained assassin.

112
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:11,596
Be careful.

113
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:14,696
Thanks.

114
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:31,181
Who are you?

115
00:06:31,354 --> 00:06:33,100
Hey.

116
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:35,315
Hey, Bryce. Buddy.

117
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:37,148
It's me, Chuck.

118
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:42,579
I don't believe you.

119
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:45,628
What did you do with the real Chuck?

120
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:52,226
I'd like to come out now, please.

121
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,730
Natural-born interrogator, huh?

122
00:06:57,278 --> 00:06:58,989
Fantastic.

123
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:03,037
All right. Well...

124
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:06,033
Unless we're in the Twilight Zone
right now...

125
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:08,123
...there is another Chuck,
and I'm his clone...

126
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,793
...the answer to your question
is, yes, I am Chuck.

127
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,391
Prove it.

128
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:19,395
Oh, come on.
They're watching us right now.

129
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:20,651
Do it.

130
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:29,627
What the hell?

131
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:33,005
Your Klingon's a bit rusty, Chuck.

132
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,220
Yeah, I've been kind of busy lately,
ever since I got your e-mail.

133
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:38,893
- You opened it, didn't you?
- Yeah.

134
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,147
- Your computer?
- Destroyed.

135
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,943
- So you're the only one.
- I don't get it. Why'd you do it?

136
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:45,609
Why send me the Intersect?
Then why did you destroy it?

137
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:48,115
And last up,
how the hell are you still alive?

138
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,122
- It's complicated.
- Who saved you?

139
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:51,543
They did.

140
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:53,626
They saved you? Did they?

141
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:55,347
Could you be any more cryptic?

142
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:57,842
Can I get a name, a place,
a something?

143
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:01,815
Come here.

144
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:04,027
Oh, don't do that.

145
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:05,479
I'm sorry, Chuck.

146
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:08,114
Untie me.

147
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,533
Oh, my God. All right. Okay, hold it.

148
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:12,369
Bryce. No.

149
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:14,664
Sarah, what are you doing here?

150
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,386
Hello, Casey.

151
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,676
Care to try again?

152
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:57,752
Stand down.

153
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:00,253
Don't do this, Bryce.
We're all on the same side here.

154
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:02,174
- What side is that?
- I've got a shot.

155
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,225
- No, you don't!
- You'll be fine.

156
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:07,435
<i>- No shooting, I'm susceptible to bullets!
Access restricted.</i>

157
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,185
The access code. I'll kill him, Sarah!

158
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,990
Between you and me,
I think he means it.

159
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,246
Five, one, six, zero, two.

160
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:19,997
<i>Access granted.</i>

161
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:22,595
Sarah.

162
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,188
You knew I wouldn't do it. Right?

163
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,192
No.

164
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:34,533
I did not know that. How would I know
that, Bryce? What are you trying to do?

165
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:36,864
- What's Sarah doing here?
- She's protecting me, okay?

166
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,295
And so is Casey. We're the good guys.
Look, you need to stop this, right now.

167
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:43,338
- Before someone, namely me, gets hurt.
- Too soon.

168
00:09:43,512 --> 00:09:45,222
We're slowing down.

169
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:48,345
We don't have to do the whole thing.

170
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,934
No, please don't do this!

171
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:53,361
- You stop this elevator again...
- Bryce.

172
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:56,201
Who's your friend?

173
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,877
- You step back.
- Okay.

174
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:10,389
I wouldn't want you to kill some
random person. I'd feel just terrible.

175
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:14,101
- Tell your people that I'm gone.
- This is your chance, Bryce.

176
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:16,190
This is me being reasonable.

177
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,945
Let's go, let's be friends again.

178
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,496
We were never friends.

179
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:21,457
Ouch.

180
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:22,956
Now my feelings are hurt.

181
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:25,716
You're gonna run, aren't you?

182
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:27,959
Good.

183
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,145
Who was that?

184
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:38,281
Nobody.

185
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:40,905
What's Fulcrum?

186
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,248
Where did you hear that?

187
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:45,587
The Intersect.

188
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:47,085
I have these flashes.

189
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:49,004
I was right.

190
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,096
You can remember its intel.

191
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,381
Is it always that fast?

192
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,268
What is Fulcrum, Bryce? Who are they,
and how do they know you?

193
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,563
- This is my stop.
- No, wait. I have questions.

194
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:01,113
- I have millions of questions.
- Chuck.

195
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,079
This is gonna sting a little.

196
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:08,213
Tell Sarah it's hard to say goodbye.

197
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:17,850
Chuck. Hey, Chuck.

198
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,736
Huh?

199
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:23,278
Hey.

200
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:25,912
Hey.

201
00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:28,910
Not pretty!

202
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,370
Ugly.

203
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,931
It wasn't a full dose. It'll be
out of your system in a few hours.

204
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:40,143
Thanks.
I think I can handle it from here.

205
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:42,111
So are you and Casey
gonna go after Bryce?

206
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:45,368
No. Bryce is probably halfway
around the world by now.

207
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:47,697
It's, uh, someone else's job
to find him.

208
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,868
Sarah, this is Bryce Larkin
we're talking about.

209
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,374
Your old flame.

210
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:53,792
My old nemesis.
We have to do something.

211
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:55,762
We each have our own assignment.

212
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:57,806
Right, and I'm yours.

213
00:11:57,977 --> 00:12:01,598
So, what?
What does this mean for us?

214
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:04,069
Nothing. You're protected.

215
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:06,031
No, for us.

216
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:10,331
Our fake relationship.
I mean, you and Bryce were...

217
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,041
You're really not making this easy.

218
00:12:13,214 --> 00:12:14,709
- Hey. Hey, sis.
- Hi. Hey.

219
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:16,344
Hey.
- Hey, Sarah.

220
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:18,637
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

221
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:21,016
Are you coming to Thanksgiving?

222
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:23,680
Of course.

223
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:32,118
On Black Friday, it comes down to us.

224
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:33,752
Crowd control.

225
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,665
Okay? Little test here.

226
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,381
Jeff, emergency in Sector 2. Move!

227
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:39,883
Nice work, Jeff. That's all.

228
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:43,227
Lester, converge on Jeff's position.
Sector 1, move. Now, go.

229
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,806
People's lives are at stake here, man.

230
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:47,149
Good hustle, Les.

231
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:49,446
Anna?
We cannot lose the doors, okay?

232
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:52,489
If we lose the doors,
we've lost the battle. Got it?

233
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:55,789
All right. You look beautiful today,
but the way.

234
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:57,042
- Chuck.
- Yes, Morgan?

235
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:58,924
- Yes, I'm right here.
Pal, listen.

236
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:00,422
Everybody's moving way too slow.

237
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:04,218
If they don't shape up, we lose control,
we are gonna have a pineapple situation.

238
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:08,057
- What's a pineapple situation?
Never say that word.

239
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:10,230
- You just...
- It's a black swan.

240
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:12,615
It's an impossible event
that changes everything.

241
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:15,362
In case something terrible happens.
Nuclear strike, earthquake.

242
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:19,376
Anyone of you could initiate a full Buy
More evacuation by uttering one word.

243
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,748
- Pineapple.
- Hmm.

244
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,636
The word that cannot be spoken.

245
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:24,550
I really just wanna say pineapple...

246
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:26,719
Pineapples are fun.
My dad used to throw them.

247
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:29,140
- Pineapple.
- Seriously? Wow.

248
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:34,115
- What's the matter? Who is it?
- Ellie. She's in Thanksgiving panic mode.

249
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:35,615
I gotta stop by the store.

250
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:38,198
- See you kids later.
- You gotta be kidding me.

251
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:42,378
Chuck, where are you? Come on, dude.
What about? What about Black Friday?

252
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:47,344
Okay.

253
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:52,226
Chuck. Get ready for some turkey.

254
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:57,906
- What are you doing here?
- Well, your sister invited me to dinner.

255
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,370
- Really?
- Thanks.

256
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:02,372
Did you find everything?
- Yeah, I did.

257
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:04,173
- Yeah, but I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

258
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:06,171
I need to talk to you about something.

259
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:08,056
Later. Later. Um.

260
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:10,432
- Hey, hey. Uh.
- Ahem.

261
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:13,098
Sorry. Uh, I have a question for you.

262
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:16,233
Um. What? What do you think
Bryce meant when he said:

263
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:18,735
"Casey, care to? Care to try again?"

264
00:14:18,912 --> 00:14:21,370
Because call me crazy,
but I got the weirdest feeling...

265
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,619
...like it was you who killed him.

266
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,625
Good guess.

267
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,426
Are you?
Does Sarah know about that?

268
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:28,759
It's in my report.

269
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:31,389
Why would you do that?

270
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:32,807
Why did you kill Bryce?

271
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,523
Orders.

272
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:37,399
Your old nemesis is a very dangerous
human being, Chuck.

273
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:40,244
You get a chance to shoot Bryce Larkin,
you shoot to kill.

274
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:43,783
Guys, no shop talk tonight.
We got a bird to eat.

275
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,250
Hey, John.
Could you help me stuff this monster?

276
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:48,714
- Cosmo?
- Thank you, John.

277
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:51,094
- He's so sweet.
- Like honey.

278
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,637
Uh, sis, Morgan is bringing somebody
tonight.

279
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,773
A real someone
or an imaginary someone?

280
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:59,900
Uh, real, actually.
Very real, and she's very nice.

281
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:02,114
- And, um, she...
- She?

282
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:04,495
- You said "she. "
- Yes.

283
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,203
Yes, Anna. Morgan's girlfriend.
There could be a little issue though...

284
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:10,376
...because she knows
about you and Morgan.

285
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:12,752
What are you talking about?

286
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:17,602
Just remember, it's not my fault.

287
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:22,066
Ah, hello, Sarah and my other friends.
Welcome to Thanksgiving.

288
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:23,702
Thank you. They're beautiful.

289
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,779
- You're welcome.
- Devon's inside over there.

290
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:28,330
Ellie. So this is Anna, my...

291
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:30,996
- Girlfriend.
- Right.

292
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:33,253
And this is my green-bean casserole.

293
00:15:34,305 --> 00:15:35,338
Try not to drop it.

294
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,017
It's good to meet you, finally.

295
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,730
Yeah. Yeah, Chuck just told me
about you and Morgan.

296
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:44,611
- I'm so happy, ha.
- Hussy.

297
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:48,448
Um...

298
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,412
- I am in heaven.
Yeah.

299
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:52,498
- This is so good.
I'm glad you like.

300
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:53,754
Amazing.

301
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:57,464
- Do you, uh, usually do Thanksgiving?
- Uh, not recently.

302
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:59,470
Oh, man, oh, man.
Okay, you know what?

303
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:02,852
For my second plate,
I need critical side dish number two.

304
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:05,068
Oh, yeah. There you go.
Thank you.

305
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,493
There's no marshmallows
on my sweet potatoes.

306
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:10,906
It's Morgan's favorite
number two side dish.

307
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:14,957
I'm sorry. I must've forgot.

308
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,044
Thanksgiving is ruined.

309
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,343
No, no. Wait, that's my bad.

310
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,264
I did pick them up.
They're in the herder.

311
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,598
- I'll be right back.
- Don't be too long.

312
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,892
How's everything? Good?

313
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:27,605
Good.

314
00:16:36,298 --> 00:16:38,922
- Hello, Chuck.
- Sarah and Casey are right inside.

315
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,174
One girlish scream,
and they go into combat mode.

316
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,428
Relax.

317
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:46,014
- This your place?
- Ellie and I live here, yeah.

318
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:48,401
You live with your sister?

319
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:51,694
What happened, Chuck?

320
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:54,324
What happened to you?

321
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,874
The guy who wanted
to be the software billionaire?

322
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:59,505
- Bill Gates with style?
- You got me kicked out of Stanford.

323
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:02,466
I need to talk to Sarah.
Can you bring her to me?

324
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:05,099
- Without Casey?
- Why would I help you?

325
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:06,731
Because of Fulcrum.

326
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:09,736
That guy in the elevator,
he works for them.

327
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,481
And they want the Intersect, Chuck.
They want you.

328
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:20,966
Thank God the marshmallows are back.

329
00:17:21,426 --> 00:17:23,337
Thank you.

330
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,640
I made this for you.

331
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:31,398
Thank you, thank you.

332
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:34,194
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's great.

333
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,246
- Do you like it?
- Mm-hm. Very much.

334
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:42,831
It's devastating... Devastatingly good.

335
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:44,469
Does anyone else want some?

336
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,343
Nice and tight, John. I'm impressed.

337
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:51,100
You work out?

338
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:53,186
Yeah, work keeps me in shape.

339
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:55,570
How many calories
do you burn at the Buy More?

340
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,580
Bryce Larkin is in my bedroom.

341
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:01,834
About 350 an hour, max.

342
00:18:02,004 --> 00:18:04,128
You look like a guy
who needs an adventure.

343
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,627
Two words: Water sports.

344
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:09,849
Excuse me.

345
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:12,680
Sweetheart, is that, um, tartar sauce?

346
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:33,885
You're getting rusty.

347
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:35,858
Bryce, I have a gun.
Do I need to use it?

348
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:37,272
I'm unarmed.

349
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:39,357
And I'm sorry.

350
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:42,787
Two dudes.
One raft. White-water rapids.

351
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:44,916
I got some brochures I gave to Chuck.

352
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:47,294
Hey, those the rafting brochures
still in your room?

353
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:48,961
- What?
- Don't worry, I'll get them.

354
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:52,055
No, no, no. I'll... I'll get them.

355
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:55,014
Please, you guys keep, you know, talk...
Talk.

356
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:57,017
Why shouldn't I arrest you right now?

357
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:58,937
Because I'm not a rogue spy.

358
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:01,072
Because Intersect was a mission.

359
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:05,412
Because, Sarah,
you're still in love with me.

360
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:34,135
So Thanksgiving.

361
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,548
We're all supposed to say
what we're thankful for.

362
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,434
I'll start. I am thankful that I'm here...

363
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:42,775
...with the most beautiful woman
in the world, Ellie Bartowski.

364
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:44,490
- Good call.
- Morgan.

365
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,403
- Uh, right.
That's sweet, honey.

366
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:50,282
I am thankful for my family
and my friends.

367
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:53,882
I pass.

368
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,303
Chuck.

369
00:19:56,806 --> 00:19:59,180
I'm thankful that Bryce Larkin is dead.

370
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:04,103
And is not currently in my bedroom
making out with my new girlfriend.

371
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:08,449
Excuse me, please.

372
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:11,789
Wow, buddy, that was,
um, really dark.

373
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,289
And specific.

374
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,213
Well, you still got it.

375
00:20:17,387 --> 00:20:19,714
This isn't a play, Sarah.
I need your help.

376
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:22,562
Please don't run.

377
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,641
Casey, everything is under control.

378
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:27,820
- Chuck, are you okay?
- Okay, I might've made a mistake.

379
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:33,833
- Nice work, CIA.
- Hey.

380
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:35,711
No guns at Thanksgiving.

381
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,012
It's not Thanksgiving without sweet
potatoes covered in marshmallows.

382
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:43,634
Okay, Ellie, I gotta tell you,
right now I'm getting really excited.

383
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,153
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay.

384
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:54,580
Oh, God.

385
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:57,037
Oh, God.

386
00:20:57,213 --> 00:20:59,207
Oh, my God.

387
00:20:59,382 --> 00:21:01,711
Oh, my God. Yeah.

388
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:03,052
- Uh-huh.
So good.

389
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:04,553
Good?
- So good. Oh, my God.

390
00:21:04,727 --> 00:21:06,270
Fine, Ellie.

391
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:07,934
You can have him.

392
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:10,776
What's the matter, babe?

393
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:13,357
Seriously, where? Hold a second.

394
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:14,948
Honey, hold on a second.

395
00:21:15,122 --> 00:21:17,282
Honey, no more family dinners, okay?

396
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:19,620
What do you think
about a destination Christmas.

397
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:21,673
Anna Banana, come here.

398
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:24,681
Leave me alone, Morgan.
Come on.

399
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:27,307
He's gone, call it in from my place.
I'll check the back.

400
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:30,232
- How did Casey find out?
- I made a rash decision.

401
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:33,108
You saw Bryce kiss me, didn't you?

402
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,240
I guess this means
we're not getting back together.

403
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,674
Sarah, why is someone
in Casey's apartment?

404
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,134
Shh.

405
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:01,582
Put it down, Bryce.

406
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:04,544
Sarah.

407
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:07,637
- Close the door, Chuck.
- Okay, okay, okay.

408
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:09,799
I'm closing the door.
I'm closing the door.

409
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:12,429
I'm walking into the apartment.

410
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,600
Please do not shoot me.

411
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:16,689
I need you to listen to me.

412
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:19,025
- Just put it down.
- The Intersect was a mission.

413
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:21,362
I was recruited by an outfit
called Fulcrum.

414
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,460
A special-access group inside the CIA.

415
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:26,423
You're lying. We would know that.

416
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:29,713
They knew who I was.
My activation codes, my record.

417
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:32,382
They ordered me to shed
my agency contacts and go deep.

418
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:34,721
Only then did I realized
it was an internal strike.

419
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:37,689
To download and destroy Intersect.
Fulcrum had plans for its intel.

420
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:39,144
How can I trust you, Bryce?

421
00:22:41,786 --> 00:22:43,413
I didn't mean to hurt you, Sarah.

422
00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:52,096
- I didn't know who to trust.
- Why Chuck?

423
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:54,758
- Yeah, why Chuck?
- I needed a friend who wasn't a spy.

424
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:58,225
He wouldn't know anything about
Fulcrum or the Intersect or Sand Wall.

425
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:09,582
Sand Wall. Sand Wall,
that was the name of the mission.

426
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:11,752
Sarah, I think he's telling the truth.

427
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:14,254
- What, did you flash?
- Yeah.

428
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,468
I'm not rogue.

429
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:25,238
- Casey, no!
- Casey, no!

430
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:43,356
Bryce.

431
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,941
Bryce.

432
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:48,325
Time to finish the job.

433
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:50,872
Casey, no.
Chuck flashed, Bryce isn't rogue.

434
00:23:51,044 --> 00:23:53,751
You should aim for the head next time,
Casey.

435
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:59,133
Hey, I'm okay. I'm fine.

436
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:02,978
Just, you know, me. Intersect guy.

437
00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:08,149
I don't get it, Bryce.
How are you alive?

438
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:11,706
I don't know how they did it,
if that's what you're asking.

439
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,327
They probably used
one of the European clinics.

440
00:24:14,505 --> 00:24:17,081
- I don't remember it.
- But you know why they did it?

441
00:24:18,262 --> 00:24:19,592
Yeah.

442
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:22,602
Well, should I pop some popcorn
or beat the answer out of you?

443
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:26,060
- No, thanks. I'll talk.
- Darn it.

444
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:28,729
You know the first part already.
I downloaded the Intersect...

445
00:24:28,907 --> 00:24:31,911
...and blew up the computer,
raced out of the DNI.

446
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,327
Then I ran into you, Casey.

447
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:40,512
<i>So I'm on the ground.</i>

448
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,182
<i>No white light.
Just Casey staring down at me.</i>

449
00:24:44,354 --> 00:24:46,016
<i>And then...</i>

450
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,399
<i>They brought me back,
but they weren't trying to save me.</i>

451
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:53,119
<i>This was a Fulcrum team.</i>

452
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:55,329
<i>They wanted something.</i>

453
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,204
Bryce, where are they?
Where are the Intersect files?

454
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:01,008
Tell me, Bryce.

455
00:25:01,177 --> 00:25:04,181
What happened to the Intersect?

456
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,261
Tell me, or I let you die again.

457
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,608
L... I saw them. I saw them.

458
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:15,870
They're in me.

459
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,531
Save him.

460
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:20,919
Do whatever it takes. Save him.

461
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:24,003
Fulcrum thinks you're the Intersect.

462
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,925
They brought me back
to take it out of me.

463
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:27,477
That's why I need your help.

464
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:31,609
- We're gonna help you?
- I need to turn myself in to the CIA.

465
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:34,067
But Fulcrum has operatives
in every agency.

466
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,913
I need to know that
I'm being handed over to the real CIA.

467
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,782
I can do that. I can do that.
I can be there at the transfer.

468
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:44,915
If I flash, they're Fulcrum.
If not, you're on your way home.

469
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:47,423
That should work. Smart, Chuck.

470
00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:49,885
We still need a place
the transfer can go down.

471
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:52,734
- A public place, a lot of people.
- A public spot?

472
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,895
Lots of witnesses?

473
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:56,527
I know a place.

474
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,946
Open the door!

475
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,953
Okay, listen up.

476
00:26:00,122 --> 00:26:01,952
Three minutes,
we let those animals in.

477
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,086
If this was a zoo,
I'd say run for your lives.

478
00:26:04,256 --> 00:26:05,668
But this is Buy More.

479
00:26:05,842 --> 00:26:09,796
For those days when you did squat,
this is where you make up for it.

480
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:11,256
Don't let me down.

481
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:15,058
This is the single most important day
of our year.

482
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,908
And my door is locked.

483
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,490
Don't even think about knocking.

484
00:26:23,418 --> 00:26:25,993
Open the door!

485
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:37,144
Take one.

486
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:39,529
Take only one.

487
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,907
Hey, are we talking?

488
00:26:42,705 --> 00:26:44,781
Anna, what happened last night?

489
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,630
It was a test, Morgan. And you failed.

490
00:26:47,797 --> 00:26:49,542
Well, why are there tests?

491
00:26:49,717 --> 00:26:51,593
No. Take only one.

492
00:26:51,763 --> 00:26:54,435
Take only one. No, take only one.

493
00:26:58,902 --> 00:27:00,861
So appliances are over there. All right?

494
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:02,657
And electronics, you're already here.

495
00:27:02,826 --> 00:27:05,117
<i>We're entering the store.</i>

496
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,953
The CIA pickup
should be here in two minutes.

497
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:13,468
Excuse me.
I'm just looking for camera bags.

498
00:27:13,638 --> 00:27:15,466
Yeah. Cameras are only just over here.

499
00:27:15,642 --> 00:27:19,014
- So if you wanna look...
Excuse me. Excuse me.

500
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:34,719
Do I know you?

501
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,430
Wow, dude.

502
00:27:36,598 --> 00:27:37,929
No, I'm sorry, man.

503
00:27:38,102 --> 00:27:41,688
You look just like this guy my best friend
used to go to Stanford with.

504
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,232
Oh, Sorry, I went to Penn.

505
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:47,651
- I'll take it as a compliment.
- You shouldn't actually.

506
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:49,906
Because this guy Bryce
was a real douche.

507
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,755
He got Chuck kicked out of Stanford,
he ruined his life.

508
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:56,543
I don't know why he'd do that to
the nicest guy in the world, you know?

509
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,845
- Anyhow, happy holidays.
- Jeff and Lester.

510
00:27:59,017 --> 00:28:00,428
They can't do it. They're hiding.

511
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:09,408
The CIA pickup is here.
Chuck, do your pass.

512
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:32,282
Hi. Welcome to Buy More.

513
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:38,458
Hey, hey, nothing happened. Nothing
happened. There were no flashes.

514
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,259
So the CIA guys are legit.

515
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:49,100
Can anybody help us?

516
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,947
- What are you guys doing?
- Dude, it is not safe out there.

517
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,913
- Someone touched me.
- I don't care.

518
00:28:55,082 --> 00:28:56,625
You both have jobs to do.

519
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,463
<i>- Yeah?
Morgan?</i>

520
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:01,792
<i>Registers are down.
I need Jeff up there to fix them.</i>

521
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:03,798
All right. I'm on it, boss man.

522
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:06,014
- Jeff, the registers are down.
- No.

523
00:29:06,186 --> 00:29:07,848
- I can't do it, man.
- Dude, you have to.

524
00:29:08,023 --> 00:29:11,726
You're old enough to understand how
registers work. They're from the '80s.

525
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:13,816
- I can't.
- Listen to me, you're scared.

526
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:17,531
I'm scared, we're all scared.
But the store is depending on you.

527
00:29:17,707 --> 00:29:20,416
If people can't check out, people
can't leave, more will fill in.

528
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:24,008
- Lf more people fill in, Jeff...
- The store will explode.

529
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:26,506
- The store will explode!
- I gotta get them out of here!

530
00:29:26,684 --> 00:29:29,223
No, Jeff, no. No, it's a trick!

531
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:32,607
Excuse me, sir? Can I help you?

532
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,488
Yes, thank you.

533
00:29:34,657 --> 00:29:37,328
These HD screens
almost look like the real thing.

534
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:39,824
Yeah, they do, huh?

535
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:44,582
You know,
I didn't mean to offend you last night.

536
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,588
About living with your sister.

537
00:29:46,763 --> 00:29:49,683
Sarah told me about your team,
what you've done together.

538
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:52,726
- And you're still the super spy, right?
- That's nothing.

539
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:54,895
I got one friend in this world.

540
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:58,819
You got a home
and a store full of them.

541
00:30:00,373 --> 00:30:03,329
So, what happens now, Bryce?
You just disappear all over again?

542
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:04,916
It's what I do well.

543
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,460
Thanks, Chuck.

544
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:10,013
For everything.

545
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:16,235
Yeah. You're welcome.

546
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:20,029
I'm taking him in, Chuck.
You stay here.

547
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,484
Right.

548
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:25,785
Stay in the store, Chuck.

549
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,349
Are we good?

550
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:39,984
Yeah, we're clear.

551
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:43,364
No, us.

552
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:48,209
I thought you were dead, Bryce.

553
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,960
Come back with me.

554
00:30:50,802 --> 00:30:52,547
I have my assignment.

555
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:56,391
You were never good at this.

556
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:58,771
The saying-your-feelings part.

557
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:02,193
Well, I don't like to talk much.

558
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,791
Excuse me. Can I get some service?

559
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:16,429
You're Charles Bartowski, aren't you?

560
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:18,180
We met the other day.

561
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:20,434
Did we?

562
00:31:20,817 --> 00:31:24,486
- So how can I, uh... How can I help you?
- I'm looking for a computer.

563
00:31:24,658 --> 00:31:27,781
You might be familiar with this one.
It was called the Intersect.

564
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:41,262
<i>You don't seem to understand
the situation, Charles.</i>

565
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,977
Think these witnesses are a guarantee
that nothing's gonna happen to you?

566
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:47,732
You couldn't be more wrong.

567
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,534
Um, I... I am so slammed right now.

568
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,833
It's really busy.
So I should get back to work.

569
00:31:53,004 --> 00:31:56,292
My team reacquired Bryce Larkin
and Sarah Walker five minutes ago.

570
00:31:56,468 --> 00:31:58,926
I have seven trained killers stationed
throughout the store.

571
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:00,760
If you look over there...

572
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:04,104
...you can also see that my men
have neutralized Mr. Casey.

573
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:05,557
See, here's the thing, Charles.

574
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:08,656
Nothing stops me
from fulfilling my orders.

575
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:10,950
Innocents, civilians.

576
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:12,666
If you make me...

577
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:16,455
...I'll execute every last person
in this place.

578
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,274
It's done.

579
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:33,617
Yeah, we'll need about two minutes
to broom the area.

580
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:43,098
- Where is he?
Who?

581
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:45,676
- Their boss, Tommy.
- Chuck.

582
00:32:53,577 --> 00:32:55,370
Chuck, the registers are down.

583
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:57,784
I can't get them back up.
What should I do?

584
00:32:57,962 --> 00:33:00,121
Say more than one word,
and I'll kill him right here.

585
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,971
- Pineapple.
- Oh!

586
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:08,478
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey.

587
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:10,980
Pineapple.

588
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,191
Dude, don't say that word. It doesn't
have meaning if you keep joking with it.

589
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,079
No. I didn't say it.

590
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:18,364
Chuck did.

591
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:19,954
- Chuck?
- Chuck.

592
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:26,044
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have an emergency.

593
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:29,596
I need everyone to leave the store
in an orderly fashion.

594
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:31,682
Anna, pineapple.

595
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:43,291
Oh! Ah!

596
00:33:45,552 --> 00:33:47,510
Grimes.

597
00:34:13,229 --> 00:34:15,604
Hey, it's a mistake! Hey, hey, no!

598
00:34:15,776 --> 00:34:17,057
The store is not on fire!

599
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:18,649
No!

600
00:34:34,353 --> 00:34:35,896
I got you. I got you.

601
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:38,522
Morgan, what are you doing?

602
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:40,689
- Put me down.
- I will not put you down.

603
00:34:40,865 --> 00:34:42,943
Morgan, put me down!

604
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,372
Code Black. Hostiles in the Buy More.

605
00:34:49,549 --> 00:34:52,089
I need a containment team right away.

606
00:34:53,431 --> 00:34:55,556
Are you kidding me?
Some kid could find this.

607
00:35:03,324 --> 00:35:05,070
- Lock the doors.
- Let's go.

608
00:35:06,456 --> 00:35:07,951
Seal the video section.

609
00:35:11,382 --> 00:35:13,922
Stay down, Chuck.
This is when the shooting starts.

610
00:35:15,055 --> 00:35:17,133
Right... Right now?

611
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:12,532
Wow.

612
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:14,907
They really are great.

613
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,471
Come on, Chuck.

614
00:36:22,642 --> 00:36:25,730
I'm getting sick and tired of getting
hauled around by you all the time.

615
00:36:27,276 --> 00:36:28,737
- Where's Chuck?
- Over here.

616
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:32,612
Let him go. Now.

617
00:36:32,786 --> 00:36:34,616
Does this look like my first time?

618
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,284
Isn't it somebody else's turn
to be the human shield?

619
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:38,625
Stay there, Bryce.

620
00:36:39,215 --> 00:36:41,294
- You all right?
- Does it look like I'm all right?

621
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:43,678
- I need to ask you something.
- Shoot.

622
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:45,048
Not you, please.

623
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:56,161
Sorry, Chuck.

624
00:36:58,795 --> 00:37:00,706
Hi.
Unh.

625
00:37:00,882 --> 00:37:02,343
What did you say to him?

626
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,887
Ask him.

627
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,800
Chuck. Hi, Chuck, Chuck.

628
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:10,683
Chuck, come on. Wake up.
Come on. Hey.

629
00:37:15,994 --> 00:37:17,109
Yes.

630
00:37:17,288 --> 00:37:18,998
Yes.

631
00:37:20,127 --> 00:37:21,540
I am wearing a vest.

632
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:28,716
That stings a little bit.

633
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:36,529
Seriously, that is not fair...

634
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,117
...to not tell someone how much
a bulletproof vest still hurts!

635
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,621
NSA. Nobody move.

636
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:44,921
Hey, stand down. He's one of us.

637
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:47,216
- All right, let's go.
Secure the perimeter.

638
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:55,816
Begin a route.

639
00:38:05,505 --> 00:38:07,167
Dude.
What?

640
00:38:07,342 --> 00:38:09,135
Why did you just carry Anna out?

641
00:38:09,304 --> 00:38:11,797
She could've just walked. No?

642
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:13,804
- Sorry about that.
Morgan.

643
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,438
- You passed.
- I passed?

644
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,105
Grimes!

645
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:22,736
You just ruined the most important
shopping day of the year. For what?

646
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:24,873
- Do you know what you are, Grimes?
- No.

647
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:27,286
- What?
- There was a gas leak in the store.

648
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:28,840
- Gas?
- Yes, sir.

649
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:31,252
Whoever evacuated it
probably saved a lot of people.

650
00:38:31,972 --> 00:38:33,468
It'll take a few hours to clean up...

651
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:37,228
...we'd appreciate if you keep everybody
out until we say give you the say-so.

652
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:43,820
Is this straight? Does it look good?

653
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:49,959
What are we gonna do?

654
00:38:50,132 --> 00:38:52,340
Relax, Chuck.
These are NSA cleaners.

655
00:38:52,512 --> 00:38:54,590
They'll have Buy More back to normal
in a jiffy.

656
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:58,933
What's happening with Bryce?
- He's in giving his report to Beckman.

657
00:39:10,337 --> 00:39:13,210
- It'd appear I have a new assignment.
- As a maître d'?

658
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:17,088
Actually, it's a consulate dinner.
They want me to go after Fulcrum.

659
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:19,012
On my own, off the radar.

660
00:39:19,187 --> 00:39:21,099
Oh, sounds like heaven.

661
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,687
It means Bryce Larkin is dead.

662
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,148
And he's going to stay that way
this time.

663
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:28,448
Goodbye, Chuck.

664
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:30,700
This is so weird.

665
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:32,705
Where are you gonna go?
Who are you gonna be?

666
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,456
Sorry. Not even you can know.

667
00:39:37,638 --> 00:39:38,885
Sarah.

668
00:39:40,937 --> 00:39:42,137
We'll always have Omaha.

669
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:57,592
- Hey.
- What?

670
00:39:57,761 --> 00:39:59,885
Um, we have some turkey leftovers.

671
00:40:00,057 --> 00:40:02,135
Actually, we have a lot
of turkey leftovers.

672
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:05,434
I was wondering if I could interest you
in some sandwiches or something?

673
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,568
- Thanks, but work to do.
- Right.

674
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,231
- Right, okay, then.
- Okay.

675
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,412
- Hey, uh, Casey, Casey, Casey.
- Yeah?

676
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:15,244
Sorry.

677
00:40:16,421 --> 00:40:18,880
What did Bryce mean by Omaha?

678
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:23,179
<i>Outside of it being
some weird Casablanca reference?</i>

679
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:25,975
Probably a code.
Contact point of some sort.

680
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:29,185
Okay, why would Sarah need that?

681
00:40:29,362 --> 00:40:30,989
Bryce is going deep, Chuck.

682
00:40:31,158 --> 00:40:32,987
No calls home, no messages out.

683
00:40:33,162 --> 00:40:35,785
If Sarah wants to join up with him,
she has to do it now.

684
00:40:36,794 --> 00:40:37,958
Sarah's leaving?

685
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:39,704
But don't worry, Chuck.

686
00:40:39,882 --> 00:40:41,758
Sarah's gone,
we'll get you a new girl.

687
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:49,690
Oh, man.

688
00:40:50,153 --> 00:40:51,482
This is great. Right?

689
00:40:51,655 --> 00:40:53,614
Two buddies,
couple of cold turkey sandwiches...

690
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,075
...and all the mayo you could want.

691
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:57,957
You all right?
