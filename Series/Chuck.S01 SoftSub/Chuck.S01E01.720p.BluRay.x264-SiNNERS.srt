1
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:16,783
Morgan, this is a bad idea.
We can't stay here, Chuck.

2
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:20,525
I'm uncomfortable with the plan.
What plan? This is survival.

3
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:23,864
We've been compromised. I'm a ghost.

4
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:27,364
Morgan, you can't leave me like this.
You can't do this to me, man.

5
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:29,482
Chuck, what are you doing?

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,192
Uh, escaping.

7
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:33,446
From your own birthday party.

8
00:00:33,657 --> 00:00:34,984
Hey, Ellie.

9
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:38,521
Wow, you look fantastic.

10
00:00:38,698 --> 00:00:40,569
Uh, you know, sis, the thing is...

11
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:44,145
...Morgan and I don't really feel
like we're fitting in...

12
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:46,317
...at my birthday party.

13
00:00:46,487 --> 00:00:49,271
Because we don't know anybody.

14
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:52,810
Because they're all your friends
and they all happen to be doctors.

15
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:56,149
Yeah, doctors
who don't really get our jokes.

16
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:59,269
- Well, your jokes.
- Okay, my jokes.

17
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:04,188
Chuck, I have invited real,
live women for you.

18
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,597
So please, let's go.

19
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:08,895
Morgan, you stay here.

20
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:13,722
- Need a hand, buddy?
- No, no, no, I'm okay. I'm all right.

21
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,105
Birthday boy, come with me.

22
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:23,884
We're gonna be social.
You are funny, smart, handsome.

23
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,812
- Thank you. There's Captain Awesome.
- Please don't call him that.

24
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,509
Okay, I've identified some candidates
for Chuck, and they are awesome.

25
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:32,635
Let me introduce you to Chuck,
Ellie's brother.

26
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:35,471
Hi. We've heard so much about you.
Are you in a costume?

27
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:37,468
No, I work for the Nerd Herd.

28
00:01:37,643 --> 00:01:41,008
Nerd Herd? That is so cute.
What do you really wanna do?

29
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,180
Working on my five-year plan.
Just need a font.

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,388
What happened here?
Did you hurt your hand?

31
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,796
No, no, it's, ahh, from "Call of Duty. "

32
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,640
The controller chafes
after several hours.

33
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:53,632
- Ellie said you went to Stanford.
- Yes, that's technically correct.

34
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,305
I graduated in '02.

35
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:57,215
- What was your major?
- Engineering.

36
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:59,088
Oh, my God. I knew this great guy.

37
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:03,511
He was an engineer. Um, he ran track.
And I think he was a gymnast too.

38
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:05,835
- Bryce Larkin. He was my roommate.
Oh, yes.

39
00:02:06,054 --> 00:02:08,256
- What's he doing now?
- I think he's an accountant.

40
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:09,458
Oh.

41
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,045
It's hard to say goodbye.

42
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,253
<i>COMPUTER
Security breach:</i>

43
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:43,246
<i>Data Vault.</i>

44
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:56,286
- So do you have a girlfriend?
- Ahh, no.

45
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,911
- I did, a while back at Stanford.
Oh.

46
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,702
Yeah. Her name was Jill.
We met freshman year.

47
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:03,994
Oh, that was a while back.

48
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:07,116
I remember when I met Jill, I was...
Uh, it was in Economics class.

49
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:10,329
I was walking across the quad
and she had dropped her bag.

50
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:13,200
And I was, like, rushing to, heh...
To go and pick it up for her.

51
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,244
And, uh, we kind of, like,
did that whole...

52
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:17,699
Like in a cartoon,
kind of bumped heads and...

53
00:03:17,913 --> 00:03:20,317
There was a whole gang of us,
Jill and Bryce.

54
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:22,612
We had so much in common then.

55
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:25,992
How's he doing?

56
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:27,816
Not awesome.

57
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:31,987
So there I was.
Jill with Bryce, me on a train home.

58
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,778
I guess she thought
he was more exciting.

59
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:42,854
Larkin is in the vault.
Larkin, open the door.

60
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:44,773
You have three seconds.
We can compromise.

61
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:46,779
Blow the door. Okay, let's go.

62
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:50,688
Larkin.

63
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,397
Freeze.

64
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,191
Stop right there.

65
00:04:06,902 --> 00:04:08,145
Larkin!

66
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:23,688
Turn right.

67
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,395
Larkin, stop.

68
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:40,685
<i>Larkin is on the roof. All units, converge.</i>

69
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:44,804
<i>I repeat, Larkin is on the roof.
All units, converge.</i>

70
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:19,259
Don't move.

71
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:23,832
Too late, Casey.

72
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:37,834
Thanks for my party.

73
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:40,790
Your seven-layer dip? Tasted like eight.

74
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:44,495
- Chuck, can I tell you something?
- It really was eight layers?

75
00:05:44,673 --> 00:05:48,664
Even though we may ask, no woman
wants to hear about an old girlfriend.

76
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:51,290
It's depressing, okay?
Stanford was five years ago.

77
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:53,997
You need to move on. It's time.

78
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,538
Do we have to have
this conversation again?

79
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,120
We've rehearsed it enough.

80
00:05:58,294 --> 00:06:01,492
Right. Well, I'll get over Jill tomorrow.

81
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,073
Hey there.

82
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,077
Seems like everybody
had a really good time, huh?

83
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:12,497
I know I did.

84
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,033
Super.

85
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:19,779
Cheer up, Chuck. You can talk
to some women. You know, it's a start.

86
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:23,947
Wow. A blast-from-the-past wow.

87
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:26,953
- Bryce remembered your birthday, dude.
- What?

88
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,118
Got you kicked out of school,
stole your girl?

89
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:32,491
Yeah, Morgan.
I think I remember Bryce.

90
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:36,323
All right, well, what, uh...?
What do we got here?

91
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:39,200
Huh.
What is it?

92
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:42,189
"Zork. " Remember "Zork,"
the old text-based video game?

93
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:46,313
Bryce and I programmed our own version
of it back at Stanford using a TRS-80.

94
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:48,446
Wow, you guys were really cool.

95
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:52,609
Yeah, if I could only remember
what was in my hero's satchel.

96
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:55,688
The weapons I would use
to kill the terrible troll.

97
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:58,103
Right. You know what?
You're still really cool.

98
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,070
And, uh, you're going home.

99
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:02,027
- Is it that time?
- It's that time.

100
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:03,689
Right.

101
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,856
- Pedal safe.
Thank you.

102
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:16,233
Attack troll with nasty knife.

103
00:08:08,932 --> 00:08:10,388
Chuck.

104
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:14,383
Chuck.

105
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:19,337
Dude.

106
00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:20,840
Dude.

107
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:22,589
Are you okay?

108
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:23,881
Morgan?

109
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:26,132
Yeah, man. Yeah, it's me.

110
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:27,381
What happened?

111
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:30,219
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

112
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,921
You okay?

113
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,673
Did you spike the punch?

114
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:38,500
Something goes wrong, you blame me.

115
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,424
After all these years, where's the trust?
Yes, I did.

116
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,669
<i>The 101 is clear at Universal City.</i>

117
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,253
<i>Watch for delays near Burbank Airport.
Security's checking all vehicles.</i>

118
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:53,994
<i>Got a stickler on the I-605
San Gabriel River Freeway.</i>

119
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:57,703
<i>A fender-bender on the I-5 Freeway,
northbound from 91 Freeway to...</i>

120
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,830
So I'm playing Xbox and I'm like,
"Dude, let me get the sniper rifle. "

121
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:03,492
Guy won't give me the sniper rifle.
I need a frag grenade...

122
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:04,831
Morgan, Morgan, Morgan.

123
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,289
As much as I would love
to talk video games with you...

124
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:09,332
...I've got a really splitting headache.
- Oh.

125
00:09:09,502 --> 00:09:12,583
You know what, can you do me a favor?
You mind driving?

126
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:16,365
Whoa, whoa. Are you being serious?
You're gonna let me drive.

127
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,823
It's a company car, Morgan.
It's not that big a deal.

128
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:21,204
Whoa, it's not just a company car,
okay?

129
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,997
A hooptie's a hooptie, homeboy.

130
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,991
I mean, this baby's sitting on chrome.
Or plastic.

131
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:30,200
Do me a favor and stay off the 5, okay?
The cops are in phased deployment.

132
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:37,032
Okay. Thanks for the tip, Ponch.

133
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:44,691
Fellow Nerds,
today is going to be a very bad day.

134
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:46,859
We've got new computer virus
on our hands.

135
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:50,281
They're calling this one
the Irene Demova virus.

136
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:54,776
Ha, ha, ha. Yes, yes.
It's named after the Serbian porn star.

137
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,691
Lonely dude call volume will be high.

138
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:59,272
This is a nasty one, kids.
It's a computer-killer.

139
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:03,436
Last night, the display version
of our Prism Express laptop was fried...

140
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:06,323
...when someone...
Excuse me, I...

141
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,361
- decided to enter
Miss Demova's website.

142
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,563
Anna, close the eyes.
This is what happens.

143
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,817
<i>Oh, this sexy.</i>

144
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,061
<i>Am I sexy?</i>

145
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:17,860
<i>Am I sexy...?</i>

146
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:24,728
Sorry, Chuck. She drives me crazy.

147
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:26,727
But that's love.

148
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,188
Ahh, if you'll please just ignore
dirty Uncle Morgan...

149
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,230
<i>The former commander of NA TO...</i>

150
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,019
<i>...I think everything...
... is set to arrive in Los Angeles...</i>

151
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:36,478
<i>...to deliver a speech
before the security league.</i>

152
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,852
...will be...

153
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:40,772
<i>The general
has drawn fire for his criticism...</i>

154
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,137
...normal.

155
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:45,721
<i>General Stanfield,
the former allied commander of NA TO...</i>

156
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:47,722
<i>His report has been
politically motivated.</i>

157
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,888
He's already here, he landed last night.

158
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:51,888
<i>Anonymous sources
inside the Pentagon...</i>

159
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:53,638
Who's already here, Chuckles?

160
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:57,141
<i>...are trying to stop tomorrow night's
speech from happening and its text...</i>

161
00:10:57,311 --> 00:10:58,685
I don't know.

162
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:02,175
<i>Of course, we'll have
updates for you as events unfold.</i>

163
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,802
Bryce Larkin was CIA, Graham.

164
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:09,176
- He was one of your agents.
And it was NSA's job to find him.

165
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:11,263
To question him, not to kill him.

166
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:13,430
Thanks to Rambo here,
we've got nothing.

167
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,087
No, you got a dead CIA agent.

168
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:17,674
That's gold star in my book.

169
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,300
- Lf this gets out...
- It won't.

170
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:21,551
- Nobody asked you.
- Actually, they did.

171
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,513
Major Casey is heading up
this investigation.

172
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:26,179
So, what was Bryce after?

173
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:27,969
What did this computer do?

174
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:31,219
Well, this computer did everything.

175
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:36,422
<i>After 9l11, the NSA and the CIA
were told to play nice.</i>

176
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:38,632
Share their intel. This is how we did it.

177
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:41,087
Every scrap of data we had
went into this computer.

178
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:44,008
<i>It mined for patterns in the chatter...</i>

179
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:45,254
<i>...saw things we didn't.</i>

180
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:47,837
<i>The data was encrypted
into thousands of images.</i>

181
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:52,001
<i>Whoever received Larkin's e-mail
got all of our secrets.</i>

182
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:53,999
Find those secrets, Casey.

183
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,126
Found this on Larkin.

184
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,256
Hard drive's fried,
but we picked up a trace signature.

185
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:03,545
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

186
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:06,746
Which is perfect.
Been feeling a little pasty.

187
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:19,283
Stop the presses. Who is that?
Vicki Vale.

188
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:21,291
<i>Vicky Vale
Vick... Va-Vicky Vale</i>

189
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,243
<i>Vickity-vickity Vicki Vale
Vick... Va-Vicky Vale...</i>

190
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,534
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- No, not at all.

191
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,029
<i>- Uh, that's from... It's from Batman.
- Because that makes it better.</i>

192
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:36,996
Ahh, hi. Hey, I'm Morgan.
And this is, uh, Chuck.

193
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:39,776
Wow, I didn't think people
still named their kids Chuck.

194
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:41,911
Or, uh, Morgan, for that matter.

195
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:43,365
My parents are sadists.

196
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:45,410
And carnival freaks
found him in a dumpster.

197
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,114
But they raised me
as one of their own.

198
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,611
- How can I help you...?
- Sarah.

199
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,326
- Sarah.
- I'm here about this.

200
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:54,941
Oh, yeah, the IntelliCell.
Yeah. Absolutely.

201
00:12:55,119 --> 00:13:00,783
Uh, this model has a little screw
that pops loose right in the back here.

202
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:05,733
You just go ahead and give it a couple
of quick turns and good as new.

203
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:07,152
No problem.

204
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:09,065
Wow, you geeks are good.

205
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:12,603
- Nerds, I'd say nerds probably more...
- It's no big deal.

206
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:14,364
Yeah, you know, Nerd Herd.

207
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,569
Excuse me, excuse me.
I have an emergency.

208
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:19,778
I don't know what I did wrong,
but I shot the entire recital...

209
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:21,440
...but, um, now it won't play back.

210
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:25,150
Okay. Okay, we'll just take a look.

211
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:27,318
And you don't have a tape in here.

212
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:29,684
- But it's digital.
- Oh, boy.

213
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:32,645
Right, yes,
but you still need digital tape.

214
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,438
Oh, no.

215
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,772
Her mom's gonna kill me.

216
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:40,936
Uh, Morgan, I need the wall.

217
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,939
It's yours.

218
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:44,894
I'm so sorry.

219
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:47,103
Okay, this way.

220
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:49,222
Are you ready?

221
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:50,595
What's wrong?

222
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:52,515
I'm usually in the back row.

223
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,224
- Why?
- I'm too tall.

224
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:57,269
I block the other ballerinas.

225
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,973
Can I tell a secret?
You can't tell the other girls.

226
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:04,221
Real ballerinas are tall.

227
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:32,095
Did you get it? Did it work?

228
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:37,632
- Chuck.
- Hi, Harry.

229
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:39,794
We'll be back up and running
in five minutes.

230
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,167
Five minutes?

231
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:44,093
Do you know what five minutes
means in Buy More dollars?

232
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:46,966
I didn't realize
we had our own currency.

233
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,759
I'm sorry about all the commotion.

234
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:51,878
We are not stock boys anymore, Chuck.
We are leaders.

235
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:54,752
Buy More leaders.

236
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,666
And you wonder why Big Mike
wants me for assistant manager.

237
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:02,746
There's an open position?
Big Mike didn't tell me.

238
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:04,044
And why should he?

239
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:06,620
He knows you won't leave
the comfort of the Herd.

240
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:16,411
Chuck, dude.

241
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:18,045
She left you her card.

242
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:20,996
Yes.

243
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,583
Why wouldn't you call this girl?

244
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:28,500
- Oh, I don't know. Did you see her?
- Yes. Oh, man, yes.

245
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:31,156
I'm gonna repeat the question:
Why wouldn't you call?

246
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:35,078
Because I live on planet Earth, Morgan.
Why are you following me home?

247
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,287
Aw, come... Hey, we're buddies.

248
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,780
We're gonna go do friend things and...

249
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:42,280
I need to use your computer.
Mine's still acting up.

250
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:44,282
Ah, heh, heh. Irene Demova?

251
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:49,243
Oh, so beautiful and so deadly.

252
00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:51,329
Yeah.

253
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,822
You gotta understand, this is what
I've been telling I don't know how long...

254
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:00,486
Please, not the computer.

255
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,649
Hyah!

256
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:15,401
Come on, Chuck, do something.

257
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:20,693
Give me the...

258
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:29,601
That's my friend.

259
00:16:34,404 --> 00:16:36,856
Okay, look,
he's not that good of a friend.

260
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,395
Didn't you hang that shelf?

261
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:58,395
Damn it.

262
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:08,056
Now, I've been through it.
It's dead, it's totally fried.

263
00:17:08,646 --> 00:17:10,637
This hard drive was...

264
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:11,967
...murdered.

265
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:14,592
What if you were the target
of a ninja vendetta...

266
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:17,762
...and he returns tonight
to strangle you with his nun-chuks?

267
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,142
That's super, Jeff.

268
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,384
Thanks for thinking outside the box
on that one.

269
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,343
And here I thought
I couldn't get any more freaked out.

270
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:32,839
I'm gonna go buy some new locks
next door at Large Mart.

271
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:52,048
Oh, thank God. Uh, excuse me, sir?

272
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:54,465
Do you know where they sell the...?

273
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:03,173
What do you want?

274
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:07,205
Um, no, sorry. Sorry, nothing.

275
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:09,416
Nothing at all. Just... I was, ahh...

276
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:11,831
Oh, the... Wow, look at that.

277
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,455
Oh, God.

278
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,239
Oh, my God. Thank God.

279
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:08,239
Listen, there's a guy here. He's trying
to do something, I don't know.

280
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:10,989
Call the cops, security,
the guy checking receipts.

281
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:13,488
<i>- What kind of guy?
- Scary, kind of a Terminator vibe.</i>

282
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,492
- Stubble, red hair.
- Black leather jacket?

283
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,822
Yes, yes.

284
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,157
Like that guy?

285
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,938
I have eyes on him right now.

286
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,943
Like I said, the computer
was destroyed beyond repair.

287
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:57,358
Okay, it's done.
I want you in the air in an hour.

288
00:19:57,942 --> 00:20:01,307
<i>- Lf he has an external drive, a backup?
It's over, Sarah.</i>

289
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:03,480
<i>The NSA is stepping in.</i>

290
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:06,931
<i>Bryce was CIA.
He was our guy, and he burned us.</i>

291
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,058
Casey's on his way out.

292
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:11,724
You're being recalled.

293
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:14,354
Because of Casey.

294
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:16,933
<i>He's a burnout.
- He's a killer, Sarah.</i>

295
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:18,810
Cold school.

296
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:20,471
<i>I want you to listen to me.</i>

297
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,258
Whatever happened with Bryce,
you couldn't have known...

298
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:25,059
<i>...you couldn't have stopped.</i>

299
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:26,389
But I can fix it.

300
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:29,469
<i>If there's a backup, I'll find it.
Just give me 12 hours.</i>

301
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:35,173
I'm losing my mind.
I'm losing my mind.

302
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,678
I'm losing my mind.

303
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:41,139
Morgan, not now.

304
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,471
Hi. Hi.

305
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,091
Uh, phone trouble again?

306
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:52,921
Uh, yeah. I'm not sure
I'm able to receive calls...

307
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:55,046
...because I never got one from you.

308
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:58,592
Man, she got...

309
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:01,294
I'm sorry I left so quickly yesterday.

310
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,255
I had an appointment with a realtor.
I just moved here.

311
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,625
- Welcome.
Thanks.

312
00:21:06,802 --> 00:21:09,965
And, uh, I don't really
know anyone here.

313
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:12,755
I was wondering
if you would show me around.

314
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,539
That is, if you're free.

315
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:19,329
Oh, he's free. He's got nothing
but time on his hands.

316
00:21:19,508 --> 00:21:24,045
He is very available and you guys
are gonna have a great time.

317
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:27,046
What's that, sir, Xerox machines?
Yeah, I'm on it.

318
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:30,204
Apparently, my schedule is wide open.

319
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:33,246
Great.

320
00:21:47,752 --> 00:21:49,244
<i>You're very suspicious.</i>

321
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:51,289
- Hey, Chuck.
- Ellie, captain.

322
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:53,615
Don't freak out, remain calm.

323
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,414
I have some news.

324
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,910
Chuck's got a date.

325
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:58,783
What? Who?

326
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,202
Way to go, Chuck. That's awesome.

327
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:03,445
Oh, God.

328
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,281
- What are you gonna wear?
- Eh.

329
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:13,366
<i>So, Sarah...</i>

330
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:15,826
...she's nice? Pretty?

331
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:19,195
Yeah. Actually, Morgan met her online
in this kind of chat room.

332
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:20,987
- I'm totally kidding.
- Try it on.

333
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:23,444
Honestly...
- I'm a girl.

334
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:26,107
I know what girls like.
- I'll go change.

335
00:23:00,403 --> 00:23:01,645
Chuck.

336
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,811
- Hey, these are leftover from the party.
- Oh, okay.

337
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:09,475
And, um, don't forget
about the old-girlfriend rule.

338
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,103
Right, got it. No mention of Jill.

339
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:15,935
Aces, Charles. You're aces.

340
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,389
A Dad quote. I'm impressed.

341
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,186
- Love you, sis.
- I love you. Have fun.

342
00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:24,560
I will. I'll try.

343
00:23:28,812 --> 00:23:30,389
Just...

344
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:33,311
- They grow up so fast, you know? And...
- Go home, Morgan.

345
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:36,430
Just go home. Go home.

346
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:38,220
He's picking me up for a date.

347
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:40,759
<i>You're on your own
on this one, Sarah.</i>

348
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:42,931
I can't help you
if something goes wrong.

349
00:23:43,143 --> 00:23:44,765
I didn't know about this guy, Graham.

350
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:47,463
Nice guys aren't sent
government secrets.

351
00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:53,514
What should I do if he runs?

352
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,214
Kill him.

353
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:16,467
Yeah, I live with my sister
and her boyfriend, Captain Awesome.

354
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,625
No. Ha, ha.
- It's true, though.

355
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:21,503
So wait.
You call him "Captain Awesome"?

356
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:23,796
Yeah, wait till you meet him.

357
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,008
Everything he does is awesome.

358
00:24:26,176 --> 00:24:28,663
Climbing mountains,
jumping out of planes, flossing.

359
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:30,002
That's funny.

360
00:24:30,216 --> 00:24:31,708
Well, I'm a funny guy.

361
00:24:31,924 --> 00:24:35,205
Clearly. Which is good,
because I am not funny.

362
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:36,459
Is that your secret?

363
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:39,747
Because I've been sitting here trying
to figure out what's wrong with you.

364
00:24:39,922 --> 00:24:41,462
Oh, plenty. Believe me.

365
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:44,455
I was thinking, "Either she's a cannibal
or she's not that funny. "

366
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:46,998
I was pulling for cannibal
because I never met one before.

367
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:49,077
Uh, not a cannibal.

368
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:51,374
But I did just come out
of a long relationship...

369
00:24:51,545 --> 00:24:53,369
...so I may come with baggage.

370
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:56,537
Well, I could be
your very own baggage handler.

371
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,367
Uh, so the guy, the ex, the guy.

372
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,413
The ex is the reason
you moved here from...?

373
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:05,827
- Uh, D.C.
- Right.

374
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,743
Yeah, after I realized that
all of my friends were his friends...

375
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:13,116
...and that everything about Washington
reminded me of Bruce...

376
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:15,742
...I needed change.

377
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:19,159
- A big one.
- Bruce, yeah.

378
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:22,945
You give me crap for being Chuck
and you went out with a Bruce.

379
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,661
That's nice. That's real good.

380
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:29,034
So, what about you? What skeletons
do you have in your closet?

381
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:32,488
Any secrets? Any women?

382
00:25:33,618 --> 00:25:35,276
Uh, yeah.

383
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:40,652
Yeah, actually. Well, back in college,
there was someone.

384
00:25:43,117 --> 00:25:44,608
Actually, that's all over with now...

385
00:25:44,782 --> 00:25:47,069
...and her restraining orders
are very specific.

386
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:49,645
So...

387
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:50,985
I like you, Chuck.

388
00:25:57,238 --> 00:25:58,944
So where are we going?

389
00:25:59,112 --> 00:26:00,938
Well, do you like music?

390
00:26:01,112 --> 00:26:02,391
I guess.

391
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:05,105
Ha-ha-ha. You guess?
What's your favorite band?

392
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:09,600
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

393
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,892
God, I'm not funny.
I don't listen to music.

394
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:15,149
This must be
your worst date ever, right?

395
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,897
I was waiting for you to say no.

396
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:33,224
Sorry. Sorry, I kind
of zoned out there for a second.

397
00:26:33,397 --> 00:26:34,675
No, no, no. God, no.

398
00:26:34,855 --> 00:26:37,806
I, uh... I've had much, much worse...

399
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,640
Ahh, much worse dates, experiences,
overall with women.

400
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:43,684
- In 11 th grade, actually.
- Eleventh grade?

401
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:46,423
Oh, you have to go back that far?

402
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:48,676
- Come on.
- I really don't date all that much.

403
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:57,182
Chuck Bartowski's your mark.

404
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,884
NSA director wants him with a pulse.

405
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:03,837
Till we find out who he's working with
and what he knows, he lives.

406
00:27:04,016 --> 00:27:06,338
The CIA skirt, you can kill.

407
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:28,625
- They're good.
- Good.

408
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:30,383
Good.

409
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,373
- Let's dance.
- I'm not really a dancer.

410
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,618
Hey, where's the fire?
Chuck, give me your keys.

411
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:47,231
I don't mean to be old-fashioned,
but the company only wants employee...

412
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:49,399
...Nerds, driving the Nerd Herd mobile.

413
00:28:49,617 --> 00:28:51,523
I mean, it's kind of, you know...

414
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,484
Get in the car.
- How did you get into my car?

415
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,612
Get in the car right now.

416
00:28:57,781 --> 00:28:59,191
Sarah.
Just get in.

417
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,608
What is going on?

418
00:29:06,364 --> 00:29:07,986
Please tell me what's going on.

419
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:11,355
Sarah, you're not even looking.

420
00:29:12,195 --> 00:29:14,766
Wait, who are these guys?
What do they want?

421
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,393
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

422
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:24,896
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.

423
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:29,518
Tell me when to turn.

424
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:33,096
Uh, left in five seconds.

425
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,349
- Your left or my left?
- What?

426
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,560
- Too late.
- Aah!

427
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:42,891
Oh, my God.

428
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:45,177
Whoa.

429
00:29:48,728 --> 00:29:50,186
Computer emergency.

430
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,640
Those men will hurt you. They're
from the NSA and they're after you.

431
00:29:59,852 --> 00:30:02,387
Me, why? Wait, why me? I'm nobody.

432
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,225
I'm the supervisor of a Nerd Herd
at a Buy More.

433
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:09,005
Maybe I'll be assistant store manager
and I don't even know if I want that job.

434
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,506
You know what,
that's not your problem.

435
00:30:11,683 --> 00:30:12,843
But that is.

436
00:30:21,347 --> 00:30:23,420
Back, back.

437
00:30:25,263 --> 00:30:29,042
Get out of the car.
Let's go, Chuck, move.

438
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:36,128
Sarah, look out.

439
00:30:49,173 --> 00:30:51,709
Sarah. Sarah.

440
00:30:52,632 --> 00:30:56,043
Request emergency air EVAC.
Track location, we're on foot.

441
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,127
Let's go.

442
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:01,580
How well do you know Bryce Larkin?

443
00:31:01,754 --> 00:31:04,123
What? How do you...?
How do you know Bryce?

444
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,871
We worked together at the CIA.

445
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:08,332
The what? The CIA?

446
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:10,872
Bryce is a spy? Bryce Larkin
from Connecticut is a spy?

447
00:31:11,044 --> 00:31:13,827
A rogue spy.
Did he try to contact you?

448
00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:16,539
I haven't heard from Bryce in the...

449
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,326
Wait, no. He sent me an e-mail.

450
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:24,078
Did you open it?

451
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,412
- Yeah, it was a line from "Zork. "
- What?

452
00:31:27,582 --> 00:31:29,702
Uh, "Zork. " It's a video game
that we used to play.

453
00:31:29,915 --> 00:31:33,612
It was a riddle, then I solved it
and there was pictures, lots of pictures.

454
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:35,109
You saw them?

455
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:41,404
Your computer, did you back it up?
Is there an external drive?

456
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:43,658
It crashed a week ago.
Wait, hold on a sec.

457
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,783
Was I not supposed
to look at those pictures?

458
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:50,525
Okay. I may have to aim my gun at you,
so just don't freak out.

459
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:52,491
Why?

460
00:31:54,243 --> 00:31:55,818
It's late. I'm tired.

461
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:02,571
Let's cut the crap and give him to me,
now. He belongs to the NSA.

462
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:04,947
The CIA gets him first.

463
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,395
You come any closer and I shoot.

464
00:32:10,322 --> 00:32:11,436
Sarah?

465
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:13,528
I'm freaking out.

466
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:20,694
You shoot him, I shoot you.

467
00:32:21,153 --> 00:32:23,902
I leave both your bodies here,
go out for a late snack.

468
00:32:24,112 --> 00:32:26,646
I'm thinking maybe pancakes.

469
00:32:28,027 --> 00:32:29,650
Chuck, no!

470
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:33,606
<i>Stanfield, the former allied...</i>

471
00:32:33,776 --> 00:32:35,516
<i>Stop tomorrow night's meeting from...</i>

472
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,767
They're gonna kill him.

473
00:32:46,606 --> 00:32:47,684
Kill who?

474
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:51,766
Stanfield, the general.
The general, Stanfield, the NATO guy.

475
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,893
Something is wrong with me, okay?

476
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:59,677
I don't know what it is. I'm remembering
things that I shouldn't know.

477
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,808
Okay, Chuck, talk to me. Like what?

478
00:33:01,978 --> 00:33:03,968
I don't know. For example, ahh...

479
00:33:04,144 --> 00:33:06,810
...there was a Serbian demolitions expert
at Large Mart today.

480
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,307
That's kind of odd, wouldn't you say?

481
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:12,094
Last week, the NSA,
you guys intercepted some blueprints.

482
00:33:12,268 --> 00:33:14,342
Blueprints of a hotel, that hotel.

483
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,089
And then the CIA, you guys found
a file of schematics of a bomb in Prague.

484
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:19,587
The bomb is in that hotel.

485
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:23,759
He was working with Bryce.

486
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:26,094
No, he opened Bryce's e-mail.

487
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:30,258
Those pictures you saw
were encoded with secrets.

488
00:33:30,472 --> 00:33:34,085
Government secrets.
If you saw them, then you know them.

489
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,963
- There were thousands of them.
Wait a minute.

490
00:33:37,178 --> 00:33:41,171
You're telling me all of our secrets
are in his head.

491
00:33:41,344 --> 00:33:44,093
Chuck is the computer.

492
00:33:44,844 --> 00:33:47,166
- What did you say, what's that mean?
- Listen to me.

493
00:33:47,343 --> 00:33:49,298
- Tell us where this bomb...
- What is happening?

494
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,381
You said there was a bomb.
Is there time to stop it?

495
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:54,424
- What? What, are you crazy?
- No, we're the good guys.

496
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,121
We get paid to keep bombs
from exploding.

497
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,254
Look, I can't help you.

498
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:01,621
Okay? I really wish that I could,
but I can't.

499
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:04,250
- Call Bryce, he can save the day.
- Bryce is dead.

500
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:08,913
He died sending those secrets to you.

501
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,374
Bryce is dead?

502
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:18,204
And he's gonna have a lot of company
unless you start talking.

503
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:20,576
So pretty please,
can we diffuse the bomb now?

504
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:26,286
According to the schedule,
the general's already on the stage.

505
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:30,825
It is our mission
to give our nation's diplomats...

506
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,696
...the military perspective
on world issues.

507
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:38,239
Now, maybe it was just because
I was a uniform...

508
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:43,236
Wait, Casey.
We can't take him in, he's too valuable.

509
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,246
Okay, Johnny Commodore.
Stay here but tell us where to go.

510
00:34:46,455 --> 00:34:48,196
- Uh, the easiest way?
- The fastest, Chuck.

511
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:50,328
The fastest. Got it.

512
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:52,447
Chuck, stop.

513
00:34:54,703 --> 00:34:56,112
Chuck, wait. Wait.

514
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:59,325
You know, it takes courage
to speak up, to take action.

515
00:34:59,536 --> 00:35:01,360
This way, this way.

516
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:03,572
It's through there. This way, this way.

517
00:35:09,534 --> 00:35:11,654
Chuck, where is it?

518
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:14,739
I don't... I don't...

519
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:17,650
What that means is
we simply shouldn't do it.

520
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:20,190
Well, I disagree.

521
00:35:20,364 --> 00:35:22,237
- During my time in Vietnam...
- That's it.

522
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:25,936
I met an exhilarating
young colonel. He theorized...

523
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:27,984
This... Yeah, right here.

524
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,401
- Oh, God.
- No time to evacuate. Ideas?

525
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:34,898
- Disconnect the laptop.
Auto-trigger. The cables?

526
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:36,443
No, definitely a trap.

527
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:38,726
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

528
00:35:39,735 --> 00:35:40,813
Ladies and gentlemen.

529
00:35:40,984 --> 00:35:45,191
We may have a cautionary situation here,
so we'll take a short break.

530
00:35:45,401 --> 00:35:48,433
Chuck, is there anything else
you remember about the bomb?

531
00:35:55,357 --> 00:35:57,229
- Hi, Morgan.
- Hey, how's it going?

532
00:35:57,399 --> 00:36:00,230
- Little busy right now, buddy.
- In a good way? Details.

533
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:03,892
- Why are you calling?
- I don't know.

534
00:36:04,063 --> 00:36:07,594
Laying on your bed, Ellie's with captain,
my computer got case of the Demova's.

535
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:10,519
<i>So I figured I'd check in. You won't...</i>

536
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:12,470
Okay, okay, I have an idea.

537
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,048
That's not an Xbox
and you're not an X-Man.

538
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:18,638
I understand that.
This is a Prism Express laptop, okay?

539
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,428
We sell this at our store.
It has a DOS override.

540
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,713
I think I can do this.
I can do this, please.

541
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:29,883
He's our best shot.

542
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:35,091
Go.

543
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:40,300
Mr. Bomb, meet Mr. Internet.

544
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:45,968
- He's searching for porn.
- Nn!

545
00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:50,962
<i>Oh, this sexy.
- Ew.</i>

546
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:53,747
<i>Am I sexy? Am I sexy...?</i>

547
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,006
You did it.

548
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,168
I did it.

549
00:37:09,006 --> 00:37:12,786
I did it. I diffused a real bomb.

550
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:15,203
Ha, ha. This is a real... I...

551
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:20,540
What if I was wrong?

552
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:24,294
Don't puke on the C-4, huh?

553
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:31,281
He's coming with me.

554
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,367
- What if this a fluke?
- What if it wasn't?

555
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:36,494
- What if he can stop something bigger?
- Fine, drop him in a psych tank.

556
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:39,618
Let him stare at four rubber walls.
He'll tell us what we wanna know.

557
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:42,280
We don't know how this works
and what triggers the memories.

558
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,744
- He'll crack wide open.
Not my job.

559
00:37:44,957 --> 00:37:48,488
- I break things, I don't fix them.
- What about his job and his friends?

560
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,655
And what do we do about his sister?

561
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,909
What about my sister?

562
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,030
- Nothing. We were just discuss...
- No, no, no, hold on a second.

563
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:58,657
You have to leave my family
and my friends out of this.

564
00:37:58,871 --> 00:38:00,067
We'll see.

565
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,490
Look, Bryce sent that e-mail to me.
I'm the one remembering your secrets.

566
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,859
Which means you have to listen to me,
both of you.

567
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,653
And right now...

568
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:12,359
...I'm gonna go home.

569
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:14,823
No, you're not.

570
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:20,024
You...

571
00:38:20,825 --> 00:38:22,530
You need me.

572
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,605
How long you been here?

573
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,438
All night.

574
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:04,222
There's nowhere I can run, is there?

575
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:06,518
Not from us.

576
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,471
Talk to me, Chuck.

577
00:39:14,522 --> 00:39:17,601
Yesterday, I was making
11 bucks an hour fixing computers.

578
00:39:17,812 --> 00:39:19,802
Now I have one in my brain...

579
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:24,551
...and I can't figure out
why Bryce did this, why he chose me.

580
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:27,683
What are you gonna do with me?

581
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:30,133
What happens now?

582
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:34,216
For now, you go back to your own life.

583
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:36,511
We'll protect you
and you'll work with us.

584
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:42,052
And my sister, my friends,
are they in danger?

585
00:39:42,264 --> 00:39:45,132
Do you know how worried I was?
I even called Morgan.

586
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:47,840
You get to go all the way?
Morgan, shut up.

587
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,091
What? I'm just...

588
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:53,550
Tell them nothing to keep them safe.

589
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:59,090
Early morning procedure, so...

590
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:01,546
Group hug, huh?

591
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:03,426
Mm.
Okay.

592
00:40:03,593 --> 00:40:05,383
Awesome.

593
00:40:07,134 --> 00:40:09,836
I need you to do
one more thing for me.

594
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:13,125
Yeah?

595
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:14,579
Trust me, Chuck.

596
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,534
Well, wish me luck.

597
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:34,607
Sorry, man.

598
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:36,357
Go get them.

599
00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:51,686
- Didn't think you'd apply.
- Uh, I think I'm ready for this, Big Mike.

600
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:54,480
And what it means:
Responsibility, decisive leadership...

601
00:41:54,694 --> 00:41:55,772
Save it for interview.

602
00:41:56,935 --> 00:41:57,934
- Now go train the new guy.
- Okey-dokey.

603
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,676
Don't freak out.
