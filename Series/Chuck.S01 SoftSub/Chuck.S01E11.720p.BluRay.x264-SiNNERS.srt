1
00:00:02,118 --> 00:00:04,539
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.
A few things you might need to know.</i>

2
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:06,088
It was nice knowing you.

3
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:10,963
Oh, my God, Bryce.

4
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:13,344
- How are you still alive?
- It's complicated.

5
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:15,772
You're still in love with me.

6
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:18,859
I guess this means
we're not getting back together.

7
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:22,245
- We'll always have Omaha.
- What did Bryce mean by Omaha?

8
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,167
A code. Contact point of some sort.

9
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:26,130
Bryce is going deep, Chuck.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,299
No calls home, no messages out.

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,422
Sarah wants to join up with him,
she has to do it now.

12
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,739
What is that?
Whoa.

13
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:03,707
What's that squiggly thing?
What did he bet on?

14
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:07,090
<i>Gimel. I win. Ah.</i>

15
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,710
- You sure?
Yes, yes.

16
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,473
<i>Gimel beats he.</i>

17
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:12,842
Pay up, buddy.

18
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:15,981
<i>- Okay, I thought he was the best.
- Yes, I know you think so.</i>

19
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:20,023
Anna, this is the Parcheesi of my people.
Don't question, hand over the cash.

20
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:21,489
I apologize.

21
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:36,771
Decided to take up bird watching?

22
00:01:36,986 --> 00:01:40,109
- Just breathing in the view.
- Hmm.

23
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:43,536
I know that grunt.

24
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:47,164
Yeah, that's the Number 7, right?
Skeptical with a side of cynicism.

25
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,920
Just clearing my throat.

26
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:53,227
Just couldn't help but notice Agent
Walker's car isn't in her usual spot.

27
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:55,474
Oh. I didn't, uh...

28
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,524
It's weird. I didn't notice,
I didn't see that at all.

29
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,150
Fine, maybe I did. So?

30
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,616
Have you talked to Sarah?

31
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,454
Agent Walker and I don't do
a lot of fraternizing off hours.

32
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,127
Guess we'll just have to see.

33
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:10,428
See...

34
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,141
See what? Why? See what?

35
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:15,226
See if she's had enough
of the good life here with you.

36
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:18,569
See if she's hightailed it
to wherever Bryce is hiding himself.

37
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:21,452
Is that an option?

38
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:23,741
Oh, don't worry.

39
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:28,049
There's a great selection of new handlers
in this year's CIA Christmas catalog.

40
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,835
Are there? Thanks a lot.

41
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:34,136
She's a liar. Not to be trusted.

42
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,519
- What's that?
- Women.

43
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,649
They're so elusive.
So unknowable, okay?

44
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,445
Wrap you in this sweater lies,
and it keeps you warm...

45
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,030
...but makes your neck itchy.

46
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,247
- Who are we talking about exactly?
- Anna.

47
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,084
Never trust a woman
whose name is a palindrome, okay?

48
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,258
Uh, how do you know she's a liar?

49
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,676
I wait outside her house last night.
I saw her get picked up.

50
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:55,565
Then dropped off
three hours and 24 minutes later.

51
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:57,021
She's cheating on me.

52
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:59,652
- My Anna-banana is cheating on me.
- In the bushes?

53
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:01,742
- Well, I brought a sandwich, you know.
- Oh.

54
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:06,537
Listen, she's lying to me, okay?
And a relationship is built on trust, Chuck.

55
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,750
Sex and trust. Am I right?

56
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:12,849
Yeah, yeah.
Two big prerequisites, I guess.

57
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,230
What's cool is you and Sarah
are so pure and simple, you know?

58
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,773
Ever wish you were born,
like, a dog or a dolphin?

59
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,111
Dr. Dre?

60
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,371
- Who's cheating on Dre, man?
Text here.

61
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:27,542
Uh, we got an install job
over in Marina del Rey.

62
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:29,503
Okay, well, go with God, fellas.

63
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,180
No. Big Mike says you have to come.

64
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:34,436
You know that Jeff's
not to be left unsupervised...

65
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:35,727
...around holidays.

66
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:37,775
- You wanna try my eggnog?
- No.

67
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:40,147
I'm sorry.
Is it okay if go by yourself, okay?

68
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,160
Because Anna's cheating on me.

69
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,488
Ouch.

70
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:44,911
Who's the lucky guy?

71
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:46,587
Maybe it's not another guy.

72
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:48,957
Strap on our life jackets
and hit the Marina.

73
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:50,964
See?
That's why I've sworn off women.

74
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,272
How would you like that guy right now,
all heartbroken over a lady?

75
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:57,892
Bitches ain't nothing
but tricks and ho's.

76
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,816
<i>You said it, bubele.</i>

77
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:37,558
The system checks out
and everything's online.

78
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,777
Most on-board functions
are controllable...

79
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:41,362
...from anywhere on the boat.

80
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:44,160
<i>Nice ship.
She reminds me of the Pacific Princess.</i>

81
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,870
- I'm not familiar.
- Oh, really.

82
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,465
<i>He's referring to Love Boat.</i>

83
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,674
- Chuck, please.
- You got a head on board?

84
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:53,679
- I had a lot of eggnog.
- You should've left it at home.

85
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:56,061
Not every boat
you get on is a booze cruise.

86
00:04:56,274 --> 00:04:58,103
Bathroom is not in there.
Nobody downstairs.

87
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,236
No, Jeff. Stop, Jeff, no.
Whoa.

88
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:02,995
- Jackpot.
Please get out.

89
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:04,369
Get out. Go, go, go.

90
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,709
Watch the step.
- Watch the what? Oh.

91
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:09,795
- What's with all the cash? Easy, sister.
- I'm not your sister.

92
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:14,135
They're counting money raised for
Mr. Kirk's aid organization from a charity.

93
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:16,478
- Kirk, as in the captain?
- Lon Kirk.

94
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,651
- The man who owns this boat.
- Oh, right.

95
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:21,742
Yeah, Lon Kirk, he's a billionaire.
He owns a country, right?

96
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:23,993
Incoming.

97
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,290
Oh.

98
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:35,594
Ladies, I'm getting my sea legs.

99
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:38,938
- Hi.
- Jeff, Lester, I think we should go now.

100
00:05:39,113 --> 00:05:40,525
Sir, you dropped this...

101
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:51,548
- They're fake.
- Whatever.

102
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:52,963
So is Cool Whip.

103
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:54,264
Ahoy-hoy.

104
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:32,680
<i>The serial numbers that Chuck flashed on
are a strain of counterfeit currency...</i>

105
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,766
<i>...the treasury's been trying to crack.</i>

106
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,977
<i>But we should wait to debrief you
until Agent Walker arrives.</i>

107
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:39,315
<i>Yes.</i>

108
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:40,569
<i>Where is Agent Walker?</i>

109
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,537
Uh, ma'am, Agent Walker's currently...

110
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:45,784
Ahem. Agent Walker
is currently suffering...

111
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,712
...from a spastic colon,
which acts up on her from time to time...

112
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:51,879
<i>She has no history of that.</i>

113
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:55,179
<i>Perhaps we should reschedule
when Agent Walker is feeling better.</i>

114
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:58,484
I'm fine. I'm sorry I'm late, carry on.

115
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:02,239
<i>As we were saying, Lon Kirk now
devotes most of his time and money...</i>

116
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:04,079
<i>...to aid projects, mostly foreign.</i>

117
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:06,457
<i>We think he's the source.
Not confirmed.</i>

118
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,006
<i>However, we have intel that
a major counterfeiter is in Los Angeles...</i>

119
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:12,420
<i>...trying to acquire
a new set of printing plates.</i>

120
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,970
And how shall we proceed?

121
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:17,267
<i>As far as Kirk
is concerned, very cautiously.</i>

122
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:18,724
<i>He's very well-connected.</i>

123
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:22,531
<i>He's hosting an event tonight
at the New Constellation Yacht Club.</i>

124
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:25,285
<i>Sarah and Chuck will go as guests.
Casey as staff.</i>

125
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,336
One question. Will Chuck and Sarah
be going as a couple?

126
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,969
- Unless they have a problem.
- No problem.

127
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:37,435
<i>- No problem.
Good luck, then.</i>

128
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,821
Hey, hey, Sarah. Wait.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,458
- What's up?
- Um...

130
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:49,501
Nothing.

131
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:50,839
Nothing, really just...

132
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:53,421
You know, good to see you.

133
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,474
Thought you'd be
halfway to Bryce by now.

134
00:07:56,983 --> 00:07:59,191
Why would you think that?

135
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:05,904
I don't know, because he offers
a pretty exciting life, I guess.

136
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:11,297
Sipping mai tais in Jakarta,
or assassinating Afghani warlords...

137
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,465
...or whatever it is
you kids do for fun.

138
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:16,473
I'm here because I have a job to do.

139
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:19,486
Right.

140
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:21,899
Right. Of course, the job.

141
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:26,782
I better... Uh, I better be going as well.
I gotta punch in.

142
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,916
- Sarah?
- Yeah?

143
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:39,357
Should we carpool
on our stay tonight?

144
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:42,615
Be at my place at 8.

145
00:08:53,892 --> 00:08:56,017
For those of you who aren't aware...

146
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:59,109
...this Friday is our annual
Buy More Christmas...

147
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,601
Oop.

148
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:05,196
Holiday party.

149
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:10,124
Respect to our Hebrew friends,
and whatever else we have here.

150
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,005
So there's no confusion...

151
00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:15,896
...I'll go over the ground rules.

152
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:17,642
Rule number one.

153
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:20,107
Jeff.

154
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:22,280
No spiking the eggnog.

155
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:24,455
- Can I bring my own?
- No.

156
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,120
Rule number two. Jeff, no holding
the mistletoe over the women...

157
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:31,294
...and copping a feel.
Uh, sir.

158
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:34,848
Hopefully, if Jeff follows
rule number one, which I'm sure...

159
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:40,903
...he might do,
then rule number two won't apply.

160
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:43,567
Good point.
Okay, who's bringing eats?

161
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:45,870
Uh, I'll be making latkes.

162
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,414
What's that?

163
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,756
Um, it's a traditional Jewish pancake.

164
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:52,880
- They got tater in them?
- Yes.

165
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:54,808
They fried?

166
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:56,639
They are, sir.

167
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:58,689
- Good. Meeting adjourned.
- Ah.

168
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:01,979
We gotta find out
how to make latkes.

169
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,579
Hey.

170
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:10,129
There you are.
You missed the meeting.

171
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,753
Jeff has to stay sober,
and he can't grope women. I know.

172
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:14,766
Okay.

173
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,729
If you don't tell me what's up,
I'm going to tickle you until you pee.

174
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:21,399
No, please. I don't want it.

175
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:22,774
Cut it out. Stop it.

176
00:10:22,994 --> 00:10:26,247
I know, okay? You weren't home
last night, Anna, you went out.

177
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,754
I was in the bushes in a stakeout
with my iPod and corned beef.

178
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:32,721
I know it's a little weird.
But I saw you get picked up.

179
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,515
I'm not an idiot, all right?

180
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:37,012
At least not when it comes to this.

181
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:40,985
I'm sorry, Morgan.

182
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:42,236
I did lie.

183
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,111
Oh, my...

184
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,620
I think I'm gonna be nauseous.

185
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:52,048
But I'm not seeing someone else.

186
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,262
I saw you getting
in a guy's German luxury sedan.

187
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:56,974
Bad enough you're cheating. Did it
have to be with someone successful?

188
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:01,321
Morgan, my parents are in town.
That was my dad's car.

189
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:05,535
- I thought your parents live in Taiwan.
- They do, mostly.

190
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,998
They're in town with a bunch
of Taiwanese government...

191
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:10,295
...and muckety-mucks
for a charity thing in L.A.

192
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:11,885
I like to meet your parents.

193
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:15,598
If you're serious about this relationship,
you should want me to meet them too.

194
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:19,692
Okay.

195
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,406
Okay.

196
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:26,457
Hey.
Oh!

197
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,377
Would you stop sneaking up on me?

198
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,666
This is a retail store. Not Tora Bora.

199
00:11:30,884 --> 00:11:33,343
Oh, Sarah's got you all up in a tizzy.

200
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:35,140
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

201
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,804
We know the Intersect
needs as much room as it can get.

202
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:40,690
Okay, look, nothing is going on, okay?

203
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:44,112
Better not be.
Need your A-game tonight. Stay sharp.

204
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,660
I think I need your help.
I think I made a horrible mistake.

205
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:51,001
- What did you swallow this time?
- No, no, it's worse, worse.

206
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:52,838
Uh, Anna's parents are in town, right?

207
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,053
So I tell her, "I'd like to meet them. "
She goes, "Okay. "

208
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:59,316
What was I thinking?
My own parents don't even like me.

209
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,730
- We're similar.
- Morgan, Morgan, relax, buddy.

210
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:04,240
Just be yourself.
That's what Anna likes, right?

211
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:06,157
So will her parents.

212
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,828
Yeah, you're right.

213
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:09,665
- That's what I'll do...
You insane?

214
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:10,962
You can't be yourself.

215
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,847
You have to be better than yourself
by, like, a factor of 10.

216
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,645
Or 11.

217
00:12:18,984 --> 00:12:21,774
I gotta take up a notch, gotta step it up.
Who should I be?

218
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,614
Last I check, there were over
6 billion people on the planet.

219
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:27,204
Pick anyone,
should be an improvement.

220
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:30,340
Lester, you shut up.
Morgan, you relax.

221
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:32,051
Relax.
- You're gonna be fine.

222
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,878
Be myself.

223
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:36,846
Rock 'n' roll.
I'm gonna make a fool of myself.

224
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:51,214
It's open.

225
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:05,908
Not a morning person, I see.

226
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,872
Well, it depends on the morning.
So we're clear on everything?

227
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,168
Eyes and ears on anything
that can trigger a flash.

228
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:15,593
- Our cover is we're a couple, you're...
- Charles Carmichael.

229
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:17,727
Yeah, I got it.

230
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,979
It should be pretty fun, right?

231
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:22,816
It's work.

232
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,658
It's okay. I got it.

233
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,960
Okay. Well, uh, ready to go to work?

234
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:53,093
If you're expecting me to hit the tables,
I'm gonna need a no-interest spy loan.

235
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:55,803
You'd be shocked what a government
super-computer pays.

236
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:57,680
CIA staked us. You have a hundred.

237
00:13:57,897 --> 00:14:00,521
Oh, well, that's ample.

238
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:03,028
- Since when do you drink martinis?
- Oh, I don't, no.

239
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,446
But Carmichael loves them.

240
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,457
There he is. Let's go.

241
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:17,769
Ah, roulette, huh? My favorite game
aside from "Call of Duty. "

242
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:19,269
Chips, please.

243
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,484
One hundred, sir. Good luck.

244
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:23,657
Don't lose it.

245
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:26,279
I don't believe we've met before.
I'm Lon Kirk.

246
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,492
I'm the host of this evening's event.

247
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:32,001
I know the people of Taiwan
are appreciative of your generosity.

248
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,298
Oh, well, cheers.

249
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,762
- The name's Charles Carmichael.
- Pleasure.

250
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:40,268
And your stunning companion.

251
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:42,611
- Sarah Walker, pleasure.
Indeed.

252
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,243
May I ask, Mr. Kirk...?

253
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:45,995
- Lon, please.
- Lon.

254
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:50,118
I was wondering how you came to focus
your charitable efforts on Taiwan.

255
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:54,923
Well, I started doing business there,
and I just fell in love with the people...

256
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:56,560
...their indefatigable spirit.

257
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:57,843
And I said to myself...

258
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,476
- Three on high, please.
- Yes.

259
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,274
I said to myself, "Lon, you can help. "

260
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,198
- That's wonderful.
And I always bet on red.

261
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:07,740
Because it reminds me
of the pain and suffering.

262
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,455
How noble.

263
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:12,379
- Any other bets?
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

264
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:14,219
I'm in. All of it.

265
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:18,556
Always bet on black.

266
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,771
<i>Wesley Snipes, Passenger 57.
Not a great film, granted.</i>

267
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:25,028
Are you sure you wanna risk it all?
Don't wanna reconsider?

268
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:28,083
- Doesn't seem prudent.
- Prudent? Ha-ha-ha.

269
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,335
I mean, here, I thought
we were gambling, right?

270
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:32,964
If I lose it, it goes to charity.
So here's to losing.

271
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:36,053
- Cheers.
- Bets are in, 100,000 on black.

272
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:39,392
A hundred thousand dollars?

273
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:40,938
Is that what you just said?

274
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:43,278
No, no, no, wait,
wait, I didn't realize...

275
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:47,196
It's a normal bet for me, $ 100,000.
So come on, black.

276
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:49,375
Black, black, black. Ha.

277
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:51,914
Come on, honey. Cheer for black.

278
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:55,593
Three red.

279
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:58,605
Do you do mulligans in roulette,
or any kind of a do-over?

280
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:00,440
Is there like a thing...?

281
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,192
Thank you. Thank you very much.

282
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:04,909
If you'll excuse me.

283
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:08,530
You really wink at him?

284
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:10,581
Did you really just lose $ 100,000?

285
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:12,002
Psst.

286
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:24,238
Kirk's talking to Rashan Chen. Taiwanese
attaché to the premier. He's dirty.

287
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:27,990
They're using the charity as a front
to launder counterfeit money.

288
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:31,416
Something's wrong, I'm gonna go over.
Chuck, you stay at the table.

289
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,837
What...?

290
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:34,713
We'll work on a payment plan later.

291
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:36,720
Can we?

292
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:43,190
- She's being obvious, don't you think?
- Relax, she's doing her job.

293
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:53,674
So, uh,
what did you and Kirk talk about?

294
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,006
Uh, he invited me
to his yacht tomorrow afternoon.

295
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:59,305
Okay. What time should I be ready?

296
00:16:59,482 --> 00:17:01,477
No. Just me.

297
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:06,453
Oh, just you, alone on his yacht.

298
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:10,911
Kind of disrespectful
to your boyfriend.

299
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,422
Bryce is not my boyfriend,
and even if he was...

300
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:15,969
...he would understand
this kind of work.

301
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:20,096
I meant Carmichael, actually.

302
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:24,401
But don't worry. Carmichael's
booked up tomorrow, anyway.

303
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:31,161
Very, very busy schedule,
so good luck and good night.

304
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:15,669
Hmm?

305
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:25,358
Nice car.

306
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:27,446
Not just any car.

307
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:30,662
It's a 1985 Crown Victoria.

308
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:33,166
She doesn't like it
when I talk about her age.

309
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:35,795
I'm not really a car guy,
so I don't really...

310
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:37,054
Pretty shiny.

311
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:38,806
Oh, yeah, she's shiny.

312
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,606
Four-point-six V8 engine.

313
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:42,193
Hydro-glide transmission.

314
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:44,441
Reupholstered
the prisoner-containment area.

315
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:48,613
Even installed a state-of-the-art GPS
tracking system in the license plate.

316
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:52,046
Can locate this baby anywhere
in the world in less than a minute.

317
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,295
That's great.
That's really great, Casey.

318
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:58,181
Could buy 10 more with the money
you pissed away on one spin last night.

319
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:01,233
I knew you weren't gonna let that go.
How did I know that?

320
00:19:02,362 --> 00:19:06,447
So, what exactly is Sarah's mission
on that guy's boat today?

321
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:13,706
Get close to Lon Kirk
by any means necessary.

322
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,464
Wait.

323
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:18,394
You're saying
she's gonna go down there, and flirt...

324
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:20,974
...with Lon Kirk, alone?

325
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:25,482
I mean, do you have an idea
of what kind of message that gives?

326
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:28,991
I hear Agent Walker
can be quite the giver.

327
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:41,437
How's it going?

328
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:43,397
Okay, sweet deal.

329
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:46,072
Do me a favor
and keep it up front. Oh.

330
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:57,429
So, Morgan, you work at Buy More?

331
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,925
Yes, sir, that's correct.

332
00:19:59,104 --> 00:20:02,559
And Anna will tell you that I got
the old nose to the grindstone.

333
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:05,029
Not literally, because that would hurt.

334
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:08,699
And is that where you see yourself
in, say, five years?

335
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,745
That's a tough question.

336
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:14,667
I could tell you where I don't
wanna see myself in five years.

337
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:17,601
Prison or under house arrest.

338
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:22,357
Doing anything that involves
a lot of chopping, deep knee bends.

339
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:25,113
- No nudity.
- Waiter, cocktail.

340
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:29,328
Just generally try to keep
my clothes on, you know, it's...

341
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,091
<i>Are you insane?</i>

342
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:34,338
You can't be yourself.

343
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,589
You have to be better than yourself.

344
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:39,895
Are you guys having lobster?
Could you bring back a doggy bag?

345
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:42,809
Take it up, take it up. Gotta be better.

346
00:20:42,987 --> 00:20:46,075
Where am I from? Wow.

347
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,203
Where are any of us really from?

348
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,041
I myself hail from many fathers.

349
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:52,211
Nietzsche, Sartre, Jarrell.

350
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:54,465
He's... Encino. He's from Encino.

351
00:20:55,972 --> 00:20:57,801
There I was. There I was.

352
00:20:58,018 --> 00:21:01,688
There I was in the Congo.

353
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,564
When you guys eat Chinese food,
do you get hungry an hour later too?

354
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,326
There she goes.

355
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,913
You don't mind, do you, babe?

356
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:14,008
Know who else famously smoked a pipe?
Boyhood hero of mine.

357
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,511
Yeah, yeah.
Quite the yachtsman himself.

358
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:18,936
One Popeye the sailorman.

359
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,558
Anyone, huh? Boop-boop.

360
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:34,715
Will you guys excuse me
for one second?

361
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:42,438
- Hey, Morgan.
- Oh, hey, dude.

362
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:44,190
We got a possible situation here.

363
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:47,778
<i>I'm lunching with Anna's
parents at some yacht club in Marina.</i>

364
00:21:47,997 --> 00:21:51,701
Okay. I see someone who resembles
the future Mrs. Chuck Bartowski.

365
00:21:51,922 --> 00:21:53,714
<i>Right now, she's getting lotioned up...</i>

366
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:58,051
<i>...by some creepy Richard Branson-meets-
Willem Dafoe-looking dude, right?</i>

367
00:21:58,226 --> 00:22:00,517
<i>And he is all over her, man.</i>

368
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,238
<i>I mean, he is really greasing her
and working up this lather, it's just...</i>

369
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:07,908
Quite a scene over here, and, um...

370
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,280
I gotta go. Lobsters here.

371
00:22:21,984 --> 00:22:24,311
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't shoot, put the gun down.

372
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:27,150
- You can have the jelly-filled.
- What are you doing here?

373
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,867
I thought you might be hungry.
Friend-to-friend kind of a thing.

374
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:32,922
- Where's Sarah?
- Oh, that's it.

375
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:36,878
Think your girlfriend's stepping out.
Agent Walker's fine doing her job.

376
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,553
See?

377
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:42,230
Plus, we have a whole team here...

378
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:43,903
...to back her up.

379
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,395
Okay?

380
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:47,777
So you can beat it, Bartowski.

381
00:22:48,664 --> 00:22:50,659
Oh, my God. They're going down.

382
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:00,350
Chuck, what is it?

383
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:02,939
They're loading counterfeit plates
onto that boat.

384
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:05,070
Hidden in crates
marked as aid medicines.

385
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,321
What?

386
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:08,368
Flashed on a crate
they brought onboard.

387
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:10,284
That's why Kirk
brought Sarah below deck.

388
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:12,834
This guy's important,
we can't be wrong. You sure?

389
00:23:13,048 --> 00:23:14,924
I just flashed. I'm sure, okay?

390
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:18,350
This is Casey.

391
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,803
We're going in. Go.

392
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:24,105
I know we just met,
but I feel so close to you.

393
00:23:26,911 --> 00:23:28,323
Federal agents. Nobody move.

394
00:23:28,497 --> 00:23:30,824
Get down.

395
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:32,707
Excuse me one moment.

396
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:34,507
Okay, don't move.

397
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:36,422
Hey, Hey.
Don't move.

398
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:41,013
- Who are you people?
- NSA.

399
00:23:41,232 --> 00:23:43,025
- Stay there, let us do our job.
- Job?

400
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,361
- Do you have any idea who I am?
- Open it.

401
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:49,279
That crate is a bonded humanitarian
shipment certified by the United Nations.

402
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:51,743
- It's illegal for you to open it.
- I can make calls.

403
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:54,414
- Hope you don't mind waiting.
- Oh, I do, so we won't.

404
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:01,180
Medical supplies,
for the earthquake victims of Taiwan.

405
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,071
I wanted to deliver it myself.
We leave tomorrow.

406
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:08,620
Now, if I could get your names
and agency affiliations...

407
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,954
...I wanna make sure everybody
is accounted for when I speak...

408
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:14,795
...to your bosses' bosses
later this evening.

409
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:22,687
- Ellie or Awesome home?
- No.

410
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,363
- They're at work, and hello to you too.
- What the hell happened today?

411
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:27,946
I don't know, I don't get it.

412
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,496
- I had a flash.
- When I went below deck with Kirk.

413
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:33,084
- Convenient timing.
- What are you talking about?

414
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:36,587
When you thought I was getting intimate
with Kirk, you decided to have a flash.

415
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:39,436
What exactly are you implying?
That I'm a flash faker?

416
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,267
We need to discuss the fact that you
let your emotions get in the way today.

417
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:44,690
My emotions?

418
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:47,536
Things have been
a little off since the incident, Chuck.

419
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:50,624
Really? And what incident
are you referring to, Agent Walker?

420
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,703
Could it be
when you planted a kiss on me...

421
00:24:52,922 --> 00:24:55,927
...right before a bomb
was supposed to go off, ending our lives?

422
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:59,717
That same kiss right before Bryce
came back from the dead? That kiss...?

423
00:24:59,895 --> 00:25:01,805
Stop saying kiss.
What's done is done.

424
00:25:01,982 --> 00:25:03,811
Can we just not talk about it, please?

425
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:06,521
Okay, fine.
Just answer me one little thing.

426
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:08,950
Did you kiss me
because we were gonna die...

427
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:12,537
...and mine were the most convenient
lips around, or was it actually about me?

428
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:16,672
What happened was a mistake.

429
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,017
One I will not make again.

430
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:43,892
Well, well, well.

431
00:25:45,698 --> 00:25:48,821
- Looking good, Morgan.
- Well, feeling good, Charles.

432
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,793
And how was meeting
Anna's parents?

433
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:55,291
Uh, it was fine.
You know, I think it went okay.

434
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,922
Ish.

435
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:03,102
Let's just say he wasn't the Morgan
we've all come to know and love.

436
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:07,824
- Captain Stubing.
- Morning, Michael.

437
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:10,833
I was thinking about focusing
on the starboard side of the store.

438
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:13,500
If you don't change
into regulation clothing now...

439
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:16,000
...I'm gonna kick
the starboard side of your ass.

440
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:17,507
Why do people hate the rich?

441
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:20,138
Speaking of starboard,
Anna's parents invited us...

442
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:24,099
...or at least Anna, on a cruise with some
of their big shot Taiwanese friends.

443
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:27,780
You and Sarah should join us. Supposed
to be some bigwig diplomats there.

444
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:30,826
You and Sarah should be
hanging out with diplomats, Chuck.

445
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:34,671
Oh. Or just you. Right.
I'm sorry, dude.

446
00:26:34,842 --> 00:26:38,760
- Find out if that was Sarah yesterday?
- Yeah, yeah.

447
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:40,346
You know, it wasn't her.

448
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,569
Must have been
some other busty long-legged blond.

449
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:48,110
- They're a dime a dozen around here.
- Figured it wasn't her, you know.

450
00:26:48,286 --> 00:26:50,779
To be honest with you,
I wasn't looking at her face.

451
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,538
Well, boat later, huh?

452
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:55,295
You, me.
Shrimp cocktails supposed to be served.

453
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:59,014
Thanks, buddy. But I think
I'm gonna stay landlocked tonight.

454
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:01,385
Oh, well, suit yourself. Ahoy-hoy.

455
00:27:02,566 --> 00:27:04,941
<i>Which
part of "Handle Lon Kirk with caution"...</i>

456
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:07,149
<i>...wasn't clear,
Agents Walker and Casey?</i>

457
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:08,697
Chuck flashed, general.

458
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,243
Our decision to raid was based
on the information from the Intersect.

459
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:13,660
Except Chuck was wrong.

460
00:27:14,256 --> 00:27:17,297
We think Kirk must have
managed to hide the plates somehow.

461
00:27:17,472 --> 00:27:19,181
<i>Where?</i>

462
00:27:20,228 --> 00:27:22,186
- We don't know.
- So you moved in, anyway.

463
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:26,109
Is there something that might've caused
Chuck to think those were on Kirk's?

464
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:28,740
<i>Anything that might have
caused his flash?</i>

465
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:32,041
Not that we're aware of.

466
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,668
I don't want the two of you near Kirk
from now on.

467
00:27:34,882 --> 00:27:36,676
Both of us?
But he doesn't suspect me.

468
00:27:36,845 --> 00:27:39,005
<i>We don't know that,
and we can't risk it.</i>

469
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:43,601
<i>So until further notice,
consider yourselves benched.</i>

470
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:49,655
That was a bang-up job, Walker.

471
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,658
Gonna give you one last chance
to come clean.

472
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:55,503
Did you or did you not
compromise yourself in the Intersect?

473
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:06,567
Do you ever
just wanna have a normal life?

474
00:28:08,661 --> 00:28:10,620
Have a family?

475
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,500
Children?

476
00:28:14,256 --> 00:28:18,840
The choice we made to protect
something bigger than ourselves...

477
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:21,224
...is the right choice.

478
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:24,186
Hard as that is for you
to remember sometimes.

479
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:31,952
I'll talk to Chuck.

480
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,665
And if I can't fix this,
then I'm gonna ask for a reassignment.

481
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:56,547
Oh.

482
00:28:58,765 --> 00:29:01,769
Ah, ha. Gilligan.

483
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:03,564
Hey there, little buddy.

484
00:29:31,123 --> 00:29:33,878
The plates are on Rashan's boat.

485
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:35,626
Oh.

486
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:39,009
This baby's got it all.
Got four main burners...

487
00:29:39,223 --> 00:29:40,388
Hey, we need to talk.

488
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:42,644
Later. I'm about to move
a Beast Master.

489
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:44,102
No. Now.

490
00:29:45,738 --> 00:29:49,490
Fine. Be right back.
This better be good.

491
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,827
Morgan sent me a JPEG from
the Taiwanese attaché's yacht, okay?

492
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:55,378
I uploaded it and used
an X-TEL software device...

493
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:57,752
...to break down
the data into readable bytes.

494
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,259
English, Bartowski.

495
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:01,012
I blew up the photo.

496
00:30:01,228 --> 00:30:04,231
The plates are on Rashan's boat
with Anna and Morgan.

497
00:30:04,442 --> 00:30:07,483
These are the same crates as yesterday.
Ones that got us benched.

498
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,073
Did you just hear what I said?
Morgan and Anna are on...

499
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:16,464
Look, I'm right about this.
The Intersect is right about this.

500
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:18,464
Orders are orders.

501
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:22,683
Your wiener, sir.

502
00:30:22,898 --> 00:30:25,307
- Excuse me, I need to talk to you.
- Not now.

503
00:30:25,486 --> 00:30:27,861
These are the same crates
I flashed on yesterday.

504
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:30,075
Here, on a boat
with the Taiwanese attaché.

505
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:33,166
The one arguing with Kirk.
He's getting away with the plates.

506
00:30:33,336 --> 00:30:36,174
- Kirk put the plates on Rashan's boat?
- Yes.

507
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:38,925
I know your orders are to stay away,
but believe me.

508
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:41,425
The plates are on that boat
with Morgan and Anna.

509
00:30:41,895 --> 00:30:44,983
I wouldn't be here right now
if I wasn't a hundred percent sure.

510
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:47,236
- What are you...?
- Let's go.

511
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:56,340
Chuck, Sarah.

512
00:30:56,551 --> 00:31:00,255
Casey, what are you doing here?
- Someone needs to protect the Intersect.

513
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:02,179
Very thoughtful. Thank you, I guess.

514
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:05,311
Plus, I didn't wanna
miss any gunplay. Come on.

515
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,373
Look, there he is.

516
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,653
There's a GPS missile tracking device
on the ship. They'll blow it up.

517
00:31:26,864 --> 00:31:29,072
Kirk's got his money.
He'll bury the evidence.

518
00:31:29,244 --> 00:31:31,321
I'm king of the world.

519
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:34,329
King of the world.

520
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,629
I'm king of the world.

521
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:40,431
They're loading something.

522
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:43,011
That's it. That's the missile launcher.

523
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,027
Gonna follow him and use it to take out
the Taiwanese boat.

524
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,071
The one with Morgan on it,
little buddy?

525
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:50,236
- Create a diversion.
- I'll get the guards.

526
00:31:50,413 --> 00:31:53,451
- I know, stay in the car.
- Not this time.

527
00:31:54,337 --> 00:31:56,131
We've got a GPS tracker on the ship.

528
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:57,837
The rocket guides itself.

529
00:31:58,012 --> 00:31:59,888
- Are the coordinates set?
- Yes, sir.

530
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,437
- I just gotta pull the trigger.
- No, when the time comes, I'll pull.

531
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:06,610
- I never liked Rashan anyway.
- Sir, we've got a situation.

532
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:07,986
Lon.

533
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,944
Lon.

534
00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:13,492
- Hi.
- It's okay, it's okay.

535
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:16,715
Lon, I'm so sorry,
but I had to talk to you.

536
00:32:16,926 --> 00:32:19,930
It's all right. That's great,
but we're about to push off.

537
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:22,016
I know, I know. Uh...

538
00:32:22,186 --> 00:32:24,265
God, this is embarrassing.

539
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:27,690
But it's just since I was here last...

540
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:30,275
...I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

541
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:34,199
And I was just wondering
if maybe we could talk or...

542
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,044
Ha, ha. Um... Uh...

543
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,967
Okay. Yeah, okay,
we have a couple minutes.

544
00:32:40,182 --> 00:32:41,763
Well, well, well.

545
00:32:41,977 --> 00:32:43,259
I see how it is, Sarah.

546
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:48,908
How could you do this
after everything that I've done for you?

547
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:52,490
After all that I've given to you,
the house...

548
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,460
...the house in the Hamptons, huh?

549
00:32:54,670 --> 00:33:00,181
Or what about the summers
in South Africa, or the winters in Gastot?

550
00:33:00,391 --> 00:33:03,478
You don't own me, Charles.
Lon knows how I really feel.

551
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:04,721
Do you love him?

552
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:08,649
Know what?
I don't have time for this.

553
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:11,034
Oh, yes, you do.

554
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,460
Yeah, I know
what you're up to, buddy.

555
00:33:14,671 --> 00:33:16,000
- I know the truth.
- Go home.

556
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:19,178
- Tell me...
- It is time for you to go.

557
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,504
What was that?

558
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:27,320
He's... He's... Sarah.

559
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:30,202
He went in the room...
Guys, guys, guys!

560
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:33,370
Get out of the way.

561
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:35,626
Put the rocket launcher down.

562
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:38,457
Oh.

563
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,009
What...?

564
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:51,110
Hey, hey, hey. Look, look, look.

565
00:33:51,288 --> 00:33:54,661
The rocket is guided by GPS software.
All software can be reset.

566
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:58,175
Hurry up.

567
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:01,722
Great. Bye.

568
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:09,402
Look at the size.
These things are the size of baby cats.

569
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:11,161
Gonna be sick if you don't stop.

570
00:34:11,371 --> 00:34:14,244
Yeah, but look at... Mr. Wu,
have you seen something so huge?

571
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,960
- Please stop that.
- This is...

572
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:21,006
Oh, Anna, look, look, look. Fireworks.

573
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:25,849
That's it.

574
00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:27,602
Ooh.

575
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:31,243
- You did it, Chuck.
- Ha-ha-ha.

576
00:34:31,412 --> 00:34:33,741
I can't believe that worked.

577
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:38,626
- Where's the rocket heading now?
- I don't know, I reset it.

578
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:41,885
Sure reset
doesn't mean "return to sender"?

579
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:45,271
Oh, man. Oh, man.

580
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:46,683
- Another target.
- Away from us.

581
00:34:46,903 --> 00:34:51,285
I need another target first,
with GPS coordinates. I don't know.

582
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,709
Casey, what about your car?

583
00:34:56,256 --> 00:34:57,835
- No.
- We're running out of time.

584
00:34:58,052 --> 00:34:59,677
Just tell me the GPS coordinates.

585
00:34:59,846 --> 00:35:01,557
Tell him, Casey.
- Tell me, Casey.

586
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,729
Seven-one-four-seven-seven.

587
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,065
Ugh.

588
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,818
I'm really sorry, buddy. Oh!

589
00:35:13,626 --> 00:35:15,953
I hate this assignment.

590
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,150
I said I was sorry, right?

591
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:42,809
Hey, buddy.
- Hey, dude.

592
00:35:44,816 --> 00:35:47,392
How did it go with Anna's family
on the yacht?

593
00:35:47,571 --> 00:35:50,065
Fine, until I got seasick and barfed.

594
00:35:50,242 --> 00:35:51,323
Was Anna freaked out?

595
00:35:51,537 --> 00:35:54,744
She rubbed my back mid-puke,
and then brought me a warm cloth...

596
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,962
...to clean the shrimp lobs
out of my beard.

597
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:59,626
- Hmm.
- She's an amazing woman, dude.

598
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:02,383
And I am a lucky guy.

599
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:04,847
Is there a way you can say that
to her instead of me?

600
00:36:05,024 --> 00:36:08,443
Yeah. I guess I could, but that
would leave me completely vulnerable.

601
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:12,361
Like a sweet puppy laying on his back,
waiting for his belly to be scratched.

602
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,662
Privates just kind of dangling
out there for everyone to see.

603
00:36:16,547 --> 00:36:20,799
But I can certainly
give it a shot, you know?

604
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:26,227
Doors closed. Time to get polluted.

605
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:29,699
Okay, people.

606
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:31,493
The official Buy More Christmas...

607
00:36:31,662 --> 00:36:32,944
Hey, now.

608
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,457
Holiday party is about to commence.

609
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:40,847
As a reminder,
I'll accept all gifts, cash and checks...

610
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:43,259
...in my office or under the tree.

611
00:36:43,437 --> 00:36:46,892
Keep it clean
and be prepared to get down.

612
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:19,417
I'm gonna be right back. Ahem.

613
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:23,096
Hey, listen.
I'm really sorry about the whole...

614
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:24,972
- Killing my car thing?
- Yeah, that.

615
00:37:25,147 --> 00:37:26,525
Again, I'm sorry.

616
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:29,151
She was my dream car.

617
00:37:29,365 --> 00:37:31,657
Crown Victoria was your dream car?

618
00:37:31,871 --> 00:37:35,290
And why wouldn't it be?
Really beautiful lines, I've always found...

619
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,129
I feel terrible about that, okay?

620
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,302
But it is the holidays, right?
Which is a time for forgiveness.

621
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,217
- Anything I can do to make it up to you?
- Sure.

622
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:47,435
- You can buy me a new car.
- Ha. Huh.

623
00:37:49,073 --> 00:37:50,568
You're totally serious.

624
00:37:50,742 --> 00:37:52,488
That's my jam.

625
00:37:56,296 --> 00:38:00,380
<i>- I believe that makes me a winner.
- I thought shin beat nun.</i>

626
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:03,181
And have you been
bar mitzvahed, Jeffrey?

627
00:38:03,352 --> 00:38:05,347
- No.
Ah. I didn't think so.

628
00:38:05,565 --> 00:38:07,559
- Right.
- Anna, can I talk to you?

629
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:17,418
Uh, I'm sorry that I was a jerk
in front of your parents.

630
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:22,680
I pretended to be something I'm not,
because I thought...

631
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:24,596
I thought
you were embarrassed of me.

632
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:28,310
Morgan, I didn't want you
to meet my parents...

633
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:32,192
...because I'm embarrassed
of who I am in front of them.

634
00:38:33,749 --> 00:38:35,079
What do you mean?

635
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:39,420
Pretending to be their obedient little girl,
dressing a certain way, not being myself.

636
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:44,057
- I didn't want you to see me like that.
- I did miss your pretty makeup.

637
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,730
And your inappropriately short skirts.

638
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:52,442
Not everything's changed, Morgan.

639
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,162
- Think the break-room door's locked?
- Let's find out.

640
00:38:55,336 --> 00:38:57,911
Merry Christmas to all.
And to all, a good night.

641
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:10,738
- Hi.
- Hey.

642
00:39:11,786 --> 00:39:13,531
I'm glad you...

643
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:15,702
I'm glad you came.

644
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,917
I got you something.

645
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:24,557
Ta-da.

646
00:39:24,771 --> 00:39:27,098
New alarm clock. Merry Christmas.

647
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:29,686
- You shouldn't have.
- Ah, come on.

648
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:32,032
They're on sale in home electronics...

649
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,998
...which reminds me, I should scan that
before you leave the store with it.

650
00:39:37,548 --> 00:39:41,633
Look, it's also kind
of a thank you for believing me...

651
00:39:41,806 --> 00:39:44,182
...when you had good reason not to.

652
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:47,060
Well, it's my job, you know?
It's what I do.

653
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:49,194
It's the one thing I'm good at.

654
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:51,778
Really?

655
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:54,659
Because I'm pretty sure
you're good at a lot of things.

656
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:59,049
Well, as you can see from everything
that happened with Bryce...

657
00:39:59,218 --> 00:40:03,053
...I'm not so good at relationships.

658
00:40:04,353 --> 00:40:05,766
I guess that makes two of us.

659
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:15,365
And then that makes me good
at pretty much nothing, I suppose.

660
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:20,631
Chuck, you're good at your job too,
and not just here fixing computers.

661
00:40:20,804 --> 00:40:23,511
The one where you risk
your life to save others...

662
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:27,977
...the one that you didn't ask for
but were supposed to have.

663
00:40:35,043 --> 00:40:36,870
Friends?

664
00:40:38,841 --> 00:40:40,752
Yeah, friends.

665
00:40:46,607 --> 00:40:48,317
Mistletoe.

666
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,322
You'll thank me later, dude.

667
00:40:52,495 --> 00:40:54,489
How about we just dance?

668
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,495
- Sure.
- Lame.

669
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,386
<i>- Casey.
Major.</i>

670
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:06,012
I'm calling to inform you
that the beta version...

671
00:41:06,189 --> 00:41:08,066
...of the Intersect computer
was successful.

672
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:11,400
<i>This means the new Intersect
should be up and running soon.</i>

673
00:41:11,576 --> 00:41:15,993
Once the new computer is online,
it will be time to take care of Bartowski.

674
00:41:18,256 --> 00:41:19,586
Roger that.

675
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,383
I hope you have not grown
too fond of the subject.

676
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:26,185
<i>I would hate for you
to be compromised.</i>

677
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,488
I understand my orders, general.

678
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:37,250
<i>Oh, and John?
- Yeah?</i>

679
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,420
Happy holidays.
