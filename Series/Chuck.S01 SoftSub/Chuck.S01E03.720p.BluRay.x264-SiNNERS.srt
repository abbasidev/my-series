1
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,348
Your money's on the desk.

2
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:00,773
What a piece of crap.

3
00:01:03,578 --> 00:01:04,657
Please.

4
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:06,822
Please don't shoot. Don't shoot me.

5
00:01:06,998 --> 00:01:09,869
Just put the gun down. Gently.

6
00:01:10,043 --> 00:01:13,209
I can't shoot, that's the problem.
This stupid thing is busted.

7
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:17,715
Oh, when it comes to Mr. Bartowski,
my friend, busted is just a state of mind.

8
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:19,040
Little bit of this.

9
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,541
Tweak that.

10
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:24,629
And ta-da, locked and loaded.
Try that.

11
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:29,014
- Nice shot. See?
- Chuck, Big Mike wants to see you.

12
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:31,559
Not now, Harry.
Can't you see I'm with a customer?

13
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:34,601
I apologize, sir, this is not
how we do things at Buy More.

14
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:36,774
- Now, Chuck.
- I was just on my way to see you.

15
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:38,736
That's crazy. Pause that.

16
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:47,328
What is it you want out of life?

17
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:50,700
Existentially? Like fulfillment,
inner peace, that kind of a thing?

18
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,662
Or practically? Like Lakers tickets,
personal steam room...

19
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:55,829
We're talking Buy More.
Career objective.

20
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,798
Where do you see yourself
in five years? Ten years?

21
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:00,840
- Honestly?
- Honestly.

22
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,964
- I have no idea.
- It's time you started to think about it.

23
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,718
There is an assistant management
position open.

24
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,634
It's down to you and Harry Tang.

25
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:11,307
Now, you want that job or not?

26
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,222
I do. I do.

27
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:15,769
I'm sorry, Big Mike.
I absolutely want that job.

28
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:19,352
Well, then, Bartowski,
it's your turn to show me something.

29
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:23,441
I got some bad news.

30
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,281
Big Mike wants us to fix all of this junk
in two days, or he's gonna give...

31
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:29,861
...the assistant-store-manager position
to Tang.

32
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:33,284
- I'm sorry, guys, and Anna.
- "Guys" is fine, I don't mind.

33
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:37,083
We need to come up with something
non-gender specific. How about "team"?

34
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,788
- Fellow Nerd Herders?
- The Lesters?

35
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:43,091
Chuck's stable of ho's?

36
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,170
Hey...

37
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:47,012
Oh, man. Uh...

38
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:51,258
Heard Big Mike threw down the gauntlet,
just wanna say I'd love to help.

39
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:54,851
But, A, I lack the skill set, and, B,
old computers give me the willies.

40
00:02:55,022 --> 00:02:56,813
No idea how much courage it's taking
just to stand here.

41
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:58,602
- I'm really proud of you, buddy.
- Whoo.

42
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:00,567
Thanks, bro. I bring you news.

43
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:02,735
- What?
- Your lady is here.

44
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:08,611
And if I'm not overstepping my bounds,
looking good.

45
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:24,297
- Hey.
- Hey.

46
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:25,879
Give me a kiss.

47
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:27,132
I'm sorry. What?

48
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:30,471
We've been on three dates,
we have to sell it.

49
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:39,221
- That's it?
- I'm not really good with the PDA.

50
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:42,021
Well, let's go somewhere
more private.

51
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:43,854
Shall we?

52
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,744
Okay, he is so in.

53
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:54,740
This is... Hey. Whoa.

54
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:58,871
Okay, whoa, why don't we give the kids
a little privacy...?

55
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:03,957
Not cool.

56
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:07,543
Sorry to break up your little tryst.

57
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,720
Next time you to talk to the subject,
I'd appreciate a heads up.

58
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,558
I wouldn't dream of starting
without you, Agent Casey.

59
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:17,302
Mom, Dad, can we get on with it?
I have hard drives to fix.

60
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:22,685
- Why are these people sleeping?
They're not sleeping.

61
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:25,101
They were killed, Chuck,
and we wanna know why.

62
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:27,569
- I have no idea.
- Well, look again.

63
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:29,233
I'd rather not, it's kind of creepy.

64
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:33,618
Oh. Sorry, I was gonna take a nap.

65
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:37,288
I'll come back in five.
Kind of called dibs on the couch.

66
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,877
- Chuck, what did you see?
- I don't... I'm not totally sure.

67
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:51,385
Water lily painting, weapons,
an art auction tomorrow night.

68
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:54,176
Does the name La Ciudad
mean anything to you?

69
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,638
- Why?
- I think he's gonna be at the art auction.

70
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:02,724
Right, I'm gonna fix some hard drives.

71
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:05,188
Good luck with the spy stuff.
Excuse me.

72
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:08,691
Chuck, I am so proud of you.

73
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:11,948
Morgan told me about the assistant
manager job. Congratulations.

74
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:14,690
Team Bartowski moving up
in the world, huh? Ha-ha-ha.

75
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:16,992
Okay, first of all, it's not mine yet.

76
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:19,156
Second, you can ease up
on the enthusiasm.

77
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:21,823
It's only a $2-an-hour raise
at an electronics store.

78
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:24,368
And it doesn't even give me
my own parking space.

79
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:28,674
Does lack of interest mean you're leaving
the Buy More for a real profession?

80
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:32,257
Real profession? Sorry,
I'm gonna need clarification on that.

81
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:34,172
He went to Stanford, for God's sakes.

82
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,298
Right, and was expelled senior year.

83
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:39,558
Sorry to bring that up,
we need to be realistic about our goals.

84
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:41,720
- His goals or your goals?
Great question.

85
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:45,063
Think we need a plan for Chuck.
Where do we see him in five years?

86
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:46,692
- Ten years?
- We?

87
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:48,277
Fine, then just you and I.

88
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:51,940
<i>Glad to hear
you've settled into Chuck's building.</i>

89
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:54,570
<i>But if he's right, this is a high priority.</i>

90
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:58,491
<i>La Ciudad is the most elusive
and dangerous arms dealer in the world.</i>

91
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:03,657
<i>Last anyone heard, Ml6 in London
had a drop on him, but he vanished.</i>

92
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:05,911
If he turns up,
we'll take him down at the auction.

93
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:08,495
Not easy.
We have no idea what he looks like.

94
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:12,006
No photographs. No one has seen
La Ciudad that has lived to tell about it.

95
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:14,465
So we'll bring the Intersect.

96
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:17,170
Everything we know
was fed into that computer.

97
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:20,349
No, it's too dangerous.
He has no field experience or training.

98
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,220
He'll be fine. It's an art auction.

99
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,684
Listen, it is way too scary out there.

100
00:06:24,856 --> 00:06:27,394
Chuck can't leave the Buy More.
We're still finding ourselves.

101
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:31,273
No offense, but my brother
has spent a few years finding himself.

102
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:34,061
And he's proven that his place
is not at the Buy More.

103
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:37,033
You don't understand.
He is a fragile little gelding.

104
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:41,157
You know, still trying to find his legs.
The real world will crush him.

105
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,406
Do you know what a gelding is?

106
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:48,497
<i>It's that weird creature
from The Dark Crystal.</i>

107
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:50,130
"Smells like gelding. " That guy.

108
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:51,496
He'll be fine.

109
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:54,295
- La Ciudad probably won't even be there.
- And if he is?

110
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:57,006
<i>- Is it worth the risk?
- All right, I've heard enough.</i>

111
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:58,259
<i>Put him in the field.</i>

112
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,218
<i>We don't know what he's capable of
until he's been tested.</i>

113
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:04,559
What he needs is something
to challenge him. Test his limitations.

114
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:06,223
A brush with his own mortality.

115
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:08,888
- You know what I'm thinking?
- I have no idea.

116
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:11,266
Dude, you're way off the reservation.

117
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:13,359
Class 5 white-water rapids.

118
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:17,479
Just the two of us this weekend,
near-death experience, awesome.

119
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:20,363
That sounds great,
but my wet suit's at the dry cleaners.

120
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:23,323
That is a terrible idea.
That's way too dangerous.

121
00:07:23,497 --> 00:07:26,451
I agree, I'm not comfortable
with you spending time together.

122
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,377
Well, Chuck hasn't said a word.
What do you wanna do?

123
00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:31,875
I'm just gonna hit the sack.
Good night, Team Bartowski.

124
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:34,837
That's great work, guys.

125
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,250
You see what you're doing here?
It's awesome.

126
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:39,006
- Oh!
- Congratulations, Chuck.

127
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:42,465
You just got your first mission.
Tomorrow night.

128
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:45,508
Hope you're ready for the real world.

129
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:24,880
Dress attire for this evening sneakers,
or we classifying this as a shoe event?

130
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:26,138
We rented you a tux.

131
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,389
Oh, that's very ni...

132
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,055
- How did you know my size?
- NSA.

133
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,230
We've records of your rental information
from prom night.

134
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,231
- I checked the suit in your closet.
- This is my first foray into spy work.

135
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:38,277
So you could ease up on the sarcasm.

136
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:41,282
How am I supposed to recognize
La Ciudad? Is there a picture?

137
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,775
If there's a photograph,
why would we need you?

138
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:45,696
- What did we just talk about?
- Sorry.

139
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,246
We're hoping something
triggers a flash.

140
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:50,083
See, that's all you had to say.
Now, hand-to-hand combat.

141
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,085
In all seriousness,
if it comes down to me and La Ciudad...

142
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:55,495
...is there a tutorial
you can take me through?

143
00:08:55,672 --> 00:08:58,210
Don't worry.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

144
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:00,257
Assuming you know how to tango.

145
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:01,838
Seriously?

146
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:04,384
Oh, I don't joke about your life.

147
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:08,679
- Right.
- Chuck, your girlfriend's here.

148
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,679
Oh, one minute, I've computers to fix.

149
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:12,728
Don't worry about it, we got it.

150
00:09:12,898 --> 00:09:14,308
- Only a few left.
- You sure?

151
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:17,229
Done, next time I have a date,
you're gonna cover for me.

152
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:18,647
Okay, great. Thanks, team.

153
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,362
I'll see you tomorrow.

154
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,772
Thanks, team.
Where you lovebirds headed?

155
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:26,069
Oh, we're actually going
to an art auction at the Wilshire Grand.

156
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:28,569
Oh, swanky. Yeah, I like it, man.

157
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:31,320
- Aren't we moving a little too fast?
- No.

158
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:34,833
Career, girl. Guy's got it all.

159
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:37,873
The idea with a cover
is to keep it as simple as possible...

160
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:40,087
...without revealing
true personal detail.

161
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,793
Any thoughts on a name?

162
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:45,377
Charles Carmichael? Simple, dignified.

163
00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:47,382
Easy to remember
and not far off from...

164
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:51,804
Graduated with honors from Stanford,
runs a successful software company...

165
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:54,849
...semi-retired, and is considering
entering America's Cup.

166
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,393
Have you done this before?

167
00:09:57,108 --> 00:10:00,857
Let's just say, Mr. Carmichael and I
share a small kinship.

168
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:03,523
How's that?

169
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:06,450
When I first entered Stanford...

170
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:09,488
...it's kind of where I envisioned
myself being by now.

171
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:12,663
Except for the sailing part,
I don't know where that came from.

172
00:10:12,832 --> 00:10:14,991
But he's where most of my class
already is.

173
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,372
So, what happened?

174
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,996
My life took a little detour
senior year...

175
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:22,997
...when our old friend Bryce Larkin
discovered stolen tests under my bed.

176
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:26,461
- Was kind enough to alert administration.
- Did you steal the tests?

177
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,217
I thought it was kind of implied
that I'm a decent person.

178
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:31,843
Well, we all make mistakes.

179
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,520
And I've made plenty.
That just wasn't one of them.

180
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:39,055
Then Bryce sent me database
of government secrets...

181
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:42,437
...now locked in my brain,
keeping me in a constant state of fear...

182
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:43,774
...danger and anxiety.

183
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:45,227
So I'd say we're even.

184
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:46,728
Don't worry about tonight.

185
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:49,529
No reason to be nervous.
I'm not gonna leave your side.

186
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:53,075
Me, nervous? Come on, never.

187
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,080
Your hand is a little moist.

188
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,165
It does that when I'm freaking out.

189
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:00,294
Hey, sis?

190
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:03,630
Hey, sis, um,
do you know how to tango?

191
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,507
No, why?

192
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:09,259
Uh, no reason, I just have a date tonight.
I thought it might come up.

193
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:11,674
You're tangoing on a date?

194
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:15,348
That's new territory. Good to see you
reaching outside your comfort zone.

195
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,520
Considering my comfort zone
extends to the end of that couch...

196
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:20,481
...new territory
was bound to come up.

197
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,764
Did someone say tango?

198
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:24,184
No, thank you, Captain Awesome.
I'll look it up online.

199
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:26,769
Would you please
put on a robe or something?

200
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:28,739
Did a semester abroad
in Buenos Aires.

201
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:32,241
<i>Spent many a night tangoing my way
into señoritas pantalones.</i>

202
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:29,674
And go.

203
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,792
There's no way he's gonna break
the two-minute record.

204
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:34,051
Oh, there.

205
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:36,974
It's okay, sweetheart.
Lester is right here.

206
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:39,677
Sorry to interrupt.

207
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:42,558
But we found just a few more
down by the loading dock.

208
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:44,356
Where's Bartowski?

209
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:47,016
On a date with a smoking-hot
wiener girl. No biggie.

210
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:49,352
And he left you all here?
Good leadership.

211
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:50,982
Real good.

212
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:53,653
Well, shouldn't be too difficult
to get these done by morning.

213
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:56,530
I'll leave the coffee pot on.

214
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:01,958
Done.

215
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:04,705
What are those?

216
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,245
- Morgan, what are those?
- Dang.

217
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:14,546
Here, this is for you.

218
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:18,256
Inside is a GPS tracking system.
That way, you can't run away from me.

219
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:21,802
If you flash on anyone, tell me
immediately, then stay out of the way.

220
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,804
Absolutely.
Yeah, I always run from a fight.

221
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:29,850
This isn't a joke. No one who's seen
La Ciudad alive has lived to tell about it.

222
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,822
Seriously, what are my chances
of getting into trouble?

223
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:35,659
You'll be fine.
Assuming you know how to tango.

224
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:38,399
Did some preparation.
Wouldn't call myself an expert...

225
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:41,069
Why would he need to know
how to tango? Is that code?

226
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:44,332
No, not... No, he told me
that I needed to know how to tango.

227
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:51,333
- Spy humor. I like that.
- You ready?

228
00:13:52,384 --> 00:13:55,301
Right here. That's right, thank you.

229
00:13:56,513 --> 00:13:59,929
Okay, wait, wait, where's everybody
going? We got computers to fix.

230
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:02,632
- Sorry, I got my bar mitzvah lesson.
- Internet poker.

231
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:05,931
- I'm off by 8 and hammered by 8:05.
- What about Chuck Bartowski?

232
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:07,642
What about our fearless leader?

233
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:09,191
- We owe him.
- For what?

234
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:12,900
Because Chuck Bartowski's going
where none of us have ever gone before.

235
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:16,363
- Intercourse with a beautiful woman.
- Speak for yourself.

236
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:17,778
- Interesting.
- Interesting.

237
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,149
Yeah, we could chitchat...

238
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:20,738
- I'm out of here.
I gotta go.

239
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:22,952
Anna.
- Okay, okay, fine.

240
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,533
See you, guys.

241
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,159
Big Mike will just give the position
to Harry Tang.

242
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,376
Oh, have I got your attention now?

243
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:34,213
Good. Good, because you know
what that means?

244
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:36,335
No more two-hour lunch breaks.

245
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:39,428
No more Xbox tournaments.

246
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:41,507
No more porn.

247
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:42,797
Yeah, yeah.

248
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:44,595
Total work hell.

249
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:48,312
I'm in,
but your boy better close the deal.

250
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,438
- Let's do this.
- Okay, thanks a lot, Les.

251
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:51,687
Don't touch me.

252
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,896
I'm gonna talk about this girl thing.
Hey, Jeff, attaboy.

253
00:15:03,496 --> 00:15:05,323
Oh, nice. Yes, thank you.

254
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,999
Sir.

255
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,284
Oh, nice.

256
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,209
I've been a spy all of five seconds, and
I already have soy sauce on my shirt.

257
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:14,579
Well, go and wash it off.

258
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:18,257
And, Chuck,
stop saying that you're a spy.

259
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:20,966
Right. Of course.

260
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:28,763
Idiot.

261
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,239
Do we know each other?

262
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,608
No.

263
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:46,075
No, not that I know of.

264
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:47,622
Sorry.

265
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:58,631
- It's him.
- Who?

266
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,712
La Ciudad.

267
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:05,763
Come here.

268
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:15,142
All right, we've already
identified the perp, as it were.

269
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:16,728
What are we still doing here?

270
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:19,440
I mean, you know,
mission accomplished, time to go.

271
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:22,194
Chuck, go wait at the bar.

272
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,944
Go wait at the bar? Okay.

273
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:28,036
You go do what you do,
I'm gonna be at the bar waiting there.

274
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:30,162
Covering that whole area.

275
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:36,202
Ahem.
- Drink, sir?

276
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,460
Yeah, I'd like a martini, barkeep,
shaken and stirred. Thank you.

277
00:16:40,676 --> 00:16:42,550
Would you like a cherry with that?

278
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:44,304
Chuck Bartowski?

279
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:47,223
No, name's Carmichael...

280
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:48,713
Alan Watterman. Stanford?

281
00:16:49,393 --> 00:16:51,551
- Hey, how are you? Hey, you, hey.
- Hey.

282
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,554
I'm great, I don't know if you heard,
I sold my company. Kind of unemployed.

283
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:57,933
Problem is, I'm too young to retire.

284
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,233
- I'm too rich to work.
- Ah, ha-ha-ha.

285
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:02,772
That's quite a pickle
you've found yourself in.

286
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:06,816
What are you doing now? Last I heard,
you were fixing computers or something.

287
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:10,908
Yeah, you know, just kind of weighing
my options right now.

288
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:13,537
You know, I may be getting
a managerial position...

289
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,200
...at an electronics conglomerate,
so, you know.

290
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,496
I knew you'd make something
of yourself.

291
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:21,287
- Who you here with?
- My date, she's right over there.

292
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:24,677
Whoa.

293
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:25,960
She's with you?

294
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:29,468
Ouch.

295
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:32,845
- We have a very open relationship.
- Well, hey, give me a call.

296
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:36,729
You know, if you need help
with the whole job thing. I know people.

297
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:37,978
- I bet you do.
- Yeah.

298
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,893
- Yeah.
- There you go.

299
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:50,114
Insider trading and offshore accounts
in the Caymans.

300
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:52,363
What did you just say?

301
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,324
Do you work for the SEC? I gotta go.

302
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:57,877
<i>Something fishy going on.</i>

303
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:01,496
I know you think Chuck's a great guy,
but that wiener girl is super hot.

304
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:03,167
Even for me.

305
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:05,418
It's obvious, dude. She's a pro.

306
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:08,879
Are you kidding? You think Chuck
could afford her if she was a pro?

307
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:12,175
All right, enough crapping about her.
Break time's over, let's go.

308
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,509
- Who's up for a game of "Deer Hunter"?
- Done.

309
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:16,928
No, no, no.
Guys, work now, play later, okay?

310
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:18,350
We got hard drives to fix.

311
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:21,097
Look at this place, come on, lookit.
Let's go.

312
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,438
No!

313
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:29,033
Oh, no.

314
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,449
Oh, no. Oh, no, what?

315
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,863
The lock is broken, man.
You need a key to open it.

316
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,618
Then get the key, Jeff.

317
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,079
There's only two keys.

318
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,497
Harry Tang has one.

319
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:43,496
And old Chuck has the other one.

320
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,835
- Where you going? Anna, don't go.
Nincompoop.

321
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:51,585
No, no, no, come on.
Old computers freak me out.

322
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:53,466
Somebody give me a hand
and help me.

323
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:55,302
Chuck, get me out of here, please!

324
00:18:57,854 --> 00:18:58,933
Hit me again.

325
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:16,239
You stay.

326
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,868
Stay? Like a dog.

327
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,746
Beautiful painting.
- What's that?

328
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:11,927
Yeah.

329
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:14,383
Beautiful painting. Yeah, it's...

330
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:16,554
It definitely has a quality about it.

331
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:19,886
Very, I would say,
Bob Rossian in its influence.

332
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:22,848
- Who?
- Bob Ross. Bob, you know Bob Ross.

333
00:20:23,064 --> 00:20:28,141
The guy who used to paint on PBS
with the afro and the soothing...

334
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,775
- You've no idea what I'm talking about.
- Sorry.

335
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:33,733
It won't be the first time.

336
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:35,450
- I'm Malena.
- Hi, Chuck.

337
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,739
Charles.

338
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,200
Charles Carmichael.

339
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:44,116
- So you don't like the painting.
- No, I... It seems very lovely.

340
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:47,460
I'm just more interested in the frame,
but that, you don't...

341
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,504
So sorry. So sorry about this.

342
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:56,551
Work, never leaves you alone.

343
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,679
I'm in the software game so...

344
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,049
- So you were saying about the frame?
- Nothing.

345
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,552
It doesn't really actually matter. Sorry.

346
00:21:03,771 --> 00:21:06,178
- Champagne?
- Sure, yeah.

347
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:08,978
- Thank you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

348
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:19,450
What's your real name,
and who do you work for?

349
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:23,748
Mm.

350
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,161
I love a tango.

351
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,783
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. Who doesn't?

352
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:30,587
Do you?

353
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,332
Do I wanna...? Uh...

354
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:37,095
Um...

355
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,295
You know what? What the hell.

356
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:41,216
Yeah, let's give it a shot.

357
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:45,804
What are you doing here? Please don't
lie, it will make this much more painful.

358
00:21:57,074 --> 00:21:59,909
- Mr. Carmichael...
- Please, Chuck.

359
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:04,618
Chuck, I think your hand
is supposed to be on my hip.

360
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:06,328
Right.

361
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,913
Apparently, I learned the girl's part
of this dance.

362
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:13,543
- Would you mind leading?
- Not at all.

363
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:21,005
Federal agents. Don't move.

364
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:22,260
Don't you move.

365
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,899
- International agents, Ml6.
- Drop your gun.

366
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:34,778
- We're British Secret Service.
- Lower your weapon.

367
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:43,780
Everyone take a deep breath.

368
00:22:43,954 --> 00:22:47,323
I'm putting down my gun,
and I'm getting my identification.

369
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:48,786
Slowly.

370
00:23:06,393 --> 00:23:09,180
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.

371
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,477
We've been pursuing an arms dealer.

372
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,607
- Let me guess, La Ciudad?
- That's right.

373
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,527
Ml6 intercepted a painting
with plutonium hidden in the frame.

374
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,244
Rather than announce the bust...

375
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:29,659
...we removed the plutonium and kept
the auction in the hope of luring Ciudad.

376
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,121
If you're not La Ciudad,
then where is he?

377
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,553
Help.

378
00:23:50,437 --> 00:23:51,979
Oh, okay, okay, so listen to me.

379
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:55,516
My friend is at some sort of art function
at your hotel, okay?

380
00:23:55,692 --> 00:23:58,017
Now listen to me clearly.
I need to speak to him.

381
00:23:58,194 --> 00:23:59,986
It's a matter of life and death.

382
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:01,186
Describe your friend.

383
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:03,736
<i>Good-looking, depends on your angle.</i>

384
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:06,399
He's not classically handsome,
I wouldn't say he is.

385
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:10,410
But he makes up for it with charm, lots
of charm. And he's kind of a lost soul.

386
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,582
Does this thing when he's nervous.
He laughs, he goes, "Ah, ha, ha. "

387
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:15,246
Anyways, what? What?

388
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,496
Brown hair, 6' 1 ".
Does that help at all?

389
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:21,130
What line of work are you in, Malena?

390
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:23,293
Why are you so interested,
Mr. Carmichael?

391
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,761
No reason, just making conversation.

392
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,881
Excuse me, sir.
Are you Chuck Bartowski?

393
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,263
Who, me? No.

394
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:34,224
<i>- No, I'm Carmichael.
- That's him, I can hear his voice.</i>

395
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:35,428
<i>Hey, Chuck!</i>

396
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:37,266
Are you sure you're not Mr. Bartowski?

397
00:24:37,483 --> 00:24:39,690
- Your friend insists.
- No, no, I insist.

398
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:42,945
I've never heard that name in my life.

399
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:44,354
I gotta go. Excuse me.

400
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,321
Why don't we head up to my room now,
Mr. Carmichael?

401
00:24:50,538 --> 00:24:52,946
And find out who you really are?

402
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,583
Oh, okay.

403
00:25:00,006 --> 00:25:02,627
Oh, so I guess we should regroup
in the morning?

404
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,879
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

405
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:05,546
No, wait. Where you guys going?

406
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,796
Dude, it's just
this is out of my pay grade.

407
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:11,092
I gotta get some serious alcohol in me
or I am never gonna sleep.

408
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:12,726
I'm sorry, Morgan. Be strong.

409
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:15,182
No, don't leave me in here
with these computers.

410
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:19,482
Hand me a slice, some water, I need
to survive through the night, and I...

411
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,265
Not cool.

412
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:37,704
Let's start with an easy one.

413
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:40,872
- What's your real name?
- Carmichael. Charles Carmichael.

414
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:49,960
- Chuck Bartowski.
- That wasn't so hard.

415
00:25:50,556 --> 00:25:53,640
Now, before you answer
my next question...

416
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,304
...I want you to think long and hard
about my options here.

417
00:25:57,521 --> 00:26:00,522
There's the old favorite.

418
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:02,767
Yank out a tooth.

419
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:04,817
Too noisy.

420
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:06,565
Cut off a toe.

421
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:08,363
- That's too messy.
- Far too messy.

422
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:12,567
Or we can chuck you off the balcony,
Chuck.

423
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,695
Probably land face first.

424
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:17,912
Teeth go through the back
of your head.

425
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,039
Tsk, tsk. Not a good way to go.

426
00:26:21,253 --> 00:26:24,456
So here's my question:

427
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,876
Who do you work for?

428
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:30,928
No one.

429
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:34,216
No, no, stop, stop. I fix computers
for a living, I swear to God.

430
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:38,389
I snuck into the party under a fake name
to impress a girl. Please, put chair down.

431
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:40,851
- Goodbye, Chuck.
No, no, no, it's a setup.

432
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:43,140
What is?

433
00:26:43,317 --> 00:26:44,811
The painting, the painting.

434
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:48,603
The painting, I think the painting
might be a fake or something.

435
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:51,065
- Why?
- Lf you put me down, I'll tell you.

436
00:26:55,871 --> 00:26:58,362
<i>I saw a photo of the painting
in the LA Times, okay?</i>

437
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,039
But it had a different frame. So
I'm assuming somebody swapped it out.

438
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,164
- I would not buy that painting.
- A fake painting.

439
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:07,331
And you had no intention
of bidding on it?

440
00:27:07,924 --> 00:27:10,629
Me bid? No, not unless
they were selling it for 25 bucks.

441
00:27:10,802 --> 00:27:13,376
- What I have in my decorating budget.
Okay.

442
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:16,390
Tell me how to fix a computer, Chuck.

443
00:27:24,024 --> 00:27:27,974
My first inclination's that your bus speed
isn't up to snuff with your video card.

444
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:30,940
We're talking about a PC, right?
Is your memory dedicated?

445
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:33,356
That's enough, Mr. Bartowski.
I believe you.

446
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,200
Problem is, since you've seen me,
now I have to kill you.

447
00:27:37,412 --> 00:27:40,746
Have to? No, no, no, I disagree.
I disagree vehemently, vehemently.

448
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,410
I won't say anything, I swear.

449
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:44,992
You don't know the things
I know about people.

450
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:49,714
Don't worry, it will be fast.

451
00:27:49,883 --> 00:27:51,922
Goodbye, Mr. Bartowski.

452
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:53,588
I enjoyed our tango.

453
00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:57,257
I didn't like it that much though.

454
00:27:57,432 --> 00:27:58,926
- He was kind of silly.
Really?

455
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,010
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi.

456
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:14,741
They're onto us.
The SEC knows everything.

457
00:28:14,949 --> 00:28:17,322
Shelly, they know about the Caymans.

458
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:18,780
Oh!

459
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:20,703
I surrender, I surrender.

460
00:28:20,914 --> 00:28:22,871
Chuck, get down.
- Aah!

461
00:28:25,502 --> 00:28:27,708
Unh. Sarah, help!

462
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:31,082
Let's do this. Okay.

463
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,429
Oh, my God.

464
00:28:44,437 --> 00:28:45,765
Hey, Chuck, are you okay?

465
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:48,180
Okay? Okay, two more seconds
and I'd be dead.

466
00:28:48,358 --> 00:28:49,768
They were gonna throw me off.

467
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:53,228
- You tell them you work for us?
- Of course not. Where were you guys?

468
00:28:53,404 --> 00:28:56,441
You're still alive.
I'd consider myself lucky.

469
00:28:56,658 --> 00:29:00,027
- We have to get you out of the country.
- But first we take him out.

470
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:16,964
- Hey.
- Hey.

471
00:29:17,136 --> 00:29:19,461
- How was the big date?
- It was good, great, fine.

472
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:22,556
- I'm gonna go to bed. I love you.
- What? No, no, no.

473
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:25,050
Is that all I get? Come on.

474
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:28,347
Sit down, I wanna know, you know.
Do you like this girl?

475
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,098
It's... You know, it's complicated.

476
00:29:31,818 --> 00:29:34,688
Well, explain it to me slowly.
I'll catch up.

477
00:29:36,197 --> 00:29:38,024
She's a very beautiful girl.

478
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:40,734
Good. Go on.

479
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,653
And she's very agile.

480
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:45,861
I'm not sure how that applies,
but continue.

481
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,076
And I think
she's too exhausting for me.

482
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:52,619
Well, what happened?
Did you guys tango?

483
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:55,667
Oh, yeah, yeah, we tangoed.
In fact, we tangoed quite a bit.

484
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:58,629
But Awesome taught me
the woman's part of the tango.

485
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:01,715
So it was a little difficult,
as one might expect.

486
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:05,139
What's up, bro?
Did you do the famous dip?

487
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:07,842
Yeah, I was on the receiving end
of that dip.

488
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,642
- You did tango with a woman, right?
- And on that note...

489
00:30:10,815 --> 00:30:13,685
No, no, no,
you're not getting off that easy.

490
00:30:15,236 --> 00:30:16,979
Why won't you talk to me?

491
00:30:17,154 --> 00:30:18,862
It's...

492
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:23,366
Look, it's complicated, okay?
Just let it go.

493
00:30:23,536 --> 00:30:24,734
Fine.

494
00:30:24,912 --> 00:30:28,079
You don't wanna talk to me,
I suggest you find someone to talk to.

495
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:32,081
Like maybe your idiot friend.
He's called about 75 times.

496
00:30:32,253 --> 00:30:36,630
He locked himself in a storage cage,
whatever that means.

497
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:01,314
Oh, God. It's you.

498
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,233
Dude, you have no idea the night...

499
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:07,193
Okay, okay, okay, settle down.
Settle down, settle down, it's all good.

500
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:08,450
What happened?

501
00:31:08,622 --> 00:31:10,033
Oh, what happened?

502
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:12,365
Tang showed up,
and he dropped all these off.

503
00:31:12,543 --> 00:31:16,540
I guess he was stashing them,
you know, so...

504
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:18,457
All right, let's do this.

505
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:21,419
What are you talk...?
You don't know how to fix a computer.

506
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:24,049
Moral support, man.
Never leave your wingman, okay?

507
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:26,012
Something your team
could learn about.

508
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:28,968
Look, it's okay, man.
Go get some sleep, okay?

509
00:31:29,142 --> 00:31:32,013
You sure? Because you say the word,
and we go down together.

510
00:31:32,187 --> 00:31:35,521
I appreciate that, but it will be nice
to do something I'm good at.

511
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:38,360
- So I'll see you.
- Fantastic, see you later, good night.

512
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:39,986
Good night.

513
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,255
You finished, Bartowski?

514
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:10,092
- Mission accomplished.
- Whoa.

515
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:13,137
Two days is an incentive,
I didn't think you'd really do it.

516
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:15,684
I'm impressed.
And I'm not a man easily impressed.

517
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:18,394
Well, I think you should know
that I only fixed the last few.

518
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:22,481
Uh, my team deserve the credit, and
you're only as good as your team so...

519
00:32:22,654 --> 00:32:23,852
First rule of management:

520
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,940
Always take credit.

521
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:30,736
- Hope we can sell all this crap.
- Sir, there's been a major infraction.

522
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:33,617
Drinking alcoholic beverages
on the property.

523
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:37,076
Nothing wrong with a man wetting
his whistle every once in a while.

524
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:40,169
- Keep it out of the store, Bartowski.
- Yeah, absolutely, sir.

525
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:43,505
You get extra points for style.
Looking sharp.

526
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,506
You look like a waiter.

527
00:32:50,557 --> 00:32:51,719
Kiss-ass.

528
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:53,801
Was I scared?
Yeah, yeah, I was scared.

529
00:32:53,977 --> 00:32:55,934
But then the survival instinct
kicked in.

530
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:59,021
Something I didn't even know
I possessed. A desire to live.

531
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,562
Good news is,
I may be able to retire off of this.

532
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:05,435
Talked to Big Mike, he'd be hearing from
my attorneys. That cage is a fire hazard.

533
00:33:05,613 --> 00:33:06,942
Chuck.

534
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:09,191
- Good work last night.
- Okay, you know what?

535
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,443
I'm working on an all-nighter here,
big guy.

536
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:13,612
And I realize
that you are probably armed.

537
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:15,615
And so I'm gonna ask you
very nicely...

538
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,830
...would you please ease up
on the sarcasm?

539
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:20,670
I wasn't being facetious.
You helped us find La Ciudad.

540
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:23,714
- But she got away.
- We got a photo from hotel security.

541
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:26,419
We had a blood sample
from a broken window.

542
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:28,881
Intel tells us she's heading
to Central America.

543
00:33:29,053 --> 00:33:30,595
We have people waiting there.

544
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:33,049
- You're looking sharp.
- Oh, thanks.

545
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:36,298
That was facetious, idiot.

546
00:33:36,477 --> 00:33:39,182
I fixed this one personally,
so it should be good as new.

547
00:33:39,355 --> 00:33:41,395
And sorry about the delay.

548
00:34:06,507 --> 00:34:08,749
Chuck, hiding from work again?

549
00:34:08,968 --> 00:34:12,218
I think
I dropped something. Go away, Harry.

550
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:14,677
You wish I would.
I'm not going anywhere, Chuck.

551
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:18,633
When you go to sleep at night, all you're
gonna see is Tang in your face. Ha-ha-ha.

552
00:34:18,811 --> 00:34:20,602
Excuse, please.

553
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:22,604
Where can I find a Chuck Bartowski?

554
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,140
- Uh, why? What's he done?
- Because I need to speak to him.

555
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,735
Okay, well, if he's in any kind of trouble,
let me know.

556
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:33,607
Chuck, you have a visitor.

557
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:36,818
Chuck?

558
00:34:36,996 --> 00:34:39,617
Well, uh, maybe
I can help you, sir, I...

559
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:04,686
I think we have some company.

560
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:07,229
- I'm on it.
- Chuck Bartowski, to the storage cage.

561
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:09,857
Chuck Bartowski,
please report to the storage cage.

562
00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:14,073
- Where's the storage cage?
- Oh, just through here, sir. I'll show you.

563
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:49,604
By the way, we're having a big sale on
refrigerators, in case you didn't notice.

564
00:35:49,818 --> 00:35:51,941
- Whoa.
- Where is he?

565
00:35:52,112 --> 00:35:55,398
- Where is Chuck Bartowski?
- Oh, sir, I'm just a salesclerk.

566
00:35:55,616 --> 00:35:56,896
Take me to him now.

567
00:36:44,414 --> 00:36:46,656
Okay. Ha, ha.

568
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:51,418
Oh, you. Ha-ha-ha.
You got... Big old guy in the thing...

569
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,037
That was so broken this morning.

570
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:10,312
Now that's what I call
moving some merchandise, yeah?

571
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,525
Yup.

572
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:06,949
Hang here.

573
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:11,206
Uh, Charles Irving Bartowski
of the Encino Bartowski's...

574
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,285
...could you please report
to the Returns Desk?

575
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:17,044
Charles Irving Bartowski, re...

576
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,748
- What?
- Nothing. I'm just loving this thing, man.

577
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:23,418
You know what?
We should get one for your apartment.

578
00:38:23,596 --> 00:38:27,179
Oh, good news. They fixed
the lock on the storage cage so...

579
00:38:28,726 --> 00:38:30,137
What?

580
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:38,067
I'm really sorry, sis.
I know that I've been kind of evasive.

581
00:38:38,236 --> 00:38:39,896
It's just that I...

582
00:38:40,071 --> 00:38:44,531
I didn't wanna lie, and I chose not saying
anything as being the lesser of two evils.

583
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,780
Why would you have to lie?

584
00:38:45,952 --> 00:38:48,621
Ellie, trust me and know
it has nothing to do with you.

585
00:38:48,788 --> 00:38:49,950
You want me to butt out.

586
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:55,413
- I get it, it's none of my business.
- No, no, no, I'm not saying that, I...

587
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:59,204
I don't wanna create false excitement
for a relationship that seems doomed.

588
00:38:59,382 --> 00:39:02,336
Well, why is it doomed?

589
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,419
Because she's not into me.

590
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:07,679
Oh, trust me, I have seen the way
that that girl looks at you...

591
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,758
...and she is into you.

592
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:12,097
Really?

593
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,346
It's none of my business.

594
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:17,308
Okay, no. Okay, fine, what the hell.

595
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:19,392
What do you wanna ask me
about Sarah?

596
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,985
Really?

597
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:23,312
You better hurry up,
this offer will not last.

598
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:25,482
Okay. Do you like her?

599
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:29,654
- Yeah.
- Oh.

600
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,370
Hap! No, no unnecessary excitements.

601
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:36,577
Ahem. Sorry. Sorry.

602
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:37,867
- What else?
- That's it.

603
00:39:38,087 --> 00:39:40,578
- That's it?
- Yeah, Chuck, that's it.

604
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:42,749
I don't need to know
the intimate details.

605
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,498
As long as you're happy,
that's enough for me. And I don't...

606
00:39:45,678 --> 00:39:47,836
I don't wanna nag you
about your future and job.

607
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:52,509
- Don't wanna be the sister that pesters...
- No, no, no, you're not a pest.

608
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:57,061
I just know what an incredible guy
Charles Bartowski is.

609
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:01,770
And sometimes,
I'm not so sure that he knows it.

610
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,643
How do you feel
about a brother-sister hug right now?

611
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:07,193
- I'm open to it.
- Okay.

612
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:11,650
Okay, hold on.

613
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:17,746
Sorry, I thought we had plans tonight,
you know.

614
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,081
What is she doing here?

615
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:20,795
What gave you that impression?

616
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:25,049
Oh, when you were leaving earlier
and you were like, "See you later, dude. "

617
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:26,968
Took you at your word.

618
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,836
It's cool, if you didn't want me here,
just stop giving me mixed signals.

619
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:36,178
- Come on in.
- Super, awesome. What are we having?

620
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:40,520
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

621
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,143
Mwah. Ouch.

622
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:44,649
- You okay?
- Uh, occupational hazard.

623
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:48,190
She got in a lucky kick.

624
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:51,695
The wine's from both of us.

625
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:11,013
Congratulations on your first mission.

626
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:14,014
- You did really good, Chuck.
- Stop it.

627
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:15,297
I'm not really a spy.

628
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:19,093
Your computer ended up in the head of
a guy who only knows how to fix them.

629
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:22,390
You survived a near-death experience
under the threat of torture.

630
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:24,439
Apprehended
one of the most elusive killers.

631
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:26,519
I'm not sure what you think spies do...

632
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:28,771
...but most of us consider that
a good day.

633
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,068
Okay, sure.

634
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,241
So today, I helped take down
a major international arms dealer.

635
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,608
But tomorrow...

636
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:38,404
Tomorrow, I still gotta go clock in
at Buy More.

637
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:41,073
What's good of being a hero
if nobody knows about it?

638
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,376
You know.

639
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,837
And so do I.

640
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:51,002
You know, if we were really dating...

641
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:54,297
...this'd be the part where I'd be forced
to kiss you good night.

642
00:41:54,472 --> 00:41:55,848
Forced?

643
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:58,139
Would it be so bad?

644
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,267
I'm sure I could suffer through it.

645
00:42:01,646 --> 00:42:03,271
Me too.

646
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,572
Man, that dude is creepy.

647
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:26,455
Agreed.
