1
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:11,289
Oh, boy. Wait.
Go back, go back, go back.

2
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:13,909
That is God and a surgeon
working in harmony.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,287
Here comes the schwarma girl.

4
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:20,281
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

5
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:21,954
Here you guys go.

6
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:25,459
Be careful, it's hot. I don't want
for you to burn your tongue on it.

7
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:30,453
- Uh...
- Wow, 29 orders this month.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,416
One more and you'll get
a free baba ghanoush.

9
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:35,962
I'm reaching in my pocket for money,
not for...

10
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:38,291
Hey, do you have change?

11
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:41,795
Oh, she's... Did you get it?

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,761
- Fellas.
- Oh, boy.

13
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,471
What are you guys doing?

14
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:49,303
Or have you forgotten about
Big Mike's policy on Mammary Cam?

15
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:51,964
I don't know what you're talking about,
Chuck.

16
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:56,637
He doesn't know? So you didn't remove
the offending video from the camcorder...

17
00:00:56,811 --> 00:00:59,301
...and hand it to Lester,
who's now hiding it behind his back?

18
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,637
What? Wow, my feelings are hurt.

19
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:04,813
Charles, after all these years,
where's the trust, my friend?

20
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,225
In Jeff's sweaty palms,
along with the amateur consumer porn.

21
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,978
- Look...
- Hey, Chuck?

22
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:11,810
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?

23
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:13,065
Move.

24
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:16,355
Awesome to see you, Devon.

25
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,154
- Yeah. Yeah. What's up?
- All right.

26
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:20,195
- So, what's on your mind?
- Chuck, I was...

27
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,937
- I was hoping to talk to you about Ellie.
- Yeah?

28
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,147
Yeah, yeah, of course.

29
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:27,574
Well, you know,
ever since, um, we've been dating...

30
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:30,661
...I've come to think of you
as that little brother I never had.

31
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,694
- Don't you have two younger brothers?
- Indeed. Indeed.

32
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:38,406
But you seem like someone who can offer
sage wisdom in confusing times...

33
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:41,667
...and this is one of those times
I am really confused, bro.

34
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,662
I don't know how to put this into words.

35
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:50,961
- That's a bug.
- What? What?

36
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:52,839
Spider? I hate those fuzzy bastards.

37
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:56,007
I think, uh, no, you got him. He was like:
"Rrr," and then: "Boo!" Gone.

38
00:01:56,176 --> 00:01:59,129
Can you excuse me? I think
I just saw a kid crawling into an oven...

39
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:01,127
...over in Home Appliances.

40
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:04,339
Chuck. Chuck, I need you
to drop some knowledge, bro.

41
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:07,756
Keep moving, Bartowksi.
Nothing to see here.

42
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:09,674
Not even if I had the time.

43
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:14,633
You're getting sloppy, Casey. I understand
you have some perverse desire...

44
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:17,846
...to listen to everybody. But you
really need to be careful hiding your bugs.

45
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,680
What are you lip-smacking about?

46
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:22,012
I just found this on one of our
product displays...

47
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:24,062
...and not very well hidden, I might add.

48
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,017
Normally, I'm a fan of your craftsmanship,
if not your methods.

49
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:28,817
Look, all I'm saying is that something...

50
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:31,356
...discovered by someone
could spell trouble.

51
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:35,274
You worry about that supercomputer.
Let me worry about the spy stuff, huh?

52
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,728
Don't you have a hard drive
you can go fix?

53
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:45,115
Uh-huh, uh-huh. There's best buddy
of mine. Yeah. What's up?

54
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:47,193
Okay, saw an Infinity Ward
mail in the trash...

55
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:51,695
...and that means you got a pre-release
demo of the next "Call of Duty" game?

56
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,824
Ah. Yeah, but the last time
I lent you a game sampler...

57
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:57,868
...it ended up all over the Internet.
This one's gonna stay in my locker.

58
00:02:58,042 --> 00:03:00,366
You can play it when you get
some adult supervision.

59
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:03,874
Adult sup...? I'm at the age where I should
get my prostate checked annually.

60
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:07,708
I could be trusted with an advance copy
of the next greatest game on the planet.

61
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,040
- Have you seen Awesome?
- Over by the Home Theater Room.

62
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:15,298
I think... That's... Really.

63
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,584
Hey. Hey. Sorry about that.
False alarm.

64
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:24,888
It turned out, anyway, the kid did not
end up defrosting himself as it turns out.

65
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:27,675
So, uh, what, uh...
What's going on?

66
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:30,883
This is one of those rare moments
when things are not kosher, Chuck.

67
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:35,883
Oh, man. This is harder than I thought.

68
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,435
Uh-huh.

69
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:39,227
Go... Go on. I'm listening.

70
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:42,812
Right. Well, I've been thinking a lot
about the way things are...

71
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:44,524
...between me and your sister.

72
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:49,515
And you're the man in Ellie's family,
so I was wondering...

73
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:51,235
...can I have your permission?

74
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:54,361
Can I marry Ellie?

75
00:03:56,488 --> 00:04:00,152
Wow, that... That's quite...
Quite a rock you got there.

76
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,739
- Is that a yes? Dude?
- Yes. Yes. Sorry.

77
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:07,241
I ju... You kind of... Wah! You know,
you pulled the... Blang, just right in...

78
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:09,616
- Yes, you have my blessing.
- Thank you. Thank...

79
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:12,990
It's been in my family for years.
This was my great-grandmother's.

80
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:16,994
- Ha, ha. Uh, you think she'll like it?
- Like it? She'll... She'll love it.

81
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:20,034
I'm just not sure she'll be able
to lift her hand anymore.

82
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,406
Oh, one other thing.

83
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:26,410
Ellie is a bloodhound. If I keep this
in the apartment, she will smell diamond.

84
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:30,418
Can you hold onto this for a day or so?
Till I figure out how to pop the question.

85
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:33,707
- I don't think it's actually a good idea...
- Oh, thank you. Oh, ho-ho!

86
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:35,257
Thank you so much, bro.

87
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:37,548
Hey, pretty soon
I'm gonna mean that literally.

88
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:40,090
- There you go.
- All right.

89
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,677
- We have a problem.
- What do you mean?

90
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,888
Chuck found that in the Buy More.

91
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:04,392
We have a problem.

92
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:07,932
<i>The bug Chuck found is a GLG-20,
one of the most advanced...</i>

93
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,441
<i>...counter-espionage listening devices
in the CIA arsenal.</i>

94
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,936
- This is a CIA design?
- Ha. Figures.

95
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:18,937
<i>The GLG-20 uses a low-power transmitter,
in order to avoid detection.</i>

96
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:21,570
<i>It has a maximum range
of about 20 yards.</i>

97
00:05:21,742 --> 00:05:25,272
<i>Which means there's probably a receiver
hidden somewhere inside the Buy More.</i>

98
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,534
<i>We believe it's recently
become a favorite of the Fulcrum agents.</i>

99
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,243
So you're telling us the secret government
cabal that abducted Bryce Larkin...

100
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:36,615
...and came within a hair of figuring out
that Chuck's the Intersect...

101
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,415
...is now skulking around the Buy More?

102
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:42,450
We need you to locate that receiver,
and find the person who planted it.

103
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:45,416
<i>You have 48 hours.</i>

104
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:49,204
<i>If you cannot identify
the enemy operative in that time...</i>

105
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,706
<i>...we will have no choice
but to relocate Chuck...</i>

106
00:05:51,883 --> 00:05:54,965
<i>...to a secure
government holding facility.</i>

107
00:05:57,634 --> 00:06:01,216
<i>Bartowski's time as a civilian
may be coming to an end.</i>

108
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:06,085
<i>For their own safety,
his family may never see him again.</i>

109
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,406
When are these ladies gonna learn?

110
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,364
They don't want someone taking a picture
of their business, put some drawers on.

111
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:36,974
- Hey, think we should make a run for it?
- You don't run from the cops.

112
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:39,635
- You look guilty or shot in the back.
- We are guilty.

113
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:40,892
Shh!

114
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,229
Bring me down and I will cut you.

115
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:49,146
- So no locks broken? No alarms set off?
- Nope. It's clean.

116
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:51,689
- Must be an inside job.
- Thought of that.

117
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:54,232
You think any of these dummies
can mastermind all this?

118
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:56,360
It's almost always someone
close to the operation.

119
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,780
When I find out who robbed my store
and stole my fish...

120
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,189
...I'm gonna break my foot off
in his behind.

121
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:04,109
- Oh, my God.
- Shh.

122
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,658
Hey.

123
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:07,070
Hey.

124
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:09,402
What's with the, uh,
police presence outside?

125
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:11,785
They robbed the Buy More, man.
They took everything.

126
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:17,287
- They took everything?
- Everything.

127
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,039
Oh, please, God, no.

128
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,997
Please be there. Please be there.

129
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,665
Oh, God.

130
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:32,921
The ring. They took Ellie's ring.

131
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:35,167
Oh, my God.

132
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:41,841
Oh! Oh!

133
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:44,336
- Hey.
- Chuckles, what's up?

134
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:48,010
Listen, dude, I figured out
how I'm gonna pop the Q.

135
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:50,056
The Q? What... What Q? What's a Q?

136
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:54,386
You know, the Q, the big Q you only ask
once in a lifetime.

137
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,176
Can't say right now, Mom.

138
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:58,384
Is that your mom?

139
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:01,931
Tell her that I love that kittens playing
with the yarn sweater that she knitted.

140
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:04,181
You got it, babe. Ha-ha-ha.

141
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:08,229
- I'm gonna do it while we're skydiving.
- Really?

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,558
Do you think, uh...
Do you think that's a good idea?

143
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:13,818
Not the first time in the mile-high club,
if you know what I mean.

144
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,150
Yeah, uh...

145
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:18,441
<i>Listen, skydiving is a little...
A little risky.</i>

146
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:21,816
- Don't you think? You could drop the ring.
- Whoa, hot call, dude.

147
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:23,401
Hate to lose my great-granny's ring.

148
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:26,029
<i>She gave it to me
right before she passed.</i>

149
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:28,738
You know?
She knew Ellie was the one before I did.

150
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,703
Great, great, okay so...

151
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:32,993
Just let me know
when you figure something else out.

152
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:35,488
- Okay.
- But, Devon, um...

153
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,081
- Take your time.
- You got it, brother.

154
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:53,580
Detective Conway here is convinced
that this is an inside job.

155
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:56,543
And we intend
to get to the bottom of this.

156
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:58,092
Bartowski, get over here!

157
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:02,376
You're a suspect too. You all are.

158
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:06,753
When that pig talks to you,
look him in the eye and say nothing.

159
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,308
- Zip it.
- Nothing?

160
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,549
Come on, that's incredibly rude, Jeffrey.

161
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:15,384
- Dead men tell no tales.
- Ha. Stop it. Quit messing around.

162
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,596
Bartowski, where's Casey?
Don't you two usually carpool together?

163
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:21,226
Yes. Yes, sir, we absolutely do.

164
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:24,895
But, uh, not today.

165
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:27,471
Why don't you go find out why his ass
is so tardy?

166
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,891
Someone might find that suspicious.

167
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:33,898
Sure, I can... I can do that.
I'll just... I just have to make...

168
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,860
<i>What?
- Where are you? Mike's looking for you.</i>

169
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:42,403
He's gonna be looking for both of us.
Now get down here.

170
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,778
No. Listen to me. I need you, okay?
Someone cleaned out the Buy More.

171
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:47,825
They took everything,
my sister's ring...

172
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:50,366
...the one she's supposed to wear
forever.

173
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:53,407
<i>Awesome is supposed to propose to her,
he trusted me and now it's gone.</i>

174
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:55,785
Save it for your coffee klatch, Bartowski.

175
00:10:55,957 --> 00:10:58,577
<i>Get down here.
We got bigger fish to fry.</i>

176
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,135
You robbed the Buy More?

177
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:28,128
We had no choice.
No choice? Out of your mind?

178
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:30,428
Do you have any idea
what's going on at the store?

179
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,509
That bug you found, it isn't one of ours.

180
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:35,223
- What bug? Who ours?
The one you found yesterday.

181
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:39,390
Casey only installed EM-50's.
The one you found was a GLG-20.

182
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:42,681
It requires a secondary recording device
nearby to collect the data.

183
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:45,690
- What are you talking about?
- Someone is spying on us.

184
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:49,187
- What?
- Okay, the bug you found was not ours.

185
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,233
It belongs to an enemy agent,
probably Fulcrum.

186
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,860
They planted it in the Buy More.

187
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:55,483
- Why?
- They're looking for the Intersect.

188
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:57,150
They're looking for you.

189
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:01,736
We found a total of 29 bugs just like it,
but we still haven't found the receiver.

190
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:05,073
Okay. Okay, well, wow.

191
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:06,820
Uh, extreme...

192
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:11,203
Extreme measures, but, uh,
decisive action had to be taken.

193
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:14,075
Good luck schlepping all this stuff
back to the Buy More.

194
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:16,536
Uh, I'm gonna get back there
and pretend I don't know.

195
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:18,664
Got any good tips
for beating a polygraph?

196
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,540
Chuck, wait.
- What?

197
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,627
Oh, duh, yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
Can I get my sister's ring back?

198
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:25,958
You guys are damn thorough.

199
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,003
You should be concerned
about not making...

200
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:31,876
Can I talk to you for a second? Hold on.

201
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:37,633
He can't hear it like that.
He won't process it.

202
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:40,588
How do you give a man a life sentence
just for being a good guy?

203
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,050
Okay, how about I give it a try, gently?

204
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,758
No, I don't wanna to hear your version
of it and neither does he.

205
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,254
It's a job. How come you gotta
get your lady feelings...?

206
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:50,638
- It has nothing to do...
- Agent Walker, Major Casey...

207
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,552
...you might wanna take a look at this.

208
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:59,062
This is a surveillance tape
taken during the robbery.

209
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,304
There's nothing there.
Bad guy disabled the security.

210
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,809
Wait.

211
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:06,150
Hey, that's Jeff and Lester.

212
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:08,889
<i>- It's off.
And they are apparently drunk.</i>

213
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:11,772
It appears they've mistakenly
turned the camera back on.

214
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,690
- Hang on a second, who's that?
That's the spy.

215
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,442
Who's the spy who spies on spies?

216
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,024
Why would a Fulcrum agent
want Big Mike's marlin?

217
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:26,111
Those two dilweeds interrupted
an actual robbery in progress.

218
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:28,823
- The receiver's in the fish.
- Marlin, actually.

219
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:31,532
- You would call it a marlin, right? Yeah.
- Look.

220
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:37,076
See? There you go. Done.
My job here is done.

221
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,206
So now I'm sure you super-agents
can figure out...

222
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:42,541
...where the two drunken pinheads
stashed the fish. Marlin. Four-foot marlin.

223
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:44,620
I'm gonna stick around here
and find my ring.

224
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:47,337
Hey, Chuck?

225
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:51,080
Chuck, no ring came up in our inventory.

226
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,712
What do you mean,
"No ring came up in your inventory"?

227
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:56,883
You robbed the Buy More, didn't you?
What happened to Awesome's ring?

228
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:59,256
We have some bigger-picture concerns
right now.

229
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:00,803
What could be possibly be bigger...

230
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,838
...than me ruining the chances
of my sister getting married?

231
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:08,634
The receiver may contain information
indicating that you're the Intersect.

232
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,261
Say it. Say what you're not saying.

233
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:21,178
If we don't locate the receiver
in the next 24 hours...

234
00:14:22,065 --> 00:14:26,013
You'll be stored in an bunker for so long
you'll forget what fresh air smells like.

235
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:31,898
See? That was very gentle.

236
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:39,273
One, two, three, four.

237
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:43,230
I declare a thumb war!

238
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,073
Oh! Come on, Jeffrey.

239
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:51,072
Jeff, Lester,
we gotta talk, it's important.

240
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:54,200
Here's your problem, Charlie.
Why's your time more valuable than mine?

241
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:56,447
Oh, he is taking him over the top.

242
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:58,830
- All right. Okay.
Oh, my thumb.

243
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,418
- Narc.
- Narc, narc.

244
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:04,707
Narc. Narc. Narc.

245
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:07,996
- Easy on the shirt, narc.
- Where's the fish?

246
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:09,285
Fish? What fish?

247
00:15:09,463 --> 00:15:11,255
Okay, we can do this the easy
or the hard way.

248
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,995
Easy way is I shove his foot up your ass.

249
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,582
- What's the hard way?
- I use my foot.

250
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:19,299
We've seen the surveillance
footage, guys. Okay?

251
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,294
- We know you were here.
- Yeah, right.

252
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,554
Yeah, you two geniuses thought
you were turning the cameras off...

253
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,879
...but instead, you turned them back on.

254
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:29,972
We won't say anything to Big Mike,
I promise.

255
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,137
Okay.

256
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:39,927
Whoa, what's happening?

257
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,096
Charles, would you give us
a few minutes, please?

258
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:44,727
Chuck?

259
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:48,774
- It was his idea.
- What?!

260
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:51,563
The whole reason we snuck in
was to get your ass another drink.

261
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:54,309
- You were getting the shakes.
- Not cool. It's a disease.

262
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,487
You're a disease and you've diseased
us all. Me, Chuck, this guy.

263
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:59,030
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Okay.

264
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,566
Look, Jeff,
I totally understand your plight.

265
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:05,695
We sympathize with you, okay?
And we don't judge.

266
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:08,441
Just tell us, what exactly happened?

267
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:11,867
We were across the street at Bennigan's
and I got cut off again...

268
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,912
Jeff. Ha, ha.

269
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:17,912
If you're gonna tell the story,
please, don't butcher it.

270
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,665
We were at Benni's,
enjoying the deep-fried sampler...

271
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:24,792
<i>...and we decided
to come back to the store...</i>

272
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:27,666
<i>...for a nightcap
in the boss man's private stash.</i>

273
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,329
It's off. Rock 'n' roll.

274
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:34,373
We have the store to ourselves.
We should take off all our clothes.

275
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,541
Don't make me uncomfortable
to be alone with you.

276
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:41,755
- Go get it.
- Bingo.

277
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,388
Yes.
No.

278
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:46,590
- No, no, no.
- Jeffrey.

279
00:16:46,765 --> 00:16:49,219
This is a wasted mission now.
It's a wasted mission.

280
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,635
We've gotta do something exciting, man.

281
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:55,019
We can burn it down.

282
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:00,011
I was thinking more along the lines
of a fishing expedition.

283
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:07,312
And that, friends, is the story
of the missing marlin.

284
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,558
And where is the marlin now?

285
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:12,900
Ah, I'm afraid I'm going to need
a little compensation.

286
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:17,355
- At Chuck's. We took it to Chuck's pad.
- What? My apartment? Why?

287
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:19,819
We didn't want to get busted
with Big Mike's fish.

288
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:22,657
I'm gonna need lotion.

289
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:25,279
We're pursuing the receiver.

290
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:28,201
We've the location and it
shouldn't be long before recovery.

291
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,568
Stay with the receiver.

292
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:32,699
In the meantime,
we've decided to extract Chuck.

293
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:34,910
What? But we don't know
he's in danger.

294
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:38,200
There's a chance the identity
of the Intersect has been compromised.

295
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,332
We have to err on the side of caution.

296
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:42,624
But you promised we had 48 hours.

297
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,502
<i>You know the game, Agent Walker.</i>

298
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:48,002
The order has gone out.
Chuck is coming in.

299
00:17:58,428 --> 00:18:01,546
Come on.
Chuck, you're looking for a marlin.

300
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:07,967
Hey, hey, whoa! Whoa, stop, stop.

301
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:11,176
I seriously doubt that these geniuses
had time to re-upholster the couch.

302
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:13,639
Well, it's gotta be here somewhere.

303
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,513
Chuck?

304
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,012
- Hey, sis.
- John.

305
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:22,311
- Hi.
- What are you two up to?

306
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:24,980
- What's going on?
- I'll clean it up later.

307
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:27,306
- We're looking for something.
- What is it?

308
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:31,230
Whatever you want to talk about is not
as important as what we're looking for.

309
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,980
Okay. What are you looking for?

310
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:39,314
- A stuffed fish.
- A fish?

311
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:42,028
Marlin, about four feet long,
got a spear-like nose.

312
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:43,362
- And a mouth.
- Yeah.

313
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:45,190
Okay, Chuck, I get it.

314
00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:47,859
Besides, if anything really important
were going on...

315
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:50,278
...you have people in your life
you can talk to about it.

316
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:53,407
- Hey, Ellie, wait.
What?

317
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,991
Oh.

318
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,785
I love you. Just in case.

319
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,452
Just in case of what?

320
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:02,783
Uh...

321
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:06,328
Just in...
Just in case I can't find the fish.

322
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:09,621
I suppose you haven't talked to Morgan.

323
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:12,336
No. Why?

324
00:19:12,508 --> 00:19:16,420
Because he left here last night
with a four-foot long marlin.

325
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:20,001
He's mine.

326
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,761
And you know nothing
about the stolen merchandise?

327
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:32,767
- No, sir. Officer. Detective.
- Where's my fish, Grimes?

328
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:35,804
- Mr. Tucker, please.
- The merchandise is insured.

329
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:38,350
That fish cost me 200 bucks on eBay.

330
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:41,225
Wait, you bought that fish?
Ha-ha-ha!

331
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,185
- That will be all, Mr. Grimes.
- What did you do for bait, PayPal?

332
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:45,934
Grimes, out.
- All right. Yes, sir.

333
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:52,355
- You cracked, didn't you?
You are so weak. So weak.

334
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:54,188
How am I weak?
I didn't say anything.

335
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:57,447
- How am I to believe that?
- Bartowski! You're up.

336
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,530
You go. I got the scraggly troll.

337
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:08,483
L... I did not rob the store.

338
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:11,910
Did I ask you that?
Already he's talking about stolen goods.

339
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,988
- Might as well admit you did it.
- Please.

340
00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:16,369
Let me handle the investigation.

341
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:18,280
Now, Mr. Bartowski...

342
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:20,868
...we believe this was an inside job.

343
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:24,126
None of these imbeciles could tie shoes
without Bartowski's say-so.

344
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:27,829
If there's a ringleader, you're looking
at him. Where's my fish, Bartowski?

345
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:30,959
Okay, start talking.

346
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,170
- From the beginning.
- Okay.

347
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:35,297
Um, I was born a cesarean section.

348
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,336
I always felt robbed of that headlong
voyage through the uterine canal.

349
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:40,053
Where's the marlin, moron?

350
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:44,543
Ah, the elusive fish. Sure.
That's a tale for the ages.

351
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:48,006
Start talking, or I'll pull each one
of these hairs out of your face...

352
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:50,221
...one at a time, starting with this one.

353
00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:52,757
Torture?

354
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:56,433
If you're trying to get me to talk,
you are using the wrong tactic, brother.

355
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:59,473
Really? What's the right tactic?

356
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:02,480
My own personal kryptonite: Grape soda.

357
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:05,560
On the rocks, please.

358
00:21:07,318 --> 00:21:08,480
Conway.

359
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:11,859
- Excuse me, I have to take this.
- I got this.

360
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:13,059
Ah.

361
00:21:17,364 --> 00:21:18,858
You don't wanna talk, Bartowski?

362
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:22,945
We'll just have to
turn the heat up on you.

363
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:39,622
Mm, mm.

364
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:43,035
There we go.

365
00:21:44,212 --> 00:21:46,418
Ahh. Proper.

366
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:49,544
So it all started
with the next "Call of Duty" game.

367
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:56,591
<i>I don't really consider it
stealing since I see Chuck and I...</i>

368
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,925
<i>...more as life partners,
and therefore community property.</i>

369
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:03,337
<i>Using my own personal entrance...</i>

370
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:06,634
<i>...I went into Chuck's room
to play the game.</i>

371
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,266
Yes.

372
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:13,351
<i>And when I reached into the bag,
I discovered...</i>

373
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:16,349
<i>I found a...</i>

374
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,262
I can't go on.

375
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,473
- This is just getting a little personal.
- All right, new tactic.

376
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:24,138
Finish the story
or I put your head through the wall.

377
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:27,184
Okay, someone wasn't
hugged enough as a child.

378
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,852
Ugh.

379
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:31,860
- That's horrible.
- It's better on the rocks, that's why I...

380
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:33,437
Anyway, there I was...

381
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:36,697
<i>...staring at the most horrific object
the world has ever seen.</i>

382
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:38,489
No!

383
00:22:38,908 --> 00:22:41,194
What? Morgan?

384
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,488
You scared me to death.
What is wrong with you?

385
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:46,326
No, no, no. No, it's Chuck.

386
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:48,404
- What is it? What happened?
- We've lost him, Ell.

387
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,285
We've lost him forever.

388
00:22:51,123 --> 00:22:53,160
L... You better sit down.

389
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,581
Um...

390
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,950
I don't know how to say this.

391
00:22:58,833 --> 00:22:59,997
He's gone.

392
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:02,834
Morgan, what are you talking about?

393
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:04,793
I'm talking about this.

394
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:08,163
Chuck's gonna propose to Sarah.

395
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:10,581
<i>That's pretty much the whole story.</i>

396
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,498
More or less.
Ellie and I bonded over the fact...

397
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:16,000
...that he didn't include us
in this life decision.

398
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:19,755
But, hey, who cares, you know?
He's got you now, so...

399
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:21,967
What does that have to do with the fish?

400
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:25,969
Fish? Who cares about the fish, John?
Chuck's getting married.

401
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,884
Pitas are here.

402
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:29,967
Hey, hey.

403
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:31,137
Hey. Hey.

404
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,183
You had 29 deliveries
so I dropped in...

405
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:36,976
...your free baba ghanoush.
- Really?

406
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:41,059
Twenty-nine deliveries, 29 bugs.

407
00:23:43,316 --> 00:23:45,307
Wait a second.

408
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:00,063
Oh, lunch.

409
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:05,615
Thank you.
- Hey, buddy.

410
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:07,444
- I smell falafel.
- Of course you do.

411
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,454
Come on.

412
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,334
- Come on.
- I'm just gonna finish...

413
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:22,996
You're gonna finish the story.

414
00:24:23,502 --> 00:24:24,499
Back to the story.

415
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:34,081
Whoa!

416
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,633
"Boobies. "

417
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:49,046
Jackpot.

418
00:25:07,693 --> 00:25:10,478
Got you.
Good thing Jeff and Lester are pervs.

419
00:25:27,412 --> 00:25:28,691
I can see you're sweating it.

420
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:32,946
So you ready to tell us
what happened here last night?

421
00:25:33,123 --> 00:25:34,830
I'm telling you, guys, I have no idea.

422
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:37,619
Fine. There's other ways
to make you talk.

423
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:40,250
Time to send you back...

424
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:41,746
...to gen pop.

425
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:45,288
He sung like a canary.

426
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:46,624
Thanks for the info, Chuck.

427
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,713
- John Casey, you're next.
- One sec.

428
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,039
What, can't fit the police
into your social schedule?

429
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:55,132
Get in here now
or you and I are taking a trip downtown.

430
00:25:56,551 --> 00:25:59,006
You have a second, Mr. Casey?
We'd appreciate it.

431
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:05,595
I can't believe you told Casey
you put the marlin in Chuck's room.

432
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:06,843
What?

433
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:10,052
Don't worry, I moved it to the freezer
at the Wienerlicious.

434
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:12,431
- Wow. I'm impressed.
Thank you.

435
00:26:12,602 --> 00:26:14,393
- Bye.
Whoa. Where you going?

436
00:26:14,562 --> 00:26:17,430
Where you going? Where you going,
Lizzie? Lizzie? Where is she going?

437
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:28,478
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

438
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:31,686
I was wondering if I could get something
out of your freezer.

439
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:35,065
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
It's a company policy.

440
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,440
The kitchen is usually off-limits
for non-employees.

441
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:41,069
Okay, then I'll have to use
my special pass.

442
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,115
You're not a hot-dog maker.

443
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:48,575
Bring it on, pita girl.

444
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,425
We're closed!

445
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,009
Where's the fish?

446
00:27:28,684 --> 00:27:31,303
- We need to talk. It's an emergency.
- Listen, no. Hey.

447
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:34,475
Chuck. Chuck, it's okay, man.
I know about you and Sarah.

448
00:27:34,644 --> 00:27:36,766
Man, and how she's more
than just your girlfriend.

449
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:41,106
What?

450
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,065
Morgan, stay.

451
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:45,726
Aah! Stay.

452
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,439
- Hello.
- After careful consideration...

453
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,147
...of all potential proposals,
I have made a decision.

454
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,029
Oh. Let me guess. Naked 2-K run?

455
00:27:54,198 --> 00:27:56,188
Dinner, Chuck.
Romantic, candlelit dinner.

456
00:27:56,364 --> 00:27:57,858
<i>- Just the two of us.
- Wow, good.</i>

457
00:27:58,032 --> 00:27:59,062
<i>The coup de grâce:</i>

458
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:01,480
Molten lava cake
with a two-carat diamond ring filling.

459
00:28:01,657 --> 00:28:03,318
Ellie will really love that.

460
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:08,776
Devon, just promise me you'll take care
of my sister if anything were to happen.

461
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:09,984
What's gonna happen?

462
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:13,657
Oh, hey. Cake hits the oven in two hours.
Don't be late.

463
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,035
What am I gonna do?

464
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:18,239
You can do nothing.

465
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,459
You didn't give Sarah the ring yet. Dude,
there's time to call this whole thing off.

466
00:28:22,627 --> 00:28:23,742
Sarah, ring?

467
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,085
Yeah, the ring you got Sarah.
The one I kind of took out of your locker.

468
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:28,286
You mean...

469
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:31,085
...the ring that Awesome got for Ellie.

470
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:32,917
Oh, thank God, man. Are you kidding?

471
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:35,546
- I thought I lost you, pal. L...
- Morgan...

472
00:28:35,718 --> 00:28:37,626
...where is the ring?

473
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:39,426
It's kind of complicated, but...

474
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:43,924
In the freezer at Wienerlicious. I put it in
Big Mike's marlin. Was gonna put it back.

475
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,467
Ow.

476
00:28:47,015 --> 00:28:48,509
Slide it to me.

477
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:49,797
Now.

478
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:55,519
Hey.

479
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:06,769
No, no, no.

480
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:08,852
No, no, no!

481
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:12,144
Help! Help me!

482
00:29:14,197 --> 00:29:15,192
Sarah?

483
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:17,272
Lizzie's the mole.
She got the receiver, Chuck.

484
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:19,984
Sarah, it's over.
They're gonna stick me in some cell.

485
00:29:20,157 --> 00:29:23,739
Okay, Chuck, I need you to focus.
We can get Lizzie if you can get me out.

486
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,067
- How?
- I keep a backup piece...

487
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:28,235
...in the jar of horseradish sauce.

488
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:31,446
- Who puts horseradish on hot dogs?
- Chuck.

489
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:35,832
Got it, right. Hide it someplace
nobody would look. Good. Right. Okay.

490
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:40,660
Oh! Oh!

491
00:29:41,502 --> 00:29:42,617
I got it. Okay.

492
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:44,584
Okay, now shoot the lock.

493
00:29:44,753 --> 00:29:47,540
Um, look, Sarah,
I've never really fired a gun...

494
00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:51,461
...and I've actually done this on purpose
to avoid shooting myself or others.

495
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:55,711
Just shoot the lock,
or I will shoot you when I get out of here.

496
00:29:57,135 --> 00:29:58,299
Okay.

497
00:29:58,471 --> 00:29:59,714
Get back. Ready? Get back.

498
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:01,262
One...

499
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:03,220
...two...

500
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,097
Take the safety off first.

501
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,392
One... One sec... Just a little problem.

502
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,311
Bartowski.
Big Mike told me I'd find you here.

503
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:18,767
- Drop the gun now!
No, no, no. No need to shoot.

504
00:30:18,938 --> 00:30:22,222
That's not my gun. My girlfriend
is in the freezer. Let her out...

505
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:23,775
...she can explain.
- Let's go.

506
00:30:23,942 --> 00:30:26,265
- She's right... Okay. Okay.
- Come on, move.

507
00:30:26,443 --> 00:30:28,149
- Just look in the freezer.
Nice try.

508
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:30,559
Please, just look in the freezer.
She's right there.

509
00:30:30,736 --> 00:30:32,894
Aren't you taking this a little seriously?

510
00:30:38,157 --> 00:30:39,615
Where is Big Mike's fish?

511
00:30:39,783 --> 00:30:42,355
What are you now, huh?
Big man's personal gestapo? Come on.

512
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:44,407
You can't break me, fool.

513
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,237
At the Wienerlicious.

514
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,202
Help!

515
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,247
- Casey.
- Sarah.

516
00:31:05,838 --> 00:31:06,834
Stand back.

517
00:31:10,007 --> 00:31:11,713
The delivery girl is the mole.

518
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:14,123
The detective took Chuck.

519
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:18,508
Where are you, Chuck? I need the ring.

520
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,511
This is not awesome.

521
00:31:25,557 --> 00:31:28,094
I have the package, HQ.
This is Long Shore.

522
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,645
You're not a cop.

523
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,729
We've identified the enemy agent.

524
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:56,146
She was posing
as a Pita Parlor delivery girl.

525
00:31:56,322 --> 00:31:57,353
Code name: Lizzie.

526
00:31:57,531 --> 00:31:59,986
<i>So she escaped with the receiver?</i>

527
00:32:00,158 --> 00:32:01,319
Yes, but she made a call.

528
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:04,526
We're tracing the cell signature
and we can triangulate her location.

529
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:08,117
<i>- We just need more time.
- As soon as you locate her, take her out.</i>

530
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:10,659
Uh, one of us needs to get Chuck
out of police custody.

531
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:14,362
<i>- He was arrested just...
- The Intersect is no longer your concern.</i>

532
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,780
L... I don't understand.

533
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:18,417
<i>Detective Conway is CIA.</i>

534
00:32:18,585 --> 00:32:21,370
<i>Chuck is on his way
to the extraction point right now.</i>

535
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:25,161
<i>We've decided to transfer him
to lockdown immediately.</i>

536
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:27,333
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

537
00:32:27,506 --> 00:32:31,336
Uh, no. No. I just thought
I would handle his transfer.

538
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,547
<i>Forget about Chuck, Agent Walker.</i>

539
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:36,124
<i>Focus on catching that Fulcrum agent.</i>

540
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:37,297
We're on it.

541
00:32:38,469 --> 00:32:41,552
We, meaning I go get Lizzie
while you find Chuck.

542
00:32:43,723 --> 00:32:45,715
Well, don't make me change my mind.

543
00:32:48,892 --> 00:32:50,432
So...

544
00:32:50,892 --> 00:32:52,552
...this is it, huh?

545
00:32:52,727 --> 00:32:55,051
Gonna get my own padded cell.

546
00:32:55,227 --> 00:32:57,896
Do I get a bed,
or is my whole room kind of like a bed?

547
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:00,220
It's not as bad as it sounds.

548
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:04,558
The underground complex you'll live in has
state-of-the-art security and amenities.

549
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,304
You'll even be allowed outside
to visit controlled locations.

550
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:17,483
I can't leave without telling Ellie,
a reason for going. What should I say?

551
00:33:17,657 --> 00:33:19,197
Nothing.

552
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:22,401
It's safer for them if you just disappear.

553
00:33:26,662 --> 00:33:29,067
<i>The package is ready for extraction.</i>

554
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:30,491
<i>Send in the chopper.</i>

555
00:33:38,376 --> 00:33:39,918
Long Shore!

556
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:43,994
- Is there a problem?
- Thank God you're here.

557
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,876
I don't wanna go yet. I ca...

558
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:48,039
Agent Casey is tracking
the Fulcrum mole...

559
00:33:48,215 --> 00:33:52,754
...he should have her in custody soon,
so we can hold off on the Chuck transfer.

560
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:56,081
If there was a change,
I would have been contacted.

561
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,259
- I have my orders.
- We don't have to. This is a judgment call.

562
00:33:59,428 --> 00:34:01,670
We can hold Chuck here
until we know for sure.

563
00:34:01,847 --> 00:34:03,506
- His cover was blown, he's gone.
- No.

564
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:07,759
I will take full responsibility.
Chuck is my asset. He's my guy.

565
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:09,509
Just give us more time, please.

566
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:13,387
I'd appreciate it. I really would.

567
00:34:15,104 --> 00:34:17,179
Please don't do this.

568
00:34:19,606 --> 00:34:22,177
Okay, you got one minute.

569
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:23,732
One minute.

570
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,683
- Sarah, I'm not ready to disappear.
- No, I know.

571
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,605
I need you to talk to Ellie...

572
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,405
...and to Morgan and my friends...

573
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:39,529
...and tell them...

574
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:43,900
I don't know. Look, if I'm supposed
to be dead, just say something...

575
00:34:44,076 --> 00:34:47,573
...that will make it okay,
that will make them feel all right.

576
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:50,869
Just make sure they know
how much I love them.

577
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,449
You can do that, right?

578
00:34:54,165 --> 00:34:57,035
Of course you can. You're Sarah.
You can do anything.

579
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,580
Hey, there's a silver lining to this too,
you know?

580
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:04,794
Because we're not working together
anymore, so we can go on a date.

581
00:35:04,963 --> 00:35:06,955
You can come by my cell
and we can hang out.

582
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:09,087
And you can tell me
who the president is.

583
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:12,126
And maybe, uh...

584
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:16,625
Maybe we can see how we really feel.

585
00:35:19,304 --> 00:35:20,298
Time's up.

586
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,718
Goodbye, Sarah.

587
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:31,684
Chuck?

588
00:35:33,393 --> 00:35:34,805
I'll save you later.

589
00:35:43,733 --> 00:35:45,439
- Oh!
- Get down.

590
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:58,941
I listened to the receiver.

591
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:00,574
She knows.

592
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:04,108
Do you know how many agents
are looking for Bryce Larkin?

593
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:06,988
And all this time, the Intersect was here.

594
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:10,078
Wait until my superiors find out.

595
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:14,029
Look, what if I surrender and you run?
I'll be in the cell. What's the difference?

596
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,779
- Torture.
- Okay, no surrender.

597
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:19,329
I only have one question, Chuck.

598
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,075
Who's the ring for?

599
00:36:22,252 --> 00:36:24,245
- She has Ellie's ring.
- Chuck, distract her.

600
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:26,162
What? How?

601
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:31,501
Aah!

602
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:35,500
- Chuck, I'm not gonna go away.
- Okay.

603
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:38,083
Okay, look, look, look.
You really wanna take me in?

604
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,834
You're gonna have to sweeten the deal
a little for me.

605
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:44,846
Hey, hey, hey, uh, look.

606
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:48,179
Look, the CIA,
they're offering me a nice, padded cell...

607
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:50,010
...real cush. Can you beat that?

608
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:53,137
I'm a guy who enjoys a good steam.
Can you do...?

609
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,768
Can you do maybe a steam room?

610
00:36:54,936 --> 00:36:58,849
I don't think you're really in a position
to bargain, Chuck. I have two guns.

611
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:00,396
What do you have?

612
00:37:00,564 --> 00:37:02,023
Me.

613
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:06,024
Don't break the ring!

614
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:17,986
Hey! Bartowski, get out of the way.

615
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:22,197
There's really serious
spy fighting going on.

616
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:24,197
Get down, Chuck.

617
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,319
Sarah!

618
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:40,709
Oh!
- I had a feeling that girl was dirty.

619
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:08,848
Norman.

620
00:38:16,855 --> 00:38:19,308
The power of positive thinking.

621
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:21,472
This was an amazing night...

622
00:38:21,648 --> 00:38:23,887
...as it always is with...

623
00:38:24,817 --> 00:38:29,607
But sometimes,
I know life isn't always awesome.

624
00:38:32,822 --> 00:38:37,563
What I'm trying to say
is that when things get rough...

625
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,447
<i>...I wanna face them together...</i>

626
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,861
<i>...the good times and the bad.</i>

627
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:42,065
Oh, oh, oh!

628
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:45,692
Ladies' feminine products.
That's not good, that's not good.

629
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:48,784
Are you...? Are you sure
that Lizzie didn't have the ring on her?

630
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:51,243
When they took her away,
all she had was the receiver.

631
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:53,240
- Then it's gotta be here.
- You know...

632
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,572
...Chuck, if we can't find it,
we can just replace it.

633
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,247
It was Awesome's great-granny's ring
and it's gonna be my sister's.

634
00:38:59,418 --> 00:39:02,582
Even if it's covered in coffee grounds
and miscellaneous DNA.

635
00:39:02,752 --> 00:39:06,666
I have a ring
and I have the blessing of your brother.

636
00:39:07,506 --> 00:39:10,257
Would you do me the honor of being
my wife, Eleanor Faye Bartowski?

637
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:21,048
Ah! Hey!

638
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,378
Ha-ha-ha! I found it!

639
00:39:24,848 --> 00:39:26,390
Let's go.

640
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,767
I'm so sorry.

641
00:39:43,942 --> 00:39:45,767
It might be a little dirty.

642
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:50,567
Wait to go, Chuck. I always knew
you could handle my family jewels.

643
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,442
So to speak.

644
00:39:57,615 --> 00:40:00,319
Uh, when she's sleeping
really hard like that...

645
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:02,448
...sometimes if you pinch her nose
it'll wake...

646
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:06,453
Right. I'm gonna... Oh, okay.

647
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,293
Mission accomplished.

648
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,333
I can't believe you pulled it off.

649
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,751
Well, it'll make one hell of a story
at their wedding.

650
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:28,162
Which I'm never allowed to talk about
under fear of death.

651
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:30,545
Understood. I have other material.

652
00:40:30,715 --> 00:40:32,457
You wanna?

653
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:35,626
What, spy? You?

654
00:40:42,763 --> 00:40:44,801
- She looks so happy.
- Yeah, she does.

655
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:49,681
I couldn't leave them yet.

656
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:51,926
You don't have to worry about that.

657
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,809
You're safe.

658
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:56,719
Yeah, safe for now, though.

659
00:40:56,895 --> 00:41:00,097
Right. I mean, they keep getting closer.

660
00:41:00,272 --> 00:41:02,349
Eventually, they're gonna figure out
who I am.

661
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:05,392
Don't you think you should go in
and congratulate Ellie?

662
00:41:07,985 --> 00:41:10,190
You wanna come in with me?

663
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,810
Oh, it's family time.

664
00:41:14,657 --> 00:41:16,113
I know.

665
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:19,945
