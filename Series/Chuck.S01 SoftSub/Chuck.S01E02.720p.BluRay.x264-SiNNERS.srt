1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,992
<i>Hi, my name is Charles Bartowski.</i>

2
00:00:09,206 --> 00:00:14,166
<i>But you can call me Chuck.
Those are my shoes. This is my life.</i>

3
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:16,129
<i>It's filled with spies, car chases...</i>

4
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:19,051
<i>...computer-stealing ninjas
and me saving the day.</i>

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,342
<i>Oh, wait. Wait, I need to go back.</i>

6
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:23,045
<i>I work at the Buy More.</i>

7
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:25,638
<i>It used to be pretty boring.</i>

8
00:00:26,478 --> 00:00:29,480
Chuck, get over here, now.

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,101
Look at this. What happened?

10
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:32,776
Oh, way to go, Jeff.

11
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:36,153
You do realize we don't work
for Large Mart? They're our competition.

12
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:37,652
Can you imagine the shame...

13
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:40,198
...if some Large Mart fiend
or a Costco stooge...

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,743
...put out a display
on our Buy More green?

15
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:44,617
So this has to come down, right?

16
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:46,334
Yesterday.

17
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:50,547
Ahem, I now present to you
the magic of Morgan.

18
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:51,795
One, two...

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,506
<i>This is my best friend,
Morgan. He is not a magician.</i>

20
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,387
<i>Everything changed
when I got an e-mail...</i>

21
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,687
<i>...from my old college buddy
Bryce Larkin.</i>

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,601
<i>Bryce have been working for the CIA
when he stole government secrets.</i>

23
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:12,232
<i>Big, important, nasty,
you-get-killed-for-having-them secrets.</i>

24
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:16,360
<i>Next thing I know, these super secrets
are downloaded into my brain.</i>

25
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:20,954
<i>Which means every moment of my life
is in danger.</i>

26
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:22,836
Sorry.

27
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:25,711
<i>The NSA sent their top agent
to protect me.</i>

28
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:27,960
<i>That's Casey. He's pretty scary.</i>

29
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:30,177
<i>He works at Buy More now,
as a cover.</i>

30
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:33,018
<i>So now I must defend the country
from assassins...</i>

31
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:34,264
No, Casey!

32
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:36,060
<i>Terrorists...</i>

33
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:41,736
<i>...and shoplifters.</i>

34
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:44,395
Casey, Casey, no, no, no.
It's just a video game, okay?

35
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:47,409
Lives are not in danger
and the country is still safe.

36
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:48,988
Wow.

37
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:52,497
Guy's been here 24 hours, and he takes
the job way more seriously than me.

38
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,704
- That's because he's crazy.
- Tell me something I don't know.

39
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, hey, Duff.

40
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:59,960
Nice to see you again, huh?
You're not so tough, are you?

41
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:02,804
Oh, you don't like that, huh?

42
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,145
Sarah?

43
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:16,563
<i>The CIA sent their top agent too.</i>

44
00:02:23,121 --> 00:02:25,873
<i>Oh, yeah, I know. Believe me.</i>

45
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:27,614
<i>She told me to trust her.</i>

46
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:30,747
<i>But just like any woman,
she's got a past.</i>

47
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:37,715
<i>And she's posing as my girlfriend.</i>

48
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:45,720
Sarah, what, uh...?
What are you doing here?

49
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,482
I work here now, Chuck.

50
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:52,906
Damn. I burnt another batch.

51
00:02:53,116 --> 00:02:54,314
Why are you working here?

52
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:59,028
Surveillance. I can monitor the Buy More
from here while you work.

53
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:03,869
- It's just a cover.
- Right, yeah, all part of the plan.

54
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:05,582
Because there's a plan, right?

55
00:03:05,756 --> 00:03:09,801
You making gourmet wieners isn't
the reason why you joined the CIA...

56
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:12,633
...and Casey isn't a natural-born
appliance salesman...

57
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,965
...and government-secrets
locked-in-my-brain thing...

58
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:17,468
...uh, that's, I'm sure,
not a boon for national security.

59
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:20,268
So I'm hoping that you'll tell me
that there's a plan.

60
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,769
We have a plan.

61
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,437
There is somebody who can help.
We can discuss it further tonight.

62
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:27,897
How about another date?
I can pick you up at 8.

63
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:32,663
Yeah, yeah, I'd like that.
That sounds great.

64
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:34,332
I'll see you.

65
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:43,215
Chuck is in. Send the doctor.

66
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:48,181
What do you think of this shirt?
Another date with Sarah?

67
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,465
This is very exciting.

68
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,310
We'll see. It's not big a deal.

69
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,053
Yes, it is. She is hot.

70
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,020
Jeepers. I'd go with the first shirt.
Better with your skin tone.

71
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:01,731
- Oh, yeah?
- Morgan has met her, and I haven't?

72
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,908
Yeah, he confides in me, Ellie,
you know?

73
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:08,326
He tells me his deepest, darkest secrets,
which you could too, by the way.

74
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:09,952
Here's one: I loathe you.

75
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,876
That's not a secret.

76
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,286
I need to meet this girl.

77
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:15,007
Tomorrow night, dinner, here.

78
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,372
Uh, whoa.

79
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:18,959
<i>Little too soon to be seeing
the Tron poster.</i>

80
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:21,760
Not exactly a natural aphrodisiac.

81
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:24,603
Dinner, perfect. I'll clear my schedule.

82
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,734
Our most valuable secrets
have been sent to an idiot.

83
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,897
At least they weren't sent
to his friend.

84
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,734
Operation Chuck.

85
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:39,656
I can't believe this.
I spoke with Agent Walker.

86
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,321
She'll deliver Chuck
to the rendezvous tonight.

87
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,585
Good. Dr. Zarnow
is on his way to L.A. Now.

88
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,705
He's our best, NSA's top scientist.

89
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:49,424
Well, I hope he can fix this.

90
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:57,260
- Get in.
- Wow, Wienerlicious really pays well.

91
00:04:57,434 --> 00:05:00,222
Heh, uh, what are we doing?

92
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:02,473
We're going to, like, a movie
or some dinner?

93
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:04,150
Not exactly.

94
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:07,772
What does "not exactly" mean,
exactly?

95
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,327
So here we are
on our date at the Buy More.

96
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,704
Is this part of the plan, or a chance
for me to clock in overtime?

97
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,539
There's a doctor coming to see you.

98
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:24,206
He worked on the encoding process
for the Intersect.

99
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:27,006
The computer that Bryce destroyed?
The one that's in your head.

100
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:28,508
He's coming to examine you.

101
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:32,680
Uh, and does this examination
involve...

102
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:35,689
...say, I don't know,
needles or probing of some kind?

103
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,933
This doctor is our best shot
at helping you.

104
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:41,695
It's what you want, right?

105
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:44,742
To get the secrets out of your head?

106
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:47,244
Yeah, yeah, of course.

107
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:51,869
But you're still vague about the probing,
and I'd like to know the answer to that.

108
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:54,706
We've rewired
the home-theater room for this test.

109
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:56,876
When the images start...

110
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:59,755
...just say what they are.
- That's it?

111
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:02,718
I'm sure you'll find a way
to screw it up.

112
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,847
- The doctor's here.
When do I meet him?

113
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:07,385
You don't.
It's important he doesn't see you.

114
00:06:07,604 --> 00:06:09,015
- You're too valuable.
- Thanks.

115
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:11,515
I'm flattered and totally freaked out.

116
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:18,028
Dr. Zarnow?
Agent Casey.

117
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:19,570
Agent Walker.

118
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:21,488
Thank you for meeting us
at a neutral site.

119
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:23,828
Let's begin.

120
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,662
I don't understand
why I can't see my patient.

121
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:30,916
For your safety, we're keeping
Patient X's identity a secret.

122
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,258
- And does Patient X work here?
Patient X...

123
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,472
...who knows all the Intersect secrets,
works at a Buy More?

124
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:40,132
Ridiculous, of course.

125
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,225
<i>After the tone, the test will begin.</i>

126
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,025
Uh, dog.

127
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:50,146
Uh, hippopotamus.

128
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:51,693
Fat guy.

129
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:53,696
Ugly building.

130
00:06:57,707 --> 00:06:59,451
Really beautiful woman at the beach.

131
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:06,709
Cardinal One is the top Moscow spy
in the White House office of...

132
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,049
The plot to assassinate
President Carter was orchestrated by...

133
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:14,262
<i>- the Northrop-Davis voting computers
has been approved by the...</i>

134
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:17,051
Oceanic Flight 815 was shot down
by surface-to-air...

135
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,975
Work on capitol beneath Denver
International Airport reached phase four.

136
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:25,323
Benedictine agents within the Vatican
report that assassin is still out there.

137
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:28,863
- They'd have been approved
by the DNC...

138
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:39,381
Okay. That's a picture of a turtle.

139
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:43,547
Your patient is phenomenal.

140
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,258
We never imagined this.

141
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:47,348
What didn't you imagine?

142
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:50,520
One person seeing all
the Intersect images.

143
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:53,440
All our secrets in one mind.

144
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,224
Can you remove the secrets, doctor?

145
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:02,033
Yes, I think I can.

146
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:08,917
So did I pass the test?

147
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:10,497
You did great, Chuck.

148
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:14,248
And this doctor guy,
he can fix me or...?

149
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:16,799
Uh, he's hopeful. Yeah.

150
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,557
Okay.

151
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:25,181
Oh, oh, uh, I almost forgot, uh...

152
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:28,940
Dinner tomorrow night with my sister
and her boyfriend, Captain Awesome.

153
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:30,944
She really wanted to meet you, so...

154
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:32,987
Oh, okay. Well, that's a good idea.

155
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:38,408
Meeting the family's kind of a big step,
if our relationship were remotely real.

156
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,707
So, uh, if this whole
examination thing...

157
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:49,547
...if it works out,
then I guess we're through, huh?

158
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,712
Uh, yeah. Mm-hm.

159
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,476
Okay. Well, good night.

160
00:08:57,645 --> 00:08:59,057
Good night.

161
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:05,644
Oh, and, uh, just so you know, um,
tonight was probably the best...

162
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:07,732
Only second date
I've been on in years.

163
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,990
Drive safe.

164
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:00,632
Hey.
- Hey.

165
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,051
Did you see this?

166
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:05,054
What?
- Did you know that Bryce was dead?

167
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:09,187
No, no, I didn't.

168
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,603
Well, are you okay?

169
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,481
I don't know.
Um, yeah, I don't know, it's crazy.

170
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:22,115
I, uh... I spent so much time hating him
for getting me kicked out of Stanford.

171
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,325
I don't know, really, how to feel.

172
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:26,417
But it's hard to be mad at him now.

173
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:27,833
I am really sorry, Chuck.

174
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,599
<i>It's Casey. I'm at the scene.</i>

175
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:40,227
No sign of Zarnow's body.
Probably vaporized.

176
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:43,309
I guess those secrets
are staying in Chuck's head.

177
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,120
Well, no sign of anything here.

178
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,616
We're sending the good doctor home
in an ashtray.

179
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:02,378
- Okay, I've got hot dogs to fry.
- And I've got some toasters to sell.

180
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,654
- Feels like a CIA job to me.
- Keep your eye on Agent Walker.

181
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,656
<i>And don't let Chuck out of your site.
He could be next.</i>

182
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:34,582
This strum bar's sticky on the one.
On the other one, it's fine...

183
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,546
...but on the second...
- You recalibrated...?

184
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:39,375
- You can't trust Sarah.
- Chuck, John.

185
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:40,882
Big Mike.

186
00:11:41,764 --> 00:11:43,092
How's customer-service training?

187
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:45,095
- Super.
- Fine.

188
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:48,139
Glad to hear it. The better
my employees, the less I work.

189
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:51,309
- Very inspiring words, sir.
- Regular call to arms.

190
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:54,058
Go make him better.

191
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:56,437
Show me
you're assistant-manager material.

192
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:59,444
Chop, chop. I gotta nap in an hour.

193
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,412
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

194
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:07,035
So, uh, this the hand-held scanner.
Very expensive piece of equipment.

195
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:10,504
So is a stealth fighter,
and somehow I managed to fly that.

196
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:14,802
Right, uh, and the gun, you know,
kind of works like a...

197
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,050
- Gun?
- Uh-huh.

198
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:18,180
And it beeps when you scan
the bar codes.

199
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:22,561
Well, if it screamed out loud,
I'd be right at home.

200
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:27,224
I don't want you to have any more
private meetings with Sarah, hmm?

201
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:29,111
Um, is there a problem?

202
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:31,445
No problems. Only solutions.

203
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:36,617
Well, that sounds very much
like the Buy More customer policy...

204
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:38,616
...that I've notice
you have some issue with.

205
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:47,003
And you know, uh, what I think
we're gonna do about that?

206
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,389
We're gonna do some role-playing
and work on that attitude of yours.

207
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:53,716
- How about that? Hey, Morgan.
- Heigh-ho.

208
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:56,219
Ah, hey, there he is.
There's my Johnny-on-the-spot.

209
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:58,561
Uh, Morgan and Casey,
you are gonna do some stuff.

210
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:01,859
You're gonna be a shopper,
and you're gonna be the sales rep.

211
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:06,235
I'll talk to Big Mike and work on stuff,
because he's got other things in store.

212
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:09,326
All right. Got it from here.

213
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:11,531
Uh, excuse me...

214
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:30,437
There you go.

215
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:37,563
So, Chuck,
no private meetings with Casey.

216
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,781
- What's with you guys?
- Did he tell you the same thing?

217
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,027
- Of course he did.
- Is something wrong?

218
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:47,078
The doctor from last night, he was killed
in an explosion after he left us.

219
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,744
What? The doctor
who was supposed to fix me?

220
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:52,001
Tell me what this is.

221
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:54,919
L... A nasty...

222
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,009
NSA incinerator.

223
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:02,805
Special issue.
Designed to eliminate biological traces.

224
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:08,520
- That's what killed the doctor.
- And guess who works for the NSA.

225
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:10,935
Why...? Why would Casey...?

226
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:13,271
He's a killer.
It's what he does for a living.

227
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:15,821
<i>He tried to kill us.
He'll probably try it again.</i>

228
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:20,071
<i>Maybe it was orders, maybe he didn't
like the way Zarnow looked at him.</i>

229
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,283
Oh, that's nice.
I feel better now, Sarah.

230
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,741
What am I supposed to do?

231
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:27,545
You go back in there
and you pretend like you know nothing.

232
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:29,169
Go. You can do that, Chuck.

233
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:34,715
I know nothing, I know nothing.
Got it.

234
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:36,517
<i>I'm gonna try that again, ready?</i>

235
00:14:36,686 --> 00:14:37,885
Do you have any Ramones?

236
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:41,390
No, don't say no. It's not gonna...
Okay.

237
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,566
Uh, excuse me, John,
how are you doing?

238
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:45,978
Do you have any Ramones here, dude?

239
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:47,989
- Don't tell me you don't...
Casey...

240
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:52,370
...the correct response is,
"Can we order you the Ramones?"

241
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,906
Ramones, man, okay?
Just looking for the Ramones.

242
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,242
Do you have Ramones?
I love the Ramones and I wanted...

243
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:00,581
That's a no on the Ramones, I guess.

244
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:04,257
Okay. I don't think
that's in the Buy More manual.

245
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:07,002
What did Sarah tell you, hmm?

246
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:10,551
I know you talked to her.
It's what I do for a living.

247
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:17,851
No, here it is,
on the bottom shelf. Ramones.

248
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:25,407
- There you go.
- Thanks.

249
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,537
- Bye.
- I love you.

250
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:32,957
What did you tell Chuck?

251
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:35,248
That you're a killer. Was I lying?

252
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,044
No.

253
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,712
The only two people that knew
the doctor was coming are right here.

254
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:43,054
And since I didn't cap him,
you're under arrest.

255
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,770
- Quick, take the pic.
She's so hot.

256
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:29,026
Did you get it?

257
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,198
Come on.
Let's go put it on the Internet.

258
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:43,294
- Mr. Bartowski.
- Hi, Lester.

259
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:44,842
Uh, Code Zebra.

260
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,928
Linux install at a factory off Ventura,
142 Euclid.

261
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:51,181
Uh, I'm sorry.
Why can't you and Jeff go?

262
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:54,639
Linux? PC's?

263
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:58,397
We're, uh, Mac guys, Chuck.
Uh, we're IT artists.

264
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,688
Okay, yeah.

265
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:02,103
Uh, fine, whatever.
I'll be back in half an hour.

266
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:06,156
- And just tell Casey that I'm on my cell.
- You tell him, I'm not your servant.

267
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,202
You know what?
- No, I'm gonna tell him.

268
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:10,199
I mean, in general, I don't always...

269
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:13,874
I... Absolutely, I'm going to.
Right now should I tell him?

270
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:28,932
- Hello?
- Pull over.

271
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:31,720
Well, I can't pull over.
I have a home install at, uh...

272
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:34,860
142 Euclid? Guess who called that in.

273
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:38,241
Oh, my God.

274
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:39,571
It was you.

275
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:42,235
You killed the doctor,
now you're here to kill me.

276
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:10,902
Are you out of your mind?

277
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:15,400
- What happened to you?
- Your girlfriend happened.

278
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,494
- Who, Sarah?
- She's rogue, Chuck.

279
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:20,032
She killed the doctor,
then she tried to kill me.

280
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,119
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, I'm golden. Thanks.

281
00:18:22,337 --> 00:18:25,173
Why should I believe you?
She showed me the bomb, you did it.

282
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:26,669
NSA incinerator, right?

283
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:29,554
It's an explosive easily purchased
on the black market.

284
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,587
What do you really know
about Sarah, Chuck, huh?

285
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:34,718
Think. She's CIA.

286
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:38,098
She worked with Bryce.
He was rogue, maybe she is too.

287
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:39,858
<i>She found you in L.A.</i>

288
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:42,393
<i>But she couldn't grab you,
because I was around.</i>

289
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:44,190
<i>So she had to wait her chance.</i>

290
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:45,984
<i>Dr. Zarnow screwed that up.</i>

291
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,910
<i>If he could pull those secrets,
she'd lose the Intersect.</i>

292
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:50,109
So she had act fast.

293
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:03,090
Let's go. Come on.

294
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:09,382
- I thought I turned that off.
- It's not me. Is it yours?

295
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:11,682
No.

296
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,776
NSA incinerator. Run!

297
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:17,564
Aah! Casey.

298
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:19,363
Casey!

299
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:43,261
You're nervous cooking, babe. Relax.

300
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:46,273
- Devon, this dinner has to go well.
- It's gonna go awesome.

301
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:49,187
You don't know Chuck.
He freaks out when he likes a girl.

302
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,027
Man, ain't that the truth, huh?
But you know, practice makes perfect.

303
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,521
How did you get in here?

304
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:58,574
Uh, Chuck's window.
Or as I like to call it, the Morgan door.

305
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:00,989
I gotta lock the window.
I wonder where Chuck is.

306
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:04,835
Still think it was me?

307
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:06,589
Why would Sarah do this?

308
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:08,216
She's cleaning the operation.

309
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:10,798
Cleaning?

310
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,422
Eliminating everyone she's come
in contact with. You know where she is?

311
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:18,763
She's having dinner with us tonight.

312
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,689
You're on the next plane
to Washington.

313
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:23,189
- But my sister...
- Doesn't have a computer in her noggin.

314
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,772
You're the priority.

315
00:20:24,946 --> 00:20:27,520
It's Casey, put me through
to General Beckman.

316
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:31,908
Hey. Hey, stop.

317
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:42,924
Well, it's about time.

318
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:45,380
Chuck.

319
00:20:45,554 --> 00:20:48,046
- Where have you been?
- Why?

320
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:50,264
You, uh, surprised to see me?

321
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:51,556
What?

322
00:20:53,313 --> 00:20:54,393
Where's Casey?

323
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:56,642
I don't know.
Maybe he's having car trouble.

324
00:20:58,528 --> 00:21:01,566
- Everyone okay?
- Yeah, a little hungry, dude. You're late.

325
00:21:01,741 --> 00:21:03,152
And dirty for my tastes.

326
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:05,824
And your girlfriend has been just nothing
but mean to me.

327
00:21:05,996 --> 00:21:08,535
Huh? Oh, ha.

328
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,787
Look out for her.

329
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:12,827
So I'm glad
everyone's getting along so well.

330
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,796
Yeah, your sister is awesome.

331
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,287
Indeed, hmm?

332
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,466
Hey, I've got an idea.

333
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:21,128
Why don't we actually go out, huh?

334
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:24,427
For pizza or something,
someplace public.

335
00:21:24,602 --> 00:21:26,476
With lots and lots of people around.

336
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:28,889
Uh, Chuck, I've been cooking all day.

337
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:32,857
Yeah, cooking pot roast, dude,
which is my favorite.

338
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:35,741
<i>Mangia, mangia, let's eat.
Yeah.</i>

339
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,156
Sit down, okay? And be good.

340
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:41,370
This looks great, babe.

341
00:21:41,581 --> 00:21:44,868
This looks delicious, Ellie.
Oh, it was nothing.

342
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:46,960
So, Sarah, let's turn this up a notch.

343
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,456
Personal style.
Tell us something about yourself.

344
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,795
Well, I'm originally from D.C.
I just moved here.

345
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,713
Oh, Chuck had a friend
who lived in D.C.

346
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,342
Hey, a former friend.

347
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,426
Former because, A, he was a jerk.
And, B, well, he's dead. Heh.

348
00:22:00,646 --> 00:22:03,767
The girl Chuck was dating before you,
he stole her.

349
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:06,860
Ugh, I just don't know how
anyone could choose Bryce over Chuck.

350
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:14,736
Hi, I'm John Casey. I moved in upstairs
and I thought I'd bring something over.

351
00:22:14,956 --> 00:22:18,455
Oh, come in. Chuck, you didn't tell me
you were bringing another friend.

352
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:21,540
Hey, hi, yeah.

353
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:22,918
It slipped my mind...

354
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:27,961
...that my friend John Casey was coming
over and we work at Buy More together.

355
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,680
Morgan, you know John.

356
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,053
I was telling him we were gonna have
a get-together, the more the merrier.

357
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,636
Pull a stunt like that again,
I'll kill you before she can.

358
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:39,517
You kidder.
- We're gonna need another chair.

359
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:41,563
Okey-dokey.

360
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:44,690
I'm crashing the party.
Maybe I should... I'll get it.

361
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:51,075
Strange.

362
00:22:56,298 --> 00:22:58,706
NSA ran a check on Sarah Walker,
see what we had.

363
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:00,670
She posed as a French diplomat.

364
00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:03,046
Infiltrated the inner circle
of an arms deal.

365
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:05,466
- Killed the entire circle.
- With a bomb?

366
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,805
We don't know.
Her alias was Elana Truffaut.

367
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:16,696
They were poisoned.

368
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,613
- At dinner.
- Wonderful.

369
00:23:21,412 --> 00:23:23,286
Hey, sis, chair. Ta-da.

370
00:23:23,498 --> 00:23:25,241
- Thank you.
Yeah.

371
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:28,700
Wow, Chuck, wow.

372
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:34,082
I mean, I knew that you had it in you,
but she is... Wow, she's really great.

373
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:37,886
Yeah. She's unpredictable.

374
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:39,890
Hey, listen to me.

375
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,266
You have no reason
to be nervous, okay?

376
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:45,890
You have a great girl out there.
I mean, she even made dessert.

377
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,442
- Dessert?
- Yeah.

378
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,809
Oh, dessert.

379
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,735
Dessert, poison. Don't freak out.

380
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:54,784
Stop!

381
00:23:57,665 --> 00:24:01,995
We... We didn't do a toast yet.

382
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:05,122
Which I'll do, right now.

383
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,875
Yeah, uh...

384
00:24:08,094 --> 00:24:10,253
So I'd like to propose a toast
to my sister.

385
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:14,719
To my sister and to a meal
that looks so great.

386
00:24:14,894 --> 00:24:17,136
And, Devon, you're great, yeah.

387
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:20,357
And Sarah, for a great dessert.

388
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:26,194
To John Casey and his many quiches,
which are equally as great.

389
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,324
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

390
00:24:30,496 --> 00:24:32,619
- Oh, what about me, Chuck?
- For what?

391
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:35,324
And to Morgan,
for his great comic timing.

392
00:24:35,544 --> 00:24:37,584
- Thank you, sir.
- Heh...

393
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:40,256
Cheers.

394
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:48,059
Well, you know,
that soufflé does look amazing.

395
00:24:48,268 --> 00:24:51,435
- You're right, honey, I can't even...
- Wait, wait, wait!

396
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:56,310
- Who likes magic?
- I do.

397
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:59,444
- I know a trick.
- Chuck?

398
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:02,149
Oh, Chuck, what are you doing?

399
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:07,040
How the...?

400
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:08,745
Whoa, Chuck, that was...

401
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:10,788
I knew you could do it, man.

402
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:13,835
Flambé.

403
00:25:24,354 --> 00:25:27,854
Chuck, look, no matter
how stressed out you are...

404
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:31,271
...it is never okay
to murder a woman's soufflé.

405
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:35,233
Um, you know what?
Let me talk to him.

406
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,536
Casey, hey, maybe, uh...

407
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:46,413
- Tell me exactly what Casey said.
- Nothing, everything is okay.

408
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:49,800
Makeup sex. Nice.

409
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:52,793
What'd he tell you?

410
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:56,176
You killed Dr. Zarnow and poisoned
a bunch of French diplomats.

411
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:57,591
They're blaming me?

412
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,430
If you're planning on hurting me...

413
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:02,441
...you should know I have
a very low threshold for pain.

414
00:26:02,609 --> 00:26:06,821
- And you believe Casey?
- Tell me about the French diplomats.

415
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:09,653
They were assassins.
They were after me, but I got them.

416
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:11,903
You know what?
I'm kind of glad that I did.

417
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:13,948
Do you really think my name is Sarah?

418
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:17,582
I never asked you to believe me.
I asked you to trust me.

419
00:26:17,752 --> 00:26:21,586
This doesn't make sense.
If Casey didn't kill Zarnow, then...

420
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:26,547
- What are you doing?
- I have to go. Right now.

421
00:26:26,764 --> 00:26:30,549
Uh, I'm sorry, I have to go,
but dinner was wonderful.

422
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:33,097
Gotta go. Be back. Yeah.

423
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:37,057
Yeah, well, uh, I better be going too.
Uh, this has been great, thanks.

424
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:40,272
Uh, you're welcome.

425
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:43,865
Mm, I think that went well.
Not great, but it went well.

426
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,778
So, uh, I'm gonna make
a little doggy bag...

427
00:26:46,997 --> 00:26:48,990
...and head out my Morgan door.

428
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,079
How about that? Sounds good? Super.

429
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:55,126
Sarah, wait.

430
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,923
You stay inside. Do what I say.

431
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:04,893
Do you think we were wrong?

432
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:08,595
Casey!

433
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:12,771
Hey, don't move.

434
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:14,946
Zarnow?

435
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:19,695
Good too see you again, Agent Casey.

436
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:30,334
- Oh, my God.
- Yep, we were wrong.

437
00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:31,581
No, no, no.

438
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:37,843
He's got Sarah. We gotta save her.

439
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:40,551
Brilliant deduction, Nancy Drew.
Pull the tranq dart.

440
00:27:40,771 --> 00:27:43,310
Oh, I have a very strong aversion
to needles.

441
00:27:43,524 --> 00:27:45,683
- Do it.
- Okay.

442
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:50,529
That was the doctor, right?
He's not dead.

443
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,859
And the sun sets in the west.
Nothing gets by you.

444
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:54,365
One, two, three.

445
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:00,494
- What's he gonna do with Sarah?
- He's gonna torture her.

446
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,494
Until she tells him all about you.

447
00:28:03,674 --> 00:28:05,418
Come on.
We hurry, we can catch them.

448
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:16,019
- All right, where are we going?
- I laced my quiches with microbots.

449
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:19,566
- You're not kidding, are you?
- I don't kid about quiche.

450
00:28:19,777 --> 00:28:21,936
We can trace them
using the car's tracker.

451
00:28:22,155 --> 00:28:24,314
I think that only comes
in the sports package.

452
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:27,618
We made some enhancements
when your car was in the shop.

453
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:32,451
- I've got a signal. Let's go.
- All right.

454
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,638
Hey, hey, Casey, Casey.
Wait a minute.

455
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,469
Why would he bring Sarah here?

456
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:49,187
I don't know. You wait here.

457
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:53,105
Damn tranq dart.

458
00:28:55,238 --> 00:28:57,147
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

459
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,818
Hey, wait, no, idiot.

460
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,579
It's Morgan.

461
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,756
He ate your quiches.

462
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:16,133
We're on the wrong trail.

463
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:18,508
Come on.

464
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:27,312
I got nothing.
Then, what do we do?

465
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:28,856
It's over, she's gone.

466
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:30,613
No, no. This is our fault.

467
00:29:30,822 --> 00:29:32,899
We didn't believe her.
We have to save her.

468
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:35,278
If you were bad guy,
what would you do?

469
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:39,036
Fly Sarah out on a plane?
Would you use a boat? A what?

470
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:42,043
A chopper.
From a small airfield near the water.

471
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:43,747
The closest I could find.

472
00:29:43,963 --> 00:29:46,122
Do a satellite search
using the touch screen.

473
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,586
Then maybe limit that to airfields
that are within range of us...

474
00:29:49,763 --> 00:29:53,048
...and then maybe limit that
by if there's activity on the ground.

475
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,882
That's not bad.

476
00:29:55,102 --> 00:29:57,772
Thanks. Yeah, I was kind of,
you know, spitballing.

477
00:29:57,939 --> 00:29:59,730
Kind of top-of-my-head.
Was thinking...

478
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:01,857
Found it. Port of Los Angeles.

479
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,564
- Floor it.
- Okay.

480
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:13,575
This is how this is gonna work.

481
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,031
I'm gonna go over there...

482
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:18,829
...rescue Sarah and capture Dr. Zarnow,
shoot anybody who gets in my way.

483
00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:24,007
- You, you're gonna stay here.
- So in this plan, I basically do nothing?

484
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,423
- Yep.
- Let's do this.

485
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:37,440
All right. All right.

486
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:38,941
Now we wait.

487
00:30:44,663 --> 00:30:47,416
Stay in the car. Stay in the car.

488
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:51,914
Do not leave the car.
Do not leave this car.

489
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:18,821
Sarah, are you okay?

490
00:31:18,997 --> 00:31:20,657
What are you doing here?

491
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,502
Stupid question. Uh, should I...?

492
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:26,871
- Sorry.
- Chuck, you have to get out of here.

493
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,462
- No, I'm here to save you.
- You shouldn't be here.

494
00:31:29,635 --> 00:31:32,969
- Besides, I have this well in hand.
- Yeah, it looks well in hand.

495
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:35,132
Just find me something
to pick this lock.

496
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,679
Right. Okay.

497
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:39,474
Here, here, here.

498
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,227
- Go, go, go.
- Tape, tape.

499
00:31:56,876 --> 00:31:59,249
The helicopter is ready, Agent Walker.

500
00:31:59,922 --> 00:32:02,793
This is your last chance.

501
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:10,510
We're going to a special facility
where they're going to torture you.

502
00:32:10,727 --> 00:32:14,511
Really torture, not this child's play.

503
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:16,932
Or you could just tell me.

504
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:20,438
Who is Patient X?

505
00:32:23,117 --> 00:32:25,110
Something for the flight.

506
00:32:25,328 --> 00:32:27,654
- Oh, crap.
Run!

507
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:28,862
Oh, crap.

508
00:32:38,552 --> 00:32:39,881
I know you. I know your secret.

509
00:32:40,054 --> 00:32:43,804
You've been feeding American science
to North Korea for years.

510
00:32:43,976 --> 00:32:46,431
Ah, Patient X.

511
00:32:46,854 --> 00:32:50,022
To think that my secrets
are in that head of yours.

512
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:52,484
It's an honor, really.

513
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:54,945
Of course, to hell with honor.

514
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:59,535
I'm here for the impressive dollar figure
the human Intersect will fetch.

515
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:02,746
Who will I offer you to first?

516
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:09,578
Sarah...

517
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:15,261
Don't worry, Agent Walker.
I'll take good care of him.

518
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:31,647
Don't. They have Chuck.

519
00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:35,035
Proceed to bravo coordinates.
The ship will be waiting there.

520
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:37,947
It's about 10 miles offshore.
Fifteen-minute flight.

521
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:42,125
Huh?

522
00:33:54,729 --> 00:33:56,272
Don't move.

523
00:33:57,399 --> 00:33:58,680
You must be kidding.

524
00:34:02,405 --> 00:34:05,110
I want you to land the helicopter
right now.

525
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:07,656
- It's heavier than you thought.
- What?

526
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,828
The gun. It's heavy.

527
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:15,457
Don't, don't.

528
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:17,955
Give me back the gun.
- I'm not giving you the gun.

529
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:24,383
You shot the pilot, you idiot.

530
00:34:24,558 --> 00:34:26,182
I didn't mean to do that.

531
00:34:26,393 --> 00:34:28,267
What's happening?

532
00:34:28,437 --> 00:34:31,889
Who's flying this thing?
- You're going to kill us both.

533
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,985
Come on, Chuck.

534
00:34:35,154 --> 00:34:36,398
Let me go.

535
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,533
Get your hands off of me.
Get off of me.

536
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,881
Oh, God, that's a crane.

537
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,799
Oh, my God.

538
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,506
Oh, my God.
I think Chuck's flying the chopper.

539
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:09,192
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

540
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:13,776
- Oh, my God. Hi, yeah, I'm here.
- I told you to stay in the car.

541
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:16,698
Forget about the car.
Tell me how to fly a helicopter.

542
00:35:16,872 --> 00:35:20,075
All right. There's a collective
and a cyclic control.

543
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,704
- What?
- One's the stick.

544
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:23,705
One looks like an emergency brake.

545
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,297
<i>Grab them both.</i>

546
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:27,880
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it,
I've got them.

547
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:30,675
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

548
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:32,003
This is not working.

549
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:33,718
Push the stick a bit forward...

550
00:35:33,892 --> 00:35:36,680
...while doing the same thing
with the emergency brake.

551
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,395
- Ground, not good.
- Pull up, pull up!

552
00:35:43,112 --> 00:35:45,650
Pull up on the emergency brake.

553
00:35:45,865 --> 00:35:47,407
Level off. Level off.

554
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,612
I don't know how to level off.

555
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:52,781
Listen, moron, you wanna die?

556
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,742
Casey, put Sarah on the phone.

557
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:57,539
Give me the phone, Casey.

558
00:35:57,713 --> 00:35:58,993
Here.

559
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:00,549
Okay, uh, Chuck?

560
00:36:00,717 --> 00:36:03,255
You're gonna be okay.
Now, I need you to focus.

561
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,670
Uh, have you ever played
any flying games before?

562
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:08,761
Flight simulators?
Yeah, flight simulators, I've done those.

563
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:10,257
Okay. Which ones?

564
00:36:10,979 --> 00:36:15,108
"Maverick of the Skies,"
uh, "Stealth Fighter Elite. "

565
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:17,518
<i>- "Apache Chopper Patrol. "
Great.</i>

566
00:36:17,737 --> 00:36:19,148
Okay, remember that last one.

567
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:21,814
I want you to pretend
like you're playing that game.

568
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:26,287
You're in your bedroom, you're playing
a game and none of this is real.

569
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:30,418
It's just a game.

570
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,579
It's just a game. Okay, I can do this.

571
00:36:34,717 --> 00:36:36,295
<i>I can play this game.</i>

572
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:38,380
<i>Easy, Chuck, easy.</i>

573
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:44,012
Uh, uh, is this one of helicopters
that can turn to a boat?

574
00:36:44,187 --> 00:36:46,346
No. Ease to the right
and goose the brake.

575
00:36:46,564 --> 00:36:49,352
<i>They designed the game
exactly like the helicopter.</i>

576
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:50,767
<i>I got it.</i>

577
00:36:50,987 --> 00:36:52,779
I got it.

578
00:36:53,198 --> 00:36:55,274
<i>- Almost there.
A little more to the right.</i>

579
00:36:55,451 --> 00:36:56,910
Easing right. Easing right.

580
00:36:58,036 --> 00:37:00,493
Goosing the break. It's just a game.

581
00:37:00,707 --> 00:37:02,996
A big, scary video game.

582
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,597
Oh, thank you, God.

583
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,306
Oh, yes, you are wonderful. I can't...

584
00:37:23,651 --> 00:37:27,946
Okay. And that is how I do that.

585
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:30,776
Okay, okay, that's how we do that.

586
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:33,278
Go team.
Seriously, Sarah, up top on that one.

587
00:37:33,455 --> 00:37:35,947
- Palms are sweaty...
- What the hell were you thinking?

588
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,745
Clammy hands, got it, no good.

589
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:40,203
The secrets that you know
are incredibly important.

590
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,051
You compromised everything
when you stopped trusting me.

591
00:37:43,218 --> 00:37:45,543
And when you got out of the car.

592
00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:48,213
Listen, I'm sorry, okay?

593
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,093
No, it is not okay.

594
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,014
How could you think
I was the double, huh?

595
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:56,936
I am not Bryce. Bryce betrayed
everything that I believe in.

596
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,648
If you accuse me of that again,
I will walk away.

597
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,312
Mission over.
We all go back to Washington.

598
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,816
And you do not want that
to happen, Chuck.

599
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:06,618
That, you should trust me on.

600
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:14,875
Way to go, ace, huh?

601
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:25,718
Dad's suit?

602
00:38:25,894 --> 00:38:28,896
Yeah, it's my only one.

603
00:38:29,565 --> 00:38:32,852
I'm quite certain
he wouldn't mind, though.

604
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,107
You realize that you don't have to go
to Bryce's funeral.

605
00:38:37,116 --> 00:38:39,240
<i>Yeah, yeah, I guess.</i>

606
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:42,163
<i>It's just we had a lot of history.</i>

607
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:46,372
Even if he did get me kicked
out of school and steal my girlfriend.

608
00:38:46,545 --> 00:38:50,590
Well, you've moved on
to bigger and better girls.

609
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:53,674
I don't mean bigger,
like literally bigger.

610
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:56,046
I just mean, um,
that I really like Sarah.

611
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,220
I hope you guys work things out,
before the next dinner, of course.

612
00:39:01,397 --> 00:39:04,813
I don't know. I don't know, sis, I...

613
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:06,264
I really think I blew it.

614
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:08,942
Chuck, just try apologizing.
It goes a long way.

615
00:39:21,922 --> 00:39:23,333
Sarah's special.

616
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:27,003
She's different
from your Stanford friends.

617
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:32,182
Yeah, yeah.

618
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:48,068
<i>Go.
He flew a helicopter?</i>

619
00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:52,038
Your report was rather terrifying,
Major Casey.

620
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,248
Do we really have
this situation in hand...

621
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:56,745
...or Mr. Bartowski
be in our care full-time?

622
00:39:56,964 --> 00:40:00,381
Well, you know how I feel, general.
But for now, we're in control.

623
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:02,219
Then Chuck stays where he is.

624
00:40:02,388 --> 00:40:05,555
But, uh,
don't get too comfortable, Casey.

625
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:08,561
The new Intersect will be up
and running in six months.

626
00:40:09,271 --> 00:40:11,348
And what happens to Chuck
when this is done?

627
00:40:11,566 --> 00:40:14,686
Well, you'll do what you do best.

628
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:31,171
Knock, knock.

629
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,918
Hey, Chuck.

630
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:35,880
How is everything?
I saw you at the funeral.

631
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:37,928
Oh, uh, yeah, I had to go.

632
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,548
After everything Bryce did,
he was still my partner.

633
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:43,176
Look, I'm not accusing you
of anything...

634
00:40:43,772 --> 00:40:45,052
...today.

635
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:49,017
Yesterday, yes, I may have laid it on
a little thick with the accusing.

636
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:52,524
But I'm really sorry about that.

637
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:54,158
Instead of not trusting you...

638
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,743
...I should've thanked you for saving
my life and protecting the country.

639
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:00,405
And making really
tasty gourmet wieners.

640
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:07,371
- I'm sorry I yelled at you.
- It was our first fight.

641
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:10,552
It's a big step, if our relationship
were remotely real.

642
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:16,186
With Dr. Zarnow gone, Chuck, those
Intersect secrets aren't going anywhere.

643
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:18,767
That means more missions,
more danger...

644
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:21,098
...more secrets you can't tell
your sister or friends.

645
00:41:21,317 --> 00:41:23,026
I know that.

646
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:28,113
Some people wanna be heroes
and others have to be asked.

647
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:30,657
So, Chuck, are you ready?

648
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,629
- Yeah.
- Good.

649
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:42,586
Hi, hope we're not
interrupting anything.

650
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:47,388
Uh, by the way, I thought
we'd give that dinner another shot.

651
00:41:47,558 --> 00:41:48,721
Maybe here.

652
00:41:49,853 --> 00:41:51,395
We knew you'd forgive him.

653
00:41:51,605 --> 00:41:54,357
Right, and you realize
you all have to eat my cooking.

654
00:41:54,817 --> 00:41:57,902
Give me the 411 on the corn dogs.

655
00:41:58,655 --> 00:42:01,325
What do you think, man?
- What do you recommend, buddy?

656
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:03,117
Sarah?

657
00:42:04,428 --> 00:42:06,053
Pogos, okay.

658
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:08,641
Cheers.
