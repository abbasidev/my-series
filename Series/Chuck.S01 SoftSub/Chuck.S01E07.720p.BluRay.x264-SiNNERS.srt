1
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:03,568
<i>Hey, I'm Chuck.</i>

2
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:07,335
<i>Here's a couple of things you might need
to know, or maybe you just forgot.</i>

3
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:12,667
Bryce Larkin from Connecticut is a spy?

4
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:14,961
A rogue spy.
Did he try to contact you?

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,258
He sent me an e-mail.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,965
<i>Bryce sent me a database
of government secrets...</i>

7
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:23,386
<i>...that are now locked in my brain,
keeping me in state of fear...</i>

8
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:25,310
<i>...danger and anxiety.</i>

9
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:27,513
Bryce Larkin
pretended to be his buddy...

10
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:29,889
...sexed up his girl,
got him kicked out of Stanford.

11
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:33,021
If Chuck is Solo, Larkin is his Fett.

12
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:36,153
Stanford was five years ago.
You need to move on.

13
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,947
It's our subconscious
that we're gonna be talking about today.

14
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:49,448
How can we penetrate
the human mind?

15
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:51,750
How can we understand it?

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,036
- How many images do you see?
- Two.

17
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:55,878
- Five.
- Ten.

18
00:00:56,088 --> 00:00:59,622
There are hundreds of images
compressed inside this picture.

19
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:01,384
The encoding is special.

20
00:01:08,557 --> 00:01:10,136
You only remember that one.

21
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:12,389
Your subconscious, though,
saw them all.

22
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:14,971
We'll see how you do
on the final exam.

23
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:18,562
I include a section on subliminal
image-recognition where you'll...

24
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:22,224
Um...

25
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:25,353
Thank you. We'll, uh...
We'll end early today.

26
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:27,564
Class dismissed.

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,574
Professor, how can we isolate the...?

28
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,955
This is Glass Castle
reporting hostile contact.

29
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:44,872
I made a mistake, Black Coat.

30
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:47,253
I copied intel for myself onto a disc.

31
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:50,379
They're after it.
I know I shouldn't have.

32
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:23,198
<i>Chuck, we have an emergency.</i>

33
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:25,287
We need to talk.

34
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:26,533
I'm on the phone.

35
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:30,746
Shh. Not here, not here.
There are spies at the Buy More.

36
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,461
- Spies, really?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,995
Yeah, Tang's minions, man.
They're everywhere.

38
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:37,546
<i>He's like Sauron
from Lord of the Rings.</i>

39
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,380
Only, he's taken control
of the assistant managership.

40
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:43,511
Yeah, from me.
Right, thanks for the reminder.

41
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:45,548
Got it, man.
Listen, we need your help.

42
00:02:45,723 --> 00:02:49,768
- Help, what am I supposed to do? I'm...
- Just one small hobbit?

43
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,640
So thought Frodo Baggins, my friend.

44
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:54,805
So thought Frodo Baggins.

45
00:02:57,317 --> 00:03:00,233
"Rules and regulations
for the Buy More break room.

46
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:01,856
From the desk of Harry Tang"?

47
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,523
He doesn't even have a desk.

48
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:05,939
This is an affront to human decency.

49
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:10,065
"No swearing. No expectorating.
No fornicating. "

50
00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:13,198
- Wait, have people been getting freaky?
- No, no.

51
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:15,744
But I like to know
that I have the option.

52
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:19,748
- Okay, so it's a little strict.
- It's torture, man.

53
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,078
The no-drug policy includes Red Bull.

54
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:25,416
Oh, ouch. I remember the last time
you tried to detox.

55
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:28,081
How am I supposed to move electronics
with the sweaty shakes?

56
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:30,881
I'm sorry, fellas,
but is this the Talk More?

57
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:33,877
No, sir. It's the Buy More.

58
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:36,719
So why don't you get back
to helping these customers...

59
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:40,343
...buy more electronics, Mr. Grimes?

60
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:47,813
I'm sorry, but is Harry wearing
a new assistant-manager polo shirt?

61
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,103
It's monogrammed.

62
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:53,477
- He must be stopped.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:03,739
Wow. That new High-Def screen
sure shows every wrinkle.

64
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:05,332
They can hear you.

65
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,369
What? Twinkle.

66
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:10,212
Every twinkle in her eye.

67
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:13,079
Eyes.

68
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:14,536
<i>We have a situation.</i>

69
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:16,958
<i>A CIA asset has gone missing.</i>

70
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,963
<i>We've had no communication
from him for two days.</i>

71
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:23,087
- No way.
- What, did you flash?

72
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:27,054
No, I don't have to.
That guy was my professor at Stanford.

73
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,350
Wait. Asset, he's CIA?
My professor was a spy?

74
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,853
The CIA recruits on campuses
across the country.

75
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,894
Professor Fleming is a company scientist,
not an operative.

76
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:39,978
<i>This is our last communication
from him.</i>

77
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,775
<i>This is
Glass Castle reporting hostile contact.</i>

78
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,740
<i>I made a mistake, Black Coat.</i>

79
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,695
<i>I copied intel for myself onto a disc.</i>

80
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,156
<i>They're after it.
I know I shouldn't have.</i>

81
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:53,244
<i>- Do we know what intel he copied?
We don't.</i>

82
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:57,750
<i>He's handled many sensitive projects
for us. Any leak could prove devastating.</i>

83
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,455
<i>- How can we help?
- Fleming has contacts in L.A.</i>

84
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,377
<i>- Lf we find him, you can extract him.
- We'd like your help on this, Chuck.</i>

85
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:09,591
Look, I don't think
I'm your go-to guy on this one.

86
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:11,963
<i>Your knowledge of Fleming
and Stanford is key here.</i>

87
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,971
<i>We only have his official reports.
You have a personal connection.</i>

88
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:19,469
Yeah, I do have a personal connection.
Very bad personal connection.

89
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,347
You guys have the file.

90
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:24,020
You know all about Fleming
and what happened to me.

91
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,733
The guy kicked me out of school.

92
00:05:25,902 --> 00:05:27,774
Professor Fleming is one of us.

93
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:30,987
Maybe you can find somebody else
to help you this time.

94
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,530
Maybe just this once.

95
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:38,903
I'm going deep.

96
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:48,035
Who invited the UCLA brain trust?

97
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:50,244
Those are Devon's fraternity brothers.

98
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:54,508
We are all caravanning up to Stanford
for the UCLA game this weekend.

99
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:56,797
Hey, Chuck. Go deep, bro.

100
00:05:58,554 --> 00:05:59,881
Ooh.

101
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:01,549
Right in the pills.

102
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:04,090
Don't touch, don't.
Please don't touch me.

103
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:06,466
Come on, man.
Let me make it up to you, bro.

104
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:09,050
Get up.
I got you a ticket for the game.

105
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:10,813
Wow.

106
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:15,274
Thanks. But, uh, Sarah
and I already have plans.

107
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,145
It's your alma mater, dude.

108
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,982
Look, no offense,
but I'd rather get hit...

109
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:23,732
...in the produce section again
than go back to that place.

110
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,951
Ha, ha. Suit yourself.
Let's go. Game on, boys.

111
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:29,154
- Where's the ball?
Let's do this.

112
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:34,536
Uh, listen, I know that Stanford doesn't
hold a lot of good memories for you...

113
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,418
Look, Ellie, Ellie.

114
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:38,958
They kicked me out
for something I didn't do.

115
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,083
Okay? So that's it. Me and Stanford?

116
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:44,256
We're officially done.

117
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:37,338
Sucks you have to leave, Chuck.

118
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:48,349
I don't get it, Bryce.

119
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:49,802
Why are you doing this?

120
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:54,474
You did this to yourself.

121
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:36,269
What?

122
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:39,473
I just flashed on myself.

123
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:42,139
Why am I in the Intersect?

124
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,384
So you don't know
why I'm in the Intersect.

125
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:20,505
Well, you didn't appear on the NSA radar
until after Bryce sent you the Intersect.

126
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:23,257
- Same with the CIA.
- Why don't I find that reassuring?

127
00:09:23,436 --> 00:09:25,928
The files that you saw
were of you in college, right?

128
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,766
Yes, yes.
Wait, what about Professor Fleming?

129
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,355
I was in his class, he was CIA.
Could that be it?

130
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,189
If we can find Fleming,
maybe he could give us answers.

131
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:37,362
- Okay. Let's do that.
It won't be easy.

132
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:39,690
Intel suggests the professor's
being hunted.

133
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:43,608
The NSA interviewed one witness
who ID'd a Magnus Einersson.

134
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:45,032
He's an Icelandic spy.

135
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:47,446
I'm sorry, Iceland does espionage?

136
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:50,079
Magnus buys and sells intel
to the highest bidder.

137
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:53,167
And Iceland isn't officially aware
of his activities.

138
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:55,916
It says here the crossbow
is his weapon of choice.

139
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,163
Oh, what, slingshot's too ineffective?

140
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:03,043
- Hey, buddy, where you going?
- What's up?

141
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,093
My lunch break is over.

142
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:07,387
- You haven't seen?
- Seen what?

143
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:11,341
New staggered lunch schedule. Dude.

144
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,930
Single shifts.

145
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,102
No more fraternization
in the break room.

146
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:18,105
We can't even eat lunch
together anymore.

147
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:21,152
No more Wednesday-Friday
surf and turf?

148
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,108
Harry Tang is drunk with power.

149
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:24,607
He could have an accident.

150
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,152
I'm just saying,
I know a guy, very reasonable.

151
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:33,704
His rates, I mean.

152
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:34,992
Not him.

153
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:37,239
Way to think outside of the box,
Anna.

154
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,702
Me likey.

155
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:42,039
- What do you say, Chuck?
- Are you two crazy? What?

156
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:45,919
I'm not gonna have a guy rubbed out
just because he upsets our lunch routine.

157
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:48,419
I see.
So you've already thrown in the towel?

158
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:49,873
Cool.

159
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:53,132
Not me, Chuck.

160
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:56,133
I'm not getting pushed around anymore.
No way.

161
00:10:57,642 --> 00:11:00,558
I hope you were aiming
for the recycling bin, Grimes...

162
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:04,219
...now that I'm instituting
a new Buy More Green program.

163
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:08,853
Tree-hugging
is all the rage these days.

164
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:12,861
And I plan on exploiting
the burgeoning conscience...

165
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:15,602
...of the American consumer.

166
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:18,196
Oh, that's very inspiring, Harry.

167
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,865
I'm gonna be the one
who breaks you, Grimes.

168
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,951
You know why?

169
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,666
Because you're soft.

170
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:34,581
Like pudding.

171
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:45,303
I've been doing
all these crunches, man.

172
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:46,672
I know, buddy.
- Yeah.

173
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,568
You didn't offer
to kill Harry for Anna, did you?

174
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:00,984
No. Why, you want me to kill him?

175
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:03,318
No. No, just curious.

176
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,692
We just got a hit off
a traffic camera in Hollywood.

177
00:12:07,617 --> 00:12:08,862
- That's Fleming.
- Thanks.

178
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:10,862
You saved me
a lot investigative work there.

179
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:13,486
- The DMV told me that.
- Wow. Sarcasm, what a surprise.

180
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:17,619
We located car Fleming's driving, local
address. We're bringing him in a. s.a. p.

181
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,327
- What do you need me for?
- Yours is a friendly face.

182
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,994
Professor sees you, he'll be
more inclined to cooperate, copy?

183
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:25,746
Yeah, except that I wasn't
the professor's star pupil.

184
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:27,756
We leave in three.

185
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:33,179
<i>As you're aware, you scored
perfectly on your midterm exam.</i>

186
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:35,554
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I was up all night studying.

187
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:37,681
- It was a monster.
- No offense.

188
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:39,724
You even aced the last section.

189
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:41,645
Encoded images.

190
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,180
Yeah, those were just kind
of a shot in the dark.

191
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:50,444
You may be aware, I keep an answer key
to every exam locked inside this office.

192
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:52,105
No, no, I wasn't aware of that.

193
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,402
Really?

194
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:56,777
Then how do you explain
the midterm answer key...

195
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:58,825
...being found in your fraternity room?

196
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:02,573
I'm sorry. You searched my room?

197
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,947
We received the tip
from a student this morning.

198
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:10,961
What? You got a tip about my room?

199
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:15,216
I need to know how you broke into
this office and stole the answers, Chuck.

200
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:18,135
I didn't steal anything.
I don't have to, I'm acing your class.

201
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:21,588
Exactly. The student also claimed
that you're selling copies.

202
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:22,885
What?

203
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:26,306
I know you're a scholarship student
and Stanford is a very expensive school.

204
00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:31,434
Look, whoever gave you your tip
was lying.

205
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:35,774
Our source was Bryce Larkin.

206
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:38,392
Your roommate.

207
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,779
All right. We all know the game.

208
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,499
We all know the rules.

209
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,540
This is Fingers of Fury.

210
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,500
The win goes to the contestant who can
identify the most TV shows in a minute.

211
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,579
All right. Who do you want next?

212
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:07,092
I challenge the ruling champion,
Morgan Grimes.

213
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:09,757
That's Mr. Morgan Grimes,
if you're nasty.

214
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:11,797
- Really?
- Oh, the suspense.

215
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:13,592
- You don't want me, punk.
- I do.

216
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:15,468
- Challenge accepted.
- Bang.

217
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:18,102
On my mark.

218
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:21,975
Three, two, one.

219
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,649
Mark.

220
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:25,275
<i>Dukes of Hazzard.
One Tree Hill.</i>

221
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:27,435
<i>Veronica Mars. Cold Case.
Gilmore Girls. Nip Tuck.</i>

222
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:28,981
<i>- Animaniacs.
Growing Pains.</i>

223
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:30,269
<i>- Smallville.
O. C., season two.</i>

224
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:31,602
<i>Pinky and the Brain.
- Underrated.</i>

225
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:34,574
<i>- Kung Fu: The Movie.
- Night Court. Night Court.</i>

226
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:38,194
They're not changing.
Anna, the channels are not changing.

227
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:40,452
It is now mine.

228
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:43,946
The one remote that controls them all.

229
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,289
The master remote.

230
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:49,835
- Your slacking days are over.
- Tang, there aren't even any customers.

231
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:52,086
Three repair orders just came in...

232
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:55,293
...which you nerds would know
if you were at your stations.

233
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:59,377
And, Grimes,
since there aren't any more customers...

234
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:03,054
...I need a cleanup
in the diaper-changing station.

235
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,511
Wear a mask.

236
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:09,348
We'll extract the professor
as quickly as possible.

237
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:10,896
You'll keep watch?

238
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:13,022
If I flash on any bad guys, I'll call.

239
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,858
Everything looks quiet, but...

240
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:17,524
I know, I know, stay in the car.

241
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:20,269
Okay, good. Let's go.

242
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:54,516
Professor Fleming. Hey.

243
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:57,182
No, no, no, wait, professor,
it's me, Chuck.

244
00:15:57,354 --> 00:16:00,722
Professor, stop.
We're here to extract you, Glass Castle.

245
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:03,313
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

246
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:06,194
But it's... It's Chuck.

247
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:11,359
I was in your Psychology
and Symbolism class at Stanford.

248
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:14,071
- I don't know if you remember me.
- Chuck Bartowski.

249
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:15,779
Of course I remember you.

250
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:21,327
Ha, ha. I guess it's not every day
you kick a guy out of school, huh?

251
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:23,372
At least, I hope not.

252
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:27,078
So you're, uh, with the Agency now.

253
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:30,836
- Why didn't you say so?
- I don't think I'm supposed to, really.

254
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:33,505
Well, we have code phrases.

255
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:36,346
- Didn't they train you?
- I mostly just stay in the car.

256
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:41,015
Next time, if it's a dangerous situation,
say, "Are you coming to the toga party?"

257
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:44,059
"Are you coming...?"
A real code phrase.

258
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,601
I like it. That's awesome.

259
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:47,437
What are we doing?
Who's bringing me in?

260
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:51,270
Oh, right. Yeah.
So Sarah and Casey will do that.

261
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:54,312
But, um, I was wondering
if I could ask you something first.

262
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,943
Why did the CIA
have a file on me at Stanford?

263
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:03,566
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:08,410
Oh, hey. Hey.

265
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:10,620
Hey, hey, buddy.

266
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:14,492
Let's not beat ourselves up.
You know, the past is the past.

267
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:19,545
Okay. Look, we didn't really know
each other that well at college.

268
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:22,123
And this is a little awkward, so...

269
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:24,175
What the...?

270
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:27,056
Oh, boy. Hey, hey, hang in there.

271
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:29,054
- Hang in there.
- I put in...

272
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:31,976
Give this to Bryce Larkin.

273
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:35,055
Bryce? Bryce Larkin? What...?

274
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,063
What did Bryce have to do with this?

275
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:39,891
Ah.

276
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,472
Ah.

277
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,528
I'm nobody, I swear.

278
00:17:54,912 --> 00:17:56,952
Casey, come on. Over here.

279
00:17:57,122 --> 00:17:59,614
Man down, man down! Help me!

280
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,075
Help. Hey, hey, come on.

281
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:04,002
Come on.

282
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:17,554
I'm sorry, Chuck, but we have to talk.

283
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:18,803
Okay.

284
00:18:20,393 --> 00:18:23,891
So how was the hospital?
Is the professor gonna be okay?

285
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,804
- They're putting him into surgery now.
- We can't talk to him, sort this mess out.

286
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,817
- You sure it was Magnus you saw?
- Gee, I don't know, Casey.

287
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,392
How many psycho archers
do you know?

288
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,936
I asked Fleming
about why I was in the Intersect.

289
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:38,985
- Should've brought him to you, sorry.
- It's not your fault.

290
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,110
I keep thinking about what he said.

291
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,776
Why would he want me
to bring those numbers to Bryce?

292
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,870
Bryce must have been one
of his CIA contacts.

293
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,247
Fleming was probably never told
of his death.

294
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:51,416
List off the numbers you remember.

295
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:54,035
There were like 10 of them.
A couple of nines.

296
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:56,620
- Five, started with a two.
That's it?

297
00:18:56,841 --> 00:19:00,884
- You have a computer for a brain...?
- It was a very stressful situation, okay?

298
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:03,424
I watched a guy
get skewered by a crossbow.

299
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:06,091
Look, Fleming knew something.

300
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:08,879
Before he fell, he said, "I'm sorry. "
Why would he say that?

301
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,718
I don't know, Chuck.

302
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:14,014
Yeah, well, I think he might know
why I'm in the Intersect.

303
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:17,891
You okay?

304
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:22,361
It's not late for you to change your mind
about revisiting the old alma mater.

305
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:25,357
- Spending time with me and Devon.
- Oh, please.

306
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:29,105
You just don't wanna be stuck in a car
alone with Awesome's frat buddies.

307
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:33,281
Maybe, or maybe I'm your sister
and I care about you...

308
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:37,914
...and I think that going back to Stanford
would help you to move on.

309
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,370
I love you, sis.

310
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:41,623
And I'd take a lot of bullets for you...

311
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:47,710
...but five hours in a car with Awesome
and his bros, that is asking too much.

312
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:52,005
Besides, if I came, you wouldn't have
room for your fun old foam finger.

313
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:53,715
- Stop it.
- What is this?

314
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:58,301
I don't know, but look at what I found.
See this? It was in my old college stuff.

315
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,016
<i>"The Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire. "</i>

316
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:04,181
You want me to return it
to the Stanford Library for you?

317
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:07,642
No. No, I'd kind of like to finish it.

318
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:10,894
- See how it ends.
- That book is like four years overdue.

319
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:13,353
What do you think
Stanford's gonna do, huh?

320
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,643
Expel me?

321
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:26,240
<i>You're a dead man, Chuck Bartowski.</i>

322
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:53,930
All right. Come on, Bryce.

323
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:58,891
Give it up, buddy. I know you're out
of ammo, I've been counting.

324
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,689
Buddy. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

325
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:05,404
You wouldn't fire at an unarmed guy.

326
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:06,897
I might.

327
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:09,446
It's hardly sportsmanlike.

328
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:11,619
What's this?

329
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,745
<i>Gynecology for Geeks.</i>

330
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,665
- You read this?
- No, is it a good read?

331
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,421
Got you. Larkin over Bartowski again.

332
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:32,970
I know what the numbers mean.
They're for a book in Stanford Library.

333
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:35,299
Bryce had a place
where he would stash stuff.

334
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:39,258
He told Fleming about it. Fleming must
have left the intel there for Bryce.

335
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:43,226
It's a matter of time before Magnus
figures it out and beats us to the book.

336
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,563
- Bingo.
- Unless we can beat him to it.

337
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:49,148
Bryce kept his stuff on the third floor.
There was a turn...

338
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,655
There was a turn...

339
00:21:53,823 --> 00:21:55,449
I'd have to be there to remember.

340
00:21:57,453 --> 00:22:03,204
I can't believe I'm about to say this,
but I have to go back to Stanford.

341
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,958
Cool.

342
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:21,922
This is really freaking me out.

343
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:24,514
It's like nothing has changed.

344
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:26,226
Is that good or bad?

345
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:28,266
It's, uh...

346
00:22:28,437 --> 00:22:30,061
It's, you know... Yeah, it's... Yeah.

347
00:22:33,523 --> 00:22:35,563
Woo! Go Bruins, huh?

348
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:38,189
Devon, put me down.

349
00:22:38,403 --> 00:22:40,692
- Put me down. Stop it.
Ha-ha-ha.

350
00:22:41,323 --> 00:22:42,521
You ladies ready to rock?

351
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:45,659
Yeah, when you put it that way,
maybe not. Okay.

352
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:47,528
- Nice barbecue.
Woo!

353
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:49,162
"Woo" you.

354
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:51,744
Uh, you wanna meet us
at the stadium?

355
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,666
I think we're gonna hang out here
until the game starts.

356
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:58,826
Yeah. I'm gonna take Sarah
for the Chuck Bartowski memorial tour.

357
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:02,703
So call me if any rabid Stanford fans
decide to put Awesome in the hospital.

358
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,122
Ah. See you.

359
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:05,332
- Have fun.
- Bye.

360
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,015
Plant a Stanford tree.

361
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,803
Create a renewable resource
for your children's future.

362
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,810
You wanna save
our environment, huh?

363
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,639
Take a shower, hippie.

364
00:23:22,482 --> 00:23:25,316
Nice job blending in with the crowd.
Who you rooting for, death?

365
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:27,393
Enh. Leave the quips to me.

366
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:30,026
The library's this way,
across the quad.

367
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,655
What is it?

368
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,405
I don't know, I figured this'd be tough,
but this place...

369
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:45,742
...is just a lot to take in, you know.

370
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:49,203
I used to have so much fun here,
and then...

371
00:23:49,422 --> 00:23:50,501
And then?

372
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:54,924
It was the worst day of my life,
getting kicked out of here.

373
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:58,419
Having to hear Ellie's voice
when I told her I was coming home.

374
00:23:58,596 --> 00:24:02,758
Packing up all my stuff
and leaving as Bryce just stood there.

375
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:04,676
He said I brought it on myself.

376
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:09,309
Why do you think
that Bryce betrayed you?

377
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,813
I don't know. He's had four years
to call and set the record straight.

378
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:14,856
And now that he's gone...

379
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:18,106
You know what? Forget it.

380
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:21,196
Bryce has betrayed
a lot of people, hasn't he?

381
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,110
Mm. Roger that.

382
00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:29,830
We have to play this really cool.

383
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:32,239
Magnus has the book number.
He could have beat us here.

384
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,788
Think he's in there?
- Maybe you should stay here.

385
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,586
Yeah, that always works out well.

386
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:39,541
You can't find the book without me.
I'm going in.

387
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:46,134
Oh, no, no, no.

388
00:24:46,304 --> 00:24:48,426
Looking for this?

389
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:53,259
- You stole my ID?
- I borrowed it to reactivate it.

390
00:24:53,435 --> 00:24:56,009
Sorry, I couldn't wipe the idiot grin
off your face in Photoshop.

391
00:24:56,188 --> 00:24:57,847
Mm.

392
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:14,076
We have a situation.

393
00:25:14,286 --> 00:25:16,610
We have a situation here.

394
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:18,531
Harry Tang is a control freak.

395
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:21,870
And his master remote
is a symbol of that control.

396
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,750
It's his totem.

397
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:27,080
We steal the remote,
and we take control of the televisions.

398
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,335
Rendering Harry impotent.

399
00:25:29,506 --> 00:25:31,664
That's totally curable, by the way.

400
00:25:33,552 --> 00:25:36,090
Here's the thing,
he keeps the remote in his locker.

401
00:25:36,263 --> 00:25:39,348
He does, but it's padlocked.
Harry has the only key.

402
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,714
- So...
- I can get it.

403
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:46,760
Trust me, you do not want to know.

404
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,435
- I do want to know.
- I wanna know.

405
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,566
- You guys wanna know?
You shouldn't make that call.

406
00:25:58,032 --> 00:26:00,653
Assistant Manager Tang?

407
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:02,611
I'm busy.

408
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:05,988
I'd like your opinion
about how we could streamline...

409
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:08,999
...our standing work orders
to operate more efficiently.

410
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,241
That's a admirable goal, young lady.

411
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,167
You know, your new position
of authority has changed you.

412
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:20,126
You look different.

413
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:22,380
Maybe it's the new
monogrammed shirt.

414
00:26:23,386 --> 00:26:26,588
Maybe it's just the cut of your slacks.

415
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:30,634
I hope you plan to make other changes
around the Buy More.

416
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:33,637
In fact, I can't wait...

417
00:26:33,854 --> 00:26:39,607
...for your next massive,
invasive move.

418
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:43,608
Well, ahem, for starters...

419
00:26:43,778 --> 00:26:48,190
...I think that the staff sits around
too far, far too often.

420
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:50,150
Thank you.

421
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:05,045
There. There, that row.

422
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:07,212
Oh, no.

423
00:27:07,383 --> 00:27:10,003
We're too late, Magnus beat us here.
He's got the book.

424
00:27:10,218 --> 00:27:11,841
Hold on.

425
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:15,089
Got you.

426
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:21,181
Hold on a second.

427
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,809
- Gotcha.
- The intel.

428
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:33,684
The book number was just a way
to mark the spot.

429
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:37,314
Let's get out here before Magnus
realizes that book he has is worthless.

430
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:38,867
Hey, you, don't move.

431
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,320
Charles Bartowski?

432
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:45,444
You still owe the library $294.68
in late fees.

433
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,490
- Do you take credit cards?
This isn't funny.

434
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,916
Chuck, run.

435
00:27:55,047 --> 00:27:57,040
Head for the back door, Chuck.

436
00:27:59,175 --> 00:28:01,666
It's hard to hate Stanford
because they suck so hard.

437
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:03,921
I wish we were playing
SC today, huh?

438
00:28:32,747 --> 00:28:34,621
- There you are.
Hey, you, freeze!

439
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:39,627
All right, they spotted us.
Okay, we have to go.

440
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:42,373
- I swear this school has it in for me.
- Come on.

441
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:43,661
Excuse us, excuse us!

442
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,622
That guy is wasted.
I want what he had.

443
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:48,880
Wake up. Wake up.

444
00:29:03,856 --> 00:29:04,970
Jackpot, baby.

445
00:29:05,189 --> 00:29:09,401
Looking for something, Mr. Grimes?

446
00:29:10,027 --> 00:29:11,902
Are you kidding me? You betrayed us?

447
00:29:16,784 --> 00:29:18,658
Nice try, pudding.

448
00:29:19,494 --> 00:29:21,486
I'm not afraid of you.
You can't fire me.

449
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:24,202
No, but I can make you wish I did.

450
00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:26,573
I need fresh bodies in The Hole.

451
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:28,500
Come on, dude, not The Hole.

452
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:30,544
Harry, just let's...

453
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:40,384
We're safe for now.

454
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:42,885
I need to see what's on this disc.
Hey, Chuck.

455
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:45,047
- That's top secret.
Yeah, well, so am I.

456
00:29:45,223 --> 00:29:48,759
There could be answers on this disk
about why I'm in the Intersect.

457
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:54,766
That's testing data.

458
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:57,772
And videotaped interviews.
These are students.

459
00:29:57,944 --> 00:30:00,944
Exactly. Students that were recruited
into the CIA by Fleming.

460
00:30:01,112 --> 00:30:04,067
Ten years worth.
It's all their current information.

461
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:07,360
No wonder Magnus wanted it so badly.
Foreign governments would pay for that.

462
00:30:07,536 --> 00:30:09,326
Look at this: Bryce Larkin.

463
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:11,743
Bryce joined the CIA our junior year?

464
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:15,904
- Enough. Now we know what he's after.
- No, wait, that's me. I'm in here too.

465
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:17,828
- Click it.
- Don't click it.

466
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:19,744
I never applied to be in the CIA.

467
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:21,753
Chuck, get down!

468
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:24,423
Go!

469
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:33,386
You think this would be a good time
for me to be waiting in the car?

470
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:48,728
I have an idea. Get me out of here.

471
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,948
Chuck, when I say go,
run out the side door.

472
00:30:53,157 --> 00:30:55,611
Protect the disc. We'll cover you.

473
00:30:56,452 --> 00:30:58,195
Go!

474
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:08,503
All right. Computers.

475
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:10,329
Here we go.

476
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:15,506
Ow.

477
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:18,001
Okay, okay, okay.

478
00:31:19,637 --> 00:31:21,049
Come on.

479
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:29,886
Excuse me.

480
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:32,644
<i>Hello?
- Hi. Hi, is this...?</i>

481
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:35,436
Is this Glenda Mitchell?
We're in the science building.

482
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:37,727
It's an emergency.
Bring lots of big guns.

483
00:31:37,945 --> 00:31:39,984
I'm sorry,
you've got the wrong number.

484
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:42,189
Crap, there's a code phrase.

485
00:31:43,617 --> 00:31:45,740
Are you coming to the toga party?

486
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:51,325
There's a place you can plant it
in the quad. Let me give you directions.

487
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:56,246
We have a situation right now.

488
00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:58,370
<i>Bring any ammunition.</i>

489
00:31:58,547 --> 00:32:00,503
Any equipment you have
for killing bad guys.

490
00:32:00,714 --> 00:32:02,956
Are you coming to the toga party?

491
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:08,504
Lots of bad guys are surrounding us.

492
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,756
Are you coming to the toga party?
Bye-bye.

493
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,967
- Agent Katz?
- Yeah, hey, Frodo, is that you?

494
00:32:16,145 --> 00:32:18,102
I thought my codename
was Samwise Gamgee.

495
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:20,512
Samwise.
Why don't you get your thumb out?

496
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:23,222
Morgan,
this is really, really not a good time.

497
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,316
It's not a good time here either, okay?

498
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:28,273
I'm stuck in The Hole
doing customer service. Ow!

499
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:29,816
<i>These kids are animals.</i>

500
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,320
But I'm at Stanford.
What do you want me to do?

501
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,023
Do you have the code
to Harry Tang's master remote?

502
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,740
<i>I think I can use it to bargain
for my freedom.</i>

503
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:41,573
<i>Okay, okay.
The code is O-U-8- 1-2-pound.</i>

504
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,417
Dude, this is why you're my hero.
Thank you so much.

505
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:49,417
Throwing things at adults' heads is not...
That's not gonna help you in life.

506
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:57,088
Oh, no.

507
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,471
I got two rounds left.

508
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,821
- I've got half a mag.
Drop your weapons and stand up.

509
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:20,521
Hands where we can see them.

510
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:22,283
I'm gonna go for it.

511
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,942
- You in?
- You bet.

512
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,365
Hate long goodbyes.

513
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:34,036
Actually, why don't you drop
your weapons?

514
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,245
- Like someone called the cavalry.
Good.

515
00:33:36,463 --> 00:33:38,953
Because I only had one shot left.

516
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:41,163
Whew.

517
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,542
- Aren't you in econ. With me?
- Yeah.

518
00:33:57,938 --> 00:34:01,604
Please don't, please don't,
please don't.

519
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:06,441
Don't.

520
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:13,905
You must be Chuck Bartowski.
I just got your message.

521
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,906
- Are you okay?
- I'm just glad you check your voice mail.

522
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:32,294
<i>Probably got
a game plan here. He's got a good caddy.</i>

523
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,876
<i>Coming on now
and breaking through the pack.</i>

524
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:38,843
<i>- She almost got knocked off by two...
- What's going on?</i>

525
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:40,679
<i>She gets passed...</i>

526
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:43,471
<i>...has only the pavement to beat
for another critical point.</i>

527
00:34:43,644 --> 00:34:45,602
What's happening?

528
00:34:47,522 --> 00:34:49,599
Grimes!

529
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:56,482
- Hey, what's up? What going on?
- You reprogrammed my remote.

530
00:34:56,697 --> 00:35:00,196
- Wow, you can do that?
- You've gone too far, Grimes.

531
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:04,904
I've done nothing. I've been here all day
helping these lovely customers.

532
00:35:06,122 --> 00:35:09,288
But I may be able to fix it.

533
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,701
For a price.

534
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,292
I want out of The Hole.

535
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,630
I'd rather take a potato peeler
to my groin.

536
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,999
Okay. Fine with me.

537
00:35:20,176 --> 00:35:22,962
I hope that Big Mike
doesn't get too upset, though...

538
00:35:23,136 --> 00:35:26,755
...if all the televisions just happen
to change to, I don't know...

539
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:28,009
<i>...Passion Cove?</i>

540
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:31,017
Quid pro quo, Harry.

541
00:35:31,185 --> 00:35:33,260
Yes or no?

542
00:35:38,356 --> 00:35:41,228
Attaboy. Nice and easy.

543
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:46,526
Smart man.

544
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:49,449
You're dismissed.

545
00:35:51,452 --> 00:35:54,204
Go ahead. Yes.

546
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:57,034
True leader. Yes.

547
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:58,452
The Grimes.

548
00:36:01,002 --> 00:36:02,992
<i>I can't believe that game
was such a wash.</i>

549
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:04,250
<i>What a blowout.</i>

550
00:36:04,798 --> 00:36:07,501
Worst game ever.

551
00:36:07,674 --> 00:36:10,675
It's not coming off.
I think I used the wrong kind of paint.

552
00:36:10,844 --> 00:36:12,302
Well, what brand was it?

553
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,386
Brand? I don't know.
One of the guys picked it up.

554
00:36:15,555 --> 00:36:17,713
Try some stronger soap.

555
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,935
So how painful was it?
Not the game, I mean.

556
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:26,762
Well, uh, do you remember the evening
with Morgan at the karaoke club?

557
00:36:26,939 --> 00:36:30,060
His cover of Peter Cetera's
"Glory of Love" he dedicated to you?

558
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:32,025
<i>That completely ruined Karate Kid II.</i>

559
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:34,526
Seriously, though,
thanks for pushing me.

560
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:38,570
After the initial shock and horror,
it was a relief to finally go back.

561
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:40,486
Say goodbye.

562
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:43,452
I'm proud of you. You know?

563
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:46,291
You faced your past, head-on.

564
00:36:46,457 --> 00:36:49,030
Did you find
what you were looking for?

565
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:51,791
Almost.

566
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,831
You'll get there.

567
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,011
You didn't think
we'd let you keep that, did you?

568
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,135
I need to know, Sarah.

569
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,388
Okay, Chuck.

570
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:22,109
<i>Test subject 0326. Bartowski.</i>

571
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:24,817
<i>This will be his first interview.</i>

572
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:27,907
<i>Send Chuck in.</i>

573
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:34,115
<i>Bryce? This isn't a good time.
I'm waiting for another student.</i>

574
00:37:34,582 --> 00:37:38,032
<i>Chuck Bartowski?
He never got your message.</i>

575
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,585
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

576
00:37:39,796 --> 00:37:42,959
<i>You put Chuck
on the CIA recruitment track?</i>

577
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:46,297
<i>It's not up to me, Bryce.
They want him for the Omaha Project.</i>

578
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:49,082
<i>That's a military operation.
They'll turn Chuck into...</i>

579
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:52,427
<i>I'm required to send
all the top test results to the Agency.</i>

580
00:37:52,596 --> 00:37:55,514
<i>- I want my friend out of this.
He's a perfect candidate.</i>

581
00:37:55,683 --> 00:37:58,849
<i>Keywords in his essay responses
correlate to 98 percent...</i>

582
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,763
<i>...of the images in the exam.</i>

583
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,053
<i>You don't get it.</i>

584
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:04,726
<i>Chuck's a good person.</i>

585
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:07,723
<i>He's got too much heart
for this kind of work.</i>

586
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,109
<i>He's no operative.</i>

587
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:12,768
<i>You can't put him out in the field.
He won't survive.</i>

588
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:16,565
<i>The Agency is not gonna
let go of a recruit this promising.</i>

589
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:19,411
<i>The amount of information
he can retain...?</i>

590
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:21,653
<i>They're not gonna give him a choice?</i>

591
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:24,114
<i>He's in no matter what.</i>

592
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,582
<i>If he cheated on the exam,
copied all the answers...</i>

593
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:36,543
<i>...it would invalidate the results,
wouldn't it?</i>

594
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:38,876
<i>Yes.
Good.</i>

595
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:41,590
<i>Now you're going to help me,
professor.</i>

596
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,347
Bryce framed me for cheating
to save me.

597
00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:54,434
- Why didn't he just tell me that?
- He couldn't.

598
00:38:54,651 --> 00:38:56,806
They had already recruited him.

599
00:38:58,195 --> 00:39:00,437
If he had a reason
for getting me kicked out...

600
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:03,150
...maybe he had a good reason
to break into the Intersect too.

601
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:07,359
And maybe he had a good reason
for sending it to you.

602
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:10,991
I just wish I could talk to him.

603
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:14,957
It must have tore him up
to not be able to tell me.

604
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,163
No one can know about this.

605
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:22,707
For your own safety, okay?

606
00:39:22,924 --> 00:39:24,418
Sure.

607
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,505
No one would believe me anyway.

608
00:40:10,462 --> 00:40:12,338
You're in Double-E 131?

609
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:15,671
Catch you later, Bryce.
- It's pretty brutal, huh?

610
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:19,425
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I...

611
00:40:19,638 --> 00:40:23,387
The only reason I signed up is because
I'm building my own version of, uh...

612
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:27,682
- It's kind of embarrassing, actually.
- What?

613
00:40:28,771 --> 00:40:32,519
You don't remember
that old computer game "Zork," do you?

614
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:35,139
- "You are likely to be eaten by a grue. "
- Ha-ha-ha.

615
00:40:35,317 --> 00:40:37,940
- Holy crap, you do remember "Zork. "
- I loved that game.

616
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:40,270
I haven't thought about it
in a while, but...

617
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:41,858
It's probably a good thing.

618
00:40:42,074 --> 00:40:43,355
I disagree.

619
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:45,069
It's 1999.

620
00:40:45,618 --> 00:40:48,987
- Next millennium belongs to the geek.
- All right.

621
00:40:49,163 --> 00:40:54,951
But still, text-based computer games
don't exactly play with the chicks.

622
00:40:55,711 --> 00:40:58,914
Well, this girl, Jill, on my floor
is nuts about EverQuest.

623
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,079
- Are you serious?
- Lf you want, you can meet her.

624
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:03,969
- Really? Right now?
- Yeah, she's over in the quad.

625
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:07,966
Uh, yeah. I would very much like
to meet her.

626
00:41:08,181 --> 00:41:12,472
- You need some help?
- No, oh, no, I'm fine. I just, you know...

627
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:14,849
College.

628
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:17,095
- Hi, I'm, uh, Chuck, by the way.
- Bryce.

629
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:20,256
- Nice to meet you, Chuck.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

630
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:24,355
So, um, she really likes EverQuest, huh? I
mean, it's not...

631
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:26,684
Yeah, I think she even plays "Zork. "

632
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,865
Are you kidding?
