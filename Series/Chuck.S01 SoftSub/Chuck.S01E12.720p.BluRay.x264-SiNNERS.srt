1
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,990
Are you insane? Come back to bed.

2
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,077
And miss all the good sunlight?

3
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:33,378
Come on, llsa. It's not like the civil war's
gonna go anywhere.

4
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,355
Tempting.

5
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:39,532
- But I have a deadline.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:42,500
Why did ever I let myself
get involved with a photojournalist?

7
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:44,877
And how did I get myself
mixed up with a...?

8
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:47,549
- What do you call yourself again?
- An energy consultant.

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,101
What does that even mean?

10
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,025
It means I get to sleep in late.

11
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:52,566
- Here's my offer...
- Yeah?

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,281
Mr. Energy-Consultant:

13
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:59,243
You stay in bed
and preserve your precious energy.

14
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,094
And I'll be back before you know it.

15
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:07,056
Bye-bye, Sugar Bear.

16
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:23,901
<i>Did you hear a word I said?</i>

17
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:25,242
Hello?

18
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:26,995
Do you speak English?

19
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:31,253
Hello?

20
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:32,972
- Yeah.
- Then why aren't you moving?

21
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:34,560
Because if you were listening...

22
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,899
...then you'd be walking to the register
to get me my 300 bucks.

23
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:42,196
Sir, I repeat, I cannot offer you a refund
without a valid receipt.

24
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,252
You can't get me a refund,
you won't get me an exchange.

25
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,211
What exactly are you capable of doing,
big Johnny...

26
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:49,798
...you sad, impotent oaf?

27
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:54,104
- I'm capable of stopping your heart...
- Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

28
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,519
Hey, John,
what seems to be the problem here?

29
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:58,449
- It's the auto focus, right?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:02,200
It happens all the time, it's a quick fix.
And I can take care of it personally.

31
00:03:02,377 --> 00:03:06,082
If you'll leave your name and number
at the Nerd Herd desk, I'll take care of it.

32
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:09,550
- Was that so hard?
- Thank you, have a good day.

33
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:12,768
Just breathe, Casey, breathe.
Breathe. Or growl.

34
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,900
Growling also works. Very good.

35
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:17,155
Very, very good.

36
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:19,867
Hey.

37
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:22,627
- You're not going to believe it.
- You got that server to work?

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,252
I got Tara Reid's phone number.

39
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:28,603
What have I told you
about stalking "celebrities" online?

40
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:30,851
And by the way,
who doesn't have her phone number?

41
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:32,814
Is that the Grand Seville's database?

42
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:36,201
I can access every guest staying
at L.A.'s swankiest hotel.

43
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:39,871
It's got it all: Room numbers,
credit cards, spank-per-view records.

44
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:42,924
That's super, Jeff. I'll let the hotel
know their computer's ready.

45
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,891
You're giving away the Holy Grail.

46
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,553
Tara!

47
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,395
Grand Seville, please don't sue us.

48
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,249
Dmitry Siljak.

49
00:03:58,423 --> 00:04:01,881
Known alias of black-market arms dealer
specializing in former Soviet...

50
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:20,637
Okay. Man, I'm gonna have
a headache tomorrow.

51
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,624
Ilsa Trinchina.

52
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:34,585
AP photographer. Rumored lover
of undercover NSA agent.

53
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,052
Whereabouts unknown.

54
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:39,552
Sugar Bear.

55
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,573
Sugar Bear's girlfriend's in town.

56
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,625
Casey, hey, hey, hey.
Wait up, wait up.

57
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:56,139
I just had the mother lode
of all bad-guy flashes.

58
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:58,355
- Who are they?
- Mostly Russian.

59
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:00,684
All traveling under aliases,
fake passports.

60
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:04,069
They're arms dealers, money launderers,
black-market smugglers.

61
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:07,333
Yeah, they're all having a douchebag
convention at the Grand Seville.

62
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:09,871
I'll run it up the flagpole,
see what Command wants.

63
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:13,340
Aah, uh, one more thing.
There was another name...

64
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:15,262
One name that I flashed on, actually.

65
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,024
But I left it...

66
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,106
- Her, off of the list.
- What are you talking about, Bartowski?

67
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:27,255
Does the name llsa Trinchina
mean anything to you...

68
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:28,925
...Sugar Bear?

69
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:33,557
You say that name ever again
and I will end you.

70
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:36,526
Nod if you understand.

71
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:42,077
Casey, you're hurting the Intersect.

72
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:30,946
Hey, try this.
It's the new breakfast corn dog...

73
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:33,610
...with country sausage and syrup
wrapped in pancake.

74
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:36,579
Thank you, but maybe later.
I have serious business to discuss.

75
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:39,841
Matter of national security.
Casey's ex-girlfriend is in town.

76
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:41,383
- How do you know...?
- I flashed.

77
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:43,847
Her name is llsa Trinchina,
super-hot, super-sexy.

78
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,859
- At the Grand Seville as we speak.
- Does Casey know?

79
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:49,521
Almost ripped my head off.
It must've been a bad break-up.

80
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,075
I always imagined Casey
was built like a Ken doll.

81
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:53,708
You know, downstairs?

82
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,624
I don't know what kind of woman
would go for a guy like Casey.

83
00:06:57,844 --> 00:07:00,054
I was, ahh, kind of hoping
you'd help me find out.

84
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:04,523
Ilsa is a civilian, a foreign national.
The Intersect has nothing on her...

85
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:07,531
...except love letters I'll never
be able to scrub out of my brain.

86
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,704
You want me to go behind Casey's back,
re-allocate CIA resources...

87
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:15,749
...and violate this woman's privacy
so you can find out what their story is?

88
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,048
Tell me you're not curious.

89
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:21,059
- Hi.
- Hi.

90
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,905
Uh, I'm Ellie Bartowski, Chuck's sister?

91
00:07:24,113 --> 00:07:25,396
Oh, yes, of course.

92
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:27,737
I recognize Chuck's sensual mouth.

93
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,705
Devon.

94
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,336
Lester.
- Jeff.

95
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:35,465
Well, any co-worker of Chuck's is a...

96
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:38,723
A guy who can help me pick
some stuff out to buy, huh? Ha.

97
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:42,740
Jeff, Lester, uh, give my guests
a little breathing room.

98
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:45,110
We have business to discuss.

99
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:54,007
So, what can I help you with
today, ma'am?

100
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:57,397
This year for our anniversary,
Devon and I are making more money.

101
00:07:57,608 --> 00:08:00,530
We decided to buy one large gift
instead of two smaller ones.

102
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:03,538
- Awesome, right?
- Gives me a chill when you say it, babe.

103
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:07,629
Uh, have we settled
on what that item may be?

104
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,711
Yes.

105
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:14,980
Beautiful, isn't she?

106
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,365
Beautiful, isn't she?

107
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:22,866
- Think of the things we can watch.
- Think of the things we can wash.

108
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:26,799
I want you guys to know
that I'm not just a salesman.

109
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:30,883
I've come to think of myself
as a retail therapist.

110
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:34,231
Ellie, why do you really want
the television?

111
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:37,283
So we can spend more time together.
Quiet evenings at home.

112
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:40,618
- Cuddling on the couch.
- That's good. Good, good.

113
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:42,169
Devon.

114
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,584
What's really behind
the washer and dryer?

115
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,846
- So we can spend more time together.
- What?

116
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:49,264
No more Laundromats.

117
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:52,193
We come home and go onto a run
without worrying about dirty shorts.

118
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:53,774
I never go running with you.

119
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,698
Maybe you would
with a drawer full of clean jog bras.

120
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,326
Oh, sorry. One second.

121
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:01,415
Oh, that's the hospital. I have to go.

122
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:03,428
Well, what about our anniversary gift?

123
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:06,394
You know what, honey?
Why don't you just surprise me, okay?

124
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:08,437
Love you.

125
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,025
<i>We received your report, major.</i>

126
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:17,122
<i>Ex-KGB, Eastern-bloc thugs,
Russian arms dealers.</i>

127
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:21,215
<i>Frankly, we're not used to seeing this
particular crowd stateside these days.</i>

128
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:23,763
Not since President Reagan
won the Cold War, huh, general?

129
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:26,222
So you want us to infiltrate
the Grand Seville.

130
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,321
<i>The hotel's bar has been booked
for a private party early this evening.</i>

131
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,280
Fine, I'll clear my schedule.
But just because it's you, general.

132
00:09:32,454 --> 00:09:35,295
<i>Mr. Bartowski,
it's up to you to tell us...</i>

133
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:38,301
<i>...what these criminal agents
are all doing in Los Angeles.</i>

134
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,630
<i>You and Agent Walker
are going undercover.</i>

135
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:42,803
<i>We need you
to press some Russian flesh.</i>

136
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:46,645
<i>See what you can flash on.
And, uh, good luck.</i>

137
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:50,110
So, what about you, Casey?

138
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:51,993
- What about me?
I don't know.

139
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,126
If Sarah and I have to go to the hotel
to press Russian flesh...

140
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,795
...you might wanna drop in
on somebody whose name...

141
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,936
- Chuck.
- Okay, fine, I'll shut up. Jeez, what?

142
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,309
What is with that guy?
He doesn't wanna see his ex.

143
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:05,279
I doubt it.

144
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:07,451
Ilsa's dead.

145
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:15,718
If Casey's girlfriend is dead, who's
the llsa Trinchina staying at this hotel?

146
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,980
Someone with a fake passport.
It happens all the time in Russia.

147
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:21,477
People die and their personal info
gets recycled.

148
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,408
My God. That's so horrible.
No wonder Casey's so messed up.

149
00:10:24,618 --> 00:10:29,037
Casey, uh, hey. I just... You know what,
I'm sorry about what I said earlier...

150
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,881
Drop it, Chuck. You heard the general,
we got work to do.

151
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:34,680
There's our Russians.

152
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:38,727
Wait, this isn't a black-tie thing.
I'm way overdressed.

153
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,949
Yeah, lose the jacket.

154
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:49,962
- What's this?
Perfect.

155
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:53,350
It would've been nice to know
that I was the help on this mission.

156
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,811
- I could've done some character study.
Recognize anyone, Chuck?

157
00:10:58,364 --> 00:11:02,236
That's, uh, Dmitry Siljak.
Black-market arms dealer.

158
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:09,880
Sergey "Noodles" Romanov.
Freelance hit man.

159
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:15,314
Sasha! Is that you, my sweet Sasha?

160
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,243
Everybody meet fourth cousin
on my mother's side!

161
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,795
Come and give your cousin
great big hug!

162
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:26,217
Ow! Ow! Hey.

163
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,477
Chuck!
Russia! Sasha!

164
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:33,985
- Russian. Sasha. Ha, ha.
- Sasha, Sasha!

165
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:35,399
Sasha wants to dance!

166
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:37,697
No, no. No.

167
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:43,543
How much for the whole night?

168
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:49,061
Get low. Get low, get low.

169
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:54,652
We are good dancers, aren't we,
us Russians?

170
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,991
Like, uh, Baryshnikov. Ha, ha.

171
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,837
<i>White Nights?
Anybody seen White Nights?</i>

172
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:01,127
Do it like a Russki. Do it like a Russki.

173
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,759
Yeah, we're in a circle. We're in a...

174
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:22,136
Sasha. You like blond.

175
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:25,392
Come! Very nice.

176
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,235
She is all yours, Sasha.

177
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,667
She's here. Ilsa is here.

178
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,837
- What? Are you sure?
- Look, over there.

179
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:41,518
Our cover's been compromised.
Requesting extraction.

180
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:43,067
I'm on it.

181
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:49,622
Llsa?

182
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:56,174
Oh, my God.

183
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,973
What did you...?

184
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,402
How are you alive?

185
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,660
No one could have survived that blast.

186
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:11,164
I'm so sorry.

187
00:13:11,718 --> 00:13:13,131
Why are you sorry?

188
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:14,974
All I remember is...

189
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:18,517
...I woke up in the hospital in Grozny
two weeks after the blast.

190
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:21,193
Couldn't see, I couldn't hear.

191
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:25,030
It took another two months
for me to remember my name.

192
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:29,544
But I never forgot your face.

193
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:33,681
- We're Russian.
Russian!

194
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:35,564
Oh, motherland.

195
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:40,116
Come with me. Keep on coming.

196
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:43,583
- You crazy people.
- We've gotta get him out of here.

197
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:46,673
The guy spent four years of his life
thinking he'd never see her again.

198
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:48,255
His cover has been compromised.

199
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,970
Can't the man live without a cover
for a couple of minutes?

200
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:54,565
Hello, everybody.
How we doing tonight, huh?

201
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:01,286
Good. Are we doing good?

202
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:04,880
Sarah. Sarah, I think I know
what brought all the baddies together.

203
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:08,592
Him, Victor Federov,
a Russian oligarch...

204
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:12,023
...with ties to everything from the Mob
to a plot to overthrow parliament.

205
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:14,606
What brings you to Los Angeles?
Why are you here?

206
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:17,621
And with this, I'd like to introduce you
to a woman...

207
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:22,000
...who'll make me the happiest man
on Earth by becoming my wife.

208
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:25,139
Ilsa Trinchina.

209
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,371
Hey, buddy.

210
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,701
- How you feeling?
- How am I feeling?

211
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,625
Yeah, uh, you know, about last night.

212
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:02,345
Our mission was a success.
You ID'd Victor Federov.

213
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,440
Agent Walker has been assigned
to set up a surveillance on the target.

214
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:07,487
In short, I feel fine-effing-tastic.

215
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,994
Well, okay. I mean, I guess, uh...

216
00:15:11,164 --> 00:15:15,215
...you know, I was referring more
to the you-and-llsa situation.

217
00:15:15,425 --> 00:15:17,466
Thought maybe you'd wanna
talk about the fact...

218
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:19,847
...that girl you thought was dead
isn't actually dead.

219
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,598
No.

220
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:24,938
Great, good, good.
Really good session here, Casey.

221
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:26,943
Feel like we're making a breakthrough.

222
00:15:27,118 --> 00:15:29,362
I just want you to know
that I'm a good listener.

223
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:31,458
If you ever wanna
talk about anything...

224
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:35,251
...if you wanna use me
as a sounding board for your emotions...

225
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,354
Finding everything okay?

226
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,551
How you doing?

227
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:14,844
Come on, buddy.
Just give me something, anything.

228
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:17,314
Where's she from
or where did you two meet?

229
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:19,440
Why is this so important to you,
Chuck?

230
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:21,826
Why do you care about me and llsa?

231
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:24,326
I don't know, man, okay? I just...

232
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:27,341
I think it'd be nice to know
you had a life before...

233
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:30,384
...this.

234
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:32,929
I just figured if a guy like you
can find love...

235
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:36,230
...no offense, Casey,
then maybe there's hope for me too.

236
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:40,324
Maybe this whole spy business
isn't as screwed up as I think it is.

237
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,418
- Hmm.
- "Hmm"?

238
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,048
That's... Okay, you know what?

239
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:47,761
If you wanna go through life emotionally
constipated and alone, suit yourself.

240
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:51,852
I'll let you get back to protecting
the greater good, you freaking robot.

241
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:55,276
I met her in a flower market.

242
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,789
In Rome.

243
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:06,423
Ilsa was the most beautiful thing
I had ever seen.

244
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:09,647
I knew it.

245
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,618
It's alive!

246
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,835
Yeah, there she is. There she is.

247
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:42,424
Hey, think Ellie's gonna be cool
with the washer and dryer?

248
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:44,812
Ah, no worries.

249
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:47,692
Oh, hey, babe. Happy anniversary.

250
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:51,413
You got the washer and dryer.

251
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:54,913
Well, you told me to surprise you,
so surprise. Ha, ha.

252
00:17:56,844 --> 00:18:00,015
You getting what you want
isn't a surprise.

253
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,438
What's that supposed to mean?

254
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:04,810
It means that I would like
to go to brunch...

255
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:07,564
...but you would rather
go rock climbing.

256
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,161
Or I wanna go winetasting in Napa...

257
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:13,007
...but you would rather go to Baja
and go kitesurfing.

258
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:15,878
- It's always about what you want.
Come on, babe.

259
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:18,175
It's just a washer and dryer.

260
00:18:18,352 --> 00:18:21,891
It's not just a washer and dryer.
It's about what it represents.

261
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:23,691
It represents clean clothes.

262
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:26,032
- Have you ever considered...?
What?

263
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:28,371
Well, that maybe,
on an unconscious level...

264
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:32,593
...Devon, uh, has a need to exercise
or go on these extreme adventures...

265
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:35,849
...because, well,
maybe he's scared of intimacy.

266
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:37,265
Of being tied down.

267
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,727
- Yes, exactly.
- What? No.

268
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:41,104
Ellie, how does that make you feel?

269
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:46,784
Like I'm banking on my future
with a giant, muscly child.

270
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:49,925
And I can't do it anymore.

271
00:18:54,396 --> 00:18:56,722
And, Devon? You? How do you feel?

272
00:18:58,112 --> 00:18:59,988
Of course. Naturally, sure.

273
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:02,245
Sure, it was great.

274
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:04,741
We had what we had, but it's over.

275
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:09,252
So that's it? You're just gonna
let her walk back out of your life?

276
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:12,012
Seems like the smart play, Chuck.

277
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:15,183
Nice girls don't marry
corrupt Russian oligarchs.

278
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,738
I hate to break it to you...

279
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,697
...but nice girls don't go around
marrying guys like you, either.

280
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:23,583
G- man assassin, international spy?
I mean, pardon me for saying it, Casey...

281
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:26,677
...but at least on paper
you're kind of an unsavory dude.

282
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:28,799
Granted.

283
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:31,940
- Ilsa never knew what I do for a living.
- That's exactly my point.

284
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:38,160
What if llsa doesn't know what
her fiancé Victor does for a living, either?

285
00:19:38,874 --> 00:19:41,368
- What are you saying I do?
- Stick to your strengths, buddy.

286
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,006
Come on, you're a fighter.
You gotta fight for her.

287
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,349
This is a terrible idea.
We shouldn't be here. Can't we just...?

288
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,603
Negatory. We have passed
the point of no return.

289
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:53,655
- No retreat, soldier.
- This isn't a mission.

290
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:57,449
We're just two guys sneaking
down a hall like a couple of numbnuts.

291
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:58,914
Hey.

292
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:02,294
- What are you two doing here?
- I'd like to apologize, Agent Walker.

293
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,096
- Chuck, here convinced me...
- To come down to the hotel.

294
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:08,723
To bring me. Maybe I could flash on
some cool stuff or things or whatever.

295
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,772
You volunteered to go
on an all-night stakeout?

296
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,573
Doesn't sound like me, does it?
I know.

297
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:16,752
But I couldn't sleep, so I thought
it would do me some good...

298
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:19,497
...to, ahh, look at some surveillance
monitors or something.

299
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,303
Maybe... knock me right out, so...

300
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:24,437
This way.

301
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:31,538
I've already tapped into
the hotel security feed.

302
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:35,917
You two get comfy, I'm gonna deliver
the surveillance to the Bridal Suite.

303
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:37,462
- Good bug.
- With any luck...

304
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:41,140
...we'll get enough dirt off the wire,
you take the target down on U.S. Soil.

305
00:20:41,354 --> 00:20:43,099
- Have fun.
- Don't wait up.

306
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:46,029
Just gonna be looking at, ahh,
ahem, monitors and...

307
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:54,880
- Um, Casey?
- What, you flash?

308
00:20:55,093 --> 00:20:57,767
Look who's hitting the bar the night
before her own wedding.

309
00:20:59,437 --> 00:21:03,225
Does that look like the face of a woman
who's happy about getting married?

310
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:06,780
Where's she going?

311
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,411
Look, look, look.
This is your chance, buddy.

312
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:14,591
This is your chance. Look at her, Casey.
She's just sitting there waiting for you.

313
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:17,593
Wait a second.
You're scared, aren't you?

314
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:20,022
Don't be an idiot.

315
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:26,955
Kemosabe, come on, man. You don't
wanna spend the rest of your life...

316
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:30,583
...hating yourself for what you didn't
have the guts to say tonight.

317
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:34,092
Okay? Believe me, I know.

318
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:35,938
Hmm.

319
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:47,294
Hey, this is a private floor.

320
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:56,695
Casey, you deliver the package.

321
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,903
<i>I've got a body to take care of.
Key's in the sugar.</i>

322
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:02,363
Deliver the package.

323
00:22:04,882 --> 00:22:06,677
<i>Casey, do you read me?</i>

324
00:22:06,845 --> 00:22:08,924
Um... Ahem.

325
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,642
Yeah, uh, copy that. On my way.

326
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:29,889
<i>Bonsoir, madam. Housekeeping.</i>

327
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:42,419
Okay, eenie, meenie, minie...

328
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:45,552
<i>:::mo:</i>

329
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:05,682
Put it in front. What am I, an idiot?

330
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,694
Let me put it...

331
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:18,131
Ooh...

332
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:29,453
Ha, ha. These stupid keys never work.

333
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:40,562
Mm.

334
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:50,032
Oh, llsa. Oh, my God.
Oh, Casey.

335
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:54,084
- Oh, I missed you.
I've missed you too.

336
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:58,012
- You haven't lost your magic touch.
Oh, Casey.

337
00:23:58,773 --> 00:23:59,805
Again.

338
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:09,128
Bartowski.

339
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:13,426
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Listen, I'm really sorry.

340
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,224
I know this is very awkward,
but llsa is a bad girl.

341
00:24:16,398 --> 00:24:19,023
She's a very bad girl.

342
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:22,493
Drop the gun, Sugar Bear.

343
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:25,579
See?

344
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,679
Mind telling me what a nice girl like you
is doing with a gun, llsa?

345
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,094
Same thing as you, Casey.

346
00:24:32,268 --> 00:24:33,931
I tried to warn you. She's a spy.

347
00:24:34,148 --> 00:24:37,152
- Who do you work for?
- Ask your friend. He's seen my files.

348
00:24:37,363 --> 00:24:40,286
Uh, yeah, I did.
She's French secret service.

349
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:43,542
But wouldn't that put us all
on the same side, kind of, doesn't it?

350
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:45,998
- You lied to me.
- Says the energy consultant.

351
00:24:46,176 --> 00:24:50,594
What about the bomb in Grozny,
that "I never forgot your face" garbage?

352
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:51,928
Oh, that bomb.

353
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,223
Llsa.

354
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:55,856
Quick. Hide.

355
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:58,612
You have to trust me.

356
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:02,996
Llsa?

357
00:25:04,427 --> 00:25:06,173
Llsa.

358
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:08,515
Baby.

359
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:10,932
Where have you been hiding, llsa?

360
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:13,776
- Right here.
I can't wait any longer.

361
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:18,243
How about we start
our honeymoon now?

362
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,462
- Oh, Victor. Oh, Victor.
Oh, llsa.

363
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:25,260
Don't even think about it.
You don't know who's on top.

364
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:34,704
You guys get out of here
before he wakes up.

365
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:40,673
All right here. Here you go.

366
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:42,806
Michael, in or out?

367
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,268
Hey, thanks for letting me,
uh, join your game, boys.

368
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,472
Perfect distraction.

369
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,563
Captain here had a fight
with his lady friend.

370
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,024
Oh, the doghouse.

371
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,706
- Been there many a time, my friend.
- No, you haven't.

372
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:58,715
Guys, Ellie and I are just going through
a little rough patch, trying to figure...

373
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:01,471
Let me share one thing that I know
from personal experience...

374
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:02,808
No, you don't.

375
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,901
You do not need some broad
holding your maracas in a vise.

376
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:12,498
Yeah, mancake like you, you should
install a turnstile on your bedroom door.

377
00:26:14,132 --> 00:26:17,837
- So in or out, buddy?
- I don't know.

378
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:21,059
All right. I have absolutely nada.

379
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,186
- Pair of threes.
- There's my straight.

380
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:25,445
- Trip nines, gentlemen.
Oh, wow.

381
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:27,778
Big man.
- Daddy takes her home.

382
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:29,827
All right.
Finishes us off.

383
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:32,080
Rules is rules, as they say in, ahh...

384
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,093
This is what's great about boys' night.

385
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:35,925
Hey, mancake, what do you think?

386
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,308
Wanna do this again tomorrow,
single guy?

387
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,057
- I got a surgery I gotta do.
Dude.

388
00:26:41,236 --> 00:26:43,315
- We wanna take your pants off.
I'll be back.

389
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:45,909
- Devon, come back!
We're all buds here.

390
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:48,576
Oh, we gotta get that guy's pants off.

391
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:52,461
<i>And then?</i>

392
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:54,967
<i>It wasn't long after we were married...</i>

393
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:57,019
<i>...that Victor went back
to Czechoslovakia.</i>

394
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,029
- Hey, Casey, we need to talk.
- Is it related to last night?

395
00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:03,155
- Uh, well, yeah.
- Then I don't wanna talk about it.

396
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,999
- Listen, Casey...
- No, you listen.

397
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,380
Whatever you thought existed
between me and llsa, you were wrong.

398
00:27:08,592 --> 00:27:10,837
That person's gone back
to being dead to me.

399
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:12,517
- You have something to say?
- Yeah.

400
00:27:12,684 --> 00:27:15,226
Just that there's a dead lady
waiting to see you.

401
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:31,477
How did you find me, llsa?

402
00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:34,608
Your friend left this under the bed.

403
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,192
He's not much of a spy.

404
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:41,209
So, what do you want?

405
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:43,419
I didn't wanna leave things
the way we left them.

406
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:45,878
With you getting plowed
by a drunk Russian crime boss?

407
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:48,134
You should get used to that.

408
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:50,973
We've been investigating
Victor Federov...

409
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,525
...since the Paris commuter train
bombings back in '02.

410
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,234
My agency's tried everything
to take him to trial...

411
00:27:56,412 --> 00:27:58,039
...but his organization is airtight.

412
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,079
Totally legit from the outside.

413
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:03,592
- The only way we could take him down...
- By screwing it out of him?

414
00:28:03,763 --> 00:28:05,842
How, uh, French.

415
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,555
- Lf you are French.
- Casey, please.

416
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:11,483
I make one call and you, Victor
and half the Grand Seville...

417
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:15,244
...are packed on a plane, shipped off
to the detention center of my choice.

418
00:28:15,457 --> 00:28:17,749
- You're not gonna do that.
- Really?

419
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:21,041
- Why is that?
- That would be unprofessional.

420
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:22,550
And that's not you.

421
00:28:25,731 --> 00:28:27,442
I wish things could be different.

422
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,277
I'm sorry, Casey.

423
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:36,418
<i>Before you and I were to leave Paris...</i>

424
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,346
<i>...a friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.</i>

425
00:28:39,806 --> 00:28:41,551
Goodbye.

426
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,405
Ahh, a lot of Scotch and a little Neil.

427
00:29:05,616 --> 00:29:06,898
Everything okay, buddy?

428
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,448
Just enjoying myself a little R and R.
Heh, heh.

429
00:29:09,626 --> 00:29:10,658
Mm-hm.

430
00:29:10,837 --> 00:29:12,166
- Wanna drink?
- No, no.

431
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:14,258
Thanks, though. I really appreciate it.

432
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:17,101
No, just, uh, thought
I'd check in on you, you know...

433
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:19,478
...what with llsa getting married
in an hour and...

434
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,102
Thanks for reminding me.

435
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:26,362
Here's to John Casey
dodging another bullet.

436
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:30,371
It's not like I want the wife
and kids...

437
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,766
...and the Little League practice
and the minivan and the Costco runs.

438
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:37,183
Yeah. Really? You don't?

439
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:40,778
It seems to me that you'd kind of
be into the whole American dream.

440
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:43,112
No.

441
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,206
I do what I do so all those
other slobs out there can have it.

442
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:51,052
What, ahh, would you say
your dream is?

443
00:29:53,102 --> 00:29:55,145
You're looking at it.

444
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,167
- Sarah.
- Hi.

445
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:09,387
- Hi. I am so glad you're here.
- Uh, yeah, me too.

446
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:11,844
I'm having a little wine.
You want some?

447
00:30:12,064 --> 00:30:16,398
- I'm actually fine, but you go ahead.
- Okay.

448
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:18,700
- Um, is Chuck here?
- Uh-uh.

449
00:30:18,913 --> 00:30:22,618
No, it's, um, just me tonight.

450
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:25,421
Um, home, all by myself. Ha.

451
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,180
Oh, um...

452
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:32,607
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

453
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:35,112
- Okay.
- Okay.

454
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,131
Ellie, are you sure you're okay?

455
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:46,926
It's just that I have both feet in
and Devon only has one foot in...

456
00:30:47,103 --> 00:30:49,777
...so then it's just me
taking care of three feet.

457
00:30:50,236 --> 00:30:52,646
And I want it to be us,
taking care of four feet.

458
00:30:52,825 --> 00:30:55,117
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Completely.

459
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,415
Of course you do. Of course you do.

460
00:30:57,627 --> 00:31:00,384
- I'm gonna get us some more wine.
- Okay.

461
00:31:02,474 --> 00:31:05,976
Besides, Chuck, it's not like llsa
left me empty-handed.

462
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:07,470
What's that?

463
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:11,696
Just a cheap little trinket
I used to think meant something.

464
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,576
You mind telling me what that is?

465
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,327
It's an RX 77
Long-Range Audio Transmitter.

466
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,170
Someone was listening in on llsa?

467
00:31:34,381 --> 00:31:35,544
With a Russian-made bug.

468
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:37,801
That means they heard last night.

469
00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:41,427
That means Victor knows she's a spy.

470
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,687
Whoa, uh, hey, Casey. Casey, Casey.

471
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,815
Casey, hey, where you going?
Where you going?

472
00:31:46,032 --> 00:31:48,444
- To stop a wedding.
- No, you're not. No, you're not.

473
00:31:48,622 --> 00:31:51,295
Scotch and driving,
very, very bad combo.

474
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:54,586
And as far as I know, also illegal.

475
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:56,591
You're absolutely right.

476
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:58,927
You're driving.

477
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:01,228
I need pants.

478
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,707
Whoa. Hi, hey, hey.

479
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:10,500
<i>- What's going on, Chuck?
Victor planted a bug on Ilsa.</i>

480
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:12,835
He knows she's a spy.
She's walking into a trap.

481
00:32:13,012 --> 00:32:15,341
- This way.
- Okay, ahh, I'll see you soon.

482
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:18,393
Ellie, I hate to do this to you, but...

483
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:22,197
No, no. We're gonna talk about Chuck
and when you see that going and...

484
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:26,745
You know, we're gonna talk about this
as soon as I get back.

485
00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:29,371
- Devon?
- Oh, I was looking for, uh...

486
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,759
Oh, what's going on here, ladies?
Having ourselves a little cocktail?

487
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:35,060
Sarah, please.
Please don't leave tonight.

488
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,690
I just really can't be alone right now.
Please.

489
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:42,115
Morgan, Ellie's feeling a little upset,
so if you could just...

490
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,243
- Absolutely. Got it. I'm your man.
- Okay.

491
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:46,581
Ellie, I'll talk to you soon.

492
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:50,217
Hey, hey. Easy, easy, Ell.

493
00:32:50,392 --> 00:32:54,608
Old Morgan's here now and I'm not
gonna leave your side, I promise.

494
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:58,618
You've always been
really sweet to me.

495
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:00,746
Aw, come on.

496
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:07,087
I thought we issued
a no-touch policy back in '98.

497
00:33:07,264 --> 00:33:08,844
Hmm, remember that?

498
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:11,685
Buddy?

499
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,155
All right, this is not how I imagined it
over and over...

500
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,785
...but let's get you to bed, huh?

501
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,075
Come on.

502
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:20,879
Come on, there.

503
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:22,293
Come on, old girl.

504
00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:24,962
Casey, Casey...
- Shh, shh, shh!

505
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,052
You shut up.
- Shh, shh!

506
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,449
- Where did you get that?
- Shh!

507
00:33:39,758 --> 00:33:41,254
Llsa? Llsa?

508
00:33:44,268 --> 00:33:47,024
I assume you are
with the bride's party.

509
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:57,042
You make for handsome groom.

510
00:33:57,214 --> 00:33:58,796
It's a shame to ruin the suit.

511
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,546
Ruin it how exactly?
With bullet holes or blood or...?

512
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:03,851
Shut up, Chuck.
- Shutting up.

513
00:34:04,021 --> 00:34:05,733
- Where's llsa?
- Way to the ceremony.

514
00:34:05,902 --> 00:34:08,146
Quite a woman, huh?
I'm gonna miss her.

515
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:10,615
Oh, well. At least we get to have
our wedding night.

516
00:34:10,788 --> 00:34:11,870
Leave her out of this.

517
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,537
I have another proposal.

518
00:34:13,754 --> 00:34:17,971
I was so moved by listening
to you and llsa say goodbye...

519
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,470
...what if I told you,
you get to keep the girl?

520
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:23,814
Casey, you wanna tell me
what's going on?

521
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,198
In fact, how would you and llsa
like to go on my honeymoon?

522
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,572
I love that idea.
I don't even have to go.

523
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:31,660
You mean let me die in your place.

524
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:35,418
What did you have in mind, Victor?
A plane crash over the Pacific?

525
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:38,934
A fiery wreck that leaves nothing behind
but our two charred corpses?

526
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:43,898
Three corpses.
Your friend will play the role of a pilot.

527
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:47,613
Or maybe
one of those men stewardesses.

528
00:34:47,832 --> 00:34:51,788
If you excuse me, my associates
have come to see me married.

529
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:54,135
I would hate to disappoint them.

530
00:34:55,016 --> 00:34:57,558
You guys.

531
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:14,804
Casey, I don't wanna die
as a man stewardess.

532
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:16,267
Relax.

533
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:20,778
I think I see a scenario where we both
get out of here with acceptable losses.

534
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,792
What exactly is your version
of acceptable?

535
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:27,334
Breaks and punctures, possible loss
of a limb. No major organ damage.

536
00:35:48,016 --> 00:35:51,852
Hey, comrades.
Mind if I ask you two fellas a question?

537
00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:01,039
<i>Where'd you learn to tie people up,
a Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoon?</i>

538
00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:03,504
I don't think
that you're helping right now.

539
00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:04,967
Hello?

540
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:09,229
No wonder you lost the Cold War.

541
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,936
A couple of girl scouts could
tie people up better than this.

542
00:36:12,156 --> 00:36:13,319
Casey, what are you...?

543
00:36:18,087 --> 00:36:20,081
Like you said,
I'm sticking to my strengths.

544
00:36:20,298 --> 00:36:22,675
How many times
do we have to go through this?

545
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:26,348
Where's Chuck Bartowski?

546
00:36:30,072 --> 00:36:32,233
That had to hurt.

547
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,372
Baddie at 6 o'clock!

548
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:39,133
Whoa!

549
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:40,970
How do you like me now, sucker?

550
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,528
Okay. Casey, Casey, Casey!

551
00:36:52,332 --> 00:36:54,494
High, very... It's so very high.

552
00:36:58,263 --> 00:36:59,344
Get him. Get him.

553
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,513
Casey! Back! Back!

554
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:04,556
I can't hold it much...

555
00:37:04,777 --> 00:37:06,904
Very weak sides! Casey?

556
00:37:08,413 --> 00:37:10,620
Last chance.
Where's Chuck Bartowski?

557
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:55,101
Hope I'm not too late
to object to this union.

558
00:37:56,984 --> 00:38:00,772
Take these two to my plane
and strangle them.

559
00:38:00,993 --> 00:38:03,035
We're not going anywhere.

560
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:05,161
Really? Who's gonna stop me?

561
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:08,086
One little girl with, ahh, one little gun?

562
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,357
Casey, this is unacceptable.

563
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:17,687
Shut up, Chuck.

564
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,704
Try two little girls.

565
00:38:24,924 --> 00:38:26,918
She looks good with a gun.

566
00:38:44,762 --> 00:38:47,767
- Morgan. Morgan.
- Damn, Ma, I got my headgear on.

567
00:38:47,978 --> 00:38:49,772
Wake up! Wake up.

568
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:51,433
Oh, thank God.

569
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,109
Oh, thank God.

570
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:55,657
Oh, God. What are you doing in here?

571
00:38:55,831 --> 00:38:58,454
What are you talking about?
You begged me not to leave.

572
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:04,391
Okay, There's, um...

573
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:06,519
Oh, there's aspirin
on your side of the...

574
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:09,105
That side of the bed.
If you could get me six, please?

575
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:12,403
Yeah, anything you, uh, want.
Anything you need.

576
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,626
Here.

577
00:39:16,795 --> 00:39:18,422
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

578
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:20,675
For last night.

579
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:23,632
- You know nothing happened.
- Mostly thanks for that.

580
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:27,475
Look, Ellie, I would pretty much do
anything for you.

581
00:39:27,654 --> 00:39:29,732
You're kind of like a sister to me.

582
00:39:33,752 --> 00:39:36,459
- A sister I wanna have sex with so bad.
Oh, God, Morgan.

583
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,551
Whoa! Hey, big guy. What's up?

584
00:39:38,763 --> 00:39:41,554
Man, nothing happening over here.
Just kind of... Not the face!

585
00:39:42,271 --> 00:39:45,610
Honey? Come here.
I wanna show you something.

586
00:39:49,706 --> 00:39:51,083
Happy anniversary, baby.

587
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,838
Devon. I'm sorry I got so mad at you.

588
00:39:55,051 --> 00:39:57,462
No, you were right. I was being selfish.

589
00:39:57,682 --> 00:40:00,854
I got a glimpse of what my life
would be like without you.

590
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,150
Not a pretty picture.

591
00:40:05,785 --> 00:40:09,123
Uh, dude? I feel like I owe you
an explanation...

592
00:40:09,294 --> 00:40:12,464
...and I want you to know that nothing
happened between me and your lady.

593
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:15,801
- I know, man.
- What do you mean, you know, man?

594
00:40:15,975 --> 00:40:19,064
You don't think there exists a scenario
where Ellie, devastated...

595
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:21,610
...comes into my arms
for the console-loving prize?

596
00:40:21,782 --> 00:40:24,322
- Think about it.
- No.

597
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:30,003
It was good working with you.
You too.

598
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:34,049
You're pretty skilled.
Got some skills yourself there.

599
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:51,180
- What does he think he's doing?
Guess he's trying to spy on us.

600
00:40:51,392 --> 00:40:53,601
- He's got a lot to learn.
Mm-hm.

601
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:58,864
Well, I gotta go. Victor's waiting
at the airport in a holding cell.

602
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:03,162
His extradition papers just came in.

603
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,087
Well, you lovebirds have a safe flight.

604
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:08,637
Sorry I had to blow your cover.

605
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:10,007
I'm gonna miss llsa.

606
00:41:10,227 --> 00:41:13,482
- I'm sure I'll find a new one.
- Hope to meet her someday.

607
00:41:14,821 --> 00:41:16,401
Well...

608
00:41:17,577 --> 00:41:20,702
You better get going
or you're gonna miss your flight.

609
00:41:29,647 --> 00:41:30,814
Goodbye, llsa.

610
00:41:32,614 --> 00:41:34,574
Goodbye, Casey.

611
00:41:36,665 --> 00:41:38,208
Hey.

612
00:41:38,878 --> 00:41:40,505
Just so you know...

613
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:42,677
...I'm happy you're not dead.

614
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:56,574
What's up, killer?

615
00:41:57,296 --> 00:42:00,052
You got yourself
a new special lady friend or what?

616
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:02,885
She's hopping a plane.

617
00:42:03,102 --> 00:42:04,597
What? You serious?

618
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,480
You guys gonna stay in touch?

619
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:09,573
She's going back undercover.

620
00:42:09,783 --> 00:42:11,114
Wow, that really sucks.

621
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:12,993
A spy's life, Chuck.

622
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,546
Well, don't you worry, buddy.

623
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:18,878
You'll always have me.
I'm not going anywhere.

624
00:42:20,432 --> 00:42:21,895
Uh-huh.

625
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:26,737
Well, Casey...

626
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:30,362
...I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

627
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:36,975
Or not.
