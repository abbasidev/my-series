See, I told you
there was weird shit going on

00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,850
over at the airbase!

3
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,686
They made
a giant fucking mutant baby!

4
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,608
Come on, Susie!

5
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,033
Guys, come on!

6
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,757
Go! Go! Go!

7
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,552

8
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,930
-Lilly!
-Give me your hand.

Chief's pretty sure.

40
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,078
The projectionist
in the movie theater...

41
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,248
with the candlestick.

42
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,879
Little Philly Malkin
went to school with my boy.

43
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,173
Show some respect.

44
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,134
Sorry.

45
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,890
And what do you think
he did to 'em?

46
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,226
A lot of blood, no bodies?

47
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,103
How the hell should I know?

48
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,399
Maybe he ate 'em.

49
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,328
Those poor parents, though.

50
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,958
It's a goddamn tragedy
is what it is.

51
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,004
Sick bastard.

52
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,888
They're still out there.

53
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,764
Well, they gon' stay out there

54
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,099
'til they either find those kids

55
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,559
or figure out
how to pin this on me.

56
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,227
I told 'em
you were nowhere near

57
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,855
that theater
when all that ugliness happened.

58
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,315
Told 'em you were here, in bed,

59
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,734
after watching
the Andy Griffith with me.

60
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,694
Told 'em they could ask you
all about it.

61
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,281
And you think they
gon' take my momma's word for an alibi?

62
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,617
They're trying
to intimidate us is what.

63
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,453
Make you confess to something
you didn't do.

64
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,288
Well, fuck 'em!

65
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,456
Calm down, Momma.

66
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,540
You know
Ronnie's still sleeping.

67
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,125
And she shouldn't have
let those kids in

68
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,752
in the first damn place.

69
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,296
They were just trying to figure
out what happened to that Clements boy.

70
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,756
That's all.

71
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,757
-None of this is her fault.
-It's your fault.

72
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,720
Filling her head full
of Hollywood nonsense,

73
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,764
thinking she Nora Charles
or some such

74
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,683
till she forget
how the world really is.

75
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,727
She's safe, Momma.

76
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,312
That's all that matters.

77
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,191
You're going to send that girl
back to school next week.

78
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,651
She need that education

79
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,986
if she ever going to get
the hell out of this town.

80
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,073
Momma, kids missing,
people watching us,

81
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,952
whispering behind my back,
your back, our backs.

82
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,954
If you think I'm lettin' Ronnie
out of my sight,

83
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,163
you got another thing coming.

84
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,749
You can't protect
that girl forever.

85
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,254
Now come Monday, she gon'
march into that school

86
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,213
with her head held high.

87
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,051
Ronnie, don't play with me now.
I know you're there.

Veronica Grogan.

89
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,695
Are they really gonna try
and pin this on you

90
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,697
-and take you away?
-No. No, baby. No.

91
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,032
-I heard, you said...
-I know... I know what I said.

92
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,368
-That's just grown folks talking.
-Come on.

93
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,830
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

94
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,333
Everything will be okay.

00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,905
for two hours.

114
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,949
Two hours, yeah.

115
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,619
Well, we kept it
well below the speed limit.

116
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,120

-Hey.

-Ow.
-Oh. What's wrong?

118
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,045
I had a little mishap on base

119
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,671
and it banged me up
a little bit.

120
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,507
-Oh no. Bad?
-I'll live.

121
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,802

122
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,431
-It's more space.
-It's very nice.

00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,308
Hey, yeah,

124
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,518
-Mm-hmm.
-All right.

125
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,144

-Yeah.

126
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,270
Mm-hmm.

127
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,902
Good afternoon.

128
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,532
You sure we're...
we're good here?

129
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,036
If anybody's got
a problem with it,

130
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,746
they can take it up with JFK.

131
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,549
Oh! Oh my...

132
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,425
This thing is amazing.

133
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,887
Oh, would you look at that.

134
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,849
Yeah, I found a nice little
secondhand shop downtown.

135
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,016
-Owner cut me a deal.
-Mm-hmm.

136
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,601
It's the exact kind I wanted.

137
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,019
How did you know?

138
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,814
You think your old man
doesn't know his own kid?

139
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,525
Well, last present
you got me was a tie.

140
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,318
Will, you said
you loved that tie.

141
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,155
Yeah, well, you can't see
Jupiter with a tie.

142
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,868
You know,
when we need to, pilots,

143
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,036
we use planets
to help us navigate.

144
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,746
So we keep a device inside
of the cockpit

145
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,540
in case of a malfunction.

146
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,542
-A sextant, right?
-That's exactly right.

147
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,544
My little navigator.

148
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,839
Be better at night,
but in the meantime,

149
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,633
maybe we could use this
to spy on the neighbors.

150
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,345
I don't think we should do that.

151
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,431
Yeah, prob... probably not.

152
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,601
It was just a joke.

153
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,730
Can I?

154
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,273
Yeah, sure, please. Yeah.

155
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,070
It's got a mirror inside.
Two mirrors, actually.

156
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,198
You know, you have one mirror
to collect the light, and...

157
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,324
And one that magnifies it.

158
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,994
That's right, son.

159
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,051
I'm not about
to sweat out my silky press.

160
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,261
We were moving in such a haste.

161
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,263
You know Charlotte's
not going to bed

162
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,973
without Charlotte's headscarf.

163
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,685
I'm going
to get organized tomorrow.

164
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,692
That was a good call on the
telescope, baby. Thank you.

165
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,030
Figured the last thing that boy
needed was another baseball

166
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,908
he was going to use
as a paperweight.

167
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,410
His age, I'd have given a kidney
for a proper mitt.

168
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,245
Well, he isn't you.

169
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,164
Now is he?

170
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,250
He's too smart for his own good.
That's what he is.

171
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,585
He's just trying to impress you.

172
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,675
That hurt?

173
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,595
What's the exact opposite
of hurt?

174
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,768

About what?

You guys can just stop asking,

Fine.

196

I think Scotty Mills is turning

Well, that was before you
told us it was Scott the Snot.

199
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,099
He hasn't had that problem
since we were kids.

200
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,395
Are you talking about me?

201
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,272
Sorry, I can't breathe
very well.

202
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,733
Oh my God,
that's what he sounds like.

203
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,234
Does something smell?

00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,070
-I can't smell anything.
-Marge, you're not funny.

205
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,988
Does anybody have a tissue?

206
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,489
Enough, Marge.

207
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,950
Yeah, don't be mean.

208
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,417
Look who's back.

209
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,129
Where does she get the nerve?

210
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,008
I can't sleep knowing that
her dad could just crawl through

211
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,426
my bedroom window at night.

212
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,511
Do you think she knows
where the bodies are?

213
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,972
I was worried about you.

214
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,849
I can't stop thinking
about them.

215
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,267
And about that thing.

216
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,439
Good morning, students.

217
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,817
This is
Principal Dunleavy speaking.

218
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,569
It's 9:00 a.m.
on another sunny spring day.

219
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,989
<i>Now I would like
to thank everyone</i>

220
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,992
<i>who attended last week's
candlelight vigil</i>

221
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,746
<i>for Theodore Uris
and Philip and Susie Malkin.</i>

222
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:14,919
<i>It was an uplifting
evening of prayer and remembrance.</i>

223
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,380
<i>And a strong reminder
that as a community,</i>

224
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,089
<i>we can weather any storm.</i>

225
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,136
<i>Oh, and the cafeteria
will not be serving</i>

226
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,471

00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,235
Hey.

230
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,487
Hi, Marge.

231
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,699
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

232
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,868
We haven't really talked
since, you know,

233
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,120
the thing that happened
at the theater.

234
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,205
Yeah, I'm fine.

235
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,456
Thanks.

236
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,583
Good.

237
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,717
I... It just... It feels like
you've been ignoring me.

238
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,136
No, it's just been hard.

239
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,681
I'm sure. I know. I bet.

240
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,601
Take your seats quickly, please.

241
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,943
Look, I saw you,

242
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,571
before,
talking to Ronnie Grogan.

243
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,822
So?

244
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,660
So, Patty and the girls
really care about you,

245
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,162
but they don't know you
like I do.

246
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,332
They see you getting cozy
with you-know-who's daughter,

247
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,041
they won't understand.

248
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,544
I just...

249
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,755
I know you want things
back to the way they were,

250
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,049
with us, with the Pattycakes,
and I can help.

251
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,385
I want to,
but you have to let me.

252
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,055
How about eating lunch
with us today?

253
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,266
Phil and Teddy are dead.
Phil's sister is dead.

254
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,477
Who cares
about your stupid Pattycakes?

255
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,402
Today, we will be discussing
the four basic food groups

256
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,321
and how to best employ them

257
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,991
to ensure your growing bodies
attain maximum vigor.

258
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,829
Is this Miss Douglas's class?

259
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,750
Sorry,
I couldn't find the room. I...

260
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,169
I'm Will Hanlon. I'm new.

261
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,213
Are you new to the concept
of time, Mr. Hanlon?

262
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,050
You mean, like, relativity?

263
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,887
There's no excuse for tardiness.

264
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,348
Next time your grade
will reflect it. Take a seat.

265
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,367
Quiet! Quiet, everyone.

266
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,083
Cedar Point.

267
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,669
Good pencil.

268
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,841
-Thanks.
-Eyes forward!

269
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,929
Can I help you, sir?

270
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,806
Yes, Major Hanlon,
Sergeant Vice, ma'am.

271
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,516
Uh, Colonel Fuller
wanted to see me.

272
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,070
Major, come on in.

273
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,907
We searched his quarters,

274
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,159
found the weapon used
in your barracks.

275
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,994
He finally admitted to it
under questioning.

276
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,161
Masters?

277
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,706
He's no Soviet spy, of course.

278
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,584
Just an asshole
wanting to put a scare

279
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,961
into a colored airman.
But this isn't the South,

280
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,380
and we don't brook
that kind of shit here.

281
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,674
We're still trying to figure out
the identities of the other two,

282
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,177
but Masters is a coward.

283
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,596
He'll break, and when he does,

284
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,141
I can promise you,
justice will be served.

285
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,184
Thank you.

286
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,978
Thank you, sir.

287
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,530
Sir, that weapon
that you recovered,

288
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,868
it was dark in there,
but it looked like a Makarov PM.

289
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,787
Is that right?

290
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,789
You have a good eye.

291
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,918
It was a Makarov,
old Soviet piece of shit.

292
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,714
-Why?
-Nothing, just, uh...

293
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,383
...one day,
when I'm telling my grandkids

294
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,092
that I stared
into the face of death,

295
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,136
I want to have all the details.

296
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,502
-Good morning.
-Morning.

297
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,960
Suck an egg, Paul Bunyan!

298
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,557
Personally, I don't mind it.

299
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,142
I mean, it's Paul Bunyan
for Pete's sake.

300
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,643
He's an American hero.

301
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,886
I'll be right with you, miss.

302
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,772
He's an eyesore.

303
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,273
And I won't stand for it,

304
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,151
and neither will any of
the other Grand Dames of Derry.

305

♪ -That statue has got to go.

306
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,032

-Hmm?

314

Okay.

315

So you passing through?

316
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,933
Oh, I actually just moved in.

317
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:48,062
I suppose I do really
stick out around here.

318
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,939
Oh gosh,
I didn't mean it that way.

319
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,857
It's just...
been here a lot of years.

320
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,442
You see the same faces,
day in, day out.

321
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,069
It's nice to have
a little bit of variety.

Stan Kersh.

323
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,741
Kids call me Stanley Cleaver.

324
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,201
Cute.

325
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,288
-Well, I'm Charlotte. Hanlon.
-Well...

326
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,292
-Welcome to Derry, Mrs. Hanlon.
-Thank you.

327
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,044
He's getting away. Get him!

328
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,391
-Why is no one stopping this?
-Boys will be boys.

329
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,684
What are you gonna do?

330
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,647
Hey! Hey!

331
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,066
Hey! Uh-uh!

332
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,028
You leave that boy alone,
you hear me?

333
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,208
-He's getting away, get him.
-Leave him alone!

334
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,266
Don't tell me boys will
be boys. How about boys will be kind?

335
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,767
-Mm.
-Boys will stand up.

336
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,603
Boys will be tall

337
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,897
in their integrity
and their hearts.

338
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,607
Mm.

339
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,984
Boys will be measured
by their mommas

340
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,652
in their new house.

341
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,237
Come on.

342
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,076
It was pathetic, Leroy.

343
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,996
Nobody seemed bothered
by it in the slightest.

344
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,080
And then when I shouted,

345
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,790
they looked at me
like I was the crazy one.

346
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,792
Dogs. That's what
they looked like,

347
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,754
a bunch of starving dogs
getting ready to tear

348
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,547
at a piece of fresh meat.

349
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,508
What were they doing
outside of school

350
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,801
in the first place?

351
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,471
I got about
a half a mind to track

352
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,973
those kids' parents down
and give them the what for.

353
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,224
Please don't.

354
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,687
Did anything like that happen
for you today at school?

355
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,896
Any bullies?

356
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,650
No. Mom...

357
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,860
This isn't
about embarrassing you.

358
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,987
This is about
what's right and wrong.

359
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,072
And isn't it wrong

360
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,949
to embarrass your only son
the first week of school?

361
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,825
Don't get cute with me.
You didn't see those kids.

362
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,160
Yeah, the boy's right, Char.

363
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,995
You should just...
you should leave it alone.

364
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,413
Is that an order, Major?

365
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,249
Well, after Shreveport,
I think the last thing

366
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,500
that you need
to get is involved...

367
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,751
Can you guys stop fighting?

368
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,419
We're not fighting.

369
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,713
We're talking.

370
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,090
That's just how we talk.

371
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,264
Can I be excused?

372
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,186
We didn't get to hear
how your first day went.

373
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,690
It was fine, Mom. Okay?
Can I go now?

374
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,445
It's all right. Go on, son.

375
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,781
Go.

376
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,041
Excuse me?

377
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,712
We're all off living
separate lives most of the day.

378
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,298
And all I ask is for a little
family time at night.

379
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,634
And please don't
bring up Shreveport

380
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,177
like we didn't
move here for you.

381
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,887
So that brick
through our car window,

382
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,639
-was that for me too, Char?
-So it's my fault now?

383
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,224
I'm not the one
that's causing trouble.

384
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,059
I'm not the one
that's making signs.

385
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,978
I'm not the one that's sitting
in places where I'm not wanted.

386

What is with you tonight?

387
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,817
Why are you coming
at me like this?

388
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,156
Um, I'm sorry, baby.

389
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,200
I... I had a day is all.

390
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,160
Okay, you want to talk about it?

391
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,833
-You know I can't.
-Yeah, I know.

You think they got
police outside their houses?

We can fix that real quick.

We're close.

528
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,132
We're close. I can feel it.

-Tastes like rats' balls.
-No way, it's worse than that.

532
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,945
Tastes like
Principal Dunleavy's butt.

533
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,626
We need to talk.

534
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,878
Hey, what's wrong?

535
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,922
That thing. It came back.

I thought you said
she wasn't crazy anymore.

I don't know. She seemed better.

another murder.

You... you think I had something

00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,837
Here's what we're gonna do.

701
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,174
We're gonna send you back
to Juniper Hill.

702
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,342
What?

703
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,677
Check you in
for an evaluation.

704
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,720
Just a couple of days,
then everybody else can see

705
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,263
they're barking up
the wrong tree.

706
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,848
No, no, please.

707
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,017
I... I... I... I can't.

708
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,685
I... I... I don't...

709
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,523
-Please don't send me back.
-I don't want to, Lilly.

710
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,774
I don't, but I...

711
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,780
Tell you what.

712
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,490
How about I ask you
one more time?

713
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,200
I'll even rephrase the question

714
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,661
if that'll make it easier
for you, all right?

715
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:32,540
I'm not gonna ask you
if you saw Hank Grogan

716
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,291
there at the theater that night.

717
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,419
What I'm gonna ask you is...

718
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,464
...can you be absolutely,

719
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:44,593
positively certain
that he wasn't there?

720
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,349
<i>This ain't right.</i>

721
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,476
He didn't do nothing
to those kids!

722
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,645
Mrs. Grogan, we have good reason
to bring him in.

723
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,397
-We need to ask him some questions.
-Come on.

724
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,481
Don't interfere.

725
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,817
-Daddy! Daddy! No! No!
-It's going to be okay, baby.

726
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,861
-No! Daddy!
-It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.

727
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,696
-No! No!
-It's going to be okay. I'll be back.

728
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,281
I'll be back, okay?
I'll be back.

729
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,490
-Don't worry about it.
-Daddy!

730
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,992
-It's going to be okay.
-Come on.

731
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,119
-Momma, watch my baby!
-No!

732
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,247
-I'll be ba...
-No!

733
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,083
Daddy!

734
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,751
No!

735
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,214
Go home!

736
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,758
Ought to be ashamed.

737
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,759
Feeding on other people's pain.

738
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,512
Go home!

739
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,267
Ronnie, baby, come back.

740
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,070
What do you think you're doing?
Do you know what time it is?

741
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,446
Where is she?

742
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,075
What did you tell them?

743
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,952
What did you say?

744
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,954
I didn't. He tricked me.

745
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,040
And I didn't know what to do.

746
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,125
-What is this about?
-This is about my daddy!

747
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,710
They took my daddy away!

748
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,212
Enough! Go home
before I call your grandmother!

749
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,050
No!

750
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,139
What'd you say?

751
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,350
You know he didn't do it!
You know it!

752
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,812
What did you do,
Lilly Bainbridge?

753
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,467
You have a visitor.

754
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,851
Staff Sergeant.

755
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,436
How did you get in here? Hmm?

756
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,188
What, all you fellas
sticking together now,

757
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,481
is that it?

758
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,235
You come to get
your pound of flesh?

759
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:11,448
Well, come on in, Poitier.
Water's fine.

760
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:19,206
What? You come all this way
to chicken out?

761
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,501
-Hey, what the hell?
-Relax.

762
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,419
The magazine's empty.

763
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,718
This one's not.

764
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,263
-Guard!
-I'm not gonna shoot you.

765
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,980
Now, that is a Makarov PM.

766
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,732
It's the same model that you put
in my face the other night.

767
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,527
This one's mine.

768
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,280
A souvenir from my time
in a North Korean POW camp.

769
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,614
I'm crying.

770
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,742
Now, the PM,

771
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,368
she's standard issue
east of the Berlin Wall,

772
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,870
but not too common around here.

773
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,371
It's a difficult piece
to handle.

774
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,165
It's even harder to load.

775
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,791
Takes two hands
and a couple tries

776
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,251
on a good day.

777
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,503
-So?
-So...

778
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,424
you cocked that gun...
in less than a second.

779
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,301
And I've seen
trained Korean officers

780
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,593
take longer than that.

781
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,848
Masters, I don't know
what you're doing here,

782
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,267
but you sure as hell weren't
in my room the other night.

783
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,440
So you think that I don't
want your Black ass

784
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,525
-out of here?
-Oh, I believe that.

785
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,946
But I pulled your file,
and near as I can tell,

786
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,198
you can barely
strip down an M16,

787
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,783
much less handle a Soviet pistol
like you're married to it.

788
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,412
There's a lot of interesting
things in that file.

789
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,748
Article 15s up the wazoo
for everything

790
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,959
from drunk on duty
to punching out NCOs.

791
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,714
Your momma must be real proud.

792
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,632
You leave my momma outta this.

793
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,551
Sure.

794
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,471
Just as long
as I don't have to leave this...

795
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,723
...out your momma.

796
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,072
That's what I thought.

797
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,544
General, do you have a moment
for Major Hanlon?

798
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,712
Send him in.

799
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,093
-General.
-Major, have a seat.

800
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,429
That won't be necessary, sir.
I just thought you should know

801
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,556
you have an innocent man
locked in the stockade.

802
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,974
He's a racist asshole,

803
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,351
but he's innocent.

804
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,562
-Bastard signed a confession.
-Yeah, well, he lied, sir.

805
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,067
-He told you that?
-In so many words.

806
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,862
I'm going to file
a report with OSI

807
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,613
to request
a further investigation.

808
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,781
I see.

809
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,701
-Will that be all, Major?
-Yes, sir. Thank you.

810
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,040
Major Hanlon.

811
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,420
Why don't you have
that seat now?

812
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,399
I needed to know.

813
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,570
If word of your brain injury
in South Korea were true.

814
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,156
And Major,
you did not disappoint.

815
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,576
A damaged amygdala.

816
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,099
Fifty years in the field and
I've never heard of such a thing.

817
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,793
I've spent enough time in combat

818
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,378
to know a brave man
when I see one.

819
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:57,382
But you, Major,
are the rarest of creatures.

820
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,259
A man without fear.

821
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,845
And I've been looking
for someone like you

822
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,680
for a long, long time.

823
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,100
It was a test, son.

824
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,561
And you passed.

825
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,689
I think I heard enough.

826
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,025
-Now hold on.
-Who was in the masks?

827
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,027
♪ -Does it matter?

828
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,071
Do I want to know who beat me
with a metal pipe?

829
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,447
Yes, sir, I do.

830
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,199
It wasn't supposed
to happen like that,

831
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,700
and I am sorry.

832
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,703
But I promised anonymity,
and I don't burn my people.

833
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,413
And Masters?

834
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,458
He wasn't there.

835
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,294
I understand.
You're obligated to report me.

836
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:35,838
But before you do,

837
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,173

ten minutes to hear me out.

00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,013
<i>There's a special on marbles
on aisle eight!</i>

874
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,724
♪ <i>- You can't leave here.</i>

875
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,727
<i>-You're a danger!</i>
<i>-You're stuck here!</i>

876
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,271
<i>She's insane.</i>

877
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,107
<i>She's crazy.</i>

878
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,735
<i>-Did you know that?</i>
<i>-I know you do.</i>

879
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,654
<i>You wanna see your daddy?</i>

880
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,907
<i>Crazy.</i>

881
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,923
<i>Na, na, na, na, na.</i>

882
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,555
Daddy?

883
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,852
There's my little girl.

884
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,568
Got a kiss for daddy?

885
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,937
No!

886
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,533
No!

887
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,118
No! No! No!

888
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,247
Hello, crazy!

889
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:09,379
Just one kiss for Papa!

890
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:13,216
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

891
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,638
Lilly Bainbridge!

892
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,726
What the hell's wrong with you?

893
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,247
-Open the gate.
-Yes, sir.

894
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,639
What is all this?

895
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,851
Bear with me, Major.

896
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,562
Earlier this year,
the Cubans and the Soviets

897
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,314
held an agricultural summit
in Havana.

898
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,024
I remember hearing
about it in the news.

899
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,776
Well, what you didn't hear
about was the true purpose

900
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,402
of that meeting.

901
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,613
It was to devise a plan
to place nuclear warheads

902
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,496
within striking distance
of the United States.

903
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,867
With launch capabilities
in Cuba,

904
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,619
the Soviets could hit
every major city

905
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,329
in the United States
within minutes.

906
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,165
What you're about to see

907
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,917
may be our best
and only hope to prevent that.

908
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,144
Gentlemen. Dismissed.

909
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,400
Welcome to Operation Precept.

910
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:57,070
A classified DOD crash program
with a single purpose.

911
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,198
To win the Cold War before
the first missile is ever fired.

912
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,368
You're building a weapon?

913
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,496
Close. We're looking for one.

914
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:11,125
Something that was buried
in Derry a long time ago.

915
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,337
Something that you, Major,

916
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,547
are uniquely qualified
to help us retrieve.

917
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:18,841
How's that?

918
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:25,556
This weapon,
it generates debilitating fear.

919
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,810
In anyone who comes near it.

920
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:30,687
In theory, it could scare a man
badly enough

921
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,563
-to kill him where he stands.
-Hmm.

922
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,357
But what is it?

923
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,359
Some kind of machine?

924
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,153
We don't know
everything about it.

925
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,697
Where it came from,
how it works.

926
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,326
What we do know is
that it's surrounded

927
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,452
on all sides
by a group of objects.

928
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,496
Think of them as beacons.

929
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,540
If we can find them,

930
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,626
they'll help us pinpoint
the exact location

931
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,836
of the weapon itself.
And at that moment...

932
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,297
we need you there, Major,
to help us secure it.

933
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:06,556
-Yes, Colonel, what is it?
-Apologies for the interruption.

934
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,725
We just received word
from the dig site.

935
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,185
Reports are still coming in,
but it appears

936
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,062
they found something.

937
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:20,653
-Join us, Major?
-Yes, sir.

938
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,175
Mom, please.

939
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,180
Don't make me go.

940
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,340
I told you.

01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,778
