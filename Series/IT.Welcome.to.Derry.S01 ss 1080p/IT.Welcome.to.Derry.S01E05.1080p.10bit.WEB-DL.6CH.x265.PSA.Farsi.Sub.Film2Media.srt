1
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,845
Shit.

2
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,805
Wait. Get help!

3
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,265
Get help!

4
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,309
- Get help!
- Guards!

5
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,477
Guards!

6
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,646
Get him to the infirmary, now!

7
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,776
- I'm fine.
- I got you.

8
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,654
- I'm... I'm fine.
- Just breathe.

9
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,031
I'm fine. I'm fine.

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,619
Well?

11
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,707
We got it.

12
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,672
Excuse me, sir.
What the hell just happened?

13
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,882
All right.

14
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,633
All right, Major.

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,928
Looks like it's time
to give you some answers.

16
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,820
It's okay.

17
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,827
Your parents will be back soon.

18
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:22,415
I'll be right outside in case
there are any more... problems.

19
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,636
I shouldn't be here.
Everyone thinks I did this.

20
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,847
It's okay. I told them you didn't.

21
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,767
What'd you say?

22
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,895
That my glasses broke and they cut my eye

23
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,606
and you were only trying to help me
when everyone showed up.

24
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,946
They'd probably send me to Juniper Hill

25
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,156
if I told them what I really saw.

26
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,916
I'm so sorry, Lil.

27
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,419
I should have believed you.

28
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,590
You're my best friend...

29
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,593
and I let you down.

30
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,145
Why is this happening?

31
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,149
We're still trying to figure that out.

32
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,614
Is it gonna happen again?

33
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,786
I don't know.

34
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,914
But if it does...

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,626
you won't be alone.

36
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,929
I missed you.

37
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,557
I really missed you too.

38
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,811
Is Marge okay? It looked pretty bad.

39
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,731
Her eye's a little messed up,
but she'll be okay.

40
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,483
Look, if she wants to help,

41
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,819
then she can tell Bowers
what really happened.

42
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,448
Ronnie, we've tried that already.

43
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,450
Why would they believe her?

44
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,786
Besides, the police
probably think I attacked her,

45
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,872
that she's covering for me.

46
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,207
Everyone thinks that.

47
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,924
No, Lilly, that's not what I meant.

48
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,926
Listen, I mean, not us,

49
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,679
but like at school,
the post office, my barber.

50
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,864
This is a private club, announce yourself.

51
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,588
Matty?

52
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,345
Help... me.

53
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,584
The Indians call them "pillars."

54
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,255
Thirteen objects carved
from the same material

55
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,257
that that thing apparently
fell to Earth on.

56
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,343
"Fell to Earth"?

57
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,805
They were buried hundreds
of years ago deep underground

58
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,224
by the Sqoteawapskot tribe
in order to create a sort of...

59
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,684
cage around the creature's territory.

60
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,271
One that runs more or less
along the borders of modern-day Derry.

61
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,984
You're telling me that Derry's a prison

62
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,028
and we're looking for the bars?

63
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,488
Exactly right, Major.

64
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,200
That kid...

65
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,371
is a member of a secret order
dedicated to keeping that thing locked up

66
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,747
and those pillars hidden.

67
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,292
A job that he and his pals
have succeeded at for nearly 400 years.

68
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,044
Until now.

69
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,468
Hallorann flipped through that boy's mind
like it was the morning paper.

70
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,967
Now we know exactly where they are

71
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,260
and how to get to them.

72
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,138
To do what, sir?

73
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,224
To reduce the size of its cage.

74
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,892
To contain it.

75
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,604
You mean to capture it.

76
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,361
29 Neibolt Street.

77
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,030
It's an abandoned home
atop a tunnel system

78
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,991
that leads directly to the 13 pillars.

79
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,579
Tomorrow morning, you and Colonel Fuller
will lead a small team to secure them.

80
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,746
Once in hand,

81
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,832
you'll tighten the perimeter
enough to control it.

82
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,561
Imagine if we had dropped
something like this

83
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,378
on the Pusan Perimeter in '51.

84
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,631
Let it do the job we lost so many GIs to.

85
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,843
How many mothers we could have
spared from heartbreak.

86
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,804
It's time to bring this Cold War
to an end, Major.

87
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,099
What's the problem, son?

88
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,270
You knew

89
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,939
that Derry was this thing's
hunting ground,

90
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,774
and you let me move my family here.

91
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,277
The plan was for you to stay on base.

92
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,653
You chose otherwise.

93
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,340
Maybe now you move them here
until this is all done with.

94
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,782
There's no maybe about it.

95
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,747
Excuse me, sir.

96
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,551
Matty, where have you been?

97
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,518
It's okay.

98
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,645
- You don't have to...
- In the sewers...

99
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,231
below Derry.

100
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,984
That's where it lives.

101
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,239
The clown.

102
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,782
Clown?

103
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,245
It kept some of us alive...

104
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,747
like...

105
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,166
like it needed...

106
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,418
Fear.

107
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,420
Yeah.

108
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,384
How did you get away?

109
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,222
It feeds at night...

110
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,141
and sleeps in the day.

111
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,020
And I just waited...

112
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,022
and I ran.

113
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,903
What about Teddy and Phil and Susie?

114
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,989
Did you see them?

115
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,784
Teddy was dead when it dragged him in.

116
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,831
His skull was ripped open and it...

117
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,542
It... It what?

118
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,462
Ate his brains right in front of me.

119
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,465
I think I'm gonna be sick.

120
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,429
And Susie, one of her arms was gone.

121
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,473
It just left her there.

122
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,478
All night, bleeding out...

123
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,273
and crying.

124
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,696
Until she stopped.

125
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,118
But Phil...

126
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,454
he's still down there.

127
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,040
He's alive?

128
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,668
He can't talk or move, but...

129
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,881
he's alive, somehow.

130
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,300
We have to go to the police.

131
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,762
No. No police.

132
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,472
I have to get my dad out.

133
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,557
And you can tell them
that he didn't take you.

134
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,602
And Phil. Matty, we have to help him.

135
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,271
No cops.

136
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,482
- Matty, please.
- No.

137
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,777
They'd send me back, back to my dad.

138
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,156
I ran away once, I will do it again.

139
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,495
I'd sooner go back
to the sewers than there.

140
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,168
Obviously, the loss of even one life

141
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,711
is one life too many.

142
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,842
That said, the cycle has been
a lot milder than '35 and '08.

143
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,932
Twenty-five disappearances,
seven confirmed deaths,

144
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,686
mostly children, the oldest 16...

145
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,230
and the youngest 5.

146
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,816
One encouraging sign

147
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,694
is obviously we know the creature sheds.

148
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,198
Its discharge, you might call it,

149
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,909
has tainted Derry's groundwater
since the town's founding.

150
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,412
Just get on with it, John.

151
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,538
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,998
Should we not be educating
our prospective keeper?

153
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,084
Leo.

154
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,086
Go on, John.

155
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,463
Well, lately our scouts have noted

156
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,466
that the residents have been
acting more aggressively.

157
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,551
The Augury!

158
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,678
Exactly.

159
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,555
And what is that, dear?

160
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,977
One last big, bloody event
that marks the end of a cycle,

161
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,229
after which,

162
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,732
we get another 27 years
or so of peace and quiet.

163
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,068
Miss Rose.

164
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,196
You're late. Where's Taniel?

165
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,283
I couldn't stop him.

166
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,144
Sir, please let me speak to him.

167
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,689
All aboard the Shawshank Express.

168
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,112
Well, your savior
better work fast, Grogan.

169
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,741
Last fish we sent in there
didn't survive the week.

170
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,954
Maybe if you're lucky, you'll survive two.

171
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,879
Burn in hell, you son of a bitch!

172
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,591
Get off of me!

173
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,427
You're a dead man.

174
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,137
You're a dead man, Grogan, you hear me?

175
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,224
You're gonna fry
for what you did to my kids,

176
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,100
{\an8}you piece of shit!

177
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,811
{\an8}Get off of me!

178
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,188
{\an8}I didn't do it!

179
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,959
Sit down.

180
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,299
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

181
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,301
I'm just a little shaken up is all.

182
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,305
He's on his way there now.

183
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,599
I just wanted to make sure
we got the paperwork in

184
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,810
so we could...
we could get him with his family

185
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,229
as quickly as possible
until we get a defense.

186
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,815
All right, so you'll let me know. Okay.

187
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,941
All right, thanks so much.

188
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,192
All right, bye-bye.

189
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,989
Is Will here? Where's Will?

190
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,408
In his room. What's wrong?

191
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,122
I gotta tell you something.

192
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,375
Okay? And as crazy as it's going to sound,

193
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,379
I really need you to just believe me.

194
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,134
<i>The National Guard was standing by</i>

195
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,219
<i>in Leflore County, Mississippi yesterday</i>

196
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,015
<i>during a demonstration
for Negro voting rights, during which...</i>

197
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,933
General? There's somebody here to see you.

198
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,560
- Not now.
- With respect, sir,

199
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,728
I think you're gonna want...

200
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,647
Where is my nephew, Francis?

201
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,815
Rose.

202
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,775
He's safe.

203
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,280
Once our operation is complete,
he'll be released.

204
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,574
- You have my word.
- Your word?

205
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,826
"Water pipelines"?

206
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,747
I told you that my memories
of Derry came back

207
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,040
when I first got here.

208
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,542
That wasn't entirely true.

209
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,210
No shit.

210
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,630
Five years ago,

211
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,008
I was administered a drug
by the Department of Defense

212
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,803
as part of a security protocol,
and it all came rushing back.

213
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,223
Every detail of that summer we shared...

214
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,727
for the first time in 45 years.

215
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,065
What was that thing?

216
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,609
Why can't it leave the woods?

217
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,616
Can you keep a secret?

218
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,207
I remember you saved my life

219
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,001
from something that shouldn't exist.

220
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,345
<i>After I processed
everything that had happened</i>

221
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,847
and everything you told me
about your ancestors

222
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,975
and their sacred responsibility,

223
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,436
I realized I was sitting
on the answer to a question

224
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,438
that has plagued me my entire life.

225
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,233
How to keep this country safe?

226
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,449
You think you can put a leash
on this thing?

227
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,621
It can't be controlled, Francis.

228
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,500
We'll see.

229
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,216
<i>You wouldn't be doing any of this</i>

230
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,343
<i>if you really remembered everything.</i>

231
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,972
What it's like
to look it right in the eye.

232
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,185
Feel its breath on your neck.

233
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:06,358
You would pack up
this entire operation and run.

234
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,819
We know how to find the pillars.

235
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,988
Taniel told us everything.

236
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,448
He would never do that.

237
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,575
Neibolt House, Rose.

238
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,327
The tunnels below Neibolt.

239
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,295
In that case...

240
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,507
you'll need my help.

241
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,886
That's out of the question, Rose.

242
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,388
Francis.

243
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,195
At the very least, let me prepare Taniel.

244
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,449
Your lives depend on it.

245
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,682
Taniel.

246
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,684
- Aunt Rose!
- Are you okay?

247
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,770
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to get caught.

248
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,480
I know you didn't.

249
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,776
You're hurt. What did you...

250
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,701
They did something to me.

251
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,789
Went into my mind.

252
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,959
Into my head, into my memories.
I don't know how, but...

253
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,168
Hey, hey, hey.

254
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,486
English!

255
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,157
I told them...

256
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,219
that you'll have a better chance
of helping them find

257
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,452
what they're looking for...

258
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,081
with this.

259
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,837
They've inspected it.

260
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,590
They know it poses no threat.

261
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,467
And they understand
that you are the only one

262
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,719
who knows how to use it.

263
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,310
Yes, Auntie.

264
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,188
I understand.

265
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,398
I'll take that.

266
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,985
I'll take that.

267
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,322
You won't need it till the morning.

268
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,700
Time's up.

269
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,497
Let's go.

270
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,250
Do what they say.

271
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,215
Keep it close and you'll be safe, okay?

272
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,452
Identification.

273
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,959
The base is far enough outside of town.

274
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,252
You all should be safe with me

275
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,212
- till the assignment's done.
- But, Dad,

276
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,880
what about my friends? They need me.

277
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,466
You'll see your friends
when this is all over.

278
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,759
You're free to go.

279
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,928
Trust me now. I'm taking care of it.

280
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,237
Lilly?

281
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,864
You said if I ever needed to talk...

282
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,618
Come on in.

283
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,621
Okay, so you're telling me
there's a chance

284
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,415
that boy's still alive?

285
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,666
Matty thinks so.

286
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,295
But he won't go to the cops
'cause he's afraid they'll send him home.

287
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,714
Oh God, what that poor boy's been through.

288
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,185
Hi, Mr. Kersh.

289
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,896
Dear, you remember Lilly.

290
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,482
Terri Bainbridge's kid.

291
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,401
Yes, sir.

292
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,112
Where's my steak?

293
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,739
It's almost done.

294
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,643
I'll bring it to you in a minute.

295
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,909
Don't overcook it again.

296
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,339
If someone has that kid,
we have to go to the police.

297
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,300
- No, I promised Matty.
- This is grownup business.

298
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,427
It's not like
you can go down there yourself.

299
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,305
I think we can save Phil.

300
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,225
Lilly, you're not thinking straight.

301
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,978
Promise me that you won't go down there.

302
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:40,025
Friends or not,
it's not worth you dying too.

303
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,819
Promise me.

304
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,114
Promise.

305
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:56,083
Well... it's not so bad, right?

306
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,544
A little smaller than our house,

307
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,630
but it'll do for now, right?

308
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,718
Can I go for a walk?

309
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,805
Thought I'd explore the base
if I gotta be stuck here.

310
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,557
Yeah.

311
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,852
I'm sure there's a rec center, darts...

312
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,605
you know? Will...

313
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,693
You'll see your friends again,
as soon as your daddy says it's safe.

314
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,946
I love you.

315
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,990
I love you.

It's always the wind, man.

338
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,919
Always...

339
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,509
What's she doing here?

340
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,927
I just want to help.

341
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,346
I'm supposed to trust a Pattycake?

342
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,430
Ex.

343
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,724
Hey. It came for her too.

344
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,104
Look, I thought about it.
And we can't make Matty go to the police.

345
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,899
- What?
- They won't believe him.

346
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,108
And he's right.

347
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,086
They'll send him right back to his dad.

348
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,905
But if Phil's really alive

349
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,658
and can prove your dad is innocent...

350
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,036
then we have to go save him ourselves.

351
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,496
- Are you insane?
- No way.

352
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,707
I'm not going down there again.

353
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,919
You said yourself, you'd sooner go back
to the sewers than home.

354
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,381
Well, good, 'cause you're gonna
take us down there right now

355
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,717
and show us exactly where Phil is,
and we're gonna get him out of there.

356
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,556
Either that, or we drag you to the cops.

357
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,891
Right now, all of us.

358
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,644
We can't go down there. We'll get eaten.

359
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,813
Not if we have these.

- "Mommy's Little Helper"?
- Exactly.

361
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,444
What Will and Matty said
about it feeding on fear?

362
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,657
Well, if it's got nothing to feed on,
then we have nothing to worry about.

363
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,617
My mom got a refill.

364
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,703
We'll each take as many as we can.

365
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,246
Are you sure that's safe?

366
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,373
My mom eats these like M&Ms.

367
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,501
If they weren't safe,
she'd probably be dead by now.

368
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,878
I don't know.

369
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,049
Listen.

370
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,636
My dad used to say, "In life,

371
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,722
people are either anchors or lifeboats."

372
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,891
"They drag you under
or they keep you afloat."

373
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,105
I don't know where I'd be
right now without you guys.

374
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,151
But Phil? He doesn't have anyone.

375
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,237
And if we don't do something,
he won't stand a chance.

376
00:26:56,364 --> 00:27:01,453
So my question is,
are you an anchor or a lifeboat?

377
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,290
Lifeboat.

378
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,083
Lifeboat.

379
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,717
Lifeboat?

380
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,023
What? What'd I miss?

381
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,567
You don't want to know.

382
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,572
According to our friends
from Indian Marsh,

383
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,159
the house on Neibolt Street
was built atop an old ground well

384
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,786
that dates back to colonial days.

385
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,081
- Clear!
- Clear!

386
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,459
<i>The objects we're looking for,
13 Indian artifacts</i>

387
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,461
<i>that the natives refer to as pillars,</i>

388
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,421
<i>were buried centuries ago</i>

389
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,924
<i>and in different locations around Derry,</i>

390
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,717
<i>and are now only accessible</i>

391
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,303
<i>through the sewers
directly beneath that old well.</i>

392
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,765
<i>Major Hanlon and his team
will secure the house,</i>

393
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,476
<i>find the well, and descend
into the sewer system</i>

394
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,937
<i>where our guide, Taniel,
will lead us through the tunnels</i>

395
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,522
<i>to the location of the pillars.</i>

396
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,400
<i>If necessary,
with the assistance of Private Hallorann.</i>

397
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,533
All right, boys. Down the hatch.

398
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,288
<i>But remember, gentlemen,
you'll be in enemy territory.</i>

399
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,499
<i>Whatever form this enemy takes,</i>

400
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,085
<i>it will use your own
personal fears against you.</i>

401
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,796
<i>Don't freeze, don't trust it.</i>

402
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,799
<i>If you see something
that by any rational measure</i>

403
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,093
<i>should not be down there, shoot it.</i>

404
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,806
<i>Be vigilant, stay safe,
and secure the assets.</i>

405
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,312
This way.

406
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,607
Can you feel it?

407
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,152
I feel something.

408
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,846
<i>Dick.</i>

409
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,769
Y'all hear that?

410
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,853
Hear what?

411
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,299
Taniel! Are you all right?

412
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,926
Yeah.

413
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,928
Big drop.

414
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,280
<i>Dick!</i>

415
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,115
<i>Baby!</i>

416
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,830
Come on, go. We're gonna fall behind.

417
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:09,993
Where is he?

418
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,664
Hallorann!

419
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,334
Hallorann!

420
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,466
Where the hell'd he go?

421
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,677
I don't know!
He went down and didn't come up.

422
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,239
Dickie.

423
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,534
He's coming for you again.

424
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,704
Grandma?

425
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,899
Grandpa.

426
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,692
Hey, Dickie.

427
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,862
It's time.

428
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,198
Hallorann!

429
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,409
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

430
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,078
Did you hear that?

431
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:37,872
Hallorann! That you?

432
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,909
I...

433
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,203
want...

434
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,706
you!

435
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,541
Fire!

436
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,546
The hell?

437
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,009
Hallorann!

438
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,094
Hallorann!

439
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,330
We should all take three.
That should be enough.

440
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,635
It's kinda bitter.

441
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,305
Better than getting kinda eaten.

442
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,849
Okay.

443
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,018
Lead the way.

444
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,601
We're close now.

445
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,062
What do you say, Hallorann? That right?

446
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,275
Major Hanlon?

447
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,487
Shit! Taniel!

448
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,949
Stop! Taniel!

449
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,457
Making a big mistake now!

450
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,043
Son of a bitch!

451
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,388
This way.

452
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,813
Y'all are cute.

453
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,858
Talking to each other with your minds,

454
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,818
keeping secrets from me.

455
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,823
I may not have had the gift,
but I ain't no dummy.

456
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,869
I know everything
that that bitch told you.

457
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,203
<i>Don't listen to him.</i>

458
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,997
<i>He's trying to get in your head.</i>

459
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,540
"Dickie."

460
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,792
"Lock 'em away

461
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,419
in a little box in your mind,

462
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,004
and then throw away the key."

463
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,089
<i>He gonna hurt you, baby.
Don't listen to him.</i>

464
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,841
She don't understand like we do.

465
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,760
Power like this is meant to be used.

466
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,928
No.

467
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,139
How'd you find that?

468
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,224
How you...

469
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,809
How you find my box?

470
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,853
It was right there.

471
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,646
In the...

472
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,773
In the sphincter of your soul.

473
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,525
<i>You know what's in there, boy.</i>

474
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,610
<i>Don't let him open it!</i>

475
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,487
Nowhere you can bury it
that I can't find! You hear me?

476
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,156
<i>They're gonna get you, Dickie.</i>

477
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,657
<i>Keep that box closed.</i>

478
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,576
Let it all go. Come on, boy. Open it up.

479
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,929
- I ain't opening shit.
- I ain't telling you one more time.

480
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,122
- Open up the damn box.
- I ain't opening shit.

481
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,082
- Open the damn box!
- No!

482
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,542
You're gonna have to put that back

483
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,520
where you got that from,
'cause I'm not opening it.

484
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,630
- Or you're gonna what?
- I'm gonna f...

485
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,341
Or you'll what? Or you'll what?

486
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,800
Or you'll what?

487
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,514
Grandma!

488
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,849
What you gonna do, huh?

489
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,727
What you gonna do, boy?

490
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,729
You won't open it?

491
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,023
- We'll open it together.
- No.

492
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,650
- On the count of three. Ready?
- Stop.

493
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,610
Stop. Stop.

494
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,987
- Put it down.
- One.

495
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,391
Don't do that. Don't do that.
Don't do that. Don't do that.

496
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,075
Stop. Stop. Stop.

497
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,035
Don't do that!

498
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,038
- Stop.
- Two.

499
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,498
No. Don't do that!

500
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,667
Leave it alone! Leave it alone!

501
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,001
What is that? What are you?

502
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,544
What are you doing?

503
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,963
Get out of here.

504
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,923
Leave me alone. Get out.

505
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,633
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Three.

506
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,703
I think I took too many pills.

507
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,999
Maybe we did take too many pills.

508
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,042
What'd you say?

509
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,837
What?

510
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,588
What?

511
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,091
Are you okay?

512
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,677
Sorry I'm so slow.

513
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,430
I can't see too well in the dark.

514
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,890
Here, take my hand.

515
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,604
Your hand is really soft.

516
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,899
Oh, well, I borrow
my mom's Noxzema sometimes.

517
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,028
No, I mean super-duper soft.

518
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,822
Like a kitty cat's belly.

519
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,658
That's a really weird thing to say.

520
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,911
Are you guys feeling this?

521
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,832
It's like that time I went to Dr. Wagner's

522
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,418
and his hygienist gave me this gas,

523
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,005
and I thought I was floating
right out of my...

524
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,092
Are you two holding hands?

525
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,678
- No.
- Yeah.

526
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,806
We're getting close.

527
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,146
Jesus Christ, it smells like shit in here.

528
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,397
It's the sewers, Pauly.

529
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,161
What did you think
it was gonna smell like?

530
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,669
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know.

531
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,213
We must have got
turned around somewhere.

532
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,007
- What are you saying, we're lost?
- I don't know.

533
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,157
Shit!

534
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,326
- Hello?
- Hey, calm down.

535
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,262
I'm calm. I'm perfectly calm.
Don't I sound calm?

536
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,287
Not really.

537
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,041
Is it hot?

538
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,586
Jesus Christ. I'm burning up.

539
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,482
It's a goddamn furnace down here.
You're not hot?

540
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,217
Pauly, I'm hot. It's hot. Take it easy.

541
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,718
Why can't we find them, huh?

542
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,613
I feel like something's wrong, man.
I got a feeling.

543
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,765
Listen, we'll catch up to the others,
or we'll find our own way out.

544
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,568
Either way, we gotta
keep moving, all right?

545
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,227
- So, let's just move.
- All right.

546
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,645
- Yeah?
- All right, all right.

547
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,063
Leroy!

548
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,525
What, what? What is it?

549
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,115
Lee, what are you looking at?

550
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,284
Leroy, help!

551
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,494
I'm scared!

552
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,913
Charlotte?

553
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,623
I want to go home, Lee. I'm scared!

554
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,961
Charlotte, what the hell
are you doing down here?

555
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,630
Who the fuck you talking to?

556
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:27,967
Pauly, you can't see her?

557
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,219
See who? Are you fucking with me?

558
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,096
Put your gun down, baby. I'm scared.

559
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,682
What the fuck?

560
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,891
Can we go home, Lee?

561
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,619
Steady that light, Russo.
Steady that light.

562
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,496
- It's not me, it's the battery.
- Let's go home, Lee!

563
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,080
Mine's off too. Change yours. Hurry up!

564
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,274
- Get yours on!
- What the fuck am I supposed to do?

565
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,116
The fuck was that? What are you doing?

566
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,493
Lee?

567
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,938
Hey, what the hell is going on?

568
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,064
Hey!

569
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,026
- Lee, what the hell is going on?
- Hey!

570
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,110
Listen, listen.

571
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,946
Whatever you see down here
that's not supposed to be here,

572
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,031
you fucking kill it.

573
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,134
It doesn't fucking matter
if it's your first girlfriend,

574
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,202
your high school gym teacher,
you fucking kill 'em.

575
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,286
- You got it?
- All right.

576
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,139
- Pauly!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it, I got it.

577
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,932
- Kill my gym teacher. I got it.
- Okay, let's go.

578
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,082
All right.

579
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,668
Freakin' me out.

580
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,240
Looks like a dead end.

581
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,033
I...

582
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,828
I could've sworn it was right.

583
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,081
Hallorann!

584
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,628
- You hear that?
- Hallorann!

585
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,921
Voices.

586
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,299
There's someone else down here.

587
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,178
We should go back.

588
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,102
Oh my God!

589
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,813
It's Susie. Oh my God.

590
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,901
Teddy!

591
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,238
Oh my God!

592
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,739
Is that Phil?

593
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,616
He's dead!

594
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,161
<i>All of the tunnels
Are underground</i>

595
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,998
<i>Where none of the children
Will ever be found</i>

596
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,168
<i>They wandered away
To join the show</i>

597
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,796
<i>And lost their way
In the world below</i>

598
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,881
<i>They swallowed the pills
And they lost their fear</i>

599
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,484
<i>But nothing they hoped to find was here</i>

600
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,634
That's Matty!

601
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,012
<i>They joined the circus
And left their town</i>

602
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,223
<i>Now they live here
Down with the clown</i>

603
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,517
<i>-Down with the clown
-With the clown</i>

604
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,603
<i>Down here with the clown</i>

605
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,688
<i>Now they live down here</i>

606
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,190
<i>With the clown!</i>

607
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,696
Duck and cover, kiddos.

608
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,754
Guys, wait up!

609
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,059
Help!

610
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,649
Help!

611
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,778
Can anyone hear me?

612
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,787
I see him too.

613
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,456
It's me! Dad!

614
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,707
He's real.

615
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,544
Leroy, he's real!

616
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,510
Shit!

617
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,595
Shit. Fuck.

618
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,097
Shit.

619
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,391
- Fuck.
- All right.

620
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,894
What the hell are you all doing here?

621
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,772
Get behind me! Behind me! Move it!

622
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,069
I got you. I got you. I got you.

623
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,114
- Is it bad?
- Just look at me.

624
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,925
- Is it bad?
- No, it's not. It's not bad, brother.

625
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,218
Not bad? Yeah, it's fucking bad.

626
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,284
- It's not bad.
- It's bad.

627
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,970
- I just... We're gonna patch you up.
- Yeah.

628
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,139
So, I can get you out of here
and we're gonna patch you up.

629
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,766
- And so, let's go.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

630
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,958
- What?
- I wanna rest.

631
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,686
- Let me rest.
- No. Fuck that. You can't rest.

632
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,430
- We gotta get out of here.
- Let me rest. No.

633
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,147
No, listen. We gotta get
the fuck out of here.

634
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,132
- Hey, hey. Lee. Lee.
- I got you. What? What?

635
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,510
It's okay. It's okay.

636
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:23,846
What?

637
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,723
It's my turn.

638
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,307
It's my turn.

639
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:28,976
I'm sorry.

640
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,610
- I'm sorry, brother.
- Hey, listen.

641
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,654
Make it count.

642
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,614
Make it count.

643
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,269
All right.
Kids, everybody get out of here.

644
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,687
Run! Now!

645
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,379
Guys!

646
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,801
Ronnie, Marge! Can anyone hear me?

647
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,443
Too bad. So sad.

648
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,572
You couldn't save ol' Matty-boy.

649
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,159
Tasty, tasty Matty-boy.

650
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,998
You convinced everyone to come and see me.

651
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,546
'Cause you're such a good friend.

652
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:25,300
But such a bad daughter!

653
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,595
Don't turn around.

654
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,056
Don't say anything.

655
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,269
Turn on the car and let's drive.

656
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,076
I saw the news. I was so worried.

657
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,662
Something attacked the bus.

658
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,746
- Attacked?
- Yeah.

659
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,415
It just happened so fast.

660
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,625
I don't know what it was.

661
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,269
They've put checkpoints on the state road

662
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,545
going in and out of town.

663
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,356
All right.
We have to find someplace for you to go.

664
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,381
Okay. Okay.

665
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,258
- Come home with me.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

666
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,760
It's too risky. It's... It ain't safe.

667
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,138
You can't stay outdoors.
They're combing the woods.

668
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,475
Shit. Shit.

669
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,397
Fuck. Fuck. Shit.

670
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,155
Yeah. Okay.

671
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,035
There might be someone who can help.

672
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,177
Hi.

673
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,344
I'm Mrs. Hanlon.

674
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,388
You called about a visitor?

675
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,806
Mrs. Hanlon?

676
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,101
My name is Ingrid Kersh.

677
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,397
You don't know me,
but we have a mutual friend.

678
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,817
And he got hit.

679
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,694
Next thing I know,

680
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,823
he's down, and he's bleeding out.

681
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,243
And so, I get him up.

682
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,579
I take him with me.

683
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,878
It was too late.

684
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,757
Thank you, Major.

685
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,134
If we need any more, we'll let you know.

686
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,442
I am so sorry, Major.

687
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,279
Russo was a good man.

688
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,617
Yes, he was, sir. Thank you.

689
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,704
I want you to know...

690
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,916
these people, they will answer...

691
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,460
for what they led us into.

692
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,506
That being said,

693
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,467
I do still have a few questions of my own.

694
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,718
Sir, I'm sorry.

695
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,017
I would just really like
to go be with my family.

696
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:28,728
Of course.

697
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,611
General. General.

698
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:39,739
Hallorann.

699
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,450
Did he make it out?

700
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,662
Hasn't reported back to base.

701
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,625
How he'd have made it
out of there, I don't know.

702
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,962
<i>But if anyone could find a way,</i>

703
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,090
<i>it's Dick Hallorann.</i>
