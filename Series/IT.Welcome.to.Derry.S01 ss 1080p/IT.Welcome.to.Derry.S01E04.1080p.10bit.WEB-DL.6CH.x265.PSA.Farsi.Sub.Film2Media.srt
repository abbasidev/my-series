1
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,894
Come on, Lilly!

2
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,579
Lilly, when we last spoke,

3
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,622
you said you weren't quite sure
you could describe

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,291
what you saw at the theater that night.

5
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,793
Still can't, but now
I don't have to because...

6
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,628
'Cause we got the pictures, Chief Bowers.

7
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,130
We have one where this thing looks

8
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,631
like the monster version of Teddy,

9
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,675
- which was incredibly scary...
- Rich.

10
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,343
Who is he?

11
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,929
Ricardo Santo, sir.
But you can call me Rich.

12
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,349
Whatever killed Teddy, Phil, and Susie,

13
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,769
it came after us again
last night in the cemetery.

14
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,146
What the hell were you doing
at the cemetery at night?

15
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,773
So, my cousin Bembe told me this thing

16
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,751
- my uncle used to do...
- We were just cutting through.

17
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,860
Yeah, taking a shortcut home.

18
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,755
And you all just happened
to have a camera with you

19
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,780
when it did.

20
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,239
We were ready this time.

21
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,827
Well, let's have a look-see.

22
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,290
Oh my God.

23
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,536
Kirn, Wallace, look at this.

24
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,714
Jesus H. Christ.

25
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,591
- What the hell is that?
- I don't...

26
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,301
Is that a...

27
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,970
Is this pigeon shit?

28
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,141
It's not possible.

29
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:45,355
What's this? Dead flowers.
Helpful. Aunt Mary's headstone.

30
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,023
A tree.

31
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,527
Stop, wait. Look at that one.

32
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,904
Yeah, that's it, right there.

33
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,412
- The statue?
- No, are you blind?

34
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,497
It's a clown!

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,165
You watch your tone, young lady.

36
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,709
You walk into this office
telling tall tales

37
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,895
and you show me this as proof?

38
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,022
The only thing this is proof of
is that you, Lilly Bainbridge,

39
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,565
are trying to buy yourself
a one-way ticket

40
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,841
back to the nuthouse.

41
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,346
You kids keep your noses
out of police business,

42
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,182
or ghouls and goblins

43
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,309
will be the very least of your worries.

44
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,436
Do I make myself perfectly clear?

45
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,381
Maybe it's a Dracula thing.

46
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,926
You know, like in the movie,
how we can't see his reflection?

47
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,261
But we did see him.

48
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,263
It could have killed us, but it didn't.

49
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,266
It's like it's messing with us.

50
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,660
The first thing I'd do is find out

51
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,004
if there's a history of stuff
like this happening in Derry.

52
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,398
Lilly, your mom grew up here, right?

53
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,482
Yeah.

54
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,484
She ever mention anything strange?

55
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,403
No, and if I ask her about it,

56
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,005
she'll send me right back to Juniper Hill.

57
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,073
But you heard what...

58
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,784
You heard what Bowers said.

59
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,547
They're gonna transfer my dad
to Shawshank.

60
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,017
You don't come back from that place.

61
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,373
- Please, I'm just asking...
- No adult's ever gonna believe

62
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,582
what we saw.

63
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,167
I wouldn't.

64
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,088
Wait.

65
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,340
I know someone who might.

66
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,552
I haven't thought about it in years,

67
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,053
but now that you mention it,

68
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,514
I do remember some kids
going missing in the '30s.

69
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,309
Quite a few, actually.

70
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,518
Really?

71
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,811
Well, it was the depression,

72
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,063
and a lot of families
were starving, and some kids,

73
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,940
they just disappeared overnight.

74
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,751
They probably ran away
looking for something better

75
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,902
or trying to relieve
their families of the burden.

76
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,321
They were tough times.

77
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,615
But nothing like...

78
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,535
What you're describing? Oh no, dear.

79
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,078
No, nothing like that.

80
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,832
But don't let that stop you

81
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,043
from trying to figure out
what's happening.

82
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,879
My father always said to me

83
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,547
that with good friends at your side,

84
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,965
anything's possible.

85
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,052
And it sounds like you have those.

86
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,663
Hello. Well, this is a surprise.

87
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,541
Thought I'd save you the trouble
of wrestling it home yourself.

88
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,544
You didn't have to do that.

89
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,380
Just happy it found a good home.

90
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,882
I'm brewing coffee, if you're in the mood.

91
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,525
I will never say no to a cup of coffee.

92
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,593
All right.

93
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,388
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

94
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,310
So, your folks are from
around these parts originally?

95
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,313
My ancestors settled in the valley here,

96
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,274
but our homelands
were much bigger back then.

97
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,527
We would follow the elk herds

98
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,779
all the way into Nova Scotia and back.

99
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,282
That was before
Manifest Destiny, of course.

100
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,284
I've never been to Canada myself.

101
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,369
No?

102
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,332
I still have cousins up there,
north of the border.

103
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,168
Well, what they call a border anyway.

104
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,796
To us, it's just a line on a map.

105
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,261
So, how is your husband adjusting?

106
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,281
I suppose they're keeping him busy
working on that new pipeline.

107
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,473
Leroy's a pilot.

108
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,642
I doubt he's got anything to do with that.

109
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,478
Not that he'd tell me if he did, but...

110
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,688
No?

111
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,523
Every time I ask about his day,

112
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,152
it's national security this,
and classified that.

113
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,988
Man's got more secrets
than King Tut's tomb.

114
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,117
That sounds a little lonely.

115
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,287
I knew what I was signing up for
when I married a fly boy.

116
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,206
He doesn't question orders.
I question everything.

117
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,958
That's the dance.

118
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,339
May I ask you something?

119
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,008
Of course.

120
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,011
This...

121
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,931
business with the theater,
the missing kids...

122
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,977
It's a terrible thing.

123
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,438
Do I need to be concerned?

124
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,944
Derry is a beautiful place,

125
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,655
but things do happen from time to time.

126
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,952
Never a bad idea
to keep the people you love close.

127
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,707
Tell you what.

128
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,085
If you need anything, to talk,

129
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,505
a friend,

130
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,009
call me.

131
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,292
Here we go.

132
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,336
- This is it.
- Hallorann!

133
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,004
- Let's go!
- Y'all seen this sh...

134
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,423
- Hell no.
- I saw that.

135
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,801
Yo, hold on. Let me find
the light up in here.

136
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,719
- I got it. Hold up.
- Hit the lights.

137
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,346
- Hey, hey.
- There you go. You...

138
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,014
- Okay.
- You did it. You did it.

139
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,140
Damn.

140
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,518
Hey, ain't it a little far from base?

141
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,436
That's good.

142
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,480
Mean there's no one to hassle us.

143
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,775
- You sure it's ours?
- Colonel said we could use it.

144
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,068
Right, right.

145
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,861
And no one else comes here?

146
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,531
Boy, do you know
what "decommissioned" means?

147
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,991
- No.
- It was all storage out here.

148
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,244
Anything they needed,
they cleared out a long time ago.

149
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,870
Come on now. Look at this.

150
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,498
- What?
- It's a damn mess.

151
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,084
Yeah. But the important thing is,

152
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,711
it's got potential.

153
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,129
Hell no.

154
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,632
No, look. You put the bar here,
put the Hi-Fi there.

155
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,342
Hey.

156
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,512
Hey, hey, Hallorann.
Maybe you could get, like, a...

157
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,156
A grill or a hot plate
or something, you know?

158
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,366
We could turn this into a kitchen!

159
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,017
Throw a little chow down for the fellas.

160
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,435
And their dates.

161
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,520
You can't do that on base.

162
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,399
Can't do nothing here neither
till we clean this motherfucker.

163
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,527
Come on. Y'all laughing like
we don't gotta clean this shit.

164
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,904
- Damn.
- Let's clean this up, gentlemen.

165
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,406
Yes, sir.

166
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,635
Can y'all help me with this?
It's heavy as hell.

167
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,138
Come on, bro. Maybe we can use
a couple of these things around here.

168
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,705
It's all damn broken.

169
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,789
There's food here.

170
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,999
There's food here? Shit.

171
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,547
<i>There is a bright flash,</i>

172
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,800
<i>brighter than the sun.
It could knock you down hard,</i>

173
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,761
<i>or throw you against a tree or a wall.</i>

174
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,805
<i>It is such a big explosion,</i>

175
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,892
<i>it can smash in buildings,
and knock signboards over,</i>

176
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,977
<i>and break windows all over town.</i>

177
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,439
<i>But if you duck and cover like Bert,</i>

178
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,066
<i>you'll be much safer.</i>

179
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,151
<i>The atomic bomb flash could burn you</i>

180
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,195
<i>worse than a terrible sunburn,</i>

181
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,447
<i>especially where you're not covered.</i>

182
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,491
<i>Now, you and I don't have shells</i>

183
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,201
<i>to crawl into like Bert the Turtle,</i>

184
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,703
<i>so we have to cover up in our own way.</i>

185
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,957
<i>First, you duck, and then you cover.</i>

186
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,167
<i>And very tightly,</i>

187
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,753
<i>you cover the back of your neck
and your face.</i>

188
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,631
<i>Duck and cover underneath a table...</i>

189
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,707
Looking for these?

190
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,420
I was tidying up,
and I found these stuffed

191
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,755
in an envelope in the back of that drawer.

192
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,383
What's going on, Will?

193
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,010
- I was...
- And don't lie to me.

194
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,724
Ronnie is my friend.

195
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,852
She swears her dad didn't do it,
and I believe her,

196
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,746
but the police don't
because he works at the theater.

197
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,772
Yeah, I know, baby.

198
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,609
So...

199
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,446
Me and some other kids, we...

200
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,824
met up to try to figure out
how to help her when...

201
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,369
When what?

202
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,874
What happened?

203
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,002
It was dark.

204
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,338
And someone came after us.

205
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,842
We were scared and we ran,

206
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,719
but Ronnie had a camera
and she was trying...

207
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,179
Trying to get some pictures and...

208
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,435
Okay, baby.

209
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,958
All right, no more running around

210
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,501
till I find out
what's going on around here.

211
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,360
- What?
- School and back, and that's it.

212
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,029
- Mom.
- Not another word.

213
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,552
Your daddy finds out you've been
running around wild at night,

214
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,992
you're gonna get
a worse punishment than that.

215
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,537
We'll keep it between us

216
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,664
this time.

217
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,724
How was your first week at school?

218
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,602
- Fine.
- Fine?

219
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,270
Give me some details.

220
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,318
Go on, baby. Tell him.

221
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,824
For goodness' sake.

222
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,910
There is a girl.

223
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,788
- Mom.
- It's okay.

224
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,122
Don't embarrass the boy, Char.

225
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,625
Can I be excused?

226
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,878
- You haven't even had dessert.
- I have homework.

227
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,674
All right. Go on.

228
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,474
So, the girl is...

229
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,434
I mean, is she...

230
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,191
You know.

231
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,904
Are you working this weekend?

232
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,867
I don't know. I'm just waiting on a call.

233
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,704
Well, I was thinking,

234
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,039
if you're free,
y'all two could do something.

235
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,001
Been so busy since we got here.

236
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,628
Could be good to get him
out of his head for a change.

237
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,465
Yeah.

238
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,260
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

239
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,387
What are you thinking?

240
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,995
Nice.

241
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,706
Dad?

242
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,375
How long do we have to do this?

243
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,465
Have to? I'm having the time of my life.

244
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,592
Spending time in nature with my boy,

245
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,135
like I used to with my pops.

246
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,347
It doesn't get better than this.

247
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,310
Tell me about
this new girlfriend of yours.

248
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,271
She's not my girlfriend.

249
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,528
Not yet? The year is young.

250
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,160
The year's young, my friend.

251
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,537
- I caught something.
- What?

252
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,622
I got something.

253
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,541
Okay, son, relax, relax. Don't force it.

254
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,377
Just reel it in a little bit at a time.

255
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,855
- Come on, easy. Keep it going.
- I'm doing it, Dad.

256
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,357
Keep it going. You got it. Stay with it.

257
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,091
You gotta stay with him. There it is.

258
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,884
Damn it.

259
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,220
I got it.

260
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,722
You had it. That's... He's gone.

261
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,023
Wind it back.
At least we know they're biting.

262
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,687
Hold on, hold on. Your fly came off.

263
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,939
Yeah, so...

264
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,149
Watch my line?

265
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,567
I left the spares in the car.

266
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,883
You'll burn too!

267
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,178
Will.

268
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,017
Dad! Help!

269
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,229
Dad! Help!

270
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,274
Help! Daddy! Help!

271
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,821
It pulled me under.
It came up out of the water!

272
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,157
What? Son, what is it?
Breathe. Breathe. What did?

273
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,950
It was you.

274
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,703
You were all burnt
like that picture of you

275
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,514
after the war when you went down
in that plane!

276
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,308
Son, you gotta relax.
You're not making any sense.

277
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,792
- It's the truth!
- Calm down!

278
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,672
Son, what the hell?

279
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,676
There's something here, in Derry.

280
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,220
Something bad.

281
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,448
<i>Reports suggest that Soviet shipments</i>

282
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,117
<i>that recently arrived in Cuban ports</i>

283
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,660
<i>may contain military equipment,</i>

284
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,370
<i>including surface-to-air missiles.</i>

285
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,747
<i>If confirmed, sources say
it would mark a significant...</i>

286
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,419
Chief, you got a visitor.

287
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,637
No details, no description.

288
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,264
That's not a lot to go on.

289
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,599
They're kids. They got scared and ran.

290
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,934
All right. We'll look into it.

291
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,477
Is there anything else, Mrs...

292
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,562
Hanlon.

293
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,814
I don't mean to be presumptuous,

294
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,732
Chief Bowers, but if there is someone

295
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,152
out there still accosting children,

296
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,655
isn't it a possibility
you have an innocent man in your jail?

297
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,949
You're talking about Hank Grogan?
Not a chance.

298
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,691
Not a chance. We questioned him,
we caught him in a lie.

299
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,537
The man has no alibi.

300
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,582
Has he been able to consult an attorney?

301
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,170
Mrs. Hanlon, this isn't the South.

302
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,380
He and his family have had regular contact

303
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,507
with the public defender's office.

304
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,926
I didn't mean to offend you, sir.
I'm sorry.

305
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,846
You can imagine where I come from,

306
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,097
what I'm used to.

307
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,270
May I speak with him, please?

308
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,480
You're neither counsel nor family, so no.

309
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,441
Now, if you'll excuse me...

310
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,364
Thank you for your time.

311
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,602
"Grogan." Grogan.

312
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,696
I don't understand, Miss...

313
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,991
Missus. Hanlon. Call me Charlotte.

314
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,703
My boy, Will, is a friend
of your granddaughter's.

315
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,956
He told me the situation with your son,

316
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,625
and I just thought I'd check in.

317
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,752
- You a lawyer?
- No, ma'am,

318
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,088
but I was active
in the movement down south.

319
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,632
Did my bit helping other colored folks

320
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,926
who got forced into false confessions.

321
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,053
If that's the case with your son,

322
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,013
I'd like to see if I could help him too.

323
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,390
That's kind of you,

324
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,475
but I don't see
as it'll do much good.

325
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,395
I thought he was in his room.

326
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,856
Turns out someone saw him
out walking, so...

327
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,526
Doesn't mean he hurt anybody.

328
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,946
Of course not.
My Hank wouldn't hurt a fly.

329
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,240
Especially not no kids.

330
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,410
So, if he wasn't at the theater,
and he wasn't home,

331
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,537
where else could he have been?

332
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,332
The only one who knows
where my son was that night,

333
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,667
other than himself,

334
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,794
is God.

335
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,006
And neither one of them's talking.

336
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,972
Hey.

337
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,641
You're gonna clean it off?

338
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,902
There you go, Reg!

339
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,156
Back against the wall. Back...

340
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,336
You actually want
the back against the wall, Jax.

341
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,628
Why aren't you helping?

342
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,464
I'm helping right now.

343
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,716
- All right, Hallorann.
- I can't play.

344
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,219
Hey! Hallorann!

345
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,461
<i>Dick...</i>

346
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,838
<i>baby.</i>

347
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,634
<i>Mind me now.</i>

348
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,805
<i>You watch yourself, you hear?</i>

349
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,392
<i>Keep that lid on tight.</i>

350
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,580
They said I'd find you here.

351
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,083
Well, here I am.

352
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,710
Hey.

353
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,963
Thanks again for that home-cooked meal.

354
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,842
The best sleep I had
since I stumbled out of a cat house.

355
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,805
Say, you heard anything
from General Shaw or Colonel Fuller?

356
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,058
Just wondering when we're going up again.

357
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,726
Oh, no. That's above my pay grade.

358
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,021
I hear you. But, you know,
that Operation Precept,

359
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,622
Shaw made it sound like a real priority.

360
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,403
One brother to another,

361
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,155
maybe don't be so eager to put yourself

362
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,781
in the line of fire on this one.

363
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,969
Now, what are you trying to say?

364
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,786
The Colonel was kind enough

365
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,872
to lend us this old requisition shed

366
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,790
to use at and for our leisure.

367
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,019
We're just setting up inside.
You want to help us out?

368
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,128
Hey.

369
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,139
Listen, I went fishin' today with my son,

370
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,434
and when I went back to the car
to get more bait...

371
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,728
something attacked him.

372
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,523
Jesus. I'm sorry. You all right?

373
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,734
When I asked him what, he said,

374
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,529
he said it was me,
all burnt up and charred

375
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,198
like I crawled out of a plane crash.

376
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,742
And I came up out the water,
tried to pull him under.

377
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,119
You believe him?

378
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,666
The boy's got bruises and cuts
like an animal scratched him all up.

379
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,754
He looked at me, he said,

380
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,758
"Dad, there's something bad
here in Derry."

381
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,349
Hallorann, what the hell
are we actually looking for?

382
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,070
And I know we're trying
to develop some shit.

383
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,022
Russia too.
What, did something go missing?

384
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,484
A machine that fucks
with your head? What is it?

385
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,404
- Answer me!
- I don't know!

386
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,115
I don't know what the hell it is.

387
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,702
Hell, I'm not sure I wanna know.

388
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,041
Look, I do what I'm told
when I'm told, just like you.

389
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:47,963
I'm sorry about your son.

390
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,198
I used to have nightmares
as a kid about my dad

391
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,057
going down in a plane
like he did in Korea.

392
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,161
It scared me more
than anything else in the world.

393
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,437
I... How did it know that?

394
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,191
It could have killed me
way before my dad got to me.

395
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:11,069
It can probably kill any one of us
anytime it wants to.

396
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,740
Unless...

397
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,742
Unless what?

398
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,497
What if it doesn't want to kill us?

399
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,082
Not yet, anyway.

400
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,127
What if it's just trying
to scare us like Lilly said?

401
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,380
Why would it just wanna scare us
when it killed all the others?

402
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:33,717
We don't actually know
Matty's dead. Not for sure.

403
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,805
But he did tell me
he'd been seeing weird stuff

404
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,765
for a while before he disappeared.

405
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,643
Phil and Teddy said the same thing.

406
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,604
Oh man.

407
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,690
- I hate being right.
- What?

408
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,650
Adrenaline.

409
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,819
Cortisol.

410
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,781
They're called the fear hormones.

411
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,284
When you get scared,
not just you, any mammal,

412
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,536
your adrenal gland secretes them
into your bloodstream,

413
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,747
which some predators like the taste of.

414
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,250
So, they'll stalk and scare their prey

415
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,793
until they smell just right.

416
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,837
- Then...
- No, no, no.

417
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,505
You're saying it wants to eat us?

418
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,424
- It's just a theory.
- It's a horrible theory!

419
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,259
- Well, it fits the facts.
- Okay, let's just,

420
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,303
for the moment, assume that you're right.

421
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,221
No, I do not wanna assume that.

422
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:24,184
But if he is, what are we supposed to do?

423
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,228
I mean, it's not like
we can just stop ourselves

424
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,813
from being scared.

425
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,275
Guys...

426
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,569
what if we could?

427
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,574
How'd you get them?

428
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,326
I swiped them from my mom's compact.

429
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,370
I got one for each of us.

430
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,997
What does it do?

431
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,916
Whenever she's really nervous about stuff

432
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,210
like bills or, you know,

433
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,462
me,

434
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,464
she just sticks one under her tongue.

435
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,217
She says it makes all her fears
and troubles

436
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,885
melt away like magic.

437
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,929
She calls it "Mommy's Little Helper."

438
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,722
That sounds pretty good.

439
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,351
So, I guess the second something weird
starts to happen,

440
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,104
- we take it and just...
- And hope for the best.

441
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,480
Yeah.

442
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,945
There are almost 20,000 species

443
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,863
of worms on Earth.

444
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,701
Each one unique,
each with its own purpose

445
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:27,163
in the great swirling apparatus
of our planet's function.

446
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,334
Here we see the parasitic flatworm,

447
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:35,672
<i>Leucochloridium paradoxum,</i>
which burrows into the bodies

448
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:39,134
of land snails,
causing their eyes to swell

449
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,720
and expand into multicolored stalks,

450
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,640
which subsequently attract
the attention of birds,

451
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,477
who then swoop down and pluck them out.

452
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:54,524
Now, the most fascinating aspect
of <i>Leucochloridium paradoxum</i>

453
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,777
is how the parasite not only
alters the snail physically...

454
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,862
Hey.

455
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,865
but also hijacks its brain
and alters its behavior...

456
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,743
I've been thinking about
what a shit I've been lately.

457
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,580
I was wondering if...

458
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,915
I don't know.

459
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,460
Do you wanna go to lunch with me today?

460
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,211
Just me and you?

461
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,840
I miss you.

462
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,510
That'd be swell.

463
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,637
Peachy.

464
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,639
Can't wait.

465
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:32,562
Now, as we consider
the durability of parasitic infections

466
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,273
in the animal kingdom,
we should never lose sight

467
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,651
of how easily they can leap
between species.

468
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,108
Are you family?

469
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,694
No, but I have a letter here
signed by his mother

470
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,155
granting permission to visit with her son.

471
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,162
Yeah.

472
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,265
You'll have to wait for the chief.

473
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,666
And when will he be in?

474
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,501
Hard to say.

475
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,419
That's just not good enough.

476
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,213
Listen, lady.

477
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,259
I suggest that you take it on the arches

478
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,679
before you find yourself
in a cell right next to him.

479
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,306
My name's not Lady,
it's Charlotte Hanlon,

480
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,851
and that may not mean much
to you right now,

481
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,537
but it will when you see
all the scary shit

482
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,895
I can do with a telephone.

483
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,148
- Excuse me?
- No, I don't think I will.

484
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,861
In fact, if you don't let me see
Hank Grogan right now,

485
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,823
by tomorrow morning,
I'll have MLK, JFK, RFK,

486
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,450
and a whole bunch of other FKs
breathing down your neck,

487
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,054
along with a bus full
of Freedom Riders after another

488
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,788
from here to the turnpike

489
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,915
singing "We Shall Overcome" in the streets

490
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,768
till you have to call
the world's largest cowcatcher

491
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,835
to clear them.

492
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,212
Now, are you gonna let me see the man?

493
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,381
Or do I need to make a call?

494
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,474
Forgive me, Mrs. Hanlon,
but you don't know my situation.

495
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,101
I know the cops locked you up

496
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,978
without a shred of hard evidence.

497
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,325
I spoke with the public defender's office,

498
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,607
asked some questions.

499
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,026
Turns out they charged you
without a bail hearing,

500
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,694
which is your legal right.

501
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,913
Public defender
ain't say nothing about that.

502
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,406
We'll worry about him later.

503
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,283
Right now, we need to file papers

504
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,119
citing prejudicial treatment,
show discrimination,

505
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,705
which should be easy to do
in your case.

506
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,166
It'll allow you to skip bail altogether

507
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,002
and go on house arrest
while you wait for trial.

508
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,587
House arrest?

509
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,131
So what you saying? You...

510
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,591
I don't gotta go to Shawshank?

511
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,593
The papers take a minute to process,

512
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,696
and it sounds like
they're bus sing you out tomorrow.

513
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,513
So you may have to spend a few days there,

514
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,766
but the fact of the matter is,

515
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,893
your right to due process was violated.

516
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,187
Whatever you did,

517
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,481
or didn't do,

518
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,651
you're gonna be going home.

519
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,278
At least for now.

520
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,114
That's a promise.

521
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:33,993
Thank you.

522
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,664
But at some point, Mr. Grogan,

523
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,000
you'll have to go on record
with the truth.

524
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,544
The truth?

525
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,173
The truth is, I ain't do nothing
to those kids.

526
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,716
Told the police about it too!

527
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,135
Doesn't change the fact that you weren't

528
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,929
where you claimed to be that night.

529
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,683
Where were you, really?

530
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,565
You realize that answer
could set you free.

531
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,072
Whatever you were doing
can't possibly compare

532
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,116
to what you're being accused of.

533
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,665
You want your daughter
to go without a father?

534
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,019
You want your mama to mourn her son...

535
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,670
You think I want that?

536
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,547
You think I want that?

537
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,009
Man, y'all don't understand.

538
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,761
All right.

539
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,763
So, tell me.

540
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,724
Please.

541
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,977
I think you know by now I'm on your side.

542
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,608
I...

543
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,198
I was with a woman.

544
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,201
A married woman?

545
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,581
Not just married.

546
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,878
A White woman?

547
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,256
It just happened.

548
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,176
"It just happened"?

549
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,099
Look, if anybody finds out,

550
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,478
I won't be heading to no Shawshank.

551
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,897
They'll just find the nearest tree.

552
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,524
Not to mention
what her husband would do to her.

553
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,821
Now, if there's a way out
without anyone getting hurt,

554
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,573
I'll take it.

555
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,286
I might...

556
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,038
I might need some help finding it.

557
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,299
Sir, we checked the areas
the Indian woman told us

558
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,592
to stay away from.

559
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,928
Either she's telling the truth
or sending us

560
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,388
on a wild goose chase,
but there is nothing there.

561
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,100
Of course there's nothing there.

562
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,560
She's a smart woman.

563
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,979
And now we've confirmed her suspicions.

564
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,001
Believe me, Colonel, these people take
their obligations very seriously.

565
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,028
And whatever comes next, it's not gonna be
a cease and desist letter.

566
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,405
Not that it matters.

567
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,158
Because the cycle will be over soon,

568
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,701
and the weapon gone to ground.

569
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,662
Maybe it's time to begin cleanup, sir.

570
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,726
How often are those kids out there
watching the base?

571
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,270
The kids from Indian Marsh?

572
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,397
I don't know, every couple of days.

573
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,649
Sir, they may be curious,

574
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,812
but they know to stay
on their own side of the fence.

575
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,362
Maybe it's time we open the gate.

576
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,531
Invite them in.

577
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,789
So, how are things with your new friends?

578
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,333
What do you mean?

579
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,878
I don't know. I guess I'm just curious.

580
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,380
What's Ronnie Grogan like?

581
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,883
People talk.

582
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,844
If you invited me to gossip, I'm not...

583
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,095
Lilly, no.

584
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,514
I just...

585
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,678
I guess I just don't know
how to talk to you anymore.

586
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,729
Everything's changed so much
since you got back from...

587
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,064
you know.

588
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,695
Look, we've been best friends
since first grade.

589
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,491
Forget the Pattycakes.
I don't wanna lose you.

590
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,243
Can we just start over?

591
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,579
Please?

592
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,789
I'd like that.

593
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,125
Hey, Marge.

594
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,837
Hey, Lilly.

595
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,760
Oh my gosh.

596
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,721
Did you see the way Tim Flanagan
just looked at you?

597
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,140
You should talk to him.

598
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,309
What? No way.

599
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,436
He's totally sweet on you.

600
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,314
Come on, at least say hi.

601
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,108
After everything you've been
through this year,

602
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,236
you deserve it.

603
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,406
Well, I should at least freshen up first.

604
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,498
Okay. I'll be right back.

605
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,929
Did she go for it?

606
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,807
I think so. She's freshening up.

607
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,809
Good. 'Cause it's all set.

608
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,871
The second she goes over to him,
he's gonna embarrass her

609
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,605
in front of the whole school.

610
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,690
It's gonna be so boss.

611
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,901
Yeah, real boss.

612
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,696
Don't chicken out now, Truman.

613
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,657
Get in there before she changes her mind.

614
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,837
What's the holdup?

615
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,381
I have a zit.

616
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,676
You can barely see it.

617
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,512
Let me touch you up
before you go back out.

618
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,097
You'll be drop-dead.

619
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,265
Okay.

620
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,143
Let me pee first. I'm nervous.

621
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,818
I can't believe Tim likes me.

622
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,880
Lills?

623
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,590
Yeah?

624
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,763
I need to tell you something.

625
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,931
What?

626
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,479
I...

627
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,565
Well...

628
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,653
The truth is...

629
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,990
Marge?

630
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,577
Marge, are you okay?

631
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,915
What?

632
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,004
Marge, what's wrong?

633
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,009
My eyes!

634
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,222
Marge!

635
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,855
Whatever you do,
just don't look at it, okay?

636
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,023
Somebody help me!

637
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,483
Close your eyes!

638
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,445
My eyes!

639
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,741
Marge, wait!

640
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,870
Help!

641
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,590
Marge!

642
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,510
Marge!

643
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,681
Marge, no!

644
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,184
Marge, stop! No!

645
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,144
Stop! Let go!

646
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,271
Stop, Marge!

647
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,107
Marge, stop!

648
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,568
No! No! No!

649
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,196
No, Marge, stop!

650
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,489
Let go!

651
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,742
Let go! Stop!

652
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,258
No.

653
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,677
No, I didn't...

654
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,737
You scared me.

655
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,906
What were you doing in town today?

656
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,200
What do you mean?

657
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,411
Pauly said he saw you
walking into the police station.

658
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,377
I can see the wheels turning,
so why don't you just tell me, Char?

659
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,587
Same way you tell me
what happens at that base?

660
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,798
That's a security issue. What is this?

661
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,484
The man that got arrested
at the movie theater?

662
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:36,554
A Black man who's arrested
for a murder he swears he didn't commit.

663
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,598
And his daughter is friends with our son.

664
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,767
His daughter?

665
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,398
Don't be looking for trouble.

666
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,650
There's gonna be trouble anywhere we go.

667
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,361
That's the country
you swore your life to defend.

668
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,256
I'm just making it worth defending.

669
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,490
You swore to me
that you wouldn't start up here.

670
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,202
I can't have you getting
arrested again, Char. Not now.

671
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,748
What I'm doing here is too important.

672
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,584
So, I just need you to trust me.

673
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,794
Just trust me and don't stir the pot.

674
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,130
Please, just promise me that.

675
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,882
Please.

676
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,970
You won't have to worry about me.

677
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,885
Hey. What's wrong? What happened?

678
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,013
I couldn't sleep.
I was using the telescope,

679
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,182
and there was somebody outside
staring at me.

680
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,021
What's wrong?

681
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,358
You see what you did?
Someone's watching the house.

682
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,368
Who's out here?

683
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,788
Show yourself!

684
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,133
Wait, you can't just...

685
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,806
Handle it. Get back to me.

686
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,225
I'm sorry, General.

687
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,018
What the hell do you have us chasing?

688
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,333
We caught him and his friends
scoping out the base.

689
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,710
Tried to get a peek
over our fence, as it were.

690
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,548
What's he doing here?

691
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:27,135
Our young Indian friend,
Taniel is his name,

692
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,722
he knows the location of exactly
what we're looking for.

693
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,517
But he refuses to answer our questions.

694
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:38,021
So, Airman Hallorann
is gonna answer them for us.

695
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,196
<i>They're watching over there.</i>

696
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,910
What they want me to do to you,

697
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,121
it's not gonna be pleasant.

698
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,083
<i>So, why don't you just tell 'em
what they wanna know?</i>

699
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,960
<i>Save us both a whole lot of pain.</i>

700
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,383
Yeah.

701
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,567
<i>Taniel.</i>

702
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,572
God, I'm so sorry about this.

703
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,356
Come on.

704
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,253
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

705
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,839
<i>Happy birthday, Taniel!</i>

706
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,644
<i>I need to tell you something.</i>

707
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:49,421
"No! He's eating them!"

708
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,592
"No!"

709
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,469
"I'll get you for that."

710
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,348
Taniel?

711
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,850
- Hi, Auntie.
- Hey.

712
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,936
- What you doing?
- Nothing.

713
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:15,655
What is it?

714
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,495
You know the story about the monster
in the Western Wood?

715
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,705
The Galloo?

716
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,749
All the kids know that story.

717
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,461
The elders made us memorize it
when we were, like, seven.

718
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,588
Well, some of our stories

719
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,883
are meant to teach us lessons.

720
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,013
And some of our stories are real.

721
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:48,438
So you're telling me The Galloo is real?

722
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,077
Tell me the story.

723
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,622
I need to know you remember
how all of this began.

724
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,381
Millions of years ago,

725
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,425
<i>before the time of the first people,</i>

726
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,386
<i>an evil spirit was cast down</i>

727
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,596
<i>from the darkest part of the night sky,</i>

728
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,890
<i>bound inside of a falling star.</i>

729
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:33,358
<i>But when the star struck
the Earth, it broke open,</i>

730
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,902
<i>and the spirit was set free.</i>

731
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:40,407
<i>It roamed the woods for many snows
and countless moons</i>

732
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:45,162
<i>until the creation of our first ancestors.</i>

733
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,751
<i>The star that carried
the monster had been its cage,</i>

734
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,422
<i>and the stone it was made from
still held power.</i>

735
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,676
<i>Our wisest took a shard from that star</i>

736
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:02,345
<i>and carved a weapon to protect our people</i>

737
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,889
<i>from the monster.</i>

738
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,308
<i>Which we named "The Galloo."</i>

739
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,478
<i>We kept the dagger close</i>

740
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,814
<i>and stayed away
from the Western Wood.</i>

741
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,651
<i>As years went by,</i>

742
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,987
<i>the legend of The Galloo was passed down</i>

743
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,157
<i>from generation to generation.</i>

744
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,411
<i>We lived in balance with the monster</i>

745
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,622
<i>by staying outside of its reach,</i>

746
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,874
<i>and never hunting in its territory.</i>

747
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,919
<i>Until one day,</i>

748
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,296
<i>the settlers arrived.</i>

749
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,383
<i>We warned them of the danger
in the Western Wood,</i>

750
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,636
<i>but they chose to ignore us.</i>

751
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,598
<i>They hunted the woods.</i>

752
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,475
<i>And just as we had warned them,</i>

753
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,810
<i>they were hunted.</i>

754
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,605
<i>The Galloo fed on them</i>

755
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,233
<i>and grew stronger and more powerful.</i>

756
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,237
<i>The monster would soon be able</i>

757
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,948
<i>to hunt outside of the Western Wood.</i>

758
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,952
<i>Sesqui, the village's great war chief,</i>

759
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,371
<i>was called to council by the clan mothers.</i>

760
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,915
<i>The creature had grown too powerful.</i>

761
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,584
<i>A single dagger could no longer protect</i>

762
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,127
<i>all of the villages.</i>

763
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,631
<i>To save our people, the decision was made.</i>

764
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,633
<i>They would have to leave.</i>

765
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,427
<i>But Sesqui's daughter, Necani,</i>

766
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,596
<i>did not want to leave our land.</i>

767
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,349
<i>She believed there was another path.</i>

768
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,226
<i>She took the dagger</i>

769
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,561
<i>and journeyed past the great dead wood</i>

770
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,522
<i>with her friends by her side.</i>

771
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,234
<i>Finally arriving at the Western Wood.</i>

772
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,905
<i>They entered the woods,</i>

773
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,408
<i>seeking the cave where The Galloo crashed</i>

774
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,244
<i>to gather more of the sacred stone.</i>

775
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,163
<i>When Sesqui realized</i>

776
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,708
<i>that her daughter
and the dagger were missing,</i>

777
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,752
<i>she formed a search party
to bring them both back.</i>

778
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,925
<i>But without the dagger,</i>

779
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,176
<i>they had nothing</i>

780
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,137
<i>to protect themselves from The Galloo.</i>

781
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,189
<i>The monster showed itself to them.</i>

782
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,109
<i>In the shape of the things</i>

783
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,777
<i>they feared the most.</i>

784
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:30,910
<i>It separated the war party. One by one.</i>

785
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,122
<i>And before she knew it,</i>

786
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,250
<i>Sesqui found herself alone.</i>

787
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:05,403
<i>Sesqui's only hope
was in her daughter's hands.</i>

788
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:16,206
Prepare to meet thy God!

789
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,709
<i>Even Sesqui, the great warrior,</i>

790
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,629
<i>was no match for the Galloo.</i>

791
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,890
Mom?

792
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:35,934
Mom!

793
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,154
Mom!

794
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,364
Mom, no!

795
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,119
Mom!

796
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,037
No.

797
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,916
<i>But it was too late.</i>

798
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,628
<i>Sesqui's spirit was already slipping away.</i>

799
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:11,302
<i>- And she went to be with the ancestors.</i>
- Mom! No! Mom!

800
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,223
No!

801
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,655
<i>Though Necani's tears
would not stop flowing,</i>

802
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,949
<i>her people were still in danger.</i>

803
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:36,744
<i>She knew what she had to do,
fight for them,</i>

804
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,788
<i>just like her mother always had.</i>

805
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,166
<i>So, Necani took the dagger</i>

806
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,544
<i>and braved the Western Wood
one last time.</i>

807
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,342
<i>They found the cave.</i>

808
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:56,848
<i>And broke off shards of the ancient star
the Galloo had arrived in.</i>

809
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,146
<i>A plan was formed.</i>

810
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,690
<i>Not to kill it,</i>

811
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:07,650
<i>but to cage it.</i>

812
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,701
<i>They would use the shards
of its old bindings,</i>

813
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,037
<i>the only thing the Galloo feared,</i>

814
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,623
<i>to keep our people safe again.</i>

815
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,752
<i>The children circled the Western Wood,</i>

816
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,254
<i>which had been
the monster's hunting ground</i>

817
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,547
<i>for so long.</i>

818
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,343
<i>And they buried 13 sacred shards</i>

819
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,428
<i>deep into the earth.</i>

820
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,901
<i>Over each stone, they lit a fire</i>

821
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,236
<i>to mark its place,</i>

822
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:55,073
<i>a line the Galloo could not cross.</i>

823
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,830
<i>Our people made a sacred promise
to guard the pillars</i>

824
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,749
<i>and keep their places secret</i>

825
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,378
<i>so that the monster that's trapped inside</i>

826
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,547
<i>could never break free.</i>

827
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,509
<i>Our people would be safe,</i>

828
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:18,096
<i>and the Galloo would remain
within these pillars</i>

829
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,723
forever.

830
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,019
Well done, Taniel.

831
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,984
Now, you're a part of...

832
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:35,863
Auntie.

833
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:41,995
Are you okay?

834
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,586
Well done, Taniel.

835
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,504
Great story.

836
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,257
So, tell me, where are they now?

837
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,594
The pillars.

838
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,429
How do I find them?

839
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,308
You can tell me.

840
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,187
Come on.

841
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,381
Through there.

842
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,723
Follow the tunnels under the old well...

843
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,727
and you'll find the pillars.
