1
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:30,112
Gather around, little friends!
Gather around and feast your eyes

2
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:35,410
on the amazing Pennywise,
the Dancing Clown!

3
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,588
Lively crowd.

4
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,468
- I'll wager it's even bigger tonight.
- Oh, you'll wager now, would you?

5
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,847
No more hanging about
with the card sharps.

6
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,183
I wish you could hear the way
they talk about you, Papa.

7
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,853
Papa, you make them so happy.

8
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,188
Yes, that's something.

9
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,817
That's good. That's good.

10
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,154
Now, what are you doing
back there, pumpkin?

11
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,745
I've been working on my face.
I wanted to surprise you.

12
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,915
My beautiful girl! Look at you!

13
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,044
Show me the bow.

14
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,213
Ladies and gentlemen!

15
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,008
For your amusement,

16
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,802
the Santini Brothers' Carnival
proudly presents

17
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,015
the first father
and daughter act in its history,

18
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,978
the Pennywise and Periwinkle Show.

19
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,150
Periwinkle?

20
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,862
That was Mom's stage name.

21
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,034
Yeah. Well, you can change it if you like.

22
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,954
No. I love it.

23
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,376
- Good.
- Papa, do you ever miss the circus?

24
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,211
Sometimes.

25
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,590
I miss the big crowds. Sure.

26
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,218
The roars.

27
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,764
One day...

28
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,560
the big tent
will come a-callin' again. You'll see.

29
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,399
But, this time, my act will be different.

30
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,445
Something new.
Something no one's ever seen before.

31
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,533
You. Now, wouldn't that be something?

32
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,545
Gather around, friends. Gather around.

33
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,965
Pennywise the Dancing Clown Show
will be on again

34
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,093
in about half an hour,
you don't want to miss it.

35
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,678
Go grab your mothers and your brothers.

36
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,723
Go grab your granny
and join the grand skit.

37
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,624
Damn it! It's all coming off.
All coming off.

38
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,879
Shit. Shit. Shit.

39
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,310
Hello?

40
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,271
Who's there?

41
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,492
Hello there, little fella.

42
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,085
What are you looking at? Show's thataway.

43
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,129
Scram.

44
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,471
The children seem drawn to you.

45
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,268
That's a strange thing
for a young man to say.

46
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,695
I can't find my parents.

47
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,367
Me neither.

48
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,410
They're dead.

49
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,372
Will you help me find them?

50
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,415
No.

51
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,584
Can't you see I'm busy?

52
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,759
What was that?

53
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,928
That's my mother.

54
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,434
Have you seen my father?

55
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,187
- He's just gone?
- Let's just take it easy.

56
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,981
We don't know exactly what happened.

57
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,024
- Are you sure it's his?
- Jesus. Right there.

58
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,775
- Who could have done this?
- I don't know anything

59
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,569
- until we find some trace of him.
- No body?

60
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,738
- Oh my word.
- I got folks combing the woods,

61
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,823
but it’s more than likely
something dragged him off.

62
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,074
- Oh God.
- I have no idea.

63
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,243
Boss, boss.

64
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,297
Found it in the woods.

65
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,093
Wolves, maybe.

66
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,263
They roam these parts.

67
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,398
Papa! Papa!

68
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,533
Hey, Reg. We got trouble.

69
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,161
Good evening.

70
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,374
Excuse the interruption, folks.

71
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,087
Now...

72
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,092
I'm gonna make this real simple.

73
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,765
Give us what we want, and we go away.

74
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,690
Norma? Norma Price?

75
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,194
You should be ashamed.

76
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,198
Go home. Now!

77
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,575
Go on.

78
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,078
What do you want?

79
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,080
Hank Grogan.
We know he's hiding here somewhere.

80
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,332
You hand him over,
and you can get back to your party.

81
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,626
No, no, no.

82
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:02,006
Seem you fellas got some bad information.
See, this here, it's just a rec facility

83
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,343
for military personnel only.

84
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,097
Well, then you won't mind
if we have a quick look around?

85
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,183
- Say we do.
- We're not asking.

86
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,817
- Look, I'm here.
- Daddy, no!

87
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,527
- Baby girl. Baby.
- No! No!

88
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,655
Look, I don't want no bloodshed over me!

89
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,159
I'll go. Just leave
these good people alone.

90
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,537
You're doing the right thing.

91
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,331
I don't think so.

92
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,127
Now, there's no need
for this to get messy, son.

93
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,551
Now, would you look at that?
We got guns too.

94
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,177
Ours just happen to be government issue.

95
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,472
I suggest you fellas leave.

96
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,142
Ain't nobody getting strung up today.

97
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,169
Put 'em down, boys.
Put 'em down. Put 'em down.

98
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,466
He's right.

99
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,427
This isn't the way.

100
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,681
Everybody out. Come on.

101
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,653
What are we supposed to do with you now?
You know they're coming back.

102
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,323
We got a truck out back.
Get him there, sneak him out.

103
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,334
- Fuck. They chained it shut.
- Is there another way out?

104
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,668
Check the back. Check the back!

105
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,336
Women and kids
in the middle of the room now!

106
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,171
Hey, call the guys on base.
I'll check the phones.

107
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,382
No, phone's not working.
Something's wrong with it.

108
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,094
Stay calm. Stay calm.

109
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,179
- Stay alert. Stay alert.
- Take care of yourselves, fellas.

110
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,723
- Do it!
- Something's going on.

111
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,979
- Stay calm.
- Watch out!

112
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,861
Get 'em out! Get 'em out!

113
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,155
Go, go! Check the back. Check the back.

114
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,411
- Reggie, go, go, go, go!
- Let's go! Hurry, come on! Come on!

115
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,209
Come on! Hey! Door's shut too!

116
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,628
Shit!

117
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,636
Hey, yo. I need ammo. Ammo!

118
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,891
Get down!

119
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,062
- Get in here!
- Down!

120
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,733
Go! Go, go, go! Move!

121
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,319
Don't go that way. They're on both sides.

122
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:12,990
Fuck!

123
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,951
Get down! Get down!

124
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,121
- Ronnie!
- Daddy!

125
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,290
Will, get up. Are you okay?

126
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,292
- You okay?
- I can't see anything!

127
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,504
- Ronnie! Will!
- Ronnie!

128
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,466
Daddy?

129
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,267
Where's my dad?

130
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,355
Please! Where's my dad?

131
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,274
- Daddy!
- I got you!

132
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,693
Let go of me!

133
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,747
My arm!

134
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,166
Rich! It's hot!

135
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,416
Hold still!

136
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,712
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

137
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,994
Frankie! Frankie!

138
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,246
Frankie! Snap out of it!

139
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,373
Come on.

140
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,375
Come on.

141
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,380
You got it. Get back.

142
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,676
Shit.

143
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,402
Dad! Where's my dad?

144
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,469
Hey!

145
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,142
Over here! Hey!

146
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,197
No, no, no.

147
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,802
Noreen. Over here.

148
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,847
Take my hand.

149
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,892
I know a way out.

150
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,778
Daddy! Will!

151
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,622
What's the matter?

152
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,626
Do I have face on my face?

153
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,554
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

154
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,140
I got you. We're gonna get you out.

155
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,729
Hello, Dicky.

156
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,232
What's the matter?

157
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,734
Seeing things?

158
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,364
I think they see you too.

159
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,720
Where are the kids? Show me.

160
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,322
It's time to go.

161
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,326
Not until I know Grogan's dead.

162
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,121
No one's getting out of there alive.

163
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,334
He's right. They're cooked.

164
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,060
Come on. Get in, get in.

165
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,270
- Down here now. Go, go, go!
- Baby.

166
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,438
What about Rich and Marge?

167
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,023
- The roof's caving in, boy!
- I got 'em.

168
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,858
- I'm gonna get them. Go on ahead.
- No! No!

169
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,069
Stop! Stop! Goddammit, I'll find them.

170
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,196
Get!

171
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,324
Get in!

172
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,872
Kids! Kids! In here! Come this way! Come.

173
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,014
Okay, get in.

174
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,865
Marge, come help me.

175
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,034
Come on, help me.

176
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,622
Help me!

177
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,375
Let's get in here.

178
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,544
It's the only way
we're gonna make it out.

179
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,088
- It's too small.
- There's plenty of room.

180
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,215
The roof is gonna fall! Come on, Marge!

181
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,384
Okay, okay.

182
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,722
There's not enough room for both...

183
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,020
- No!
- Marge-- Marge, stop!

184
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,816
No, Rich! Please, no!

185
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,777
Let me out! Please!

186
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,279
Marge, listen to me!

187
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,738
Let me out!

188
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,284
- Marge!
- Let me out!

189
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,245
Remember what you said?

190
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,248
About knights?

191
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,588
- What?
- Knights.

192
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,882
Who sleep with something by the bed?

193
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,176
Yeah.

194
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,220
Well, we don't just pee in pots.

195
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,101
We also protect fair maidens.

196
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,397
Remember the day,

197
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,566
that day all the guinea pigs
got loose in the hallway

198
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:49,362
'cause Robbie Mueller,
he broke into the science lab?

199
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:54,242
That was my first week of school,
and everyone went out to see it.

200
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:59,289
You came out of class
with a yellow sweater and a gray skirt

201
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,042
with a string tied to your finger.

202
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,048
You remember that?

203
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,884
You were so pretty.

204
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,890
I remember wondering, <i>"¿Quién es esa?"</i>

205
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,393
And you saw me staring and you said,

206
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,063
"Take a picture, it'll last longer."

207
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:28,360
You didn't say it mean or anything.
I didn't even know what it meant.

208
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,531
Later when I figured it out,

209
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,784
I remember thinking
what I should have said back.

210
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,833
"I wish I could."

211
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,306
I love you, Rich.

212
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,232
I love you too, Marge.

213
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, come on. No, come on!

214
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,895
Guys, guys, wait!

215
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,024
Fuck.

216
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,740
No, no, no. No, not now. Not now! Fuck!

217
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,208
Come on. Come on.

218
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,306
Ingrid?

219
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,934
Hello, Stanley.

220
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,021
Is that you?

221
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,984
What are you doing?
What the hell are you wearing?

222
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,403
This is me, Stanley.

223
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,406
This is who I really am.

224
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,327
Black and blue is what you're gonna be
if you don't get back to the house

225
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,164
and wipe this ridiculous crap
off your face!

226
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,168
You hear me?

227
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,088
Hello, Papa.

228
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,757
What?

229
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,512
What the hell?

230
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,973
Who the hell are you--

231
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,508
I knew they would come
if they thought that he was here.

232
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:44,681
And there would be blood,
and-- and pain, and fear.

233
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,601
And I knew that you
wouldn't be able to resist it.

234
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,147
And you would come back.

235
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,233
And you would tell me that I was good.

236
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,078
Show me the bow.

237
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,904
Come to Papa.

238
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,203
Papa. Papa.

239
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,121
I love you.

240
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,296
You did good. You did very, very good.

241
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:03,968
Now, I'm going to sleep.

242
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,599
What?

243
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,644
Don't you worry.

244
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,479
I'll come back.

245
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,024
- No, no, no.
- I always do.

246
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,362
No. No, don't leave me. Please. No.

247
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,572
Don't abandon me.

248
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,964
You're not him.

249
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,762
Who are you?

250
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:53,017
Why, I'm Pennywise, your dancing daddy.

251
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,271
You are not my father.

252
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,608
- Yes, I am.
- What have you done with him?

253
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,490
I... I ate him.

254
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,414
But he still lives inside of me!

255
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,208
- No!
- Yes, he does!

256
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,336
Why, I... I can feel him right now, yes.

257
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,421
Stop.

258
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,048
- He's reaching out for his baby girl.
- Shut up!

259
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,302
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!

260
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,721
Stop it!

261
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,806
Shut up!

262
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,309
Come to Papa.

263
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,801
Help!

264
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,472
Help!

265
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,440
Hey, hey. Are you okay?

266
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,569
Come on, dear. Are you alright?

267
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,366
Come on, careful. Watch your step.

268
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,693
Wait, wait.

269
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,301
All right, I'm good. Go.

270
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,401
Will!

271
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,155
Son.

272
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,241
Oh my God.

273
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,869
Son.

274
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,496
Son, you could have
gotten yourself killed.

275
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,166
I know. I-- I'm sorry.

276
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,378
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

277
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,298
Mr. Hallorann, he got us out.

278
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,217
- Hallorann?
- Hanlon!

279
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,850
You all just hold tight.
I'll be right back, okay?

280
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,692
My dad. The woods.

281
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,278
Okay.

282
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,801
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just me. It's okay. It's all right.

283
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,179
- Leroy? Leroy?
- It's all right. Yeah. Yes.

284
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,890
You all right?

285
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,309
No. No.

286
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,604
I had to talk to one of 'em.

287
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,773
I had to.

288
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,150
The noise.

289
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,152
The noise.

290
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,949
The noise.

291
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,874
What's happening?

292
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,212
- It hurts like hell.
- Talking to you.

293
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,589
Look at our kind, brother.
What'd they do to us?

294
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,801
Gotta make it right.

295
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:43,928
Make it right--

296
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,981
- Dad.
- Baby.

297
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,068
We thought we should hide him
here just till you got here.

298
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,861
Are you hurt, Mr. Grogan?

299
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,406
No, I made it.

300
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,033
I'm just more worried
about the ones that didn't.

301
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,122
We gotta get him out of here.

302
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,540
- What if Dad sees?
- He knows.

303
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,750
Really?

304
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,463
Give me your clothes,
Mr. Grogan. If you don't mind.

305
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,716
Excuse me?

306
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,849
We need to help him.

307
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,228
We can help him
by getting his ass and ours back to base.

308
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,690
That... thing is still out here,

309
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,275
and I'm not inclined
to wait around to find--

310
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,194
It ain't here no more.

311
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,282
- What'd you say, Airman?
- Ain't here no more.

312
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,371
I could always feel it before,
but now it's like...

313
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,043
It's like a light went out. It's like...

314
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,964
Like this son of a bitch
just went to sleep.

315
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,218
Asleep or not,
the general's gonna wanna see us.

316
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,805
Seventeen dead airmen, more civilians,
not a goddamn clue where the pillars are.

317
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,891
- We are fucked, Major!
- Okay, Colonel. Okay.

318
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,435
No, no, maybe not.

319
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,689
I can help us find one of them pillars.

320
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,901
- What?
- Yeah.

321
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,445
How?

322
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,199
In that Indian kid's head, I saw it.

323
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,827
They put one of them pillars
where their war chief died.

324
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,122
I didn't know exactly where, but now...

325
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,043
Now we just gotta follow her.

326
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,713
Follow who?

327
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,549
Her...

328
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,070
What do we do about Hank?

329
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,697
I don't know, babe.
I'll think of something.

330
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,699
But for now, maybe you should
take him back to the house.

331
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,076
- Our house?
- Yes.

332
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,369
- Derry?
- Yes.

333
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,703
No one's going to look for him there.

334
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,539
- That thing--
- Dick seems to think

335
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,334
that this thing is asleep,
or hibernating, or something.

336
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,336
- Hibernating?
- Whatever the reason.

337
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,214
- Leroy, whoever did this needs to pay.
- That's not our job though, Charlotte.

338
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,507
How are you so calm?

339
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,758
- It's not our job.
- People died.

340
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,803
- Other than protect-- All we can do--
- Our son saw dead bodies, Leroy.

341
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,139
After this mission,

342
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,308
this place, all of this, it's done.

343
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,102
And we take our family

344
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,688
and get out of this town to safety.

345
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,151
The worst of all this shit is behind us.

346
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,778
I promise you.

347
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,366
<i>Good morning, Derry.</i>

348
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,911
<i>It's 7:15 a.m. and this is
the news you can use.</i>

349
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,413
<i>Reports have begun filing in</i>

350
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,707
<i>about an electrical fire
that broke out overnight</i>

351
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,126
<i>at what fire department
spokesman Bob McCormick</i>

352
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,045
<i>described as
"an illegal colored speakeasy"</i>

353
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,630
<i>on the outskirts of town.</i>

354
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,924
<i>The blaze claimed scores of lives.</i>

355
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,343
<i>Among them,
the Negro patrons responsible...</i>

356
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,970
Lilly, you've barely touched
your breakfast.

357
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,388
<i>...along with several citizens</i>

358
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,557
<i>who showed up
to help treat the wounded.</i>

359
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,519
<i>Including beloved
local butcher Stanley Kersh.</i>

360
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,772
<i>Derry police also reported
including amongst the remains</i>

361
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,691
<i>the charred body of notorious</i>

362
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,904
<i>fugitive child killer Hank Grogan.</i>

363
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:34,825
<i>Way to go, boys in blue.
And rest in peace, Stanley.</i>

364
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:38,496
<i>No one could filet
a tenderloin quite like you.</i>

365
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,665
<i>Now here's Frank with the weather.</i>

366
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,006
<i>The Augury has passed.</i>

367
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,010
Its feeding cycle is complete.

368
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,931
It sleeps.

369
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,892
How many died at the Black Spot?

370
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:05,356
Reports are still coming in,
but according to the coroner, 23.

371
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:10,694
And how many children
for the-- for the full cycle?

372
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:15,533
Seventeen. Seventeen young souls.

373
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,077
All those people.

374
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,288
And not a damn thing we can do
about it but watch.

375
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,083
It feels wrong.

376
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:29,088
We do as much as we can
for as many as we can.

377
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,174
Focus on the lives saved.

378
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:38,472
The ones protected because we
keep this thing in its cage.

379
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,525
Well...

380
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,863
See you shit-asses in 27 years.

381
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,831
Don't worry about him. I know.

382
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,623
- Where are we?
- Been at it since 0700 hours, sir.

383
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,166
If it's down there, we'll know soon.

384
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,877
- Where's Hallorann?
- In the tent.

385
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,595
- How are you holding up, Airman?
- The fuck it look like?

386
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,515
Sorry, sir. It's just...

387
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,143
the noise, sir. I'm sorry.

388
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,397
Why don't you head back to base, Airman?
Get some rest.

389
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,318
You did good.

390
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,172
So this friend of yours,
you really think she'll help us?

391
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,510
If anyone can get you
and your family outside Derry,

392
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,762
it's her. Trust me.

393
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,389
This is going to work.

394
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,140
Assuming someone will pick up the phone.

395
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,102
Come on, girl. Come on.

396
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,440
We'll just head there.

397
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,361
- You're not coming.
- No, I was gonna go to Lilly's

398
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,613
with Ronnie and Marge.

399
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,492
We thought it'd be better
if she heard it from us about Rich.

400
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,202
I don't think so, baby.

401
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,704
But Dad said the thing was asleep.

402
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,832
It wasn't that thing
that lit the fire last night.

403
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,667
This town is the monster!
You're not going anywhere!

404
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,294
And neither is Ronnie.

405
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,172
You sure this is necessary?

406
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,091
Unless you want my neighbors wondering

407
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,176
what a dead man's doing
walking down my driveway.

408
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,721
I mean, you think they'll notice?

409
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,013
I don't exactly look like Mr. Hanlon.

410
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,474
In this town?

411
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,477
Yeah, point taken.

412
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,274
Let's go. You stay.
I'll be back in an hour.

413
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,157
Lilly, sweetheart. You have guests.

414
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,288
Hey.

415
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,336
We needed to talk.

416
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,465
Last night, something happened.

417
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,718
We ended up heading
to the Black Spot without you.

418
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:46,804
The fire.

419
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,264
I heard about it on the news.

420
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,809
Are you--

421
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,563
- Is your dad--
- He's fine.

422
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,816
We're fine.

423
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,568
Will is okay. It's ju--

424
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,496
Where's Rich?

425
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,793
What?

426
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,129
No.

427
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,514
You okay?

428
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,027
He never did get one all the way
to Main Street, did he?

429
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,185
Found something!

430
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,132
Goddamn. Hallorann was right.

431
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,412
You can stand down, Major.

432
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,582
Stand down?

433
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,378
Colonel, we have orders
to take the pillar three clicks north.

434
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,088
Change of plan.
Pillar's going back to base

435
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,381
- for further testing.
- Wait.

436
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:14,094
The plan has always been to move inward.
Toward the center of Derry.

437
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,180
No, we pen this thing
one pillar at a time.

438
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,226
What you're suggesting,
it's like leaving the cage door open.

439
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,479
You heard Hallorann. The entity is asleep.

440
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,107
Now we can analyze the pillar's
physical properties.

441
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,192
See if Dick or the eggheads
can't use that data

442
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,029
to find the other 12 pillars even faster.

443
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,158
Relax, Major. We're in the homestretch.

444
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:37,826
You done good.

445
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,825
Charlotte?

446
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,286
You said if I ever needed a friend...

447
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,712
Why don't you two come inside?

448
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:39,929
Hank.

449
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,056
Rose.

450
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,065
The good news is the heat'll be off.

451
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,734
They already think Hank's dead.

452
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,654
I got friends in McGill up in Montreal.

453
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:59,366
They can get the Grogans set up
with fresh papers, all of that.

454
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,244
- What's the bad news?
- Gotta get him across the border.

455
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,704
Last I checked,
customs ain't all accommodating

456
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,457
to... dead people.

457
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,211
Just a line on a map.

458
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,296
Right?

459
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,006
Auntie!

460
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,843
We might have a problem.

461
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,372
Begin incinerator process.

462
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,127
Hold it right there!

463
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,506
Shut it down!

464
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,177
Shut it down! Now!

465
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,144
Take it out.

466
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,063
Take it out of there!

467
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,362
What the hell do you think you're doing?

468
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,489
You said we were just studying
the physical properties.

469
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,242
Orders are orders, Major.

470
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,292
<i>Leroy.</i>

471
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,756
<i>Put the damn gun down.</i>

472
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,177
<i>Weapons down. All of you.</i>

473
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,679
<i>Now!</i>

474
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,643
<i>A word, please, Major?</i>

475
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,946
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner, Major,
but OPSEC comes first.

476
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,197
You were on a need-to-know basis.

477
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,534
This isn't even about Russia, is it?

478
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,626
The greatest threat to this nation
is not from without, Major.

479
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,753
It's from within.

480
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,840
You see what's happening out there, Leroy?

481
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,677
Americans are at each other's throats,
and it's only getting worse.

482
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,764
Anti-nuke crazies,
the women's movement, race riots.

483
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,017
This country is slowly fracturing

484
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,520
into a thousand jagged,
ill-fitting pieces.

485
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:20,108
I am only trying to prevent
another civil war.

486
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,069
Americans have stopped
hearing one another.

487
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,238
They only want to fight
over who gets which piece of the damn pie

488
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,324
while the rest of the world eats us alive.

489
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,536
And the one thing
that makes people really listen is fear.

490
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,413
Listen? Or you mean obey?

491
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:38,335
I mean a nation of laws requires a system
where people actually follow them.

492
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,546
Anything else is anarchy.
You know that, Major.

493
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,007
You never planned to cage it.

494
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,551
You were always planning to free it,

495
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,720
to release it
in your own fucking backyard!

496
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,557
Look at this town.
What happened last night?

497
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,018
Horrific. But guess what?

498
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,728
The streets are calm today.

499
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,607
No rioting, no looting, no unrest.

500
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,193
The fear.

501
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,863
It settles on every living person
it touches like a fog,

502
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,031
like a goddamned anesthetic.

503
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,866
So you want to make America Derry?

504
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,368
At what cost?

505
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,119
How many dead fucking kids
along the way?

506
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,039
Fewer than die in car accidents
every single year!

507
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,000
We're soldiers, Major!
We accept collateral damage.

508
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,752
You are fucking insane.

509
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,379
And that's exactly what the IG officers

510
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,839
at DOD will say when I tell them
about this shit.

511
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,968
You'd be shutting the barn door
after the horse is already out.

512
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,762
Finish it.

513
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,643
Rescind the order.

514
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,561
Do it!

515
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,816
Put it down, Hanlon.

516
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,337
You may not realize it yet, Major,

517
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,756
but the actions you've taken today

518
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,759
may very well save this country.

519
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,054
You wanted to be a hero.

520
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,806
You did it, son.

521
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,142
Now go back to your quarters.

522
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,361
Make sure that man
does not leave this base.

523
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,947
Yes, sir, General.

524
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,188
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's Ron.</i>

525
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,816
Ron, I'm sorry.
My mom wouldn't let me out.

526
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,442
<i>It's okay.</i>

527
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,319
<i>We all went over to the Standpipe,</i>

528
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,364
<i>just to get Rich's stuff and...</i>

529
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,159
Hey, Ro-- Ron, it's okay.

530
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,911
- It's--
<i>- No, it's not.</i>

531
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,538
<i>Nothing is okay.</i>

532
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,541
I know.

533
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,668
I'm sorry.

534
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,297
<i>I just can't get over
the fact that he's gone.</i>

535
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,218
<i>That he died like that. The way he looked.</i>

536
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,137
<i>The way he must have suffocated.</i>

537
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,723
<i>Lungs bursting like popcorn.</i>

538
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,309
<i>Making my mouth water.</i>

539
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,645
What?

540
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:30,900
<i>I can smell
his stinky, little, broken boy body.</i>

541
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,069
<i>Can't you?</i>

542
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,029
Shut up.

543
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,823
- Shut up!
<i>- I can't hear you.</i>

544
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,200
I know who this is!

545
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,327
- You're not gonna scare me!
<i>- Speak up, Willy boy!</i>

546
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,329
- You hear that?
<i>- I can't hear you!</i>

547
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,789
I'm done being scared!

548
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,458
I can't hear you!
