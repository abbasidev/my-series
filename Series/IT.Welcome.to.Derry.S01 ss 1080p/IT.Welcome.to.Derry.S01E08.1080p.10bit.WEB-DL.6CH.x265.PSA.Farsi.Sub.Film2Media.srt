1
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,892
My word! What is going on out there?

2
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,504
<i>Good afternoon, students.</i>

3
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,131
<i>Classes have been canceled
for the rest of the day.</i>

4
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,592
<i>Upperclassmen are excused,
but all other students,</i>

5
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,055
<i>please report to the auditorium
for an all-school assembly.</i>

6
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,938
Who do you think
would have the ugliest baby?

7
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,398
Burt the Turtle and Teddy Yurin.

8
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,442
What about Lilly Bainbridge
and that Matty guy?

9
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,277
That's so gross.

10
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,739
My parents...

11
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,121
Where are all the teachers?

12
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,883
Settle down, students. Settle down.

13
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,261
We have a special treat today

14
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,473
designed to entertain and delight.

15
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:26,020
Please allow me to introduce
the one and only...

16
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,149
Pennywise the Dancing Clown!

17
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,860
Hiya, kiddos!

18
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,119
Ta-da!

19
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,138
<i>When I close my eyes</i>

20
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,433
<i>And I dream of you</i>

21
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:08,562
<i>I see your pretty faces
And I taste them too</i>

22
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,064
<i>But my, oh my</i>

23
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,152
<i>How I wish to cry</i>

24
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,821
<i>Every time we say</i>

25
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:24,454
<i>Goodbye!</i>

26
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,095
Guys.

27
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,292
Guys.

28
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,518
Shit.

29
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,229
It's all the kids from school.

30
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,107
It's messing with us, right?

31
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,983
It can't have taken all of them.

32
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,902
Only one way to find out.

33
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,029
Let's go.

34
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,677
Who is that?

35
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,096
I don't wanna know.

36
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,477
They're gone!

37
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,438
Everyone. Everyone-- Everyone's gone exc--

38
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,398
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

39
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,734
It's Dunleavy. No, no.
That's Principal Dunleavy.

40
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,944
- Uh-huh.
- Wh... why?

41
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,196
Wait.

42
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,408
How can it have taken all of them? How?

43
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,540
Guys.

44
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,335
No. No, no.

45
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,545
It-- It took Will.

46
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,089
Took him? Took him where?

47
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,968
Probably wherever that leads.

48
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,094
So what do we do?

49
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,846
We have to follow the trail,

50
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,557
and we can use the dagger thing
to protect ourselves.

51
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,685
I mean, we have to try
and save our friend.

52
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,563
I wanna kill that fucking clown.

53
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,482
Let's go.

54
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,071
Go!

55
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,158
Stop squirming.

56
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,326
I'm falling.

57
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,037
You weren't falling on the way over!

58
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,164
Guys, we're never gonna
catch up to them at this rate.

59
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,959
Do you have a better idea?

60
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,962
Oh, shit!

61
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,756
Oh, the milkman.

62
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,435
What are you doing?

63
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,606
You don't know how to drive!

64
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,775
Neither do you. I mean, do you?

65
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,902
No. But you've only got one eye.

66
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,737
It's fine. My uncle Mike has a truck.

67
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,322
And he let you drive it?

68
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,408
No.

69
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,618
But I watched him.

70
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,393
Come on, son. Pick up, please.

71
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,188
Pick up the fucking phone.

72
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,441
Pick up, Will. Come on.

73
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,863
Shit.

74
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,912
Hello? Will?

75
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,207
Will?

76
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,547
Who is this?

77
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,552
<i>What scares the man without fear?</i>

78
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,639
- You.
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

79
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,599
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

80
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,726
<i>Us.</i>

81
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,354
<i>Where am I? Hello?</i>

82
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,230
<i>- Anybody?</i>
- Will.

83
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,483
Will, I'm here, son. Will, I'm here.

84
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,902
<i>Hello? Please, I'm scared.</i>

85
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,111
<i>Oh, yes. You are.</i>

86
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,863
Will, don't be scared. Listen, I'm here.

87
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,282
You just need to tell me where you are.
Okay, son?

88
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,368
Tell me--

89
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,078
Hello?

90
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,246
Will!

91
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,833
- Will!
<i>- Back in the wagon for Willie boy!</i>

92
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,919
<i>Gotta keep him nice and fresh.</i>

93
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,130
- Listen, please.
<i>- The dark meat tastes twice as sweet!</i>

94
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,299
Don't put your hands on my son!

95
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,429
Don't touch my son, you hear me?
I'll rip your fucking heart out!

96
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,139
Don't touch my s--

97
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,225
Hello?

98
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,268
Will!

99
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,349
Leave me alone.

100
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,233
Dick! Dick, open up!

101
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,570
Dick!

102
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,782
- Dick!
- Shut up.

103
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,201
<i>Do it, Dick!</i>

104
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,081
- Dick, open up. I can hear you.
<i>- Do it!</i>

105
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,084
This is your last chance!

106
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,211
<i>Join us!</i>

107
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,922
<i>- Do it!
- Do it!</i>

108
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,883
I am coming in!

109
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,261
No. No, don't.

110
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,305
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

111
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,682
What the hell is going on?

112
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,059
- Dick, what are you doing?
- I can't take it no more.

113
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,936
Okay, but listen to me, brother.

114
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,063
They won't...

115
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,191
shut up.

116
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,485
Shut up.

117
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,112
Shut up!

118
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,699
You shut up. Shut up.

119
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,576
Dick, we don't have time
for this, brother.

120
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,661
- Dick, I need you.
- Back up!

121
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,622
- Easy, brother.
- No!

122
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,792
- Easy.
- You did this.

123
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,003
You did it.

124
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,214
- I'm sorry.
- You got my mind all fucked up.

125
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,216
I'm sorry. I just--
I need you to listen to me.

126
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,301
And now...

127
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,011
- there ain't no other way, brother.
- I need you to listen to me.

128
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,596
There ain't no other way.

129
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,682
Dick, please! Please, it's got Will!

130
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,060
It's got Will!

131
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,855
It's got my boy, and I don't know where.

132
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,774
I don't know where he is.

133
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,612
So I'm-- I'm ask-- I'm begging you.

134
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,323
I'm begging you
to please help me find him,

135
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,784
and I swear on my life

136
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,037
that I will do everything in my power--

137
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,206
I will do everything in my-- Look at me!

138
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,126
I'll do everything in my power
to help you.

139
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,338
I promise you
I'll pull the trigger myself.

140
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,884
Please, just...

141
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,265
help me find my baby, please.

142
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,603
Help me find my baby, please.

143
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,985
General, I just received word
that Major Hanlon has gone AWOL.

144
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,696
Forced his way through the guard gate.

145
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,448
We don't need him anymore.

146
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,951
There's nothing he can do to stop us now.

147
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,788
Apparently, there was another airman
with him in the car.

148
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,665
Hallorann.

149
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,224
- Come on, Dick. Come on.
- Cold.

150
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,311
- I know. Come on.
- It's too cold here.

151
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,688
- Come on.
- It's too cold.

152
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,572
What? What?

153
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,449
You said we'd be safe here!

154
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,326
You said we'd be safe here.

155
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,787
- You said--
- I'm sorry.

156
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,206
- You lied to me, Leroy. You're a liar!
- I know.

157
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,875
I'mma get him-- I know. I'm sorry.

158
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,668
- But, Charlotte, listen to me.
- I can't take this.

159
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,461
- I'm gonna get him back.
- I'll call you back, John.

160
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,630
- Bullshit!
- I swear to God, I will get Will back.

161
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,298
- I will get Will back.
- My baby.

162
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,342
Dick-- Dick is gonna help us.

163
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,428
How is he gonna help us?
How are you gonna help us?

164
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,682
- How are you gonna help us?
- Listen, listen to me. Listen.

165
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,393
He said that the bond
between mother and son

166
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,229
is the strongest in this world.
The strongest.

167
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,481
So if you can just-- just connect,

168
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,024
just-- just connect for a second.

169
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,151
It won't matter.

170
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,445
Excuse me?

171
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,073
Even if he locates your son,

172
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,409
you won't stand a chance
against this creature.

173
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,996
- You do realize that.
- What are we supposed to do?

174
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,998
Just give up on our boy?

175
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,749
Of course not.

176
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,505
But if Mr. Hallorann...

177
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,549
could do for us
what he did for your general,

178
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,177
there may be a way to stop this thing
and save your son.

179
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,471
How?

180
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,601
By using his ability
to find one last artifact.

181
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,147
The dagger.

182
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,108
What dagger?

183
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,611
So if this dagger
is made of the same rock,

184
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,990
we can use it to replace a pillar
and re-lock the cage.

185
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,577
Exactly. And, hopefully, save your son.

186
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:21,123
If Mr. Hallorann can find it
before the creature reaches this point.

187
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,252
On the southern bank of the river,
there's a great pine.

188
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,131
<i>A deadwood that has stood there
since before even our ancestors.</i>

189
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,674
It's the furthest point

190
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,678
that the dagger's energy can still
connect with the other pillars...

191
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,680
- and restore the cage.
- Yeah, that's the southern bank.

192
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,183
That's the shortest route
across the river,

193
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,892
probably where that thing
will try to cross it.

194
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,437
How do we connect the dagger's energy
to the other pillars?

195
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,148
The earth is a conductor.

196
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,902
The dagger needs to be buried
just as the other pillars were.

197
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,654
It's our only hope.

198
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,865
You're a bunch of goddamn fools.

199
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,203
I can barely hear myself think.

200
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,581
And now y'all expecting me
to find your little dagger?

201
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,508
I can help you quiet the voices
in your head, Mr. Hallorann.

202
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,469
But you're going to have to trust me.

203
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,388
How?

204
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,322
You need to be connected
to the dagger's energy.

205
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,075
This is made from Maturin root.

206
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,203
It will connect you to all things
in the realm this evil came from.

207
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,082
But not all things there are evil.

208
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,377
This tea is gonna shut
all these voices up?

209
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,798
When one door in the mind opens,
another must close.

210
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,932
How long is it gonna take?

211
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,600
Not long.

212
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,061
Remember this.

213
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,606
Whatever you do, do not go...

214
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,849
You have to drive faster, Marge.

215
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,059
It's a fucking milk truck.
I'm going as fast as I can.

216
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,352
Well, step on it, okay?

217
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,771
- I'm trying!
- We have to catch up to it or we may be--

218
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,107
Pothole!

219
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,956
Are you guys okay?

220
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,666
Marge, what the hell?

221
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,837
That wasn't a one-eye thing.
It was a pothole thing.

222
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,179
What's wrong?

223
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,847
Oh, jeepers, Lilly,
you have blood on your face.

224
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,017
- Are you okay?
- The dagger, where is it?

225
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,227
We have to find it. We have to.

226
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,188
We will. It's got to be here somewhere.

227
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,733
There it is!

228
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,194
No! No, don't touch it!

229
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,737
I can get it myself.

230
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,988
Why are you snapping at her like--

231
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,282
Just shut up, Ronnie.

232
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,284
Just stop.

233
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,247
Guys, we don't have time.
We have to keep going.

234
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,098
- Stay with it, Mr. Hallorann.
- Hey.

235
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,725
- Stay with it.
- Ah! The dagger!

236
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,893
I see it.

237
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,353
Where? Where is it?

238
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,980
Will's friends. Will's friends.

239
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,940
- What? Ronnie?
- The girls.

240
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,275
They-- They have it.

241
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,320
- Ronnie, my ba-- My baby, Ronnie?
- They're fighting over it.

242
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,657
They're going after--

243
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,992
They're going after Will.

244
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,328
He'll help us find him,
but we've gotta go now!

245
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,876
Okay.

246
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,550
Let's go.

247
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,769
I can't see too good.

248
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,230
Are you sure we're going the right way?

249
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,191
We're getting closer.

250
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,777
I don't understand.
If the dagger's power is real,

251
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,238
why wouldn't my daughter
and her friends be safe?

252
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:08,118
The dagger is a lost fragment
of the comet that this thing arrived on,

253
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,330
taken from where it crashed down
beneath Neibolt House.

254
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,875
Like all lost things,
it just wants to go home.

255
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,919
The further you take it
from where it belongs,

256
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,048
the more damage it does to your mind.

257
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,258
It drives you insane.

258
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,093
The dagger will resist.

259
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:31,099
It will fight back with a force
that you cannot imagine.

260
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,536
Something's wrong with that thing.

261
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,792
Why are you looking at me like that?

262
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,171
- We're not looking at you any--
- Yes, you are.

263
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,923
You're looking at me
like you think I'm crazy.

264
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,135
Lilly, why don't you
just give us the dagger?

265
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,720
Just for a little bit.

266
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,556
You never trusted me, did you?

267
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,892
You just used me!

268
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,435
You used me to save your stupid dad!

269
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,104
- Hey!
- And you used me 'cause you lost

270
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,190
all your other stupid friends!

271
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,168
I have to go back!

272
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,379
I'm gonna get us all killed,
don't you get it?

273
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,964
Ronnie was right about me!

274
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,299
No, I wasn't!

275
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,969
Lilly! Please, stop it!

276
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,680
This thing is making you think
these things!

277
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,558
I'm gonna drag you all under,
don't you see?

278
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,769
- I am!
- No, you're not! Lilly!

279
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,981
This is not you! Listen to me, okay?

280
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,776
You are a goddamn lifeboat!

281
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,928
Ron, Marge, I'm--

282
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,140
I'm so sorry.

283
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,270
Don't be. It wasn't really you.

284
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,901
We trade off who holds
this thing as we go.

285
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,652
Okay?

286
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,580
Oh, what the fu--

287
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,177
Guys?

288
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,906
Look.

289
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,744
You think Will is in there?

290
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,121
Let's find out.

291
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,716
- Jesus!
- What's wrong?

292
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,720
All of those kids... floating on ice.

293
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,806
Ice?

294
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,099
The kids?

295
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,851
Oh my God, it's already on the river.

296
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,436
We're not gonna make it.

297
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,522
We won't get to the kids in time.

298
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,774
Not before it passes the deadwood.

299
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,569
I see it. I can see it...

300
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,862
the clown.

301
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,156
We can slow it down.

302
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,742
Uh, how are we gonna do that?

303
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,453
Dick has gotten
into this thing's head before.

304
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,746
In the helicopter.

305
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,207
Dick. Dick.

306
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,044
Can you do it again? Can you try? Dick!

307
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,449
There he is! Will!

308
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,910
Oh, Will! Oh, Will!

309
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,872
Please, Will!

310
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,125
Will! Will!

311
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,045
Try to pull him down.

312
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:28,938
Look who decided to join the circus!

313
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,778
The fool!

314
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,863
The freak!

315
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,908
The failure!

316
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,038
But who is who?

317
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,040
It doesn't matter.

318
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,543
There's a spot for you all!

319
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,443
Where is he?

320
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,324
Where is he?

321
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,049
- Lilly, no! Stay close!
- Where did she go?

322
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,812
Oh, I've always wondered how you'd taste,

323
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,690
Margaret Tozier.

324
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,652
Tozier?

325
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,696
Oh, but not yet.

326
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,990
You're not Tozier yet.

327
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,909
First comes love,

328
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,953
then comes marriage,

329
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:12,000
then comes Richie in the baby carriage!

330
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,044
Unless...

331
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,880
Unless he dies with you!

332
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,883
I don't know what you're talking about!

333
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,013
{\an8}Your son!

334
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,851
{\an8}Don't you recognize your little boy?

335
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,730
The seed of your stinking loins

336
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:39,652
and his filthy friends bring me my death!

337
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,073
Or is it birth?

338
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,492
I get confused.

339
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,410
Tomorrow? Yesterday?

340
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,706
It's all the same for little Pennywise.

341
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,836
But it's not always easy. No.

342
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:02,550
Being caged up in one place, one time.

343
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,929
They can't fence me in.

344
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,639
Not them!

345
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,475
And not you.

346
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,271
Beep-beep, Margie.

347
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,581
Marge!

348
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,254
- What happened?
- I don't know.

349
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,177
Will! Will!

350
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,471
You're alive!

351
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,473
What happened?

352
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:57,896
Ice?

353
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,732
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

354
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,244
Will!

355
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,370
- Dad? Dad!
- Son!

356
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,454
- Ronnie!
- Son!

357
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,539
- Dad!
- You're okay.

358
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,999
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Are you okay?

359
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,542
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

360
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,210
It's okay. Go over there
with your mother, okay?

361
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,420
- Go. Let's go. Go, go.
- Mom's here?

362
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,005
The clown, it's here,
and it almost ate Marge!

363
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,424
Okay, calm down. Let's get to the van.
Let's get to the van. Come on.

364
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,843
Where's the dagger? Where's the dagger?

365
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,343
- It's here!
- Go, go, go!

366
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,512
To the north shore! Let's go!

367
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,722
Wake up! Wake up! To the north shore!

368
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,891
Oh, baby!

369
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,024
Deadwood's that way, yeah?

370
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,692
On the south bank.

371
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,319
Rose said the dagger's gonna
try to resist.

372
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,613
We're going together.

373
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,687
- No!
- Dad!

374
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,022
- Dad!
- Will!

375
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,107
Come-- Come back!

376
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,278
Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie!

377
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,740
Oh, shit! Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh--

378
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,326
Rose!

379
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,935
Okay. Be still.

380
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,063
Tan-- Taniel. Look at me. Still. Still.

381
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,607
Breathe. Breathe.

382
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,316
Taniel.

383
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,444
Taniel? Taniel?

384
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,655
Sh-- Fuck.

385
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,324
Dad! Dad!

386
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,204
I'm okay. I'm okay.

387
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,414
- But why--
- Listen. Listen.

388
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,999
- You take this dagger.
- What?

389
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,375
You take it. You take it.

390
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,254
And you hide in the fog,
and you use it for cover.

391
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,380
Take the dagger. Take it to that tree.

392
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,257
And you bury it deep in the base.

393
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,718
Secure Major Hanlon.

394
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,595
And don't let Hallorann get away.

395
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,892
And that thing, it goes to sleep,

396
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,602
and all of this stops. You understand me?

397
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,937
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

398
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,648
- No.
- Why not?

399
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,900
I'm scared.

400
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,447
I'm not you.

401
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,575
Listen. You don't have to be.
You understand?

402
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,036
You don't have to be me,
and I don't want you to be.

403
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,329
You just be you.

404
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,331
You hear me?

405
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,333
I love you, son.

406
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,294
I love you.

407
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,925
Go, son. Go. Go. Go!

408
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,677
Come on. Let's go.

409
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,897
Go get Hallorann.

410
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,762
<i>Bob! Bob!</i>

411
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,556
<i>Bob!</i>

412
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,853
Bob!

413
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,022
Bob!

414
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,608
Are you okay, friend?

415
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,944
Papa, Papa, you're all right.

416
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,033
Where am I?

417
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,742
What is this?

418
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,912
You need to lay off the spirits, Robert.

419
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,413
I found you out yonder in a ditch.

420
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,542
You look like you took a nasty fall.

421
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,086
I'm not Bob Gray.

422
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,922
Well, who else might you be,
then? Peter Rabbit?

423
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,134
- Don't you dare speak to me that way!
- Daddy!

424
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,972
I am a god! An eater of worlds!

425
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:47,269
Must have hit your head a little harder
than you thought there, didn't you, Bob?

426
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,272
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

427
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,942
Did they see us?

428
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,277
I don't know, but where the hell are we?

429
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,653
I can't see a goddamn thing.

430
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,280
I thought they're supposed
to be the good guys.

431
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,948
Why would they kill that man?

432
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:03,493
Guys, it's okay.
All right, just stay calm.

433
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,328
We just gotta come
from the far side of the tree

434
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,956
so those guys don't spot us first.

435
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,093
I wanna know what the hell
you think you're doing out here.

436
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,096
The kids, where are they headed?

437
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,931
Answer me, Major!

438
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,476
If you don't talk to me,
you're in a world of hurt, son.

439
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,913
There it is. That's the tree.

440
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,748
Let's go.

441
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,348
- I can't do this.
- What?

442
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,059
What are you talking about?

443
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,269
It won't let me.

444
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,480
It's the dagger.

445
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,234
No! No, Will!

446
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,818
- Stop!
- It wants to go home!

447
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,071
- I have to bring it home!
- Don't listen to it!

448
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,697
You have to let it go!

449
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,367
Please, just give it to us!

450
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,059
Just give it to us!

451
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,811
Just-- Just let us help you, Will.

452
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,563
- We can end this.
- We can end it together!

453
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,857
Help me turn around.

454
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,868
All these years,
wondering if you were real,

455
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,788
or just a little boy's nightmare.

456
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,332
Look at you.

457
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,084
You're both.

458
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,962
I don't know if you can hear me in there.

459
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,006
But whatever Hallorann's done to you,

460
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,216
we're gonna fix it.

461
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,428
Show me your hands!

462
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,764
No! Wait!

463
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,160
Tricky, tricky...

464
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,536
Dicky!

465
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,164
Who's Dicky, Bob?

466
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,127
I'm not...

467
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,254
Bob!

468
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,678
Tricky Dicky, Dicky.

469
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,848
Hey! Hey!

470
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,600
- Move!
- No...

471
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,436
No!

472
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,229
On your knees!

473
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,195
I tried, man. I tried.

474
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,702
It's okay. You're free.

475
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,581
You're free to go.

476
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,389
I know you.

477
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,603
I never forget a smell.

478
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,065
Stop. What are you doing?

479
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,619
- Now you see it!
- Stay back!

480
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,162
You stay back!

481
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,707
Or, goddammit, I will teach you a--

482
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,130
See to the General.

483
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,655
Colonel, you have to stop that thing!

484
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,075
If it gets past that tree,
we're all fucked!

485
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,119
Listen to me! Please!

486
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,748
This man is a traitor. Ignore him, airmen.

487
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,113
Drop it!

488
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,593
Don't be scared! Keep going!

489
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,178
Hey! You!

490
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,556
Having a little bit of trouble, are we?

491
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,725
Keep tugging that thing
and it just might pop!

492
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,979
So long, losers!

493
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,549
Fuck!

494
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,099
Oh, fuck!

495
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,018
Lee!

496
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,290
Uh-oh!

497
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,507
Leroy!

498
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,985
Come on, Ronnie! Ronnie, you can do this!

499
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,181
What do you see?

500
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,309
A motherfucking miracle.

501
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,735
Will!

502
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,404
Keep going! It's working!

503
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,908
Ronnie! Ron--

504
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,244
Oh! Oh, shit!

505
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,635
No!

506
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,502
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

507
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,108
Lively crowd.

508
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,594
I thought I was-- Will! Where's Will?

509
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,805
- He's okay.
- He's okay. Oh, shit.

510
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,558
Shit. He's okay.

511
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,227
It's gone.

512
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,690
At the end there...

513
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:09,947
was that just me,
or did you fe-- feel something?

514
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,825
Like another pair of hands.

515
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,454
Rich.

516
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,127
I felt him too.

517
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,173
We did it.

518
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,635
Ronnie! Baby!

519
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,678
- Ronnie!
- Daddy!

520
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,180
- Will!
- Mom!

521
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:36,848
Will!

522
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,809
Come here, baby.

523
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,942
Hi, everybody.

524
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:34,239
I only knew Rich for about a month.

525
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:36,992
I know what you're thinking.

526
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,537
How well can you know
anyone in a month?

527
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,539
If you weren't good friends,

528
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,917
why are you even speaking at his funeral?

529
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,586
But maybe

530
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:53,800
there aren't such things as...
good friends or bad friends.

531
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,221
Maybe there are just friends.

532
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:03,643
People who stand by us when we're hurt,

533
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,814
and who help us not feel so lonely.

534
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:14,029
Maybe friends like those
are always worth being scared for...

535
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,408
and hoping for, and living for.

536
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:24,998
Maybe worth dying for, too...

537
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,627
if that's what has to be.

538
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,215
Rich taught me that too.

539
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,093
No good friends,

540
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,178
no bad friends.

541
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,889
Only people

542
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,141
we want to be with...

543
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,937
need to be with.

544
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:57,030
People who build their houses
in your heart.

545
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,382
Thank you for those kind words.

546
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,259
And thank you, everyone, for coming

547
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,054
to honor the memory of Ricardo Santos.

548
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,765
God bless you. Go in peace.

549
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,558
The hand you feel on your shoulders...

550
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,313
Your boy's there.

551
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,609
He always will be.

552
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,455
Who are you, sir?

553
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,501
I'm still working on that.

554
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,410
Hey, Dad.

555
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,415
Sorry, I haven't been around much.

556
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,878
I just didn't know what to say.

557
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,424
I'm better now.

558
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,970
{\an8}So much has happened.

559
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,098
{\an8}But the good news is...

560
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,185
I made some new friends.

561
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,121
{\an8}It looks so peaceful from up here.

562
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,875
{\an8}Almost like... nothing ever happened.

563
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,212
Yeah.

564
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:03,842
Lil...

565
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,013
it talked to me...

566
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:10,765
the clown,

567
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,393
when we were alone in the fog.

568
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,729
What do you mean?

569
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,568
He said I'm gonna have a son.

570
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,571
And that he and his friends...

571
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,491
that they kill him in the future.

572
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:31,745
What?

573
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,497
That's why he wanted to kill me.

574
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,416
He said, to him,

575
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,462
the past, present,
and future are all the same.

576
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:44,174
And that his death was actually his birth.

577
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,093
He was probably just saying
all that to scare you.

578
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,720
But what if he wasn't?

579
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,141
What if he does see time differently?

580
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,895
What if he can go backwards?

581
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,857
You mean to the past?

582
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,319
I know it sounds crazy,
but what if he tries to go back

583
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,739
and kill someone from the time
before we were born,

584
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,657
like our parents?

585
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,286
I guess...

586
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,333
it'll be someone else's fight.

587
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,629
I guess.

588
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:37,017
Will! I'm looking at the time.
You said five minutes!

589
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,395
I'm coming, Mom.

590
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,525
Thank you, baby.

591
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,749
Major.

592
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,172
Just stopping by to say <i>au revoir.</i>

593
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,591
How you holdin' up?

594
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,343
Everything hurts.

595
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,845
But whatever that root was...

596
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,347
Whew, boy! Sh--

597
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,183
It quieted those voices down real good.

598
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,144
Hopefully forever.

599
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,856
- You leaving tonight?
- Yeah.

600
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,942
Bus to Boston, plane to London in the a.m.

601
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,862
Got an old buddy back there
who owns a hotel,

602
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,989
wants to give me a shot
cooking in a restaurant.

603
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,575
Okay, fancy stuff.

604
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,287
Well, listen, if you run
into any trouble out there,

605
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,122
you know who you can call.

606
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,707
I owe you.

607
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,376
I think I'll manage.

608
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,212
I mean, how much trouble can a hotel be?

609
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,526
You keep in touch, all right?

610
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,237
I need updates on Will and Char.

611
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,740
I thought you didn't care.

612
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:17,911
Well, don't tell nobody.

613
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:28,045
You might wanna put Miss Natalie Wood
in the back seat with Miss Grogan.

614
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,714
It's a long drive now.

615
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,716
I mean, that's right.

616
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,887
- Is that the last one? All right.
- All right.

617
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,849
Now, you know when you get
to crossing St. Stephen who to look for.

618
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,602
Rosa's friends will make it easy.

619
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,063
Thank you.

620
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,525
For everything.

621
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,277
Of course. Of course.

622
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,489
Here you go.

623
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,116
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

624
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,495
So honorable discharge, huh?

625
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,249
I keep my mouth shut,
and they let me walk away.

626
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,291
Yeah.

627
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,377
You know, the military
has always been my life,

628
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,630
but what happened to me and my family,

629
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,299
I don't have faith in it.

630
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,470
Kind of makes you the perfect person
to keep an eye on 'em.

631
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,392
- What do you mean?
- You and Charlotte.

632
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:29,482
I would like for both of you to join us.

633
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,819
Make sure that your old friends,
or anybody else for that matter,

634
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,072
never tries to reopen that cage.

635
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,118
Others will come.

636
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,746
This isn't the end of the story.

637
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,501
And I've decided
to sell the farm, the house.

638
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:50,628
It's just...

639
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,507
just too much without Taniel, you know?

640
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,136
I know it's a lot to ask,

641
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:02,265
but you two could really
do some good around here.

642
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:06,561
Besides, it'll be 27 years
before that thing wakes up again.

643
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:14,277
Listen, Rose, we're honored, but...

644
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:18,072
I think me and my family,
we've had enough of Derry.

645
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,117
Right?

646
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:22,910
Right.

647
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,205
I understand. Really.

648
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,338
I could have sworn
that you threw that stink bomb

649
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,173
'cause it smelled so bad.

650
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,509
I told you, it was the stardust.

651
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,851
You know what they say about Derry.

652
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,188
Once you leave, you forget.

653
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:53,941
That's good, right?

654
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,987
Is that what you want?

655
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,532
To forget?

656
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,701
No.

657
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,996
There's some parts of this year
I wouldn't mind forgetting.

658
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,874
Not the you part, of course.

659
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:15,380
You know, I guess if that's how it works,
that's how it works.

660
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:20,301
So maybe in some way, it's something--

661
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,159
I'm gonna remember that.

662
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,789
Kids.

663
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,422
All right.

664
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,383
Let's go.

665
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,014
Char. What's wrong?

666
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,477
I'm just--

667
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,605
I'm thinking about Rose's offer.

668
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,151
You serious?

669
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:24,156
I mean, this is how we got
into this mess in the first place.

670
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,784
I mean, you going off on your crusades
and me on mine.

671
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,870
I thought we were done with that.
No more damn fool missions.

672
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:30,997
Yeah.

673
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:35,877
But maybe the next damn fool mission
needs to be together.

674
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,555
Will.

675
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,600
How would you feel if we stuck around?

676
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:54,896
I need a pen.

677
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,693
More importantly...

678
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,236
you gonna help me with those sheep?

679
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:05,031
Oh, I don't fool with no sheep.

680
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,074
I don't need to touch no sheep.
You grew up on a farm.

681
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,368
You know what to do.

682
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,079
- We might be settling.
- Leave me alone, Mr. Hanlon.

683
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,835
<i>Dear Ronnie...</i>

684
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,087
<i>we leave, we forget, right?</i>

685
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:24,634
<i>Well, turns out I'm staying.
So maybe I don't have to.</i>

686
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,095
<i>And maybe if I write to you enough,</i>

687
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,223
<i>you won't have to either.</i>

688
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,184
<i>Help me! Help me, please!</i>

689
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,687
<i>Help me! Where am I?</i>

690
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,272
<i>The-- The wolves!</i>

691
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,690
Where am I? The wolves.

692
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,192
They're looking at me.
They're staring at me.

693
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,278
Don't let them--
Don't let them look at me, please!

694
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,487
- Mrs. Kersh, please.
- Please!

695
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,030
Do not ignore me!

696
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,323
Listen to me!

697
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,659
They killed my father.
I know they killed my father.

698
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,996
I saw the handkerchief. Please!

699
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:36,622
Please.

700
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,377
My father...

701
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:43,921
liked to sing.

702
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,053
Thank you, sir.

703
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,906
Help her! Someone help her!

704
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:00,915
No!

705
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,465
Yeah. Name?

706
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:13,052
Elfrida Marsh.
This time she's really dead.

707
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,288
Oh, dear.

708
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,916
Don't be sad.

709
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:48,087
You know what they say about Derry.

710
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:53,634
No one who dies here ever really dies.
