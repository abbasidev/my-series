1
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,692
Shh.

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,911
I don't want to go.

3
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,582
Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of down there.

4
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,126
Come on.

5
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,545
Good girl.

6
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,009
What's your name, dear?

7
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,762
Mabel.

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,656
So, Mabel...

9
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,368
this is where the clown told you
to meet him?

10
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,955
You can tell me.

11
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,735
It's okay.

12
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,239
Sweetheart, it's okay.
It's just a balloon.

What you don't understand is,

43
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,455
I could have killed you
down there.

44
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,333
But instead, I had to send
my best friend home

45
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,543
in a box.

46
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,381
Because you disobeyed me.

47
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,423
Come on, Dad. That's not fair.

48
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,883
You know
what killed Uncle Pauly.

49
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,761
What I know is I have a son
that has no goddamn sense.

50
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,805
- Okay, Leroy.
- Charlotte, I'm sorry.

51
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,391
You have to stay out of this.
You were not there.

52
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,935
This thing could change
its shape.

53
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,395
Like, it could see
inside my head.

54
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,022
- How is that possible, Lee?
- I don't know.

55
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,400
But I do know
these weren't mind games.

56
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,235
This was real. This was solid.

57
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,822
- It killed trained soldiers.
- Dad, I know what it can do.

58
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,156
It's come after us
a bunch of times,

59
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,324
and it's not gonna stop.

60
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,243
Well, it can't touch you
out here. Outside of Derry.

61
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,453
So, from now on,
you don't leave your room

62
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,621
without my permission.

63
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,165
Do you understand?

64
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,542
No.

65
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,212
Baby, mind your daddy now.

66
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,757
No! You always told me

67
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,884
that a man should never
hide from trouble.

68
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,012
That what makes life count
are the friends you make

69
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,098
and the risks you take.
Well, I've got friends now, Dad.

70
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,433
I've got friends
and they need me,

71
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,310
and I'm gonna be there for them,
just like you would.

72
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,062
You are not me.

73
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,398
Yeah, I know that.
I know I'm not you

74
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,066
'cause I would never
let my friends die.

75
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,486
Leroy!

76
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,081
- I'm sorry, son.
- It's gotten to you too.

77
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,750
It's gotten to your head.

78
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,376
No.

79
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,880
- Come here, son.
- Get away from me!

What is that?

93
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,303
It was under the water

94
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,764
when the clown was
coming after me.

95
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,475
It started to glow, and...

96
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,562
and he looked at it
almost like...

97
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,730
like he was afraid.

98
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,067
Afraid? Really?

99
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,777
Yeah.

100
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,572
Then he backed away and just...

101
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,907
disappeared.

102
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,203
Can I see?

103
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,622
I'll hold it.

104
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,208
Fine.

105
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,254
They look like hieroglyphs.

106
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,047
I thought
those were Egyptian.

107
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,383
All ancient civilizations
have hieroglyphs.

108
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,510
It's a Greek word.

109
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,720
Exactly.

110
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,556
Whatever it is,
if this thing is scared of it,

111
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,975
maybe we can use it.

112
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,605
We go back down there,
all of us together,

113
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,107
and we kill it.

114
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,070
You really
expect us to listen to you?

115
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,198
You're the one
who dragged us down there

116
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,533
in the first damn place.

117
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,868
We almost died.

118
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,621
And now you want us to go back?

119
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,415
You are crazy.

120
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,000
What did you call me?

121
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,589
Lilly?

122
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,257
- Just give it--
- Don't touch it!

123
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,389
You think I wanted this?

124
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,642
If I could go back, I'd never
have gone to your house

125
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,268
in the first place.

126
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,437
You were up in the booth.
You didn't see.

127
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,398
I was the only one who made it
out of that theater.

128
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,942
And for Matty to come back
and tell us

129
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,236
there was a chance
that Phil was still alive?

130
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,862
What was I supposed to do?

131
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,698
If you hadn't come
to my house that day,

132
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,700
they probably would
still be alive.

133
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,911
And the cops wouldn't be
hunting my daddy

134
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,246
like some kind of animal.

135
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,957
All I wanted was to help you.

136
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,001
A lot of good it did.
I wish I never tried.

137
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,754
- Guys--
- And I wish I'd never met you,
Lilly Bainbridge!

138
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,381
Can't you see?

139
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,467
This is what it wants!
To turn us against each other.

140
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:16,055
They should have never
let you out of Juniper Hill!

141
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,187
I'll go make sure she's okay.

142
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,237
- She didn't mean that.
- Don't.

143
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,533
Just... Just leave me alone.

144
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,313
Hallorann?

145
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,564
Where you been?

146
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,858
Can't tell you.

147
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,109
Okay. Place looks good, huh?

148
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,528
Yeah,
we're gonna get something going
later tomorrow night,

149
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,363
bring some ladies, some music,

150
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,656
break this place in.

151
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,076
Yeah, it's gonna be
a real good time.

152
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,957
Shit.

153
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,419
You need this?

154
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,546
More than you know.

155
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,350
You good?

156
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,560
Yeah.

157
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,231
Fuckin' ice box leakin'.
Need to replace that.

158
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,525
Floorboard is rottin'.

159
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,280
I'm gonna polish off
this bottle of Pap,

160
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,366
catch myself a couple Z's
in the back.

161
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,951
Y-- You can't.

162
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,120
We got something
we gotta talk about.

163
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,877
Tell me.

164
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,629
Can you believe her?
It's like she won't stop

165
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,005
until one of us is dead.

166
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,715
We barely made it
out of those tunnels alive,

167
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,842
and now she's trying
to serve us up
to that thing again?

168
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,261
She must have snapped her cap!

169
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,180
You agree with me, right?

170
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,182
Yeah. Definitely.

171
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,935
You think I went too far?

172
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,603
I mean...

173
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,897
Maybe I did, but...

174
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,819
I'm just tired.

175
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,612
I'm tired of being scared.

176
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,158
I know.

177
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,703
Me too.

178
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,938
William Dubois Hanlon?

179
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,107
Get your disobedient behind
in this car right now.

180
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,610
Dubois?

181
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,864
You too, little miss.

182
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,033
Me? Why?

183
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,579
Y'all think y'all grown?

184
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,873
Mm-hmm.

185
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,552
Oh shit.

186
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,304
Are you-- Is that who
the fuck I think that is?

187
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,346
Yeah, but--

188
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,182
They got posters of the man
all over town, Reggie.

189
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,851
They got-- got rewards
for this man and everything.

190
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,227
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

191
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,188
- Please, I-- I-- Please.
- No, no, no. No. No!

192
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,023
Mrs. Hanlon asked
if we could hide him here.

193
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,357
What was I supposed to say?

194
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,235
I think that you are inviting
a whole lot of hurt up in here.

195
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,362
She says she's got
a plan to get him out of town.

196
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,031
Just needs a couple days
to get it all straight.

197
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,407
Like, what do you expect me
to do?

198
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,533
Turn him over to some lynch mob?

199
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,993
Look, I'll--
I'll stay out of sight.

200
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,078
I'll stay out of sight.
I-- I-- I promise, sir.

201
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,207
I won't leave this room. Please.

202
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,125
Please.

203
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,753
I don't need this shit
right now.

204
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,549
Where is he? Daddy?

205
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,717
- Ronnie?
- Daddy!

206
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,719
Ronnie! Ronnie!

207
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,805
- Daddy!
- Oh God! Oh God!

208
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,934
Oh, baby.

209
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,895
Oh, I missed you!
Let me look at you.

210
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,564
- You okay? Let me see you.
- I missed you.

211
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,942
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

212
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,568
We've been looking
for you everywhere.

213
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,737
It's all right, baby.
No one knows about this place.

214
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,365
Just a few colored airmen
from the base.

215
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,370
I'm so sorry.

216
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,289
- I'm sorry I left you.
- Hey.

217
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,333
Thank you for doing this.

218
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,751
Leave me out of this.

219
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm so sorry.

220
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,089
How'd they find you?

221
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,008
A friend of mine reached out
to-- to Mrs. Hanlon for me.

222
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,345
- Who?
- It's a long story, baby.

223
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,472
What's important is
that we're together

224
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,266
and we're gonna stay together.

225
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,268
Ain't no one gonna
keep us apart ever again.

226
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,812
Hmm? Ever again, okay?

227
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,607
Yeah, let 'em try. Okay?

228
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,192
Oh, I missed you.

229
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,443
I missed you.

230
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,779
You wanna talk about
what happened this morning?

231
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,533
I'm here for you. I got you.

232
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,744
My baby girl.

233
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,745
It's gonna be all right.

234
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,000
You're safe.
You're safe, okay?

235
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:41,963
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay, baby.

236
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,360
Hey.

237
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,029
Hey.

238
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,489
You scared me.

239
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,991
Sorry.

240
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,452
I didn't think
anybody would be here.

241
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,454
Um, what are you doing here?

242
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,290
Still haven't landed one
on Main Street.

243
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,044
- Want to try?
- I have to redress my eye.

244
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,838
- The tape is hard to take off.
- Want some help?

245
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,050
I was a Webelo
for a couple years.

246
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,676
I know the trick
to taking a bandage off

247
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,887
without it hurting.

248
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,931
It's really gross.

249
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,699
Ew, what are you doing?

250
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,868
What? If you wet it a little,
it'll slide right off.

251
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,120
- Not with your spit.
- It's fine.

252
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,040
Saliva actually has
antiseptic properties.

253
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,626
- I don't think that's true.
- Who knows?

254
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,712
Science is constantly changing.
That's what Will says.

255
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,256
You should hear him
talk about it.

256
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,307
See? Easy...

257
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,018
peasy.

258
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,525
It's awful, isn't it?

259
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,278
No, it's the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

260
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,031
Whoa.

261
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,206
I can handle it from here.
Thanks.

262
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,757
That was crazy before, huh?

263
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,260
Lilly and Ronnie really
went at each other.

264
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,429
Yeah.

265
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,018
{\an8}Yeah, I just...

266
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,146
{\an8}I just get
a bad feeling. Like...

267
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,440
{\an8}this thing's not done with us.

268
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,818
{\an8}And if we have
to face it alone, then...

269
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,612
{\an8}I know.

270
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,782
What if Lilly's right?

271
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,452
About that thing she found?

272
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,913
What if it really is
the only way we can stop this?

273
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,126
Don't we have a better chance
if we're together?

274
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,175
I'm not the one
who needs convincing.

275
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,802
And Ronnie seems stubborn.

276
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,642
I got it.

277
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,162
Here goes nothing.

278
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:06,834
<i>♪ Young emotions ♪</i>

279
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,002
Oh shit.

280
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:14,092
<i>♪ Are mixed emotions ♪</i>

281
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:20,348
<i>♪ A world full of doubt
But love works it out ♪</i>

282
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:26,395
<i>♪ These young emotions ♪</i>

283
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,923
Hallorann, are you in there?

284
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,060
Major.

285
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,985
Where you been?

286
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,155
You need a drink?

287
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,409
Drink. Drink, drink, drink.

288
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,747
New orders from Shaw.

289
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,501
Dead soldiers or not, he's still
on the hunt for those pillars.

290
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,044
Ah, makes sense.

291
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,673
But if I was Shaw, I would stop
that shit before he f--

292
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,648
I'll fuckin' look at it later.

293
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,068
Dick, what happened down there?

294
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,697
I think we pissed it off.

295
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,991
I meant you.

296
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,620
You stayed in those tunnels
for hours.

297
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,163
What happened?

298
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,917
This thing I got,

299
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,254
when I was little,
let me see things.

300
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,340
Okay.

301
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,842
What kind of things?

302
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,302
Dead ones.

303
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,312
My grandma had some
of what I got.

304
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,899
Not as strong,
but she had some, so...

305
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,152
she realized
I wasn't sleeping, and why,

306
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,989
and she taught me this trick.
Told me...

307
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,535
Said, "Dick, think
of a great big ol' box.

308
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,496
And imagine
putting all the things

309
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,040
you don't want to see no more
inside the box.

310
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,376
Closing it up."

311
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,544
So I did.

312
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,006
I took all them dead things,

313
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,008
threw them in that box
in my mind,

314
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,804
and I shoved
that goddamn lid on tight.

315
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,099
I was nine.

316
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,810
I ain't seen them since.

317
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,604
'Til yesterday...

318
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,191
when that goddamn thing...

319
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:22,197
It forced itself into my head,
ripped that lid off,

320
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,702
and laughed
as it all came spillin' out.

321
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,802
Are they here now?

322
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,140
Can you see them?

323
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,689
My grandma,
she used to tell me that

324
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,650
the dead, they--
they always wander back

325
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,736
to where they died.

326
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,281
Look like one or two of 'em
met their maker right here.

327
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,534
Do they talk to you?

328
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,745
No, no, no, no, no, no.

329
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,040
Long as I don't regard them,
they don't even notice I'm here.

330
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,917
But, man, if I open my mouth...

331
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,006
the voices,
they don't ever stop.

332
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,468
And they know things,
things we don't.

333
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,512
Things the living
aren't meant to know.

334
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,974
Like what?

335
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,607
Like how to find
what we're looking for?

336
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,112
Did you hear a word I just said?

337
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,156
Look.

338
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,076
I just buried my wingman.

339
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,622
Okay, my best friend.
And I almost killed my own son.

340
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,373
So, no disrespect,

341
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,291
but we both got skin
in the game.

342
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,919
And I know it's asking a lot,
but at the end of the day,

343
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,130
you're an airman first class
of the United States military.

344
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,924
When shit gets real,
it's the job.

345
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,050
Mm.

346
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,468
If this helps
complete the mission,

347
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,803
just do it this one time,

348
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,056
and then you can-- you can

349
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,809
put it all back away,
just like it was before.

350
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,185
Okay, so what-- what happens

351
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,772
if I can't shove it
all away like before?

352
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,734
Hmm? You don't know.
You don't know, do you?

353
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,528
Or you don't give a fuck.

354
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,363
Either way, all this shit is
about what you want.

355
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,489
It's about doing what's right.

356
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,866
Oh, get the fuck out of here
with that.

357
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,159
You know what? Shaw's calling,

358
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,370
needs his boot shined,
you fuckin' bootlicker.

359
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,038
Man, you don't talk to me
like that.

360
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,331
I'm your superior officer.

361
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,166
I don't give a fuck!

362
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,585
Get out!

363
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,796
Get out!

364
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,688
Now you think about
whether you want to do
your sworn duty,

365
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,691
or get dragged out
of here in handcuffs.

366
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,694
Get some rest.

367
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,626
Charlotte.

368
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,967
Char?

369
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,268
What's going on? Where's Will?

370
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,437
Probably with his friends,

371
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,106
who are about the only people
he can trust right now.

372
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,485
And you know what?
I don't blame him.

373
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,402
Okay, hold on a minute.

374
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,988
No, you hold on a minute.

375
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,241
You put hands on our boy.

376
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,868
I know.

377
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,912
And I'm sorry, Char,
but you know that--

378
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,039
that wasn't me.

379
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,250
It wasn't. My head was just...

380
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,044
It was all messed up

381
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,838
because of what happened
down in that sewer.

382
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,175
And wh-- what happened to Pauly.

383
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,185
I'm sorry.

384
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,650
I'm sorry, Char.

385
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,276
I'm just...

386
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,778
trying to protect
this goddamn country.

387
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,323
This country?

388
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,407
What?

389
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:38,244
You put us in a cage
with a goddamn monster!

390
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,288
I didn't know.

391
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,998
I didn't know that.

392
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,500
Yeah, well,
there's a lot you don't know.

393
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,584
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

394
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,170
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

395
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,674
Hank Grogan's at the Black Spot.

396
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,008
How'd he wind up
there, Charlotte?

397
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,176
I put him there.

398
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,303
You--

399
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,097
Mm-hmm.

400
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,057
Yell, scream, stomp,

401
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,308
do whatever it is
you need to do,

402
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,851
won't make a lick of difference.

403
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,311
Tomorrow morning,
I'm getting him

404
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,980
out of town. Safe.

405
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,982
And then Will and I are
headed back to Shreveport

406
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,191
with or without you.

407
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,859
I have a mission
to finish, Charlotte.

408
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,069
I can't just walk away
from that.

409
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,487
Well, then I guess
you'll join us

410
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,573
when you can find the time
to make things right.

411
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,241
Can't you see that's
what I'm trying to do here?

412
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,410
Not with me.

413
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,578
With your son.

414
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,686
<i>You convinced everyone</i>

415
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,731
<i>to come and see me.</i>

416
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,402
<i>Because you're such a good friend.</i>

417
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:57,698
<i>But such a bad daughter!</i>

418
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,243
If you all
take out your textbooks
and turn to page 61.

419
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:08,208
Okay, so Sally has
2X the number of apples.

420
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:14,590
Who's gonna help you now, crazy?

421
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,430
You'll die if you try!

422
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,016
Stay away!

423
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,438
Lilly Bainbridge!

424
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,399
Sit back down this very instant!

425
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,913
Where do you think
you're going, young lady?

426
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,086
Her dad? Are you serious?

427
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,462
That's why she's not here.

428
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,130
Will said his mom took 'em
there yesterday,

429
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,341
and Ronnie hasn't
left his side since.

430
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,759
He said he'll take us
there later,

431
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,220
but we can't tell anyone.

432
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,013
You think we can change
her mind?

433
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,932
I don't know. We gotta try.

434
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,226
I could barely sleep last night.

435
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,936
When I brushed my teeth,
I thought I heard voices

436
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,938
- in the pipes.
- Voices in the pipes?

437
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,939
You too?

438
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,108
I wouldn't even go
in there to pee.

439
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,610
So what, you just held it in?

440
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,778
Are you kidding?

441
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,571
I couldn't even do that
if I tried.

442
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,824
I just put it--

443
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,286
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

444
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,580
Oh, come on. Please.
You're the only person

445
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,458
I've shown
my oozing eye scab to.

446
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,003
Fine.

447
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,842
I put a jar next to my bed,
and I emptied it this morning.

448
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,302
Huh.

449
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,723
In medieval times,
they called it a chamber pot.

450
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,767
Everyone peed in them,
even knights.

451
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,476
Knights? Cool.

452
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,355
They also fought in duels
and rescued fair maidens.

453
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,150
Oh, hey, I got you something.

454
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,822
Here it is.

455
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,158
Dug it out of my attic.

456
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,784
Supposedly,
it belonged to a corsair

457
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,995
my ancestors knew back in Cuba.

458
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,038
I figured, I don't know,
you might like it.

459
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,762
I love it.

460
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,390
I've always wanted
to be a pirate.

461
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:31,518
Look at us.
A pirate and a knight.

462
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,854
Guess we got next Halloween
all figured out, huh?

463
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,189
It's a date.

464
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,942
- Oh.
- No, I know.

465
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,112
- I didn't mean to say--
- I didn't-- I didn't think
you meant--

466
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,864
Sorry.

467
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,576
Hey, Margie.
If I didn't know any better,

468
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,244
I'd think you were avoiding us.

469
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,871
Oh. Hi, Patty.

470
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,956
Everyone's still talking
about how you escaped

471
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,541
the jaws of death.

472
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,086
At least Loony Lilly didn't
stab both your eyes out.

473
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,630
That's not what happened.

474
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,633
Well, why don't you tell us
about it over lunch?

475
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,551
At our table.

476
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,554
Unless you'd rather stay here

477
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,891
with Ricky Ricardo
and the other freaks.

478
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,075
Patty?

479
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,827
Margaret?

480
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,745
I am a freak.

481
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,751
Stop!

482
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,963
Rhon? Oh my God, Rhonda.
Just breathe! Oh my God!

483
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,064

Almost there, I think.

490

491

This is it.

492
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,130
Now we gotta convince Ronnie
we have to stick together

493
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,965
to fight this thing.

494
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,634
Um, quick question.
What if she says no?

495
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,470
Say a prayer she doesn't.

496
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,805
I don't know, man.

497
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:35,434
Last time I said a prayer,
my dead <i>tío</i> almost killed us.

498
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,604
Okay, well, um...
no prayers then.

499
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,314
Oh. Oh, Lord.

500
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:52,159
Wow. What is this place?

501
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,912
It's like a clubhouse for some
of the airmen from the base.

502
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,166
So kind of like the Standpipe,
but for grownups.

503
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,677
Who is it?

504
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,263
It's Will.

505
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,891
Rich. Come on.

506
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,599
Hello?

507
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,909
Mrs. Kersh?

508
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,003
Lilly?

509
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,924
What are you doing up here?

510
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,509
Uh, the-- the door was open.

511
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:01,307
Oh, it's-- it's fine.
I just wasn't expecting anybody.

512
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,101
Are you okay?

513
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,646
I'm all right. It's just...

514
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,690
Well, we went down
to the tunnels and--

515
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,984
Oh, Lilly.

516
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,738
- I begged you not to go.
- We didn't have a choice.

517
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:17,949
And Matty...

518
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,286
Matty, he...

519
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,250
Oh, darling.

520
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,171
Oh. It's all right.

521
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,007
It's okay. Whatever it is,
it's all going to be okay.

522
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,385
I just-- I didn't know
who else to go to.

523
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,890
You're in the right place.
All right?

524
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,810
It's okay.

525
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,645
It's okay.

526
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,400
There, there.

527
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,865
Oh, Lilly,
you're safe here with me.

528
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,247
Lilly, what's the matter?

529
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,424
Have you seen him?

530
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,013
You saw him.

531
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,932
Oh, my word.

532
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,977
You did it.

533
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,062
Oh, sweetheart, you did it.

534
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,606
You did it.

535
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,025
Oh, Lilly.

536
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,527
Of course, it was you.

537
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,279
Oh, this is...

538
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,739
I know you don't understand,

539
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,367
but you brought him back.

540
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,081
It's my old costume.

541
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,299
You followed us?

542
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,135
Yes. Yes.

543
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,305
I thought he might appear
that night in the cemetery.

544
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,848
You kids were on your bikes,

545
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,476
and I was worried
I might miss him

546
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,729
if he--
if he showed himself to you.

547
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,647
So-- So that was you.

548
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,404
But-- But why?

549
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,542
My father was
a carnival performer.

550
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,255
He called himself
"Pennywise the Dancing Clown."

551
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,591
I adored him.

552
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,844
And he was taken from me.

553
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,975
The carnival moved on,
but I stayed in Derry.

554
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,396
I suppose you could say
I felt... drawn.

555
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,287
Your parents are very concerned.

556
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,789
They don't believe me...

557
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,541
about Pennywise.

558
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,883
He says he wants
to show me his carnival.

559
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:29,389
He's here in the pipes.

560
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,600
He tells me to come down
to the basement at night.

561
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,146
There are no such things
as clowns in pipes.

562
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,274
Clowns live at the circus.

563
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,736
Good girl.

564
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,630
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay. It's just a balloon.

565
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,366
Hello, Mabel.

566
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,623
You finally came.

567
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,721
And you brought a friend.

568
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,558
Papa?

569
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,196
Don't look back!

570
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,324
There, Mabel!

571
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,838
- Help!
- I'm trying! It's stuck!

572
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,298
Please, open the door!

573
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,885
Open the door!

574
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,512
Oh God! No!

575
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,348
Leave her alone!
Oh no, please! Please!

576
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,021
Mabel--

577
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,125
No!

578
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:50,591
Pumpkin, it's me, Papa.

579
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:01,894
Oh, how I've missed you
all these years.

580
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,607
No, no, don't be scared.

581
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,319
I can explain everything.

582
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,115
Just open the door
and let me in.

583
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,252
That's right.

584
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,796
Open it.

585
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,507
Let me in.

586
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,969
Everything's gonna be all right.

587
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,232
<i>It was him.</i>

588
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,151
Different, perhaps changed

589
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:56,239
by whatever he'd been through,
or wherever he'd been.

590
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,076
Oh, but it was him all the same.

591
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,079
A daughter knows.

592
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,584
And...

593
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,253
suddenly I...

594
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,922
oh, I felt whole again...

595
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,594
...for the first time
since that awful day.

596
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,182
<i>But every time
that he would return,</i>

597
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:27,229
<i>this shadow would steal
my father away.</i>

598
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,860
<i>I... I had to find a way
to free him.</i>

599
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,239
So I did what I had to
to see him again.

600
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,668
If he could just see me
once more as his Periwinkle,

601
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,255
remind him of the love
that we shared,

602
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,343
I know that he'll be able
to break free.

603
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,597
Please don't hurt me.

604
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,558
Hurt you?

605
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,979
I would never
let anything hurt you.

606
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,023
And my friends?

607
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,318
Oh, Lilly.

608
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,989
You above all people
should understand.

609
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,749
If you could see
your father again, hold him,

610
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,293
be his little girl...

611
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,712
wouldn't you do everything
you could

612
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,090
to make that happen?

613
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,220
My father is dead.

614
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,515
Oh, you know what they say
about Derry, dear.

615
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,727
No one who dies here
ever really dies.

616
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,439
Come with me tonight.

617
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,607
Let me show you.

618
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,652
Lilly!

619
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,125
If we're gonna go
after this thing,

620
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,960
it needs to be all of us.

621
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,505
Uh-uh. I'm not going anywhere
until I know my dad is safe.

622
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,882
Hey, your dad,
he's gonna be fine.

623
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,427
Nobody knows that he's here.

624
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,471
I'm not getting separated again.

625
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,976
You guys do what you want.
I'm staying.

626
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,819
- Well, she's stubborn.
- I told you.

627
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,572
Yeah, well...

628
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,491
so am I.

629
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,618
Will--

630
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,996
All right, now.
Here we go.

631
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,582
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

632
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,047
Maybe we should wait outside.

633
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:04,011
Nah, I think...
I think here's good.

634
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,513
If this thing Lilly found
in the sewers

635
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,849
really scares it like she said,

636
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,519
it's a chance it can stop it.
Like, for good.

637
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,062
But we think
we'd have a better chance

638
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,314
if we could all
be together until--

639
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,607
Enough.

640
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,734
You really expect my dad
to let me go back down there?

641
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,027
No,
you're not going anywhere,

642
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,112
but I get it.

643
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,406
He's worried about you.

644
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,657
Right?

645
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,534
Well, yes, sir.
But that's-- that's not--

646
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,287
You really care
about my daughter, don't you?

647
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,749
Uh... Yes, sir.

648
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:38,212
We have that in common.
That's why I can't let her go.

649
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,214
So, what, the two of you

650
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,882
been spending a lot of time
together then?

651
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,009
- Daddy.
- Hush up, now.

652
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,053
You have a new gentleman friend.

653
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,056
I'm your father. I should
know him a little better.

654
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,851
Let me ask you
something, William.

655
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,438
What's your favorite movie?

656
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,987
That kiddie killer's
still out there.

657
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,781
Where the hell else can we look?

658
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,241
We've already
covered the Barren's.

659
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,494
There's a whole sewer system
he could be hiding in.

660
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,580
I say we go in, split up,
and search it all again.

661
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,542
How about that area
outside the rail yards

662
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,752
where the hobos used
to come through?

663
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,755
Tomorrow, we get the others,
the Boone brothers, maybe,

664
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,132
- some dogs--
- He's not there.

665
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,179
Grogan.

666
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,765
I know where he's hiding,
and it ain't the rail yards.

667
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,601
- You serious?
- Uh, yeah.

668
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,020
A lady called in a tip.

669
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,398
Didn't leave her name, but, uh,

670
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,149
well, considering the nature
of the place

671
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,902
she was pointing at,
I'd say it's a pretty safe bet.

672
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,237
Are you gonna arrest him?

673
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,573
Well, there's a problem.

674
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:52,285
See, when the tip came in,
I was cleaning out my desk

675
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,287
'cause the deputy mayor

676
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,455
just relieved me of my duties.

677
00:47:56,456 --> 00:48:00,043
Seems, uh, they've lost
confidence in my ability to...

678
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,962
serve and protect.

679
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:07,091
So, no.
No, I couldn't even...

680
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,844
...couldn't even give him
a parking ticket.

681
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,763
What are you telling us for?

682
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,810
<i>♪ It's the wrong song... ♪</i>

683
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,020
Look who made it.

684
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,730
What's happening, man?

685
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,192
<i>♪ Your smile is lovely
It's the wrong smile ♪</i>

686
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:11,405
<i>♪ It's not his smile
But such a lovely smile ♪</i>

687
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:15,619
<i>♪ That it's all right with me ♪</i>

688
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,956
<i>♪ You can't know
How happy I am ♪</i>

689
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,666
<i>♪ That we met ♪</i>

690
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:26,796
<i>♪ I'm strangely
Attracted to you... ♪</i>

691
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:30,384
Here you go. Careful now,
she's got some sting.

692
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:31,969
Thanks.

693
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,724
Ah! Young Master Will's friends.

694
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,602
- Whatcha drinkin'?
- Two Cokes.

695
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,437
Two Cokes coming up.

696
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,781
What are they doing?

697
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,242
Uh,
I think they're dancing.

698
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,078
What kind of dancing is that?

699
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,331
Two Cokes?

700
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,667
Thank you.

701
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,879
I think there's something wrong
with this Coke.

702
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,465
Well, nah, you got a...

703
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,426
Air Force Coke.

704
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,970
Tastes kind of funny.

705
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,430
That's the taste
of freedom, son.

706

707
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:26,731
<i>♪ And it's all right with me ♪</i>

708
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,025
Freedom tastes weird.

709
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,907
Oh, they did play
<i>War of the Worlds</i>

710
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,492
at the rec center
on base last year.

711
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,745
- I-- I-- I like that.
- Great answer.

712
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,458
You seem like a bright
young man, William.

713
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,757
Truth is...

714
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,179
if anything were to happen
to me...

715
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,640
it's good to know
someone of your character

716
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,435
is looking out for my baby girl.

717
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,735
Nothing's gonna happen
to you or Ronnie, sir.

718
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,528
Not on my watch.

719
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,042
Oh shit.

720
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,336
Not even
the old Hanlon charm, huh?

721
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,588
I tried. She won't budge.

722
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,174
Oh man. That sucks.

723
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:38,303
- What are we gonna do now?
- Hey, Sticks, you play?

724
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,430
I don't know. A little.

725
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,848
Look, we're about to swing out,

726
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,684
but our drummer's
a little bit, uh...

727
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,229
indisposed.

728
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,273
What do you say? Wanna sit in?

729
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,858
Oh, come on!

730
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,029
I've never seen you play before.
What's a couple more minutes?

731
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,742
What are we playing?

732
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,702
You know how to use these?

733
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,087
<i>♪ Say, it's only a paper moon ♪</i>

734
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,090
<i>♪ Sailing over a cardboard sea ♪</i>

735
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,217
<i>♪ But it wouldn't be
Make-believe ♪</i>

736
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,887
<i>♪ If you believed in me ♪</i>

737
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,392
- Wanna go dance?
- Oh yeah.

738
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,189
I love Air Force Coke.

739
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,613
Go, Rich!

740
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:51,018
It's kinda nice
out here, huh?

741
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,645
Just the two of us.

742
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,481
Can finally hear
each other talk.

743
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,524
And, girl,
let me tell you something.

744
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,777
I can listen to the sound
of your voice till sunup.

745
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,196
You sure you don't mean
the sound of your own?

746
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,990
Oof.

747
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,451
Come on. Light me up.

748
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,928
You guys expecting
more people tonight?

749
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,471
No.

750
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,063
Goddamn.

751
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:41,194
Say, you wanna kill
those headlights, jack?

752
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,906
What's wrong with these people?

753
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,333
Get behind me. Now.
