3
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:22,366
Step right up, folks!

4
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:27,079
Step right up and see our hall
of freaks and curiosities!

5
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:31,375
The Lee Twins, joined at birth
by a cruel trick of God!

6
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:34,378
Careful.

7
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:37,130
And the dog-faced boy,

8
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:39,299
more dog than boy.

9
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:41,843
The Skeleton Man,

10
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:44,888
more dead than alive.

11
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,557
Slorak, the Man-Ape,

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,227
more ape than man.

13
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:55,357
Come on. They're all here.

14
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:07,661
Step right up...

15
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:12,791
into a grotesquerie of horrors
beyond your darkest imaginings.

16
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:17,253
Step right up.

17
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:24,302
Mm.

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,721
There you go.

19
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:34,771
Step right up.

20
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:56,668
Keep moving.

21
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,447
Hello, boy.

22
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,951
Come closer.

23
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:17,374
Don't be afraid. Come closer.

24
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:25,882
Come on. Come closer.

25
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:31,304
Yeah. That's right.

26
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:42,149
Now you see it!

27
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:52,325
Whoa, whoa.

28
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:53,952
There you are.

29
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:57,664
For the love of Christ.

30
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:00,959
Don't be a damn sissy, Francis.

31
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,419
Your old man won you something.

32
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:13,388
Come on.

33
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:20,770
-Step right up.
-Thank you.

34
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:47,672
Come on.

35
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,966
God.

36
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:00,727
Damn fair cleaned me out.

37
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,729
Get us some water.

38
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:18,745
Uh, one please.

39
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,418
Come on now, hurry up.

40
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,740
It's five cents.

41
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,716
Uh, that's all I got.

42
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:35,178
That a slingshot?

43
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:58,576
Where's that damn slingshot?

44
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:31,609
Wait! Francis! No!
Come back! Wait!

45
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:34,279
Francis!

46
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:35,405
Come back!

47
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:13,818
What do you want?

48
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,620
Leave me alone!

49
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:41,012
Hello.

50
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:27,141
Run, come on!

51
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:33,314
Hurry.

52
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,568
He's getting closer!

53
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:38,570
Don't look back!

85
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:54,580
Mrs. Bainbridge.

86
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:56,916
Pleasure to see you again.

87
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,837
I've upped Lilly's dosage
of chlorpromazine,

88
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,922
but if she has another episode,

89
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:06,801
we may want to discuss a more
restrictive treatment plan.

90
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:08,386
Where is she now?

91
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,221
Lilly forged quite the bond
last summer

92
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:12,390
with the head
of our housekeeping staff.

93
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:14,684
She wanted to say goodbye
before she left.

94
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:17,436
Fold and tuck.

95
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:27,864
It's going to be okay, dear.

96
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:31,200
You're a bright girl.
You'll figure it out.

97
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:33,244
Yeah, it's just...

98
00:11:34,704 --> 00:11:37,248
It's my fault
that her dad's in jail.

99
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:40,710
We don't even know
each other that well.

100
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:43,963
And if I tell the truth
about what I really saw, then...

101
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:46,257
You'd probably wind up
right back here.

102
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:50,469
What would you do
if you were me?

103
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:56,768
My father used to say that life
is about the journey.

104
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,730
But I think it's more about
who you take that journey with.

105
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:04,567
And if this Ronnie means as much
to you as it sounds,

106
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,944
you're going to find a way
to make things right.

107
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,197
Somehow.

108
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,578
Listen.

109
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:18,330
If you tell me that
you've seen the impossible,

110
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,083
then I believe you.

111
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:24,920
Most people, well...

112
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:28,758
they only believe
what they can see.

113
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:35,098
With their own eyes.

114
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:50,571
Easy, partner.

115
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:54,200
I come in peace.

116
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:21,978
What's the matter,
not your brand?

117
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:24,104
I'm more
of an Embassy Golds man.

118
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:27,984
Is that right? Embassy Golds.

119
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,069
Not too popular
this side of the pond.

120
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,241
To think, I had you pegged
as a Pall Mall man,

121
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:37,368
a regular James Coburn.

122
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:40,121
-Lee Marvin.
-Hmm?

123
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:42,498
Pall Malls,
the commercials are Lee Marvin.

124
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:43,958
Oh.

125
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,918
Well, you do know
your movie stars, Hank.

126
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:47,753
Guess it comes
with the territory, huh?

127
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:52,299
You know what I know,
what my, uh... my territory is?

128
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:55,970
Liars.

129
00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:59,765
I can sniff 'em out a mile away.

130
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:06,022
Where were you
the night of the murder, Hank?

131
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:07,732
I told you, I was home.

132
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:09,192
Then why do I have
an eyewitness,

133
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:11,694
puts you on Jackson Street
at 11:30?

134
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:17,033
Yeah, a witness called it in,

135
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:18,534
said she saw your picture
in the papers.

136
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:19,911
Put two and two together
with the man

137
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:22,246
she'd seen sneaking around
in the shadows that night.

138
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,373
-She wrote a sworn statement.
-Yeah, it don't make it true.

139
00:14:24,456 --> 00:14:26,751
Well, she was pretty upset.

140
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:29,795
So, um, we went out there,
had a look around, and...

141
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,217
found this at the scene.

142
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:39,638
"Thou shalt not lie," Hank.

143
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:45,269
Do you know what they do
to kiddy-killers in Shawshank?

144
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,355
I didn't do nothing
to those kids,

145
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:49,357
and I wasn't nowhere near
that theater.

146
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,566
Then where were you, Hank?

147
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,568
And don't give me any more guff
about you being at home in bed.

148
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:54,403
Don't insult my intelligence.

149
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:04,413
All right.

150
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:12,129
We're gonna miss you
around here, Hank.

151
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:14,757
At least we got the memories.

152
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,759
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait. wait.

153
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:19,595
I... I didn't do this!
I didn't do this!

154
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:22,806
Come back! Come back!

155
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,442
Can you imagine if your dad
turns out to be a psycho killer?

156
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,904
I mean, they must have evidence
if they arrested him, right?

157
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:20,281
This is America.

158
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:22,825
You can't just throw people
in jail for nothing.

159
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:24,743
Are we talking
about the same country?

160
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:29,165
She just doesn't seem
like the kind of person

161
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:30,728
that would've been raised
by a killer.

162
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,376
That's all.

163
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:39,466
Hey.

164
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:42,094
Grabbed this
from the nurse's office.

165
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:44,013
It should help get that off.

166
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:45,973
You're the last person
I need help from.

167
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:47,350
You're lucky
I don't whoop your ass

168
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:48,976
for what you did to my dad.

169
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:51,895
Just walk on out of here.

170
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:55,274
-Just go.
-I'll tell them, okay?

171
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:57,568
What I really saw.

172
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,571
-You will?
-I'll do anything

173
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,114
to make it right.

174
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:05,325
It happened again
at the grocery store.

175
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:07,119
I saw my dad.

176
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:11,874
They sent me back
to Juniper Hill.

177
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:14,543
Now everyone thinks
I'm still crazy or...

178
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,379
I don't know, even more crazy.

179
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:17,755
So even if I tell them
the truth,

180
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:19,465
no one's gonna believe it.

181
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:24,053
People only believe what
they can see for themselves.

182
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:27,223
It won't matter
what we tell them

183
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:28,766
unless we can show them proof.

184
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,560
How are we supposed
to get proof?

185
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,608
You actually think this thing
is gonna stop

186
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,193
and pose for pictures?

187
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:41,612
What have we got to lose?
It's worth a shot.

188
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:42,905
To prove that I'm not crazy

189
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:44,865
and that your dad's
not a killer.

190
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:49,703
Okay.

191
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:53,708
Say we try this
and we actually get something.

192
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,750
What are we gonna do?

193
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,877
Send it to Keene's
to get developed?

194
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,255
We'd never get
those pictures back.

195
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:01,757
And I don't know how
to develop a roll of film.

196
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,759
-Do you?
-No.

197
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:06,637
But there must be someone
we know who can.

198
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,103
We stripped that Caddy
down to the bolts.

199
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:15,604
If there was anything
hidden inside,

200
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:18,107
we'd have found it. It's clean.

201
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,609
Nothing but blood stains
and bullet holes.

202
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,279
We even checked the area
around the dig site.

203
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:25,864
Must have dug up half an acre.
Still no luck.

204
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,451
Of course not.

205
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:30,786
What we're looking for
was buried in Derry 300 years

206
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:32,830
before the automobile
was even invented.

207
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:35,666
But that car
had to give off something

208
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:37,334
for Hallorann
to be able to find it.

209
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,296
It's part of the 1935 cycle.

210
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,506
The Bradley Gang massacre.

211
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,133
Bunch of Dillinger wannabes.

212
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:47,219
Town went crazy
and shot them to hell.

213
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:50,014
Eyewitness reports at the time
suggest sightings of the entity

214
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:52,558
in one of its forms.

215
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:00,232
Everything we've dug up so far

216
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:02,318
and we're no closer
to locating the target.

217
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:04,361
And we're running out of time.

218
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,072
Hallorann's psychic abilities
have been proven,

219
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:07,490
but there's only
so much he can do

220
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:09,158
stuck on base pointing at maps.

221
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:13,036
We need to get him closer
to the target.

222
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:16,456
Right on top of it if possible.

223
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,417
On top of it, sir?

224
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:25,007
Put him in the air.

225
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,801
Hallorann is the key
to this whole operation.

226
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:28,052
If something should happen
to him...

227
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:29,845
We have Major Hanlon
to look after him now.

228
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:31,055
Well, with all due respect, sir,

229
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:33,182
how do we know Hallorann will do
any better out in the field?

230
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:34,809
Maybe he just needs
a little something extra

231
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:36,018
to guide him.

232
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:49,615
Something that put its mark
on that thing...

233
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,617
a long time ago.

234
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:02,878
Ain't no way.

235
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:04,505
-Bullshit. Bullshit.
-Ain't no way.

236
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:06,423
There ain't no way.
Ain't no way.

237
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,551
You ain't never made it
with Aretha Franklin.

238
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:10,052
Hand to God!

239
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:12,680
We met in Detroit. At a club.

240
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:16,892
Spent the night together. Shit,
she even wrote a song about me.

241
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:19,562
Yeah, "Won't Be Long."

242
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:27,069
Oh!

243
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:29,112
Goddamn, man.

244
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:31,114
Fuck!

245
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:36,078
I thought you were supposed
to have special privileges.

246
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:37,121
So, what?

247
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:39,874
So, can't you get us
a little upgrade?

248
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:42,251
Hallorann. It's time.

249
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:50,509
We want that upgrade.

250
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,639
Masters, son of a bitch.
I'd love to get him

251
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,141
and his buddies alone,
let me tell you.

252
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:58,767
It's too bad,
because Masters and his pals

253
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,269
shipped off yesterday,
so it's done.

254
00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:01,645
Yeah, tell that
to my right shoulder.

255
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,771
Huh?

256
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:03,939
You gotta man up, Pauly.

257
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:05,024
-"Man up"?
-Yeah.

258
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:06,775
I was taking those two guys down
while you were still

259
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:08,944
under the bed looking
for your jaw. "Man up."

260
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:10,779
I don't remember
you taking anyone down.

261
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:12,364
I remember you getting tossed
around like a baby.

262
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:13,532
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

263
00:21:13,615 --> 00:21:14,617
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

264
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,660
Then why are you
in the military? Why'd you join?

265
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,829
-I look so good in the uniform.
-Oh, yeah?

266
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:20,331
-No, not the hair. Not the hair.
-Fuck you.

267
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:21,957
Touch that, you die.
You know that.

268
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:26,962
-Major.
-Colonel.

269
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:28,923
Airman Hallorann,
this is Major Hanlon,

270
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:30,299
Captain Russo.
They'll be your crew

271
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:31,842
for today's surveillance flight.

272
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:33,260
How they hangin', fellas?

273
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,972
Uh, sir, what exactly

274
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:38,974
are we gonna be surveilling
this afternoon?

275
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:40,476
Your consoles.

276
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,229
Think of Hallorann here
as a human compass.

277
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:44,980
You go wherever he says to.

278
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:51,111
-Sounds good.
-Let's get you in the air.

279
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:10,797
-So, Hallorann.
-Yeah?

280
00:22:12,007 --> 00:22:13,300
What's with the cigars?

281
00:22:15,052 --> 00:22:16,261
No cigars in here.

282
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,389
Well, then what's in it?

283
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:23,727
You wouldn't understand.

284
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:57,636
You're... You're gonna need
to turn east.

285
00:22:59,388 --> 00:23:00,806
East. Now!

286
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:05,477
Roger that. East we go.

287
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,627
Why... Why are you
stopping? We have to get out of here.

288
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,754
We're okay now. Look.

289
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,007
It doesn't leave the woods.

290
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:38,593
What was that thing?

291
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:40,720
I don't know.

292
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:42,681
Stop, please.

293
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,268
Why can't it leave the woods?

294
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:52,649
Can you keep a secret?

295
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:01,075
I don't know what they think

296
00:24:01,158 --> 00:24:02,492
they're doing out there.

297
00:24:03,702 --> 00:24:07,373
Our ceremonial grounds
have always been off limits.

298

-If they want the land...
-They always want the land.

299
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:12,002
Then at least give us
a fair price

300
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:14,880
so that we can fix things up
around the Marsh.

301
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:15,881
She's right.

302
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:17,841

00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:40,108

357
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:42,569
I'm advising again.
Unresponsive.

359
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:52,329
I'm advising
that Airman Hallorann is unresponsive!

360
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:53,872
Requesting permission
to head back!

361
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:55,457
Hallorann!

362
00:26:56,249 --> 00:26:59,461
Hey! Hallorann!

363
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:19,374
Who are you?

364
00:29:05,378 --> 00:29:06,755
Grandma.

365
00:29:06,838 --> 00:29:09,007
He's coming, Dickie.

366
00:29:09,507 --> 00:29:10,634
Get out of here.

367
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:12,469
Now!

368
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:29,819
Hallorann!
Step back, Hallorann!

369
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,282
Hallorann!

370
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:35,283
-Hallorann!
-No! No!

371
00:29:35,366 --> 00:29:37,994
-Hey! Hey!
-You both in?

372
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:12,570
-How you holding up, soldier?
-I feel fine, sir.

373
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:16,449
So...

374
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:18,660
you saw it.

375
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:24,332
More like it saw me.

376
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:28,419
What was it like?

377
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:32,090
Cold.

378
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:40,182
You did good up there today.

379
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:43,769
If there's anything

380
00:30:43,852 --> 00:30:46,313
we can do to make
your time here a little easier,

381
00:30:46,396 --> 00:30:47,605
you let me know.

382
00:30:49,274 --> 00:30:51,985
-Now that you mention it...
-That was quick.

383
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:55,489
Me and my pals on base,

384
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:57,157
it's kind of hard

385
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,742
to find a place
to blow off steam.

386
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:01,870
If you can see fit
to find us someplace that...

387
00:31:01,953 --> 00:31:03,997
maybe it don't rain in
on our heads,

388
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,999
I know the boys
would be grateful.

389
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,794
Understood.
I'll see what I can do.

390
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:13,339
Sir.

391
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:21,723
It wasn't supposed to see us.

392
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:25,727
It wasn't supposed to know.

393
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:30,732
I got a feeling

394
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:33,401
we keep on like we're doing,
something bad is coming.

395
00:31:36,696 --> 00:31:38,865
Maybe we oughta
just let this thing be.

396
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,250
Rest up.

398
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,229
Here you go, gentlemen.

399
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:10,814
The trip was supposed
to be short,

400
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:12,774
but the launch was delayed
for over three hours

401
00:32:12,857 --> 00:32:14,734
after Shepard climbed
into the rocket.

402
00:32:14,817 --> 00:32:16,528
So Shepard asked
if he could go outside and pee,

403
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:18,405
and they said no,
but they had to temporarily

404
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:19,948
turn off the electrical parts
in his suit

405
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:21,741
so he could pee in his pants
without frying himself.

406
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:24,744
So, you're telling me
the first human

407
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:27,205
that went to space went there
with pee in his pants?

408
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:28,498
Yeah.

409
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:30,125
It could have been worse.

410
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,960
Dude, stop! Ew!

411
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,795
You got it on your face.

412
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:35,964
Let me ask you this.

413
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:38,216
Who do you think has
the best ta-tas in the grade?

414
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:39,634
What?

415
00:32:39,717 --> 00:32:41,303
Do they not call them ta-tas
where you're from?

416
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:44,722
-No, they do.
-Well, for me, it's Delores.

417
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:49,269
Even though Marge Truman
has the better face.

419

What does she want with you?

421
00:33:07,578 --> 00:33:09,372
-Can I what?
-Develop film.

422
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:12,000
I mean, the way you talked
about that stink bomb,

423
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,543
thought maybe you knew
what type of chemicals

424
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:14,836
you needed in a dark room.

425
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:16,755
Can't you just send it out
to a lab?

426
00:33:16,838 --> 00:33:19,341
No. Can you help us or not?

427
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:21,092
Maybe, but why?

428
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:24,262
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you.

429
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:26,889
Try me.

430
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:30,268
So, what do you think?

431
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,395
Why did I agree to this?

432
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:33,730
I can't help her.

433
00:33:33,813 --> 00:33:35,231
Well, do you believe her?

434
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:36,983
I believe she believes it.

435
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:38,902
But when she asked me,

436
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,653
it's like my mind
just went blank.

437
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:43,531
-Love will do that to you.
-Yeah.

438
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:47,077
-Wait, what?
-Ronnie. You're sweet on her.

439
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,287
-I know the signs.
-There are no signs.

440
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,914
Sure there are.

441
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:54,042
Love can make you do
some crazy things, pal.

442
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:56,544
Like climb a balcony or... or...

443
00:33:56,627 --> 00:33:59,214
Or write a poem
on the inside of your shoe

444
00:33:59,297 --> 00:34:00,715
so no one finds out about it.

445
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,051
Who writes poems on the inside
of their shoes?

446
00:34:03,134 --> 00:34:04,385
Just someone.

447
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:07,555
Someone in love.

448
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:10,725
Okay, but I'm not
in love with Ronnie.

458
00:34:50,848 --> 00:34:52,725
No, it doesn't.

459
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:55,144
It's the oddest thing.

460
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:59,441
Before I got here, I...
I didn't remember you at all.

461
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:01,609
You really know
how to flatter a gal.

462
00:35:01,692 --> 00:35:03,444
I mean,
I didn't remember any of it.

463
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,031
-You. This town.
-You're not the first.

464

Derry's funny that way.

465
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:11,953
No matter how long
you spend here,

466
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:13,746
the further away you get,

467
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:17,458
the more it all
just seems to fade.

468
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:22,004
Some would say
it's for the best.

469
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:23,714
I don't know.

470
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:26,551
It has its charms.

471
00:35:29,637 --> 00:35:30,805
What do you remember?

472
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:33,141
Not much.

473
00:35:33,224 --> 00:35:37,645
My father, life on the base,
but mostly I remember you.

474
00:35:39,313 --> 00:35:41,983
It was one summer, Francis.
We were 12.

475
00:35:42,066 --> 00:35:44,777
I doubt you
even remembered my name.

476
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:49,782
I didn't.

477
00:35:54,203 --> 00:35:55,538
Not until this week.

478
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:00,418
You're in charge of the digs?

479
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:06,340
What are you doing
out there, Francis?

480
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:08,635
Soil surveys.

481
00:36:08,718 --> 00:36:10,428
We're trying to figure out
where to lay pipe

482
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:12,097
to bring in water
from the Kenduskeag.

483
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,015
And our community is concerned

484
00:36:14,098 --> 00:36:16,851
that your dig
will disturb sacred remains.

485
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,395
We can't allow
unmarked burial grounds

486
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:20,563
to be destroyed.

487
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,649
Then let's work together.

488
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:25,693
You can show us exactly
what areas to stay away from.

489
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:30,740
I know
it might not mean much

490
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:32,533
coming from a man
in my position,

491
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:34,911
but you can trust me.

492
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:38,831
I'd like to believe that.

493
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:44,003
I will talk to the town council.

494
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:46,881
No promises.

495
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:48,591
I'll be in touch.

496
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:56,933
It's nice to see you, Rose.

497
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,436
You too.

498
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:31,342
What's the matter?
Why do you look so sad?

499
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,596
My dad got
his redeployment orders.

500
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:37,598
We leave in the morning.

501
00:37:42,895 --> 00:37:45,147
I was gonna wait
to give this back to you, but...

502
00:37:46,357 --> 00:37:48,901
I think you should have it.
Something to remember me by.

503
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:57,952
You have to promise
me something, okay?

504
00:37:58,035 --> 00:38:01,414
Promise me you'll never
forget me, this summer,

505
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:04,750
us being... friends.

506
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,299
Francis,
you don't know this yet, but...

507
00:38:11,382 --> 00:38:13,592
this place has a way
of making people forget...

508
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:16,512
even if they don't want to.

509
00:38:44,248 --> 00:38:47,668
Holy smokes! This place
is the living end, man!

510
00:38:48,711 --> 00:38:50,505
How do you even know about it?

511
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:52,923
It's my friends' place.
Their hangout.

512
00:38:53,924 --> 00:38:55,926
Or... it was.

513
00:38:57,011 --> 00:39:00,222
No way! I love these!

514
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,225
So, how do we get this picture?

515
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:05,770
Well, I guess we could
either wait for it

516
00:39:05,853 --> 00:39:08,356
to come after us again or...
I don't know,

517
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:10,775
somehow draw it out?

518
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:13,111
What are all the ways this thing
has come after you so far?

519
00:39:13,194 --> 00:39:15,822
Matty, my dad.

520
00:39:15,905 --> 00:39:19,117
-Ronnie's mom.
-Yeah, but it's not them.

521
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,536
It's something pretending
to be them,

522
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:23,079
to scare us.

523
00:39:23,162 --> 00:39:24,163
The right question would be,

524
00:39:24,246 --> 00:39:25,873
what in the hell is it?

525
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:27,458
-It's an <i>orixá.</i>
-What?

526
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:30,003
You know, an evil spirit.

527
00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:32,713
Well, they're not all evil,
but this one sounds pretty bad.

528
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,675
How do you know?

529
00:39:35,758 --> 00:39:39,762
Well, I don't know for sure,
but my <i>tío</i> was a <i>babalao.</i>

530
00:39:41,263 --> 00:39:44,559

didn't pay back money and stuff,

533

he'd conjure this <i>orixá</i>

And the really mean ones

535

always took the form
of their dead ancestors.

536
00:40:00,116 --> 00:40:01,826
You know,
to really freak them out.

537
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:06,289

to just... conjure them?

-Starting to feel like home.

What is that?

612
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:22,711
My grand mama said it's like...

613
00:44:23,671 --> 00:44:25,881

Yeah, I know.
It sound crazy, right?

It's funny, just before,

619
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:46,402
you asked me about my son,
I felt something.

620
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:51,073
Yeah, somewhere
in the back of my brain.

621
00:44:52,783 --> 00:44:55,036
Can't describe it really,
other than it's the strangest

622

in my whole life.

623
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:58,539
And I've only felt it
one other time.

624

628
00:45:20,644 --> 00:45:22,063

You don't have
to worry about that.

What is that supposed to mean?

631
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,658
I've seen what men think about
when they're facing death.

632
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:36,535
They think about their families.
They think about their regrets.

633
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:39,204
But you?

634
00:45:41,874 --> 00:45:44,334
Gun to your head,
finger on the trigger.

635
00:45:46,003 --> 00:45:47,004
You were analyzing.

636
00:45:47,087 --> 00:45:50,632
You were just...
collecting information.

637
00:45:52,384 --> 00:45:54,428

that's supposed to be afraid,

638
00:45:54,511 --> 00:45:55,679
it's not even there.

639
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,767

655
00:47:16,802 --> 00:47:18,470

to come back quickly.

663

665

about it from my cousin, so...

666

667

00:53:58,578 --> 00:54:01,248
-Come on! Oh my God!
-Hurry, get out of there!

708
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:02,332
Come on!

709
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:13,176
-I should have believed you.
-You're damn right!

710
00:54:40,203 --> 00:54:42,789
Do you need help?

711
00:54:48,003 --> 00:54:50,923
Shit, I think I just broke
both my femurs.

712
00:54:55,677 --> 00:54:58,138
Okay, so first we're going
to set up three trays

713
00:54:58,221 --> 00:54:59,640
and a water bath.

714
00:54:59,723 --> 00:55:02,517
-Fill one tray with developer.
-Smells like Fizz-A-Lot.

715
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,810
-Can you drink these?
-No.

716
00:55:03,893 --> 00:55:07,189
One with mixer
and the other with stop bath.

717
00:55:07,272 --> 00:55:08,773
Rich, don't touch that.

718
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:12,527
Red light.

719
00:55:14,487 --> 00:55:16,573
Timer.

720
00:55:18,074 --> 00:55:20,910
And now we wait.

721
00:55:38,261 --> 00:55:39,596
Holy shit.

722
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,181
I took that.

723
00:55:41,264 --> 00:55:42,724
Guys, come on.

724
00:55:45,101 --> 00:55:46,728
Here.

725
00:55:56,988 --> 00:55:58,699
Teddy!

726
00:55:58,782 --> 00:56:01,243
We did it.

727
00:56:01,326 --> 00:56:03,954
-We actually did it.
-Oh my God.

728
00:56:04,037 --> 00:56:06,873
Come on, next one.
Let's go. Wait, this way, right?

729
00:56:06,956 --> 00:56:08,375
-No, other way.
-Okay.

730
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:09,667
Here.

731
00:56:14,506 --> 00:56:15,548
Susie!

732
00:56:17,467 --> 00:56:20,970
Yes! Oh my gosh. Oh!

733
00:56:22,555 --> 00:56:23,556
Yes.

734
00:56:25,892 --> 00:56:27,012
-Ronnie.
-I'm coming.

735
00:56:39,906 --> 00:56:41,825

I took in the crypt.

736
00:56:59,676 --> 00:57:00,969
