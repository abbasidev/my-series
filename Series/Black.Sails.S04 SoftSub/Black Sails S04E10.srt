1
00:00:11,932 --> 00:00:14,588
So, let us assume that
the measuring of you

2
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:16,786
and your proposal are done...

3
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:18,429
and that we are partners...

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,429
in a venture to acquire
and reform Nassau.

5
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:23,971
Jack went to hunt Captain Flint.

6
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:25,940
Chances are good you've
seen the last of him.

7
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:28,388
When Anne was recruiting
spies in Port Royal,

8
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,698
she met a man with an
estate in the wilderness.

9
00:00:30,723 --> 00:00:34,971
This man found it profitable to
offer his services to wealthy families

10
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:37,829
with a need to make troublesome
family members disappear.

11
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,804
What families?

12
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:41,762
Flint doesn't need to get far.

13
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:45,088
All he needs is to bury that gold
somewhere unknown and he's won.

14
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:48,182
Accept the treaty and John Silver lives.

15
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:51,498
This war, it will not be
bargained away to avoid a fight.

16
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:52,742
Even if you could kill me,

17
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,263
how are you going to explain it to her?

18
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,654
She believes in this.

19
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,651
If it costs a war to save her,
you'll have lost her anyway.

20
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,934
Even you cannot construct a story
to make her forgive you that.

21
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:05,226
Is this war more
important than her life?

22
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:09,743
Answer the question.

23
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:12,110
I wanna hear you say it.

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,653
What's to be done
with the unwanted ones?

25
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,663
The men who do not fit,

26
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:29,569
whom civilization must
prune from the vine

27
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:32,804
to protect its sense of itself.

28
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:36,944
Every culture since earliest
antiquity has survived this way,

29
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,030
defining itself by
the things it excludes.

30
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,986
So long as there is progress,

31
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:46,654
there will always be
human debris in its wake,

32
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:49,318
on the outside looking in.

33
00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:51,669
And sooner or later,

34
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,986
one must answer the question...

35
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:57,671
what becomes of them?

36
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:00,466
In London,

37
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:03,318
the solution is to call them criminals.

38
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,111
To throw them in a deep, dark hole

39
00:02:06,136 --> 00:02:08,344
and hope it never runs over.

40
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:16,111
I would argue that justice
demands we do better than that.

41
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:20,715
That a civilization is
judged not by who it excludes,

42
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:24,455
but by how it treats the excluded.

43
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:29,819
That is not what I asked.

44
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:43,569
Many of the men incarcerated
here have enemies, sir.

45
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:47,278
Such is the nature of being
anathema to the empire.

46
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:49,278
And the only way I can protect them

47
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,944
is to ensure that once they
walk through these gates,

48
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:55,318
their anonymity is protected, too.

49
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:59,319
Here, they must cease to
be... to be able to find peace.

50
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,944
I already said I'm not an enemy
of his, nor is the man who sent me.

51
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:06,310
Yes, and I believe you when
you say it. But still...

52
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:07,926
Do you know where I come from, sir?

53
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:11,069
- No, I don't.
- I come from Nassau.

54
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:20,404
My name is Tom Morgan.

55
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:26,569
I come on behalf of Long John Silver.

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,910
Have you heard of him?

57
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,949
Yes, of course.

58
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:39,006
Good.

59
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:44,715
Then I ask you again
and for the last time,

60
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:48,004
is the prisoner we
are looking for here...

61
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:49,913
or isn't he?

62
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:17,150

www.addic7ed.com

63
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:30,465
Come on!

64
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:31,735
Come on!

65
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:38,302
Ready, set.

66
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,745
Come up.

67
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,278
Quick! Get to cover!

68
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:45,759
Get on the beach!

69
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:53,723
When we make our landing, pass
word to the men I need Flint alive.

70
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,569
If he departed with the money, he's
the one who knows its whereabouts.

71
00:05:57,643 --> 00:05:59,536
What of the others, my Lord?

72
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,497
There are no others.

73
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:06,485
No quarter, Mr. Utley.

74
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:11,848
Come on, run! Go!

75
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:16,008
Get to cover!

76
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:22,883
Give me your hand!

77
00:06:26,443 --> 00:06:27,986
Give me your hand!

78
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:49,777
- Ready to starboard!
- Starboard!

79
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:51,905
Bring her about!

80
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:53,819
Back to the ship!

81
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,538
Jesus.

82
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,507
Yeah.

83
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:37,347
Make ready to take on survivors.

84
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,069
An hour ago,

85
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:47,908
we were upon a fool's errand
to capture Captain Flint

86
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:51,213
and find an island
that does not exist...

87
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,652
you're welcome for that, by the way...

88
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,152
evade a ship full of redcoats,

89
00:07:56,236 --> 00:07:57,986
fight through a ship full of pirates,

90
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,261
and somehow get past Long John Silver.

91
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:05,456
I don't know if you've noticed,

92
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:07,356
but this is considerably better luck

93
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:09,830
than you and I have experienced lately.

94
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,669
And yet somehow, I get the sense

95
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:13,986
you and I are possessed
of different instincts

96
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:16,152
as to how to react to this.

97
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,902
How would you like to react to it?

98
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:20,335
Throw him in a sack,
sail away from here,

99
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,318
let the Guthrie woman and her
lawyers deal with the governor,

100
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,319
and be alive come tomorrow.

101
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:32,840
He's headed for open water.

102
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,793
I noticed.

103
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,782
He has everything he came for?

104
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,527
We were at the camp.

105
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:47,986
They told me you brought the
cache to ransom for her life.

106
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,922
It's in the ground.

107
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:51,275
Ashore.

108
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:54,173
I'm the only one who knows where.

109
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:57,475
It comes out when Madi is safe,

110
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,117
when the governor is dead or captured,

111
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:03,723
and when we are ready to
return together to the camp

112
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:06,418
to resume the war to which
we all committed ourselves.

113
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:09,250
Then and only then.

114
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:11,928
Can you live with that?

115
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:19,625
She runs or she wants
room to fight this out?

116
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,610
You've met the man. What do you think?

117
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:28,922
He'll never stop until we're
all hanging in his square.

118
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,055
Unless we defeat him today, together.

119
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:39,438
Get us underway and ready the guns.

120
00:09:39,463 --> 00:09:42,027
- Make ready the guns!
- We should speak.

121
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:43,789
The three of us.

122
00:09:57,827 --> 00:09:59,443
Woodes Rogers isn't
going to receive a letter

123
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:01,694
from anyone's lawyer
informing him I've beaten him.

124
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,263
I'm going to tell him so.

125
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:04,902
- Jack...
- I want my money back.

126
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:06,694
If it takes rescuing the girl
to get Flint to dig it up,

127
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:09,111
then, Augustus, you and I are
in the rescuing business today.

128
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:10,788
Get us after that ship.

129
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:32,514
Well, here I am. What
exactly is on the agenda?

130
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,294
Where did you go?

131
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:40,545
You were to follow us to the camp.

132
00:10:41,985 --> 00:10:43,294
Your ship disappears...

133
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,961
and then you arrive here as
though none of it happened.

134
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:51,859
Before we discuss anything else,
I wanna know where you went.

135
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:56,812
I went to Philadelphia...

136
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:59,003
to see Joseph Guthrie.

137
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:02,250
You went to see Joseph Guthrie?

138
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:06,922
I presented him with a
plan to join our cause.

139
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:11,069
Every rebellion can use a wealthy
convert or two early in the game.

140
00:11:11,362 --> 00:11:13,071
What did he say?

141
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,584
He politely passed.

142
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:21,134
Anne remained to be
tended to in the city.

143
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,726
Max with her.

144
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:25,152
Now that we're all caught up,

145
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:28,437
might we agree there are
more pressing issues at hand?

146
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:31,024
Namely, what we intend to do from here.

147
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:35,586
I intend to assume command here,

148
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:38,861
pursue the governor, and
capture his ship whole.

149
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:40,544
Is that so?

150
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:43,467
We'll need to take her without
the use of our great guns.

151
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:46,152
It will be technically
beyond your capacities.

152
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:48,930
Without the guns? Why would you...

153
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:51,508
It would put Madi's
life at greater risk.

154
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:55,586
Securing her alive is
all that matters today.

155
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,873
Return her, him,

156
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:01,779
and the cache back to the camp intact

157
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,318
along with the governor
defeated and in chains.

158
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,236
And news of it will travel far and wide.

159
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:10,297
The war will be fully,

160
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:13,964
undeniably, and maybe
unstoppably underway.

161
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:17,576
Victory here today changes everything

162
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:19,194
for everyone forever.

163
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:23,437
And it is most likely to
happen under my direction.

164
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,976
Do you have anything to say about this?

165
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:37,225
He's right.

166
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:42,943
And you know it.

167
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,487
You people.

168
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,876
We need to watch him.

169
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:22,653
The governor is the danger ahead of us.

170
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:24,861
But if he has a chance

171
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:26,944
to put knives in our backs
for the money, he'll do it.

172
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:28,684
You don't think I know that?

173
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,877
What the hell is this?

174
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,694
You cannot honestly
believe that placating me

175
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:40,318
is going to repair
what's been broken here.

176
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,278
I absolutely think
that it is repairable.

177
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,236
And no one is placating anyone.

178
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:48,011
Then what exactly is it
you think you're doing here?

179
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,995
I know what it's like...

180
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,713
to have lost her.

181
00:13:55,394 --> 00:14:00,205
And then seeing a way to have her back.

182
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:05,438
I understand what
that must've felt like.

183
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:13,319
You asked me once what I would do,

184
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:15,819
what I would sacrifice

185
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:18,774
if it meant having Thomas back again.

186
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:28,735
I honestly don't know...
what I would've done.

187
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:33,540
I honestly couldn't say I
wouldn't have done what you did.

188
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,194
I told you I'd see you through this.

189
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:46,345
Put things back together again
so that we can move forward.

190
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:50,466
I meant it.

191
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:34,352
Please know...

192
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,883
I was so conflicted about
all this when it began.

193
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:46,320
I knew it would be
difficult to separate them...

194
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,810
Flint and Silver.

195
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:52,694
They'd grown so close, it was
hard to know where one ended

196
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,380
and the other began.

197
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:03,482
I worried that the act of separating
them might destroy them both...

198
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:08,560
when what I wanted was to remove Flint.

199
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:12,427
And I saw no other way.

200
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:21,785
But the things I've done
in the pursuit of it...

201
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:27,887
were intended to honor my oath.

202
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:32,270
But somehow, here I am now.

203
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:40,170
What I've just done...

204
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,636
there's no coming back from that.

205
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:57,045
There is no difference
between Flint and Silver now.

206
00:16:57,944 --> 00:16:59,318
Or between Flint and any of them.

207
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,662
They are all enemies of mine.

208
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,912
Now, I believe they
are outmatched today.

209
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:10,652
I believe at the end of the day,

210
00:17:10,735 --> 00:17:13,193
there will be no more
of them left alive.

211
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:18,763
But if somehow...

212
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:22,388
they are able to prevail
today against us...

213
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:25,919
fight their way through
the British soldiers above,

214
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,044
through the governor, through me...

215
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,027
I will ensure that at the end of it all,

216
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:33,861
when they walk through this final door,

217
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:35,318
there is defeat awaiting them.

218
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,654
You think killing me
means defeat for them?

219
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:45,621
You will have given them
a martyr to unite them.

220
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,352
Still no sign of her.

221
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:41,526
Thought he'd try to block us in ahead.

222
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:43,532
He's out there.

223
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,696
Maybe there, ready to loose his
guns once we clear the mouth.

224
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:53,318
We should veer to starboard
as far as is possible

225
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,133
and be prepared to take fire when we do.

226
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:19,555
The captain suggests Eurydice

227
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,203
is likely lying in wait
beyond that headland.

228
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:25,320
We should take measures
to prepare for it.

229
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,318
In the meantime,

230
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:32,799
why don't you tell me what the
fuck you're actually doing here?

231
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:37,568
You presented a plan
to the Guthrie family

232
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:39,769
to bolster piracy in Nassau...

233
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:42,713
with Max at your side?

234
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:46,651
I sincerely doubt you'd
go along with any plan

235
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,174
that promised support for the account.

236
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,080
And from there,

237
00:19:52,577 --> 00:19:55,277
my questions only multiply.

238
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,643
Which is probably not a
state you want to leave me in.

239
00:20:04,784 --> 00:20:07,734
A state of multiplying questions.

240
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:10,573
I suppose that makes two of us.

241
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,318
Because there is something in the air

242
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,901
between you and your friend up there.

243
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:20,966
It's just tension between
steadfast partners.

244
00:20:23,027 --> 00:20:24,606
Or it's something else.

245
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:31,706
We could suffer under the weight
of our respective questions.

246
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:37,602
Or would you like to
start trading answers?

247
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:21,273
Helm!

248
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:22,776
Hard to starboard!

249
00:21:22,777 --> 00:21:24,734
Put the wind on the port quarter.

250
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:26,901
Mr. Featherstone, set the foresail,

251
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:28,901
Trim as we alter course.

252
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,442
What's happening?

253
00:21:30,443 --> 00:21:32,095
We're gonna get hit.

254
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:45,525
My Lord, shall we withdraw
in favor of a wider approach?

255
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:47,277
No.

256
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:48,898
I beg your pardon, sir,

257
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:50,734
but there are easier ways
to attempt to board her.

258
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:52,679
I do not wish to board her.

259
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:55,492
I wish to cause confusion
and terror amongst her men.

260
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:57,204
I wish to shatter their spirits.

261
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:58,686
I wish to break them.

262
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:01,585
And then I wish to board her.

263
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:04,853
Keep her main mast aligned over the bow.

264
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:07,111
Bow guns we fire at will.

265
00:22:12,443 --> 00:22:14,318
- Fire!
- Take cover!

266
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,318
Helm, prepare to come
hard over to starboard.

267
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,501
Helm, prepare to come
hard over to starboard!

268
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,751
Now!

269
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:29,000
Brace for impact!

270
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:30,558
Brace for impact!

271
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,073
Target the rail!

272
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,442
Target the rail!

273
00:23:06,443 --> 00:23:08,526
Come on, men, fire at will!

274
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:10,519
Take cover!

275
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:14,727
Stay down!

276
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:26,504
Ready the rest of the men.

277
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,661
And lead them over the
stern. Board them at the helm.

278
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,685
The helm?

279
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,415
Just get them ready.

280
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,341
When you're on-board, get
below decks and find Madi.

281
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:40,532
Where are you going?

282
00:23:40,557 --> 00:23:42,263
To turn us around.

283
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,492
Musket!

284
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:53,357
You.

285
00:23:54,036 --> 00:23:55,755
Join the muskets on the foremast.

286
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:01,827
Musket. Reload!

287
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,770
Target on the quarterdeck!

288
00:25:13,075 --> 00:25:15,363
- We broken away!
- Yeah!

289
00:25:17,442 --> 00:25:19,255
Hooks at the ready!

290
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,481
You load that now.

291
00:25:33,903 --> 00:25:35,535
Come on, men!

292
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:37,005
Come on!

293
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:12,611
What are you doing down here?

294
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:18,853
Are you a fucking coward?

295
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,345
P-please, sir.

296
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:24,560
I'm just the cook.

297
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:42,127
You had a prisoner here.

298
00:29:46,544 --> 00:29:48,542
Is she still alive?

299
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:53,886
Is she still alive?!

300
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,797
Don't worry.

301
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,434
No one's going under the ship today.

302
00:33:42,536 --> 00:33:45,224
Though, the thought had crossed my mind.

303
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:51,456
No, I'm quite certain I
can do better than that.

304
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,983
I'll need cutting away completely.

305
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:07,332
Time is of the essence
for what happens next.

306
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,207
Take the better part of a day,
maybe two, to secure the chest.

307
00:34:13,754 --> 00:34:17,773
Captain Rackham will ferry you
back to the camp aboard the Lion

308
00:34:17,798 --> 00:34:19,255
to relay the news.

309
00:34:19,256 --> 00:34:21,332
I'd like to stay, actually.

310
00:34:23,218 --> 00:34:26,252
To help see the chest secured properly.

311
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:31,129
Mr. Featherstone can see
her back aboard the Eurydice.

312
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:35,987
Provided the majority of men
crewing the Lion are ours, not yours,

313
00:34:36,012 --> 00:34:38,880
and you remain on the ship
while we retrieve the chest.

314
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,071
Yes?

315
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,462
Let's go.

316
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:00,960
We'll rest up here.

317
00:36:03,215 --> 00:36:04,968
I can keep going.

318
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:07,483
We'll rest here.

319
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:31,373
You really are getting
nimble on that thing.

320
00:36:33,414 --> 00:36:35,922
Pain is an exceptional tutor.

321
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:37,456
Hmm.

322
00:36:40,373 --> 00:36:42,656
We won't be going any farther.

323
00:36:44,756 --> 00:36:46,354
Won't we?

324
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,838
I won't take another
step towards that chest

325
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:53,462
until I know for certain that I'm wrong

326
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:56,097
about what I suspect is happening here.

327
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:57,566
I don't know what you're talking about.

328
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,503
Please don't do that.

329
00:37:07,466 --> 00:37:09,874
And what is it you think is happening?

330
00:37:13,256 --> 00:37:14,733
I show you the chest,

331
00:37:14,758 --> 00:37:17,256
the chest is brought
out of the ground...

332
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,921
and then...

333
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:23,255
I don't know what then exactly,

334
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:28,456
but I doubt it involves returning
it to the camp as planned.

335
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:35,664
Am I wrong?

336
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,769
Tell me I am and we'll
continue on our way.

337
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,622
And then what?

338
00:37:53,756 --> 00:37:55,539
This war...

339
00:37:58,055 --> 00:37:59,916
your war...

340
00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:04,541
her war...

341
00:38:09,923 --> 00:38:12,456
Julius will be no obstacle to it.

342
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:16,640
As long as you and she stand for it...

343
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,155
as long as the treasure powers it...

344
00:38:21,256 --> 00:38:23,706
nothing can stop it from beginning now.

345
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:27,944
Nothing but you.

346
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:35,561
Why would you want to do that?

347
00:38:43,876 --> 00:38:45,992
This is what it would be.

348
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:51,702
Time after time after time.

349
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,872
Endlessly.

350
00:38:57,006 --> 00:38:59,255
The measuring of lives...

351
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:02,028
and loves and spirits...

352
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,825
so that they may be
wagered in a grand game.

353
00:39:05,985 --> 00:39:09,458
How much ransom can be
afforded for the cause?

354
00:39:10,256 --> 00:39:13,998
How many casualties can
be tolerated for the cause?

355
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:17,364
How much loss?

356
00:39:21,006 --> 00:39:22,869
That isn't a war.

357
00:39:24,256 --> 00:39:26,580
That is a fucking nightmare.

358
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,548
And I cannot take a single step
towards leaving this forest...

359
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,375
till I know it's over.

360
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:48,484
This is how they survive.

361
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:54,255
You must know this.

362
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,456
You're too smart not to know this.

363
00:40:06,357 --> 00:40:09,258
They paint the world full of shadows...

364
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:13,534
and then tell their children
to stay close to the light.

365
00:40:14,593 --> 00:40:16,040
Their light.

366
00:40:17,006 --> 00:40:19,962
Their reasons, their judgments.

367
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:25,436
Because in the darkness,
there be dragons.

368
00:40:27,496 --> 00:40:29,469
But it isn't true.

369
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:35,206
We can prove that it isn't true.

370
00:40:36,798 --> 00:40:39,546
In the dark, there is discovery,

371
00:40:39,743 --> 00:40:41,797
there is possibility,

372
00:40:41,798 --> 00:40:46,968
there is freedom in the dark

373
00:40:46,993 --> 00:40:49,038
once someone has illuminated it.

374
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:53,088
And who has been so close to
doing it as we are right now?

375
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:54,883
This isn't about England...

376
00:40:58,464 --> 00:41:00,188
or her king...

377
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:03,063
or our freedom, or any of it.

378
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:07,429
When I thought Madi was gone,

379
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:09,439
I saw... for the first time,

380
00:41:09,464 --> 00:41:12,481
I saw the world through your eyes.

381
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:16,561
A world in which there
is nothing left to lose.

382
00:41:18,404 --> 00:41:21,604
I felt the need to make
sense of the loss...

383
00:41:22,672 --> 00:41:24,842
to impart meaning to it...

384
00:41:25,428 --> 00:41:27,442
whatever the cost.

385
00:41:27,497 --> 00:41:30,244
To exalt her memory with battles...

386
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:31,926
and victories.

387
00:41:34,935 --> 00:41:36,850
But beneath all of that,

388
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:39,284
I recognized the other thing...

389
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:41,994
hiding in the spaces.

390
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:45,932
The one whose shape you first showed me.

391
00:41:47,943 --> 00:41:49,859
And when asked,

392
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:53,135
it was honest about the
role it wanted to play.

393
00:41:56,256 --> 00:41:58,123
It was rage.

394
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,432
And it just wanted
to see the world burn.

395
00:42:14,895 --> 00:42:17,512
I see a life for myself with her.

396
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,172
And I will not live it
wondering if tomorrow

397
00:42:21,173 --> 00:42:24,706
is the day your nightmare
finally takes her away for good.

398
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:30,871
So, what next, then?

399
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:34,546
What decisions have you made

400
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:37,622
about what our tomorrows will be?

401
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:43,403
I made arrangements...

402
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:47,323
to ensure that when we leave here,

403
00:42:47,348 --> 00:42:49,255
it is with compromises in place

404
00:42:49,256 --> 00:42:52,363
that will diffuse any threat
of widespread rebellion.

405
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:57,869
All this will be for nothing.

406
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:04,206
We will have been for nothing.

407
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,107
Defined by their histories...

408
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,834
distorted to fit into their narrative...

409
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,170
until all that is left of us...

410
00:43:20,795 --> 00:43:24,245
are the monsters in the stories
they tell their children.

411
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:30,325
I don't care.

412
00:43:33,256 --> 00:43:34,795
You will.

413
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,526
Someday, you will.

414
00:43:42,798 --> 00:43:44,331
Someday.

415
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:49,733
Even if you can persuade
her to keep you...

416
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:53,206
she'll no longer be enough.

417
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,116
And the comfort will grow stale.

418
00:43:58,923 --> 00:44:01,005
And casting about in the dark

419
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:04,255
for some proof that you mattered

420
00:44:04,256 --> 00:44:07,233
and finding none, you'll know...

421
00:44:09,215 --> 00:44:11,258
that you gave it away...

422
00:44:11,283 --> 00:44:13,066
in this moment...

423
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:16,179
on this island.

424
00:44:18,506 --> 00:44:20,497
Left it in the ground...

425
00:44:21,297 --> 00:44:23,647
along with that chest.

426
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:34,129
This is not what I wanted.

427
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,911
But I will stand here with you...

428
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,184
for an hour,

429
00:44:42,574 --> 00:44:44,733
a day, a year...

430
00:44:46,006 --> 00:44:49,348
while you find a way to
accept this outcome...

431
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:53,427
so that we might leave here together.

432
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,075
For if not...

433
00:45:01,521 --> 00:45:04,184
then I must end this another way.

434
00:46:27,648 --> 00:46:29,855
Captain Flint is gone.

435
00:46:35,256 --> 00:46:36,689
Gone?

436
00:46:37,485 --> 00:46:39,173
Gone where?

437
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:41,915
Retired from the account.

438
00:46:42,672 --> 00:46:47,015
He was persuaded that his
efforts were no longer viable,

439
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,876
that those closest to him
had grown tired of them.

440
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,821
And of him.

441
00:46:54,631 --> 00:46:58,456
He then chose to walk away from it all.

442
00:46:59,687 --> 00:47:02,118
He's no longer a concern of ours.

443
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,630
This sounds somewhat less definitive
an end than I had expected.

444
00:47:07,655 --> 00:47:10,397
But far more effective.

445
00:47:11,256 --> 00:47:14,449
For if our intent was
to extinguish his war,

446
00:47:14,474 --> 00:47:16,723
feeding it a martyr

447
00:47:16,748 --> 00:47:19,698
seems like an odd way of going about it.

448
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:21,963
Flint had allies

449
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,767
who would've only been
emboldened by his death.

450
00:47:27,256 --> 00:47:28,963
Some of whom, had they the desire,

451
00:47:28,964 --> 00:47:32,172
could and would have
fought his war without him

452
00:47:32,173 --> 00:47:34,304
to honor his memory.

453
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:39,963
Instead of a martyr,
we have fed it a story,

454
00:47:39,964 --> 00:47:45,255
a tragedy that diffused
their fighting spirit,

455
00:47:45,256 --> 00:47:49,949
and enabled the more
moderate voices among them

456
00:47:49,974 --> 00:47:53,674
to press for a more moderate solution.

457
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,801
What is that?

458
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,081
A treaty.

459
00:48:02,855 --> 00:48:06,273
Its terms conceived by Governor Rogers.

460
00:48:06,297 --> 00:48:09,995
Its terms agreed to by
the Maroon leaders...

461
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:13,797
over a few scattered objections.

462
00:48:21,505 --> 00:48:23,255
I can tell you whatever
it is you want to hear

463
00:48:23,256 --> 00:48:25,418
about Flint's whereabouts.

464
00:48:25,443 --> 00:48:27,018
He's dead.

465
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,478
He's retired.

466
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:32,922
The truth of it matters not at all.

467
00:48:32,923 --> 00:48:36,421
The truth is there will be no
Maroon War in the West Indies

468
00:48:36,422 --> 00:48:39,935
because the Maroons
themselves have agreed to it.

469
00:48:46,305 --> 00:48:48,255
All that remains, then,

470
00:48:48,256 --> 00:48:51,601
is for you to purchase
Woodes Rogers' debts.

471
00:48:52,336 --> 00:48:54,671
Force his default and incarceration

472
00:48:54,672 --> 00:48:56,671
and see him replaced with a new governor

473
00:48:56,672 --> 00:48:59,255
who will honor these terms.

474
00:49:09,662 --> 00:49:13,013
You asked for proof of
Captain Flint's removal.

475
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:15,955
I cannot give it to you.

476
00:49:16,923 --> 00:49:19,255
But this is a meaningful assurance

477
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,849
that the pirate threat is no more.

478
00:49:24,332 --> 00:49:27,573
You asked for a governor
I would call husband.

479
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:30,867
I cannot give that to you either.

480
00:49:32,745 --> 00:49:35,059
But I have given you a candidate

481
00:49:35,084 --> 00:49:38,831
whose trustworthiness I can guarantee.

482
00:49:40,256 --> 00:49:42,331
What candidate?

483
00:49:45,506 --> 00:49:48,237
You want me to administrate Nassau?

484
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,630
These are the terms under
which it will happen.

485
00:49:50,631 --> 00:49:53,214
They are the best I can offer.

486
00:49:54,139 --> 00:49:56,698
Are they acceptable to you?

487
00:50:08,544 --> 00:50:10,286
Just one more thing.

488
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:19,214
Small favor to ask...

489
00:50:19,215 --> 00:50:21,255
before the ink dries

490
00:50:21,256 --> 00:50:24,106
on whatever it is you've agreed upon.

491
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:27,338
Once the demand for
repayment has been made

492
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:30,832
and his default recorded
and the warrant sworn,

493
00:50:30,857 --> 00:50:32,682
there will be a trial.

494
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:35,863
And at that trial,

495
00:50:35,888 --> 00:50:39,400
the court will solicit
affidavits from his creditors.

496
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:44,456
Affidavits that will shape the
official narrative of the default.

497
00:50:47,315 --> 00:50:48,963
The failure.

498
00:50:48,964 --> 00:50:50,878
The humiliation.

499
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:53,671
For a man like Woodes Rogers,

500
00:50:53,672 --> 00:50:57,894
how difficult that will
be... to sit helpless

501
00:50:58,136 --> 00:51:03,005
while history records
such an unflattering end

502
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:06,034
to what was once such a promising story.

503
00:51:10,256 --> 00:51:12,585
I suppose what I'm asking is...

504
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:15,696
once the time comes to
submit that affidavit,

505
00:51:15,721 --> 00:51:18,338
I'd so love to help you write it.

506
00:51:54,256 --> 00:51:55,664
Leave.

507
00:51:58,464 --> 00:51:59,872
No.

508
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,630
The treaty is being ratified.

509
00:52:07,714 --> 00:52:10,745
The chiefs from the other
camps will be leaving shortly,

510
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,206
along with the pirate crews.

511
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,456
The war is over.

512
00:52:21,034 --> 00:52:22,502
Yes.

513
00:52:33,448 --> 00:52:35,648
I don't know why you did this.

514
00:52:37,798 --> 00:52:39,937
But I know you did this.

515
00:52:41,665 --> 00:52:44,838
Sent me away from that
island so I would not see it.

516
00:52:45,103 --> 00:52:48,623
Emboldened Julius so
I could not oppose it.

517
00:52:48,648 --> 00:52:50,515
Orchestrated it.

518
00:52:53,881 --> 00:52:57,577
Don't you dare insult
me by denying this.

519
00:53:00,881 --> 00:53:03,718
Flint's war could only have one result.

520
00:53:05,256 --> 00:53:07,101
A life of loss...

521
00:53:07,633 --> 00:53:09,334
and misery...

522
00:53:10,173 --> 00:53:12,214
and fruitless sacrifice.

523
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:15,047
- I had to stop it.
- You had to stop it?

524
00:53:15,117 --> 00:53:16,900
And I'm not sorry for it.

525
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:20,218
I lost you once.

526
00:53:21,215 --> 00:53:22,956
I would not do it again.

527
00:53:29,648 --> 00:53:32,599
Captain Flint didn't retire from this.

528
00:53:33,288 --> 00:53:35,602
It was important that they heard that,

529
00:53:35,627 --> 00:53:38,077
but they didn't know him like you do.

530
00:53:39,357 --> 00:53:41,681
I won't insult you by repeating it.

531
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:46,866
He trusted you.

532
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:49,736
He was your friend.

533
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:52,450
And you killed him.

534
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:56,456
No.

535
00:54:00,497 --> 00:54:03,030
I did not kill Captain Flint.

536
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:08,671
I unmade him.

537
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:16,150
The man you know could
never let go of his war.

538
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:19,505
For if he were to
exclude it from himself,

539
00:54:19,661 --> 00:54:22,361
he would not be able
to understand himself.

540
00:54:23,964 --> 00:54:27,400
So I had to return him to
an earlier state of being.

541
00:54:29,372 --> 00:54:31,780
One in which he could
function without the war.

542
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:34,743
Without the violence.

543
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:37,360
Without us.

544
00:54:40,256 --> 00:54:42,998
Captain Flint was born
out of great tragedy.

545
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,496
You know this.

546
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:47,304
I told you this.

547
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,912
I found a way to reach into the past...

548
00:54:52,737 --> 00:54:54,437
and undo it.

549
00:54:58,661 --> 00:55:01,361
There is a place near Savannah...

550
00:55:02,297 --> 00:55:04,421
where men unjustly imprisoned in England

551
00:55:04,422 --> 00:55:06,561
are sent in secret.

552
00:55:08,756 --> 00:55:11,427
An internment far more humane,

553
00:55:11,452 --> 00:55:13,486
but no less secure.

554
00:55:14,422 --> 00:55:17,100
Men who enter these
gates never leave them.

555
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,494
To the rest of the world,

556
00:55:23,299 --> 00:55:25,580
they simply cease to be.

557
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,025
I don't believe you.

558
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,255
I don't believe this.

559
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:36,449
Flint would have fought to
the death before allowing it.

560
00:55:36,474 --> 00:55:38,007
He resisted...

561
00:55:39,113 --> 00:55:40,697
at first.

562
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,783
But then I told him what else
I had heard about this place.

563
00:55:47,297 --> 00:55:50,255
I was told prominent families
amongst London society

564
00:55:50,256 --> 00:55:52,244
made use of it.

565
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:56,721
I was told the governor
in Carolina made use of it.

566
00:55:58,338 --> 00:56:00,255
So I sent a man to find out

567
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:04,081
if they'd used it to hide
away one particular prisoner.

568
00:56:05,131 --> 00:56:07,456
He returned with news.

569
00:56:10,006 --> 00:56:12,872
Thomas Hamilton was there.

570
00:56:15,215 --> 00:56:17,259
He disbelieved me.

571
00:56:17,525 --> 00:56:19,642
He continued to resist.

572
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:23,226
And corralling him took great effort.

573
00:56:24,916 --> 00:56:26,463
But the closer we got to Savannah,

574
00:56:26,464 --> 00:56:28,923
his resistance began to diminish.

575
00:56:30,737 --> 00:56:32,521
I couldn't say why.

576
00:56:33,174 --> 00:56:34,975
I wasn't expecting it.

577
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:37,702
Perhaps he'd finally reached

578
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,647
the limits of his
physical ability to fight.

579
00:56:41,085 --> 00:56:45,369
Or perhaps as the promise of
seeing Thomas got closer...

580
00:56:46,215 --> 00:56:48,372
he grew more comfortable
letting go of this man

581
00:56:48,397 --> 00:56:51,068
he created in response to his loss.

582
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:57,858
The man whose mind I had
come to know so well...

583
00:56:59,256 --> 00:57:04,022
whose mind I'd in some ways
incorporated into my own.

584
00:57:06,135 --> 00:57:09,544
It was a strange experience
to see something from it...

585
00:57:10,923 --> 00:57:12,779
so unexpected.

586
00:57:15,256 --> 00:57:17,297
I choose to believe it...

587
00:57:18,256 --> 00:57:21,032
because it wasn't the man
I had come to know at all...

588
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:25,664
but one who existed beforehand...

589
00:57:27,435 --> 00:57:29,343
waking from a long...

590
00:57:30,455 --> 00:57:32,454
and terrible nightmare.

591
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:42,235
Reorienting to the daylight...

592
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,588
and the world as it existed

593
00:57:48,589 --> 00:57:51,197
before he first closed his eyes...

594
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:05,881
letting the memory of
the nightmare fade away.

595
01:00:27,258 --> 01:00:29,666
You may think what you want of me.

596
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:37,030
I will draw comfort in the knowledge
that you're alive to think it.

597
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:42,444
But I'm not the villain you fear I am.

598
01:00:44,938 --> 01:00:46,694
I'm not him.

599
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:02,768
You sent a man...

600
01:01:04,804 --> 01:01:06,963
to investigate this place?

601
01:01:08,263 --> 01:01:09,671
Yes.

602
01:01:13,488 --> 01:01:17,927
And he did this and
returned to Nassau...

603
01:01:19,173 --> 01:01:21,770
all before the Spanish arrived?

604
01:01:24,154 --> 01:01:25,571
Yes.

605
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,000
You didn't just betray my trust.

606
01:01:36,524 --> 01:01:38,883
You have planned to betray it...

607
01:01:40,339 --> 01:01:42,196
all that time.

608
01:01:50,742 --> 01:01:52,276
Get out.

609
01:01:58,205 --> 01:02:00,480
The pirates will be leaving here.

610
01:02:01,705 --> 01:02:03,405
The chiefs.

611
01:02:06,006 --> 01:02:07,738
But I will stay.

612
01:02:09,566 --> 01:02:11,100
And I will wait.

613
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:14,664
A day...

614
01:02:15,923 --> 01:02:17,373
a month...

615
01:02:18,624 --> 01:02:20,186
a year...

616
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:23,580
forever...

617
01:02:27,123 --> 01:02:30,748
in the hopes that you will
understand why I did what I did.

618
01:02:34,868 --> 01:02:36,443
Get out.

619
01:03:06,479 --> 01:03:08,679
A story is true.

620
01:03:09,881 --> 01:03:11,729
A story is untrue.

621
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:19,713
As time extends,

622
01:03:19,714 --> 01:03:22,996
it matters less and less.

623
01:03:25,881 --> 01:03:29,338
The stories we want to believe...

624
01:03:30,486 --> 01:03:32,735
those are the ones that survive,

625
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,696
despite upheaval and transition

626
01:03:35,721 --> 01:03:38,369
and progress.

627
01:03:42,256 --> 01:03:46,630
Those are the stories
that shape history.

628
01:03:48,089 --> 01:03:51,654
And then what does it matter
if it was true when it was born?

629
01:03:51,701 --> 01:03:55,879
It's found truth in its maturity,

630
01:03:55,904 --> 01:03:58,365
which if a virtue in man
ought to be no less so

631
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:00,479
for the things men create.

632
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:05,084
As this relates to your
question specifically...

633
01:04:09,877 --> 01:04:12,255
I'm sorry. Remind me, what was
your question, specifically?

634
01:04:12,256 --> 01:04:14,255
- Long John Silver.
- Long John Silver, yes.

635
01:04:14,256 --> 01:04:15,963
Please forgive me.

636
01:04:15,964 --> 01:04:18,088
I will go on from time to time,

637
01:04:18,089 --> 01:04:20,255
but generally in the
service of thoroughness

638
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:22,508
and always with the best of intentions.

639
01:04:22,533 --> 01:04:24,172
I appreciate your indulging me.

640
01:04:24,173 --> 01:04:27,255
No need. I was drawn in.

641
01:04:35,573 --> 01:04:38,049
Long John Silver's story...

642
01:04:39,032 --> 01:04:40,955
is a hard one to know.

643
01:04:46,859 --> 01:04:50,182
The men who believed
most deeply in it...

644
01:04:53,412 --> 01:04:56,404
were ultimately destroyed by it.

645
01:05:12,256 --> 01:05:16,193
And those who stood to
benefit most from it...

646
01:05:17,256 --> 01:05:20,052
were the most eager
to leave it all behind.

647
01:05:36,881 --> 01:05:39,880
Until all that remains of any of it...

648
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:43,255
are stories bearing only
a passing resemblance

649
01:05:43,256 --> 01:05:45,588
to the world the rest of us lived in.

650
01:05:49,357 --> 01:05:51,390
A world we survived.

651
01:05:54,471 --> 01:05:56,588
A world that is no more.

652
01:05:59,306 --> 01:06:02,214
I hear it ain't altogether over.

653
01:06:02,215 --> 01:06:05,476
I hear there are still
men on the account here

654
01:06:05,501 --> 01:06:07,656
under the blessing of the governor.

655
01:06:07,681 --> 01:06:10,130
I hear he allows for it...

656
01:06:10,131 --> 01:06:14,407
as long as it helps drive up
prices for the merchants here.

657
01:06:15,615 --> 01:06:19,273
I hear he allows you to
continue the practice.

658
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:22,382
That's why I came.

659
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,437
Two things you must know

660
01:06:25,462 --> 01:06:27,765
if you're gonna be
spending time here with us.

661
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,338
One, the governor.

662
01:06:29,339 --> 01:06:31,255
Lovely man. Dear friend.

663
01:06:31,256 --> 01:06:34,773
Might be the hero given
credit for the Maroon truce,

664
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:37,130
bringing peace to the West Indies,

665
01:06:37,131 --> 01:06:39,633
and finally, at long last,

666
01:06:39,658 --> 01:06:42,579
bringing law and order to Nassau.

667
01:06:44,256 --> 01:06:46,476
But let's just say he had some help.

668
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:48,697
And the true power here...

669
01:06:48,722 --> 01:06:52,946
is a little more complicated than that.

670
01:07:05,964 --> 01:07:07,755
And two,

671
01:07:07,842 --> 01:07:10,919
there is, by law...

672
01:07:12,568 --> 01:07:15,933
and strict enforcement
of the administration,

673
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,713
no piracy in Nassau.

674
01:07:17,714 --> 01:07:20,232
Not anymore. Not ever.

675
01:07:21,444 --> 01:07:22,880
It's critical for commerce.

676
01:07:22,881 --> 01:07:25,218
This is known to the world.

677
01:07:25,972 --> 01:07:27,687
Meet me at the jetty.

678
01:07:44,637 --> 01:07:46,713
Are we ready to depart?

679
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:58,306
Don't remember talking
about bringing on new people.

680
01:07:58,331 --> 01:07:59,797
Ah, we didn't.

681
01:07:59,798 --> 01:08:01,503
Oh, I know we didn't.

682
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:04,130
He's come from the continent.

683
01:08:04,155 --> 01:08:06,188
Served with the regulars in the war.

684
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:12,370
Mark. Mark Read.

685
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:27,416
You could be more
welcoming to new people.

686
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,113
Would it hurt?

687
01:08:29,308 --> 01:08:31,255
Planning on bringing them all on?

688
01:08:31,256 --> 01:08:32,872
All of who?

689
01:08:34,881 --> 01:08:36,255
All the fools that have heard

690
01:08:36,256 --> 01:08:39,324
you may know where to find
Captain Flint's treasure.

691
01:08:40,422 --> 01:08:43,277
The ones thinking you may
go looking for it again.

692
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:46,004
Thinking you'll make them rich.

693
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:51,533
The ones I worry might
just convince you to do it.

694
01:08:53,089 --> 01:08:55,255
I've chased Captain Flint's treasure.

695
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,421
I've had Captain Flint's treasure.

696
01:08:57,422 --> 01:08:59,202
It never ends well.

697
01:08:59,964 --> 01:09:02,577
Rather than rush off after it again...

698
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:06,080
maybe let's just do this a while longer.

699
01:09:07,756 --> 01:09:09,155
Maybe...

700
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,307
Oh, is that it?

701
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:23,169
Still don't understand what
was wrong with the one we had.

702
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,963
Because what's it all for
if it goes unremembered?

703
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:32,630
It's the art that leaves the mark.

704
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:37,316
But to leave it, it must... transcend.

705
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:41,541
It must speak for itself.

706
01:09:44,756 --> 01:09:46,598
It must be true.

707
01:10:02,173 --> 01:10:03,717
It's fine.

708
01:10:07,568 --> 01:10:09,055
It's fine.

709
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:13,047
Get us underway.
