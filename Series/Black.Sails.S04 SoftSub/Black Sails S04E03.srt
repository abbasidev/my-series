1
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:15,359
My grandfather is one of the
wealthiest men in the New World.

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,095
If I plead our case
and gain his support,

3
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:19,831
that might be all we need
to emerge from this intact.

4
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:23,001
I alone am to be left in
charge of Nassau's security.

5
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:25,678
And I gave our lord
governor my solemn oath

6
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:27,080
that I would see it protected.

7
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:29,474
Israel Hands.

8
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:31,676
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

9
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:33,444
- You want to withdraw?
- If we don't,

10
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:35,480
it will be the end of
whatever trust exists

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,381
between us and the slaves on the island.

12
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:39,355
I'm through following you down a path

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,576
only you seem able to see.

14
00:00:40,652 --> 00:00:42,153
Fire!

15
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:46,993
The neighboring estates must've
heard the guns and rallied.

16
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:48,860
We need to be gone before
that militia arrives.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,054
I board the sloop and I run.

18
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,789
The door will be open for you to reach
your grandfather and gain his aid.

19
00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:56,173
- It's the governor's banner.
- Do we pursue?

20
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:58,610
Set a course to overtake her.

22
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:58,872
Captain?

23
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:04,298
I would've thought you'd retired by now.

24
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:07,157
Bulletins...

25
00:03:07,558 --> 00:03:10,195
from my scouts in the field tonight.

26
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,574
I was contemplating my
response after the sunrise.

27
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:17,164
Anything we should discuss?

28
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:20,949
You have enough on your mind.

29
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,576
Let this be my concern.

30
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:33,337
Have you told her, my Lord?

31
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:36,847
Your wife.

32
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:39,730
About what lies ahead?

33
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,976
Good.

34
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:51,208
She doesn't need it
on her mind, either...

35
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:55,483
what lies ahead.

36
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:07,661
I have found that
contemplating these things

37
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:09,998
is the most difficult part.

38
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:14,072
That when the dread moment arrives,

39
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:17,071
your true nature will assert itself.

40
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:20,008
The confusion will lift

41
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,305
and all will appear as it should be.

42
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,748
You've given me good men to lead.

43
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,585
I'll do my best by them.

44
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:39,327
There isn't a good man among them.

45
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:42,094
Not anymore.

46
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:48,269
Some of them may have
been, before all this.

47
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:51,539
Some of them may be again

48
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,133
on the other side of it.

49
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:57,111
But right now,

50
00:04:57,211 --> 00:05:02,116
good men are not what
the moment requires.

51
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:06,054
Right now,

52
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:08,781
the time calls for dark men...

53
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,999
to do dark things.

54
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:16,992
Do not be afraid to lead them to it.

55
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,681
Prepare for departure!

56
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,322
Today is the 24th.

57
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:47,441
David is five today.

58
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:50,243
My son.

59
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,767
I didn't know that.

60
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,307
Mr. Grandal has not
contacted me in weeks.

61
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:03,647
With the war apparently occupying
Spain's attention elsewhere,

62
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,947
there is a good chance the
entire unfortunate affair

63
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:09,311
surrounding the Spanish
gold is behind us.

64
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:11,327
So, when we reach Philadelphia,

65
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:13,891
once you are under the
protection of your family...

66
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:21,129
I was hoping you might see fit
to release me from my service,

67
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,165
that I might return to London...

68
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,010
to my children.

69
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,471
Of course.

70
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,667
Ma'am...

71
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:42,450
I've just been informed our permission
to depart has been suspended.

72
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,185
Suspended? Why?

73
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:46,515
I'm told the soldiers that
were to comprise your escort

74
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,297
are otherwise needed ashore.

75
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:12,280
What the fuck is this?

76
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:14,880
- Get out.
- Get dressed.

77
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,824
Mr. Harrison,

78
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,872
proceed.

79
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:55,918
Six men with you.

80
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:59,460
They never looked my way as I
stayed a considerable distance.

81
00:08:00,594 --> 00:08:03,231
Saw you meet two others late last night,

82
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:05,833
one of them standing on just one leg.

83
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,486
Saw it all.

84
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:11,539
I had him follow you

85
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:15,542
after you left town
so abruptly last night.

86
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:21,415
I assume the one-legged
man was Long John Silver.

87
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:26,530
Would you like to tell me
what the meeting was about?

88
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:29,257
I was summoned by him

89
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:32,967
in a failed attempt to
extort money from me.

90
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:35,763
I would hope that your
spy also informed you

91
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:38,257
that four of my six men
attempted to arrest him

92
00:08:38,282 --> 00:08:39,942
and died in the effort.

93
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:42,336
I was barely able to escape myself.

94
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:46,897
Surely this should mitigate any
doubt you may have about my loyalties.

95
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,643
If you were loyal to the governor,

96
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:52,821
why did you not inform me of
the meeting before the fact?

97
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:55,483
If you are loyal to the governor,

98
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:58,819
why attempt to arrest
a man as dangerous as he

99
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,389
rather than simply eliminating him?

100
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,591
If you had informed me,

101
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:06,327
I'm sure I could have
helped in that regard.

102
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:08,710
My questions about your loyalty, ma'am,

103
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:10,898
are not mitigated by
last night's events.

104
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:14,802
If anything, they are now
aggravated to an intolerable degree.

105
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,744
Does the testimony presented
satisfy a charge of treason?

106
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:26,124
- Wait.
- It does.

107
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:27,781
This is outrageous.

108
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:29,703
When the governor returns,
he will not stand for this.

109
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:32,281
The governor is not here. I am here.

110
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:36,023
And you are now under an indictment

111
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:39,370
that carries with it
the penalty of death.

112
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:46,634
Mr. Harrison here
trailed Long John Silver

113
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:48,699
before losing him in the wrecks.

114
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:50,671
Men and horse await in the square,

115
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:54,041
preparing to clear that
area and apprehend him.

116
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:57,645
Today is the day the
pirate resistance dies,

117
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:59,279
its leader eliminated,

118
00:09:59,304 --> 00:10:02,487
its supporters in Nassau
exposed and arrested.

119
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:05,553
If you cooperate with me to that end,

120
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:09,646
perhaps your death
might still be averted.

121
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,831
We have no choice but
to leave the island.

122
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:19,867
No one is leaving anything.

123
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,031
We came here to take Nassau.

124
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:24,279
We leave once that
is done or not at all.

125
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:26,617
Take Nassau?

126
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:28,547
With what army?

127
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,479
Whatever slaves are
still alive on this island

128
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:34,826
will never fight
alongside a pirate again.

129
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,625
- Not after last night.
- Last night,

130
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,919
there were also pirates
who fought alongside us.

131
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,508
Against terrible odds and at great cost.

132
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:44,792
Billy and his men are our enemies
now, but these men are not.

133
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:48,028
And as long as that is true,
our alliance with them holds.

134
00:10:55,517 --> 00:10:57,237
You know where you're going?

135
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,615
I saw her last employed in the tavern.

136
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,308
I'll begin there.

137
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:04,597
We don't need to persuade
her to do anything yet.

138
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,580
Eventually, we'll need to garner support

139
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,051
to help incite Nassau to
revolt against the governor,

140
00:11:11,076 --> 00:11:13,521
but what we need right
now is information.

141
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:15,556
How many soldiers there are,

142
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:18,869
what kind of sympathy
exists for our cause.

143
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:20,329
I know.

144
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:24,798
Thank you.

145
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:28,702
- What for?
- Last night.

146
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:30,838
You did not have to side with me.

147
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:32,831
It was costly for you to do so.

148
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:36,444
Well, it would have cost far
more for me not to have done so.

149
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:38,646
We might be able to take Nassau alone,

150
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:41,949
but there will be no greater
victory, no widespread revolution

151
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:45,653
unless we can somehow
keep our alliance together.

152
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,330
You truly believe it is possible?

153
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:53,220
That as disadvantaged
and disabled as we are,

154
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:55,095
that anything we do here

155
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:58,002
is going to make the least bit of
difference to the men in London?

156
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,759
Well, that's the trick, isn't it?

157
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,872
If no one remembers a time
before there was an England,

158
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:08,038
then no one can imagine a time after it.

159
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,043
The empire survives in part

160
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:13,138
because we believe its
survival to be inevitable.

161
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,115
But it isn't.

162
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,887
And they know that.

163
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:21,880
That's why they're so
terrified of you and I.

164
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:24,925
If we were able to take Nassau,

165
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:29,007
if we are able to expose the illusion

166
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:31,458
that England is not inevitable,

167
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:34,367
if we are able to incite a revolt

168
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:36,494
that spreads across the New World...

169
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,159
then, yeah...

170
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:44,679
I imagine people are gonna notice.

171
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:49,917
"Too much sanity may be madness,

172
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:52,383
"and the maddest of all,

173
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:55,721
"to see life as it is
and not as it should be."

174
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:26,817
Get the main sail.

175
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:30,157
I'll say this for him, he's not shy.

176
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:33,460
If he misses this tack, we'll
be on him in less than an hour.

177
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:36,830
He's completed his last
three tacks. Why stop now?

178
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,637
Not that close to the wind.

179
00:13:38,662 --> 00:13:40,324
Not nearly that close.

180
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,154
Don't you think?

181
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,527
Any chance he could slip away from us?

182
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:47,074
- Not really, no.
- No.

183
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:51,044
He's pointing higher,
but we've got the speed.

184
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:52,971
He can't hold us off forever.

185
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,182
Once we've stopped him,

186
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:57,918
you and I will take the
vanguard aboard on longboats.

187
00:13:58,268 --> 00:14:01,837
You can stay close, provide
support until we're boarded.

188
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,913
Ever captained a ship
of this size before?

189
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:06,239
God, no.

190
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:10,942
Have you captained a
ship this size before?

191
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:13,133
- Sure.
- Good.

192
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:22,810
This ain't ever gonna end for us, is it?

193
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:24,866
What?

194
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:27,773
You always wanted to
stand next to giants.

195
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:29,963
Now there you are.

196
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:35,039
And I'm wondering how it is you and
I are ever gonna move on from this.

197
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:42,696
He's brilliant, you know?

198
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:44,960
I've heard him
underestimated on that score,

199
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,007
perhaps owing to his physical strength.

200
00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:48,937
People finding it
hard to accept the idea

201
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,506
that one man can be two things,

202
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:51,967
but I've seen it.

203
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:54,116
He is brilliant.

204
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:59,179
And last night, all
he wanted was revenge,

205
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,249
and all that would satisfy it was
Eleanor Guthrie's head on a plate.

206
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:06,405
And in a moment in which he had no
appetite to be persuaded otherwise,

207
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,021
I persuaded him otherwise.

208
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:13,321
If the story of the pirate Jack Rackham

209
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:17,366
is to end with him standing
alongside Blackbeard as an equal,

210
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:19,920
together defeating the
governor who hanged Charles Vane

211
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:23,880
and in so doing restoring
pirate rule over Nassau...

212
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:31,745
that is an ending I can live with.

213
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:36,757
Defeat Rogers...

214
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:39,383
and we walk away.

215
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:44,280
They've missed stays!

216
00:15:44,305 --> 00:15:46,307
We've got him.

217
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:49,017
Ready the guns!

218
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,874
The end is about to begin.

219
00:15:57,871 --> 00:16:00,006
Our invasion failed.

220
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,196
But we are not through.

221
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:07,163
There is support for
our cause inside Nassau.

222
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:09,923
There must be, however dormant.

223
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,535
But we need to find it.

224
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,677
Need your help to find it.

225
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:16,564
There was support once,

226
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,942
but now Nassau is frightened.

227
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:25,053
What you would ask, openly
defying those soldiers...

228
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:28,330
I doubt you'd find that kind of support.

229
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:35,785
I have lost more than you
can know to reach this moment.

230
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,988
Captain Flint has lost
more than you can know.

231
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:40,122
- But we are here.
- Captain Flint?

232
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:42,943
He awaits with a small force of men.

233
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:45,308
But if we can see those
prisoners broken free...

234
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,828
And you are with him as well?

235
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:49,396
Yes?

236
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:52,666
Him... who?

237
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:55,279
Long John Silver.

238
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:01,204
He died in the bay

239
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,898
during the invasion.

240
00:17:06,537 --> 00:17:07,889
What?

241
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:11,014
A posse just departed for the wrecks

242
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:13,418
under instructions
from Captain Berringer

243
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:16,856
to locate and arrest Long John Silver.

244
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:29,184
Are you all right, ma'am?

245
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,001
Ma'am?

246
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:42,750
Fuck.

247
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,027
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
- That's enough.

248
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,821
We should be running.

249
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:50,123
There's nowhere to run.

250
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:52,159
Then we have a serious problem,

251
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,360
as Captain Berringer is going to demand

252
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:57,555
she identify her connections
to the resistance, which is us.

253
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,999
She won't.

254
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,801
How can you be so sure?

255
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:03,527
Because she doesn't like
her friends being threatened.

256
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:05,305
And she doesn't like
to be pushed around.

257
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,307
I sincerely hope you're right,

258
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:09,677
as I believe our lives depend upon it.

259
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:12,513
She won't tell on us in there.

260
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:14,693
What we should be worried about

261
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,066
is how we're going to
help her from out here.

262
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:19,987
Fuck.

263
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,668
The other day,

264
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:28,061
you refused to name the source you used

265
00:18:28,161 --> 00:18:30,898
to undermine the pirate
invasion of the bay...

266
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:34,400
as a matter of principle.

267
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:41,174
Since that time, Long John
Silver and his associates

268
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:43,944
have murdered one of my men...

269
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,358
murdered four of your men...

270
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:52,271
murdered a family of three
on the Underhill estate

271
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:53,821
in cold blood last night,

272
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:55,856
including an eight-year-old girl.

273
00:18:58,424 --> 00:19:01,094
Knowing now how high
the bodies are piling,

274
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:03,731
how real the threat is,

275
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:07,567
I am giving you an opportunity
to remedy your error

276
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:11,082
and help me end this
threat once and for all.

277
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:19,212
I want the names of your sources.

278
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,772
I am sorry,

279
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:27,853
but I cannot do that.

280
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:31,095
Cannot or will not?

281
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:34,627
These men would turn on
you in a blink of an eye.

282
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:37,904
Why would you go to such
lengths to protect them?

283
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,849
I told you,

284
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,259
I have an understanding
with the governor...

285
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:43,654
- ... in which he acknowledged...
- Give me the names.

286
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,213
... the benefit of my being
able to honor my word...

287
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:47,464
- ... to my sources...
- Give me the names.

288
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,917
- ... such that I might continue...
- Give me the names.

289
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:50,378
- to serve his regime in the future...
- Give me the names.

290
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:52,080
- ... as I have served it every day...
- Give me the names.

291
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:54,370
- ... until now.
- Give me the names!

292
00:20:00,345 --> 00:20:02,400
You can't go in there, ma'am.

293
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:05,837
What is going on here?

294
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:16,571
Go!

295
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:50,612
I'm not shackled.

296
00:20:52,176 --> 00:20:54,212
You plan to run?

297
00:20:57,244 --> 00:20:59,079
Do I need to run?

298
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:04,195
That'd be fun for me to see.

299
00:21:05,886 --> 00:21:07,821
How would you do it?

300
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:12,469
With great difficulty, I imagine.

301
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:15,563
How would you take Nassau?

302
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,668
When I did it...

303
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:24,437
drove the governor away,

304
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:28,909
I had Teach and an army of
my once-brothers at my back.

305
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:30,878
You want to play Teach?

306
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:34,003
Who's to play the rest?

307
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:39,243
Or do you believe we
two could do it alone?

308
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:58,688
Find him!

309
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,640
Look over there!

310
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:11,518
Find him!

311
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:14,346
Right. Over there!

312
00:22:14,856 --> 00:22:16,847
Behind them. Check the brush!

313
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:22,963
Find him!

314
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,818
Search that wreck!

315
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,982
Get in there!

316
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,633
It's all right.

317
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:04,031
How are we going to take Nassau?

318
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,206
That's how.

319
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,770
Cease fire!

320
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:30,299
Cease firing!

321
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:32,126
Shall we reload, Captain?

322
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:38,305
There's nothing more
we can do from here.

323
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:42,419
They're on their own now.

324
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:46,446
They've struck their colors!

325
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:20,660
She is the most influential
member of the Governor's Council.

326
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,894
Whatever tension there has been,

327
00:27:21,994 --> 00:27:23,276
he relies upon her to maintain control.

328
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:24,571
Ma'am.

329
00:27:24,596 --> 00:27:26,233
If when the governor does return

330
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:28,235
I have to explain to
him that I discovered

331
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:30,483
the most influential
member of his council

332
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:32,422
conspiring with our enemies

333
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:34,365
and took action to stop her,

334
00:27:34,511 --> 00:27:37,614
that is an explanation
I will offer happily.

335
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:40,547
Now, I apologize for the delay

336
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:42,705
in your transport to Philadelphia.

337
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,752
The men were most needed
to address today's crisis.

338
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:47,654
Please trust I will have you on your way

339
00:27:47,754 --> 00:27:50,201
by the time the sun rises tomorrow.

340
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:03,606
I explained the situation to him.

341
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:06,316
He's in no mood to be
reasoned with on the issue.

342
00:28:06,426 --> 00:28:08,567
You saw him, Silver?

343
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:10,689
What happened?

344
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:12,845
It was him and one other.

345
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:15,282
I had six men.

346
00:28:15,753 --> 00:28:18,285
I thought it would be sufficient
to apprehend him myself.

347
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:19,824
Apprehend him?

348
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:21,319
No one asked you to apprehend him.

349
00:28:21,354 --> 00:28:23,405
All you had to do was
report the invitation to meet

350
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,817
and let the captain handle it.

351
00:28:24,842 --> 00:28:27,083
How in God's name did
that not occur to you?

352
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:29,124
I did not fail to do it.

353
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:32,632
I refused to do it and would again.

354
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:35,405
Why would you refuse
to adhere to the law?

355
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:39,275
Because the last time the law

356
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,832
got its hands on a
pirate of that stature,

357
00:28:41,908 --> 00:28:44,446
it yielded the following...

358
00:28:44,493 --> 00:28:48,415
anger, hostility, resentment,

359
00:28:48,782 --> 00:28:52,852
purges to combat it all that only
resulted in amplifying it all,

360
00:28:52,952 --> 00:28:56,789
and a resistance movement that,
since Captain Vane was hanged,

361
00:28:56,814 --> 00:28:59,134
has done nothing but grow strong enough

362
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,563
to control almost every part of
this island outside of Nassau.

363
00:29:03,596 --> 00:29:05,498
And you ask why I chose

364
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:08,304
not to help start the
cycle all over again?

365
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,829
There is a ship in the bay

366
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:11,513
that is supposed to
be taking me to a place

367
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:13,976
where I might actually
solve our problems here.

368
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:17,344
But instead, I am stuck here for
as long as it takes to fix this.

369
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,799
In order to do that,

370
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,345
you are going to have to give
me something to fix it with.

371
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:23,450
But you'd better come up with
something of value I can use

372
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,666
to get him to walk away from this.

373
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,743
You think you can control him.

374
00:29:31,358 --> 00:29:35,227
And by the time you realize
he has been controlling you,

375
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,764
it is going to be too late.

376
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:40,604
Riders returning!

377
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:52,354
Give me something I can use

378
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:54,749
because otherwise I can't help you.

379
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:58,233
And I beg your pardon, but what
the fuck have you got to lose?

380
00:30:09,462 --> 00:30:12,231
- What happened?
- Fugitive escaped.

381
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:13,666
Though, not before
killing three of my men

382
00:30:13,766 --> 00:30:15,602
and fixing that to one of the bodies.

383
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:20,939
What does it say?

384
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:27,088
"To the men and women of Nassau,

385
00:30:27,113 --> 00:30:31,172
"the strength of the governor's
force is now reduced by three.

386
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:35,244
"The time to lend us
your efforts is now.

387
00:30:35,955 --> 00:30:38,838
"See my brothers held captive freed.

388
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:43,144
"Join them. Join me.

389
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:47,066
"Signed, Long John Silver."

390
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:50,329
You heard him.

391
00:30:51,969 --> 00:30:54,040
The time is now.

392
00:30:56,509 --> 00:30:59,979
Who among you would like to lend
his efforts to Long John Silver

393
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,781
and resist me?

394
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:08,955
Here.

395
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,736
I am unarmed.

396
00:31:16,496 --> 00:31:18,765
No one will stand in your way.

397
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:26,070
If the time isn't now, when
the fuck is it going to be?!

398
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:30,201
None of you?!

399
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:34,849
No one at all?!

400
00:31:51,097 --> 00:31:53,733
You fucking cowards.

401
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,103
I don't understand.

402
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:24,130
- Billy.
- Yep.

403
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,965
- Tried to kill you?
- Yep.

404
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:28,697
- And Madi?
- Her, too.

405
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:31,613
Why are we not angry about this?

406
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:33,561
Who says we're not?

407
00:32:33,806 --> 00:32:36,843
Well, I'm not sensing a whole lot
of urgency to do anything about it.

408
00:32:36,943 --> 00:32:40,064
There isn't anything we can
do about it at the moment.

409
00:32:40,647 --> 00:32:41,848
Isn't there?

410
00:32:42,973 --> 00:32:44,977
Look, Billy's not stupid.

411
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:47,019
He's almost certainly
consolidated by now,

412
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,473
intimidated or eliminated anyone who
would challenge him or support me.

413
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:53,535
He has control of the Underhill estate,

414
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,068
control of the army that calls it home.

415
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,932
There will be a time to
deal with him, but not now.

416
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:08,738
This one, however.

417
00:33:12,107 --> 00:33:13,444
He's fine.

418
00:33:14,246 --> 00:33:16,146
If you'd asked me yesterday,

419
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:20,152
when he was considering selling
me to the governor for a profit,

420
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:22,589
I'd be in agreement we
should be rid of him.

421
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,962
But now, I don't know.

422
00:33:25,987 --> 00:33:28,733
I feel like we need as
much help as we can...

423
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:32,607
get.

424
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:12,271
Execution of the pirate
prisoners is scheduled for today.

425
00:34:12,371 --> 00:34:14,707
Captain Berringer stood in the square

426
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:17,978
and said if Long John Silver
had a problem with this,

427
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:21,023
he was welcome to show
himself and voice it.

428
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,872
Uh, even if we could get
through their outer defenses,

429
00:34:25,904 --> 00:34:28,762
10 of us walk into town against
what could be 100 soldiers.

430
00:34:28,787 --> 00:34:30,319
And then what?

431
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:34,761
The threats have been
made. The story's been told.

432
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:36,467
Everyone in Nassau knows

433
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:39,474
what Long John Silver's return means,

434
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:42,451
what's expected of them
when he does return.

435
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:45,545
All that remains to do...

436
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,498
is for him to return.

437
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:53,568
It would help if Nassau
knew I was coming.

438
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:55,685
Can you see to it?

439
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,429
Of course.

440
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:09,829
Ooh, lovely.

441
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,542
I don't make this request lightly.

442
00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:16,750
But after everything Max
has done for the council,

443
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:18,740
for you,

444
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:21,949
it seems like a moment when
she's owed something back.

445
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:26,154
The charges against her are
of the utmost seriousness.

446
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:28,425
It sounds as if the
law is being adhered to.

447
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,058
And what standing do
we have to interfere?

448
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:33,276
People are angry, Mr. Frasier.

449
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:35,745
At the soldiers, at Captain Berringer.

450
00:35:35,846 --> 00:35:37,976
Some of them even at our lord governor.

451
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:40,991
You may not see it, but trust me, I do.

452
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,688
If the council won't resist the captain,

453
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:50,213
then some of those people might find
their own ways of resisting this.

454
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:52,838
Ways you might not like.

455
00:35:57,736 --> 00:36:00,199
Don't send for me again.

456
00:36:05,942 --> 00:36:07,377
Fuck.

457
00:36:11,255 --> 00:36:13,916
- What did he say?
- Nothing helpful.

458
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:18,151
What's going on?

459
00:36:32,248 --> 00:36:34,521
You're about to make a terrible mistake

460
00:36:34,552 --> 00:36:36,606
and I am asking you to reconsider.

461
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:40,151
I am entitled to exercise these
sentences at my discretion.

462
00:36:40,176 --> 00:36:41,978
But I'm not asking you
to cancel the hangings.

463
00:36:42,078 --> 00:36:44,284
I'm asking you to cancel
the theater around them.

464
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:49,209
You intend to lure Silver in.

465
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:51,554
Force him to appear in
the square to save his men

466
00:36:51,654 --> 00:36:53,957
so that you might defeat him
in full view of all of Nassau.

467
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:55,966
Demonstrate your fearsomeness to them.

468
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,012
Don't.

469
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:01,848
- Why not?
- Because you don't need to.

470
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:03,817
Because they know it already
and because at a certain point,

471
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:06,267
there is only so much
fear a man can endure.

472
00:37:06,446 --> 00:37:08,588
All you are doing is antagonizing them.

473
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:10,891
And who is that serving?

474
00:37:11,654 --> 00:37:14,462
Because there is a better
way to solve this problem.

475
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:18,552
What is that?

476
00:37:18,577 --> 00:37:20,768
This is information
about the preferred routes

477
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:23,522
used by the resistance
to enter into Nassau.

478
00:37:26,774 --> 00:37:29,306
- She gave it to you?
- She did.

479
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:43,114
Send men to lie in wait.

480
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:44,925
Set an ambush that can
overwhelm Silver and his men

481
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:46,794
when they attempt to pass.

482
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:50,806
End this quietly and easily

483
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:52,800
and definitively.

484
00:38:31,884 --> 00:38:34,687
What do you imagine happens next?

485
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,389
If you are fortunate
enough to capture Teach...

486
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:45,466
what will you do with him?

487
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:52,451
Years ago...

488
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:55,668
as a privateer during the war,

489
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:58,746
I was in a running fight
with a Spanish galleon.

490
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:01,001
Hounded her for days.

491
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:04,837
By all rights, she should've
surrendered long before she did.

492
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:10,259
Just before her colors were
struck, a shot was fired.

493
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:15,115
A cheap, cowardly shot...

494
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,252
fired with the knowledge they
were about to surrender anyway

495
00:39:19,352 --> 00:39:22,732
and the presumption that
they be entitled to quarter.

496
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,227
This particular shot found its mark.

497
00:39:28,796 --> 00:39:30,898
Took three of my men...

498
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:34,232
one of them, my brother, Thomas.

499
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:39,713
He'd always been smarter than me.

500
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,368
Braver.

501
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:45,786
Better.

502
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:49,182
Protected me when we were young.

503
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:52,385
Taught me to sail when we were older.

504
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,742
He was my closest friend.

505
00:39:57,555 --> 00:40:02,062
Lost to a cheap and cowardly shot.

506
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:08,140
So, after they surrendered,
I went aboard the ship.

507
00:40:10,276 --> 00:40:12,339
And I began with the captain.

508
00:40:17,003 --> 00:40:19,007
I was more deliberate with him.

509
00:40:21,214 --> 00:40:23,350
It took some time.

510
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:29,079
Then I moved to his first mate.

511
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:33,226
The gun captains.

512
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,592
Gun crews.

513
00:40:39,547 --> 00:40:42,585
74 men aboard that
ship when I boarded her.

514
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,906
But by the time we reached
Acapulco, there was only one.

515
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,675
The one I delivered
alive to recount the tale.

516
00:41:05,023 --> 00:41:07,570
You asked what would happen next.

517
00:41:09,027 --> 00:41:12,331
My instinct is the
same now as it was then.

518
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:15,834
I will show them what
the consequences are

519
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:18,737
for threatening that
which I hold most dear.

520
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,346
I will leave no doubt about it.

521
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:26,963
Do it.

522
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:34,944
Heave!

523
00:42:12,986 --> 00:42:14,365
Let's get the slack.

524
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:49,500
Now.

525
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:50,868
Pull!

526
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:26,237
Pull it away!

527
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,049
Hold him.

528
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,901
Again.

529
00:44:36,038 --> 00:44:37,303
Again.

530
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:44,239
Heave!

531
00:45:13,675 --> 00:45:15,887
- Heave!
- Get it out!

532
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,157
Heave!

533
00:46:05,474 --> 00:46:06,976
Him next.

534
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,571
Again!

535
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,934
Again!

536
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,051
Heave!

537
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:53,513
Heave!

538
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:07,724
Let fall.

539
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,573
Can you see?

540
00:49:43,158 --> 00:49:44,877
Secure the rest of them.

541
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:48,118
Set a course for Nassau.

542
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:50,020
Raise sail!

543
00:50:18,075 --> 00:50:20,677
Keep moving. Don't drag your feet!

544
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,134
Go on.

545
00:50:23,097 --> 00:50:24,833
Move it.

546
00:50:26,052 --> 00:50:27,519
Go on through.

547
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,593
Sir...

548
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,312
What did he say?

549
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,182
Your men lying in wait
for Silver and his men,

550
00:51:26,282 --> 00:51:27,951
were they successful?

551
00:51:29,993 --> 00:51:31,581
Do it.

552
00:51:43,091 --> 00:51:45,269
There was no ambush set, was there?

553
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:49,592
- I reconsidered.
- We had an agreement.

554
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:52,642
Nassau will never fully come to heel

555
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:55,694
until we can demonstrate control.

556
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,914
And control that no one can see

557
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:00,884
makes for no demonstration at all.

558
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,087
So, I will let them see it.

559
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:09,788
Remove them.

560
00:52:09,907 --> 00:52:11,709
Ready the next three.

561
00:52:12,008 --> 00:52:13,843
Take them down.

562
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,266
Next three prisoners.

563
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:18,034
You know Lieutenant Utley
from the captain's staff?

564
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,369
- Yes.
- Find him.

565
00:52:19,394 --> 00:52:21,279
Tell him I ask that he gather
as much food and supplies

566
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,752
as he can move into the
fort within the next hour.

567
00:52:22,777 --> 00:52:23,854
The fort?

568
00:52:23,879 --> 00:52:25,265
And tell him to gather six men he trusts

569
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:27,110
to escort it and us up there.

570
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,518
And tell him to get Max.

571
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,986
Why do we need an escort to the fort?

572
00:52:30,011 --> 00:52:31,946
Quickly, please. We
don't have much time.

573
00:53:10,699 --> 00:53:12,301
They'll come.

574
00:53:35,899 --> 00:53:38,966
Company, fall into two ranks!

575
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:03,834
Make ready!

576
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,516
Present!

577
00:54:36,804 --> 00:54:38,356
Ready!

578
00:54:38,773 --> 00:54:40,276
- Fire!
- Fire!

579
00:54:52,293 --> 00:54:54,016
Charge!

580
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,676
I need B Company!

581
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:15,168
Fall back!

582
00:55:16,018 --> 00:55:18,114
B Company, make ready!

583
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,289
Wait for my command!

584
00:55:26,314 --> 00:55:28,040
Mark your target!

585
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:02,762
