1
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,238
I am suggesting that we help each other

2
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:16,374
by an alliance of pirates and slaves,

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,177
bring down Nassau,
maybe bring it all down.

4
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:20,812
My name is Woodes Rogers,

5
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,248
and I am the next governor
of New Providence Island.

6
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:25,083
Spain... what did you
have to promise them?

7
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:27,247
That I would secure the remains
of the Urca de Lima's gold

8
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:28,586
and return it to Havana.

9
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:30,755
- You set aside some of the gold?
- She did.

10
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:32,223
- How much?
- Mm.

11
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:33,925
A cache of gems.

12
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:36,594
Spain is willing to burn
Nassau to the ground.

13
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:38,530
The only way Rogers can prevent this

14
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:40,165
is to find the cache and return it,

15
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,200
which means if we were to find it first,

16
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,958
we could dictate what happens next.

17
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:45,042
Where's Vane?

18
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:47,472
The militia arrived
before he could get away.

19
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:49,207
We had no choice but to run.

20
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,009
You cannot stay.

21
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,777
The war is going to follow that chest.

22
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:54,779
I'll go back and address the situation.

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,048
We're creating the appearance
of a man out of nothing

24
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:58,850
that the resistance against the English

25
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,652
feels compelled to rally around.

26
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:02,554
When he's ready, he'll
step into the role

27
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:04,022
we've created for him.

28
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,391
Does he have any idea
you're using his name?

29
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:09,027
Long John Silver.

30
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,529
It's a hard thing to look
your successor in the eye.

31
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,899
But as far as successors go,
your mother could do far worse.

32
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,067
Charles is dead.

33
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:18,203
Governor in Nassau
hung him in the square.

34
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,572
The resistance in
Nassau is now underway.

35
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:21,940
I think you and I both know who it was

36
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:23,097
that fashioned that noose.

37
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:24,321
I know this enemy.

38
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:26,344
He took that cache
with the express purpose

39
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:28,279
of compelling us to commit your force

40
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,914
to a battlefield of his choosing.

41
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:32,150
If you allow him to
dictate the terms of battle,

42
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:34,119
you court a disastrous outcome.

43
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:37,235
Tell your governor!

44
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:39,469
You tell him I'm coming!

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,191
"And the Lord said unto Rebecca,

47
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,193
"two nations are in thy womb.

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,905
"Two peoples within you

"One shall be stronger than the other.

00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,290
"And the older shall serve the younger."

51
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:06,371
Twins...

52
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:10,108
as close as two things can
get to being the same one,

53
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:13,344
and what's the first thing
they do to each other?

54
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:16,347
Fight over who gets to be the first one

55
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:18,748
to see the light of day.

56
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:23,488
And here I sit at the
head of an army of men,

57
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:26,924
each of whom, present company included,

58
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:28,860
has probably at some point considered

59
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:31,963
killing the man he now fights alongside,

60
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:34,232
each of whom, present company included,

61
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,335
has certainly considered killing me.

62
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:39,470
If it makes you feel any better,

63
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:42,038
I haven't considered
killing you in months.

64
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:44,574
A little bit.

65
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,878
We're so close.

66
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,017
So very close.

67
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:58,122
If we can just hold
this alliance together

68
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:01,125
just a little longer, if we can just...

69
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,103
will it forward just a little more...

70
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:06,329
And nothing will ever be the
same for anyone ever again.

71
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:12,203
You and I have willed our
men through unthinkable things

72
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:14,070
to get this far.

73
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,508
Why not one more?

74
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,833
To call Nassau home again.

75
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:25,281
Two flags on the starboard bow!

76
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:37,895
There's no sign of
the alarm being raised.

77
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:39,697
Is it possible they
trust our false colors?

78
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:43,234
Well, anything's possible,
but I wouldn't count on it.

79
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:47,338
Maintain our current
approach, present heading.

80
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:48,706
Prepare to take courses.

81
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:50,561
Aye, Captain.

82
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:51,999
Maintain course.

83
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,946
All hands, stand by to change course.

84
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:57,482
Lookout reports had
five two-masted vessels

85
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,717
in the harbor while you were below.

86
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:02,253
That's what Billy's information
suggested we should expect.

87
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:04,722
I want more men in the yard.

88
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:06,357
With the governor's naval consort gone

89
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:09,227
and the fort lightly armed, if at all,

90
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:12,163
they won't be able to prevent
us from making our landing today.

91
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,865
Hmm.

92
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,699
Keep the course.

93
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:18,847
Stay with the land.

94
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:21,406
You still don't trust him, do you?

95
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:23,641
I understand why you do.

96
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:26,010
I don't believe that's what I asked.

97
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,546
I don't believe you want me
to answer what you've asked.

98
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,418
We are in sight of the
end of this journey,

99
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,720
and he's still worried this
alliance all falls apart

100
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,660
before we get there.

101
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,791
Please don't give him any more reason

102
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:42,225
to indulge that feeling.

103
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:59,710
Gun crews, prepare the
starboard batteries, double shot!

104
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,945
Sharpen up the yards now.

105
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:04,048
And clew our courses as
we approach the harbor.

106
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,483
Helm, once we've cleared the reefs,

107
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:07,318
head up two points so that
we might begin our run.

108
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,718
Aye, sir.

109
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,895
One of us should probably say something.

110
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,465
About what?

111
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:23,034
I don't know, the moment?

112
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:26,904
Remind the men in whose name
this fight is to be fought?

113
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,872
You think they've forgotten?

114
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:34,011
No, but we are emotional
beings, after all,

115
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:37,746
and rhetoric is the
fuel that feeds the fire.

116
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:41,118
For 10,000 years, a man
anticipating conquest

117
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,319
- has stood before his army...
- Do it.

118
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:56,876
Friends, a word before it all begins.

119
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:58,669
It's no wonder you don't say much.

120
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:00,304
If you please.

121
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:02,173
Lads, hey, listen up.

122
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:03,488
Thank you.

123
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:08,145
All of us have given
some part of ourselves

124
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:10,481
to reach this moment.

125
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:13,449
Today, we reclaim what is ours.

126
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:20,391
And we seek retribution
for what was taken from us.

127
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:23,960
Today there will be vengeance
for the death of Charles Vane.

128
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:42,413
What is it?

129
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:44,849
The governor's sloops aren't moving.

130
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,324
Well, what would you have them doing?

131
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,754
Outgunned as they are, maybe nothing.

132
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,257
Maybe something.

133
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:59,030
What the hell does that mean?

134
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:01,497
The Revenge is almost
in range of the fort.

135
00:09:06,572 --> 00:09:08,480
No guns.

136
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:11,788
It's just as Billy said.

137
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:19,717
Standby the anchor!

138
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:22,119
And signal the Eagle to
offer her larboard batteries

139
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,830
to hold those sloops at bay.

140
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,755
What the fuck is the Defiant doing?

141
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:30,094
Why is she cutting across our bow?

142
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:31,829
The Defiant's altering course!

143
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,231
Helm! Hard to starboard!

144
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:35,232
Hard over!

145
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:36,458
Trim in all the sails!

146
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,091
Brace up sharp!

147
00:09:56,644 --> 00:10:00,113
Take the larboard bow! Move ahead!

148
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:10,001
- Let the sheets fly!
- Let the sheets fly!

149
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:12,568
Let the sheets fly!

150
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:32,288
Let go of the line!

151
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:33,758
Watch out for the cannons!

152
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,799
Look out! Brace yourselves!

153
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:38,828
Can we get free?

154
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:45,380
Get to the guns!

155
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,639
Get the shots!

156
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,308
Looks like the barricade held, sir.

157
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:52,977
Your orders?

158
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:54,745
Open fire.

159
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:57,548
Eastern battery, open fire.

160
00:10:57,549 --> 00:10:59,817
- Fire!
- Fire!

161
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:01,551
Take cover!

162
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:06,668
- Fire!
- Fire!

163
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,669
Brace ahead!

164
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:31,916
Signal the sloops to engage.

165
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,384
Engage the sloops!

166
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:35,718
Signal to pursue!

167
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:49,333
I'm giving the order!

168
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,102
Not yet.

169
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,870
If we don't get these men
off the ship, they're dead.

170
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:56,841
If we don't find a way to harass
those guns, everyone's dead.

171
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,542
Harass them with what?

172
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,244
The starboard guns can't elevate enough

173
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:01,651
to get anywhere near that fort.

174
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,302
All hands!

175
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:12,975
Reset the topsails and t'gallants!

176
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:15,860
Now!

177
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,876
Ready top sails!

178
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:21,565
Ready those guns!

179
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,203
T'gallants!

180
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:28,630
- Pull! Pull!
- Put your backs into it!

181
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:30,141
Pull those lines!

182
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:33,009
Pull! Pull!

183
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,828
Top sails in the corner.

184
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:52,334
Top sails!

185
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,643
Reload with chain shot
and target their canvas.

186
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:58,768
- Reload with chain shot!
- Go!

187
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,605
Fire!

188
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:16,520
Gun crews!

189
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,380
On my mark!

190
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:24,488
Fire!

191
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,585
Ah!

192
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:42,678
Abandon ship! All hands!

193
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:49,486
Abandon ship!

194
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:50,987
Get the ladders over!

195
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,013
Get on the longboats.

196
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,381
What are you doing?

197
00:14:17,382 --> 00:14:18,649
I'll be the slowest one.

198
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,217
Get on the ladder!

199
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:22,348
It's all right. Go.

200
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:24,662
Go!

201
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:35,269
Why aren't we moving in closer?

202
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:39,703
We cannot fire the great
guns into that mess.

203
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,238
We'll kill as many of
our own men as theirs.

204
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,840
But if we run with the one ship

205
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,341
that still presents a
threat to the governor,

206
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,443
he may very well chase

207
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:48,479
and give the survivors
their best chance of escaping

208
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,081
to the fallback position
on the eastern shore.

209
00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:53,049
And if they don't chase?

210
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:10,167
Come on! Get in the longboat!

211
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:11,435
I got ya!

212
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:22,256
Fall, sir!

213
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,491
We're not gonna make it!

214
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:20,803
Return fire!

215
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:25,408
In the wind!

216
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,133
Shall we pursue the man-of-war, my Lord?

217
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:51,702
It'd be the cost of
rounding up those longboats.

218
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:53,771
Are you certain your
men can capture her?

219
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:56,179
Teach is a formidable opponent,

220
00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:58,909
but his ship is weakened, and my
men can attack from three directions

221
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,515
with greater numbers
with greater discipline.

222
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:04,469
Tactically, he's greatly disadvantaged.

223
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:07,618
Between tactics and passion,
I'll take the latter.

224
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,353
If our information's
correct and he seeks revenge

225
00:17:09,354 --> 00:17:10,788
over the death of Charles Vane,

226
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:12,523
he will fight with passion today.

227
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:15,659
Revenge is a powerful
motivator, undoubtedly.

228
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,261
Fortunately, my men would like

229
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:19,495
a little of it for themselves as well.

230
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,101
Do it.

231
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:26,036
Signal to pursue!

232
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:29,377
Inform the council I'll return
once the street is secure.

233
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:32,432
And please have someone
retrieve my wife.

234
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:34,490
Of course, my Lord.

235
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:04,558
Oh, fuck.

236
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:11,787
It has been quiet for some time.

237
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:15,719
Is that bad for us or bad for them?

238
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,621
Hard to say.

239
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,329
If it were bad for us, I
assume we would know by now.

240
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:25,406
For whose benefit is that?

241
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:30,150
I'm told that once mastered,
it's actually quite soothing.

242
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:33,447
At this moment, I'm finding
that hard to believe.

243
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:37,774
But if I am to play the role,

244
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:40,042
I ought to make some
effort to look the part.

245
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:43,814
It bothers me that this
does not bother you.

246
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:46,183
What's that?

247
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:48,919
This. That.

248
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,419
All of it.

249
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,660
The world is changing so
rapidly and we with it.

250
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:57,995
I fear the day will soon come

251
00:18:57,996 --> 00:19:00,037
when we will no longer recognize either.

252
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:02,979
We are who we are.

253
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:05,604
Nothing so important changes so quickly.

254
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:10,941
Mrs. Rogers?

255
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,179
The governor requests your presence.

256
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:40,137
Two ships grounded and only
one escaped the barricade.

257
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:42,840
Three ships grounded.

258
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:44,602
Teach is still loose.

259
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,539
All things considered,
we are very lucky.

260
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,312
I'm sorry you weren't there to see it.

261
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:56,153
I know it cannot be
comfortable to be so removed.

262
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,355
I don't know.

263
00:19:58,356 --> 00:20:00,289
I got to make this.

264
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:08,365
I am sure there were
others that found themselves

265
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:10,701
more uncomfortable today than I.

266
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,874
Company at the ready!

267
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:14,083
Company!

268
00:20:14,108 --> 00:20:16,306
And I told you before we
ever set foot on this island

269
00:20:16,307 --> 00:20:19,776
I will do whatever necessary
to ensure your success here.

270
00:20:19,777 --> 00:20:21,578
If the street understands
us better when I sit

271
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:24,081
among your men's wives
rather than your men,

272
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:26,216
if the world makes more
sense to them that way

273
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:28,164
and your authority grows because of it,

274
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:29,686
as uncomfortable as it may be,

275
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:32,564
then that is a compromise
I am willing to make.

276
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:36,940
Governor?

277
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:43,900
I'll send for you as
soon as I'm satisfied

278
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:45,568
the street is secure.

279
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:51,893
Captain.

280
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,715
That's the last one.

281
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:13,664
According to the men who just landed,

282
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:15,598
that is the last longboat.

283
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:19,780
I heard the same.

284
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:24,473
I'm told they saw an injured man

285
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:27,098
pulled aboard from out of the water,

286
00:21:27,123 --> 00:21:28,918
almost drowned.

287
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,280
I heard the same.

288
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:40,857
Here I must be careful.

289
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:45,128
I have well over 200
men unaccounted for.

290
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,931
Those who remain, it will be very hard

291
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,866
to explain to them why,

292
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:54,137
with all I have to attend
to, I choose to stand here

293
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:57,242
hanging onto the fate
of just one of them.

294
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,678
I know that you and he

295
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,381
had been working
closely together of late,

296
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:06,615
become friends even.

297
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:12,598
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

298
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:17,809
Perhaps just that...

299
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:19,988
he is my friend, too.

300
00:22:53,698 --> 00:22:55,699
- They obstructed the harbor!
- I know.

301
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,067
Two ships they sunk!

302
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,528
It must have taken them days to arrange!

303
00:22:58,553 --> 00:23:00,833
- I know, I...
- Then why the fuck didn't you warn us?!

304
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:02,739
I did warn you!

305
00:23:03,364 --> 00:23:05,675
There were three ships, not two.

306
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,110
He bought them cheap out of Abaco.

307
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:08,945
He scuttled them six days ago.

308
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:11,715
The moment I learned of it, I
sent word to Mr. Featherstone.

309
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:15,250
He was supposed to send word
to you not to enter the harbor.

310
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:18,822
Then Mr. Featherstone has fucked us all.

311
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:20,689
Yes, I know that, too.

312
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:27,695
Is this all that's left?

313
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:32,936
Teach and the Revenge
are unaccounted for.

314
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:35,937
I saw them sailing north

315
00:23:35,962 --> 00:23:38,462
away from the harbor under pursuit.

316
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,987
The rest...

317
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:45,395
are presumed dead or captured.

318
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:49,816
And Silver?

319
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:52,653
Which is he?

320
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:11,942
There'll be debts to repay after today.

321
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:14,611
And there'll be plenty of time to do it.

322
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:18,230
But right now, we need
to get off the sand.

323
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,559
Where are you?

324
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:38,689
What?

325
00:24:38,714 --> 00:24:41,271
We sail for Nassau soon.

326
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:44,207
There are many other places I could be

327
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:47,244
in this moment to prepare.

328
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:49,344
I choose to be here.

329
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:52,648
Where have you just chosen to go?

330
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:59,125
We received word today from Nassau

331
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,059
that Billy's resistance movement
has proclaimed its fealty

332
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,432
to a pirate king,

333
00:25:06,698 --> 00:25:10,839
a man who would one day return
to Nassau from his exile,

334
00:25:10,864 --> 00:25:13,603
expel the English,

335
00:25:13,604 --> 00:25:16,471
and punish those who betrayed the cause.

336
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:22,923
You left my bed for that?

337
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:27,083
Now, the pirate king's name...

338
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:29,967
is Long John Silver.

339
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:36,693
Long John Silver?

340
00:25:36,694 --> 00:25:38,060
Yeah.

341
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:44,186
Who is Long John Silver?

342
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,405
Well, that's a very good question.

343
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:52,709
I assume he saw value in the tall tales

344
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,745
told about me after
that night in the tavern.

345
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:58,615
Saw mystery in it, perhaps.

346
00:25:58,616 --> 00:26:01,350
Use my name upon which
to build his story.

347
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,555
And this bothers you why?

348
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:12,342
We've come this far because when
Flint and I are of the same mind,

349
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:16,132
there's no obstacle yet
encountered that we cannot surmount.

350
00:26:16,404 --> 00:26:18,677
I don't know why that is.

351
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,137
He doesn't know why it is.

352
00:26:21,387 --> 00:26:23,387
But it is.

353
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,343
To elevate one of us over the other,

354
00:26:26,344 --> 00:26:28,369
even as a fiction,

355
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:33,493
seems to me to be tempting
fate in a most dangerous way.

356
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:36,118
And...

357
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,525
And it upsets you because
you believe he is your friend?

358
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:48,164
Yes, it upsets me.

359
00:26:48,165 --> 00:26:50,100
And I know that Billy's
been looking for a way

360
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:52,969
to remove Flint from
our lives for months now.

361
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,238
I'm sure that's somewhere
at the root of this.

362
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,699
And I don't like having him
conscripting me into his cause

363
00:26:57,724 --> 00:26:59,799
without me even having a say.

364
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,381
I'm sorry.

365
00:27:04,918 --> 00:27:08,650
Because I believe he is my friend?

366
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:11,821
Are you questioning
whether I'm qualified

367
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:14,089
to have an opinion on that subject?

368
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,896
Did you not once tell me of your worry

369
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:21,598
about the fate of those

370
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,300
whom Captain Flint has
called friends before you?

371
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:26,569
A lot has changed since then.

372
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,674
A lot has changed since
then, but what has not changed

373
00:27:30,675 --> 00:27:33,143
is that when a man first needs you

374
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:36,279
and thereafter calls you a friend,

375
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,983
a little suspicion is a healthy thing.

376
00:27:40,604 --> 00:27:43,286
That'd make a lot more
sense if I didn't need him

377
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,018
just as badly as he needs me.

378
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:47,323
I don't believe you do.

379
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:51,809
Whatever he is to you,
whatever you are to him...

380
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:56,164
I don't believe you need
him to be the man you are.

381
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,737
I think you would be a very good king.

382
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:07,243
If I were a no-good pirate,

383
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,979
I would follow you wherever you led.

384
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:58,862
Take the courses. Brace
the main and mizzen aback.

385
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,285
Haul in the guns.
Close all the gun ports.

386
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,499
You're letting up?

387
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,234
With the damage done to the rig,

388
00:29:04,235 --> 00:29:07,357
I can't maneuver our broadside around
fast enough to be of any effect.

389
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:09,129
The sloops are too nimble.

390
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:11,272
But hauling in the guns?

391
00:29:11,297 --> 00:29:12,742
They'll board us easily.

392
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:15,232
I was always told that you
were the one without fear.

393
00:29:15,257 --> 00:29:16,764
Was I misinformed?

394
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:20,024
It ain't fear to want
to do a hard thing smart.

395
00:29:28,337 --> 00:29:30,470
He wants this fight.

396
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,935
Let him have it.

397
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:36,833
Prepare to be boarded!

398
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:38,967
Prepare to be boarded!

399
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:04,065
My Lord,

400
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,752
the squad is returning
from the outer beaches.

401
00:31:07,022 --> 00:31:10,556
All told, the captives number 75.

402
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,163
Well, there are more
out there. There must be.

403
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,798
With our numbers, our ability to search

404
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,101
outside Nassau town is limited.

405
00:31:18,102 --> 00:31:19,936
Without any sense of where to look...

406
00:31:19,937 --> 00:31:21,574
And what about informants?

407
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,957
Informants?

408
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,209
Well, there must be
someone in town who knows

409
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,111
where the pirates would go to hide.

410
00:31:28,684 --> 00:31:31,073
I understand they might be
hesitant to come forward yesterday,

411
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:34,226
with the outcome in doubt, but today?

412
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:35,952
Are you telling me that literally no one

413
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:37,786
has offered assistance?

414
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,794
Oh, of course they haven't.

415
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:46,930
Why would they when it is so much easier

416
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:48,387
to do nothing at all?

417
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:50,700
Somewhere on the other
side of the world,

418
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,268
Spain and England are
fighting yet another war

419
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:54,832
over what king will
sit upon what throne.

420
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:56,557
Meanwhile we fight an enemy here

421
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,208
determined to see all
of civilization collapse.

422
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,379
The only thing standing between
them and their goal is you and I,

423
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:05,303
and no one else seems willing
to lift a finger to help.

424
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:09,052
I hope at some point
someone will explain to me

425
00:32:09,077 --> 00:32:11,645
what sort of sense any of that makes.

426
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,157
Don't look at me! Keep moving.

427
00:32:14,158 --> 00:32:16,091
You heard, move.

428
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,361
How many others?

429
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:22,065
On your knees!

430
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:24,968
Captured nine more just
east of the fence line.

431
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:28,316
We think this one's
Flint's ship's master.

432
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,957
You are part of Flint's inner circle?

433
00:32:39,222 --> 00:32:43,086
If you have information about
Captain Flint's contingency plans,

434
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,955
it may argue in favor of leniency.

435
00:32:46,721 --> 00:32:48,254
Go fuck yourself.

436
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:52,725
Pull him up.

437
00:32:56,113 --> 00:32:58,746
You don't remember me, do you?

438
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:05,341
I was there that day in the forest,

439
00:33:05,342 --> 00:33:08,215
when your trap was sprung.

440
00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:12,115
I saw what your people did to my men.

441
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:16,308
I was told that after the fact,

442
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,737
the children of the camp...

443
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:23,722
were encouraged to remove the
ears from men I called friends.

444
00:33:25,062 --> 00:33:29,265
Trophies to mark the victory.

445
00:33:29,562 --> 00:33:32,735
We that remain do so in violation

446
00:33:32,736 --> 00:33:35,351
of our orders to return home,

447
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:39,974
a breach of our duty
to His Majesty's Army.

448
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:46,249
Someday, if we see England again,

449
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,185
I imagine we'll have to answer for it.

450
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:51,271
Hold him.

451
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:59,594
But some things are
more important than duty.

452
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:05,066
No, n-no!

453
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,076
I doubt they'll turn on
their own kind, my Lord.

454
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:21,070
This isn't that sort of a war anymore.

455
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:29,859
I want the trials started
as soon as possible.

456
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,679
I want this behind us.

457
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,531
Of course.

458
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,874
After you defeated his forces,

459
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,689
the naval commander notified the
governor he was quitting Nassau,

460
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,789
took his fleet right to London.

461
00:34:50,814 --> 00:34:54,050
One subordinate, Captain Berringer,

462
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:56,152
he led a mutiny of a few hundred men

463
00:34:56,153 --> 00:34:59,259
determined to stay and
avenge their defeat.

464
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,126
Swore a loyalty oath
to Rogers personally,

465
00:35:03,127 --> 00:35:05,328
and then began a purge in town of anyone

466
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:08,397
even suspected of having
a connection to our cause.

467
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,799
What kind of purge?

468
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,902
Well, hangings, torture.

469
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,571
Eventually the street was
more afraid of him than of us,

470
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,940
and the black spots had
ceased having any effect.

471
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:19,609
So we challenged him directly,

472
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,744
tried to force our way into town, but...

473
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,312
his men are fanatical,

474
00:35:23,313 --> 00:35:25,715
and the fighting was most bloody.

475
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:30,715
At its worst, Berringer tried to
reach out from town into our camp,

476
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,222
turned two of our men against us,

477
00:35:33,443 --> 00:35:35,496
help finish us off for good.

478
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:38,911
Fortunately we were able to
discover the plot in time.

479
00:35:52,142 --> 00:35:54,648
The lines are settled now.

480
00:35:54,673 --> 00:35:57,718
He controls the town but little else.

481
00:35:57,743 --> 00:36:00,357
My people have free reign over
most of the rest of the island.

482
00:36:00,382 --> 00:36:01,914
Your people?

483
00:36:08,058 --> 00:36:09,791
The scouts are returning.

484
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:13,048
I'll meet you inside.

485
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:21,262
Is it over?

486
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:26,761
Is what over?

487
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:30,206
You looked into my mother's eyes

488
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:33,463
and you said a great
war lay ahead of us,

489
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,546
one in which pirates and
slaves would stand together

490
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,982
and strike a blow that might
shake the very foundation

491
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:42,016
of the British Empire.

492
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:45,814
Now our ships are gone,

493
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,551
our army is fractured,

494
00:37:48,576 --> 00:37:52,044
battered, and beaten.

495
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:55,997
And the only man among
you I trusted is dead.

496
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,886
I'm asking you...

497
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:04,151
if this war died with him.

498
00:38:13,368 --> 00:38:16,501
Come down! Open this
door! Get over here!

499
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:43,145
It is the opinion of this court

500
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:45,181
that the evidence brought to bear

501
00:38:45,182 --> 00:38:47,149
against this particular defendant

502
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,854
is both abundant and incontrovertible.

503
00:38:52,423 --> 00:38:55,257
Having afforded him ample opportunity

504
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:57,392
to speak in his own defense...

505
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,888
121 prisoners we took today.

506
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:05,334
Had our enemies 121 prisoners of ours,

507
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:09,013
I imagine their deaths
would be swift and cruel.

508
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:14,744
For us, it means 121 prisoners
to be housed and guarded,

509
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,913
121 mouths to feed,

510
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:20,675
121 trials to process.

511
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:23,819
Never let it be said
that civilization came

512
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,987
to anyone easily here.

513
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:30,926
And these trials,

514
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,812
they will all be taking place here?

515
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:41,556
It would please me if you
would accommodate it, yes.

516
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:48,878
Judge Adams and his... court,

517
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:51,147
we have all seen in recent
weeks since their arrival

518
00:39:51,148 --> 00:39:53,916
that their appetites are significant.

519
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:57,240
Shall I expect to be reimbursed
for the costs of this?

520
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,725
You stood in my office

521
00:40:02,726 --> 00:40:05,995
and said you wished us to be friends.

522
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:07,296
As my friend, I would think

523
00:40:07,297 --> 00:40:08,798
you would be eager to do your part

524
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:12,235
to see our common enterprise
survive its current crisis.

525
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,330
I beg your pardon, my Lord,

526
00:40:15,355 --> 00:40:18,140
but have I not proved
to you my friendship?

527
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:21,343
At great personal risk to
myself and my interests,

528
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:24,246
I made enemies of the pirates
in order to ensure your success.

529
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,449
Made enemies of them?

530
00:40:26,817 --> 00:40:29,118
They've been my enemies
for some time now.

531
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,686
Are you saying that
they haven't been yours?

532
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:34,390
- May I suggest...
- I thank you for your aid today.

533
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,992
It is, I believe, to be expected,

534
00:40:36,993 --> 00:40:41,030
today, tomorrow, every
day till the war is won.

535
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:43,199
That is the burden that
we all ought to share.

536
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,068
I serve you best, my Lord,
when I am seen by the street

537
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,575
as having some independence from you,

538
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,406
as your silent partner, I am able...

539
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,007
There are no silent partners anymore.

540
00:40:52,008 --> 00:40:53,942
I will have no more of them.

541
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:56,038
This is now an island of true friends

542
00:40:56,063 --> 00:40:57,989
and mortal enemies
and nothing in between.

543
00:40:58,014 --> 00:41:01,150
Now, in this moment, I still
believe you are among the former.

544
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:04,672
Should I have any reason
to believe otherwise?

545
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,733
Of course not, my Lord.

546
00:41:08,992 --> 00:41:10,092
Thank you.

547
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,010
Give us the room.

548
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,294
I don't have exact numbers,

549
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:35,878
but it sounds as though there's already
been a significant number of prisoners

550
00:41:35,903 --> 00:41:37,629
captured from the harbor.

551
00:41:37,654 --> 00:41:39,308
I assume they'll push to
start the hangings right away,

552
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,501
which doesn't leave us much time.

553
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:44,512
Now, even with your men here,
we don't have sufficient numbers

554
00:41:44,537 --> 00:41:47,553
to move on Nassau directly
and be assured victory.

555
00:41:48,823 --> 00:41:52,559
But if we could dramatically
increase those numbers...

556
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,361
Increase them how?

557
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:56,664
The Underhill plantation.

558
00:41:57,068 --> 00:41:59,700
It's the largest and richest
of the interior estates,

559
00:41:59,701 --> 00:42:04,104
and it's home to well over 200 slaves.

560
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,057
It's well-defended.

561
00:42:06,082 --> 00:42:09,209
Until now, I haven't had
the manpower to take it.

562
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:12,927
But now, with the men we have
here, I think it's possible,

563
00:42:12,952 --> 00:42:17,151
and if we could convince even half
of those slaves to join our fight,

564
00:42:17,504 --> 00:42:19,987
we might then actually be
in a position to take back...

565
00:42:19,988 --> 00:42:21,789
Too long.

566
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,325
What you're suggesting, we
don't have time for that.

567
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:27,995
- Well, it'll take a few days...
- The governor may be on his heels,

568
00:42:27,996 --> 00:42:29,930
but he won't stay that way for long.

569
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:33,000
It will be days, hours
maybe, before he finds a way

570
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:36,670
to set his feet beneath
him and retrench.

571
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:40,541
We need to strike
quickly, directly at Nassau

572
00:42:40,566 --> 00:42:42,714
with as many forces as
we can muster and today.

573
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:45,043
- Hang on...
- We are two battered fighters

574
00:42:45,068 --> 00:42:47,614
at the end of a long fight.

575
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:49,917
The next blow struck
may be a decisive one,

576
00:42:49,918 --> 00:42:51,318
and we have to be the one that strikes.

577
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,718
Stop.

578
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:01,571
I prepared these men to
follow Long John Silver

579
00:43:01,596 --> 00:43:03,520
upon his return.

580
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,333
Now, if you assume that in his absence,

581
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:09,336
that role now reverts to you...

582
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,527
then you assume wrong.

583
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:13,874
See, my men know your name,

584
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:16,510
but you weren't the one who
recruited them into this.

585
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,946
You weren't the one who led
them in those midnight raids

586
00:43:18,947 --> 00:43:21,115
in the western plantations.

587
00:43:21,116 --> 00:43:23,684
You weren't the one
who has lived with them

588
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:27,086
and drank with them and bled with them.

589
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:32,226
So in the absence of Long John Silver,

590
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:35,726
the men will look to me, not you,

591
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:37,694
for answers to what happens next,

592
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:40,302
and I will be the one to
give them those answers,

593
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,826
not you.

594
00:43:43,338 --> 00:43:46,305
I have become so easily
set aside, have I?

595
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:52,550
Do you have value to me? Yes.

596
00:43:52,605 --> 00:43:55,315
Would your skill in a
fight aid us in our efforts?

597
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:57,116
Of course.

598
00:43:59,249 --> 00:44:02,256
But do we need you here?

599
00:44:02,257 --> 00:44:05,458
No. We do not.

600
00:44:06,866 --> 00:44:09,233
You're forgetting one thing.

601
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,166
Somewhere on an island a
few days' journey from here

602
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:16,570
is a chest filled with treasure
buried in a secret place,

603
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,539
and of the three men
who know of that place,

604
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,341
I may be the last one alive after today.

605
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:31,412
Are you threatening to withhold
the location of the chest

606
00:44:31,437 --> 00:44:34,064
that every man here is counting upon

607
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:37,686
to provide for Nassau's
treasury once we secure it

608
00:44:38,827 --> 00:44:42,329
solely so you can maintain
your own status here?

609
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:46,600
There is an unthinkable
victory within our reach,

610
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,135
and I will see this through

611
00:44:48,136 --> 00:44:51,270
by whatever means I have at my disposal.

612
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,503
This seems like the act
of a small man to you.

613
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,644
Were he here, I'm sure,

614
00:44:57,645 --> 00:44:59,947
Mr. Silver would make this all sound

615
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:02,206
more agreeable to you.

616
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:06,720
But without him, think what you like.

617
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:09,488
My word will govern.

618
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,593
I know, too.

619
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:21,478
Three men know the
resting place of the chest,

620
00:45:21,503 --> 00:45:23,531
and one woman.

621
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:26,723
He told it to me before we left home.

622
00:45:28,776 --> 00:45:30,777
It would be preferable
if there were one voice

623
00:45:30,778 --> 00:45:32,613
to govern here tomorrow,

624
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:35,949
but I don't think it's
going to be quite so simple.

625
00:45:36,336 --> 00:45:39,067
There will be no pirate king here.

626
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:42,621
Of that much, I am certain.

627
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,401
Are you through?

628
00:48:52,426 --> 00:48:54,147
Yes.

629
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:56,199
Then go.

630
00:49:10,964 --> 00:49:13,831
When was the last time
you fought in a vanguard?

631
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:24,389
He ain't never gonna see
you in that way, Teach.

632
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,936
I know why you want him to,
but it ain't never gonna happen.

633
00:49:28,783 --> 00:49:31,017
You think that little
of me that I care so much

634
00:49:31,018 --> 00:49:32,552
how I'm seen in his eyes,

635
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:35,088
I'd be willing to lose my life over it?

636
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:37,256
Then why did you do it?

637
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:42,896
When I was in that
carriage with the governor,

638
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:45,298
when your horses first appeared,

639
00:49:45,577 --> 00:49:48,178
I had a chance to end it all.

640
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,889
Had my hands round his neck.

641
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:54,975
Had I done more in that moment,

642
00:49:54,976 --> 00:49:59,073
had I been more in that moment...

643
00:49:59,606 --> 00:50:01,705
Charles would still be here.

644
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,922
The idea that he might
be looking down on me

645
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,757
in this moment and find me not doing

646
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:14,528
everything in my power to
see his death answered for,

647
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:17,631
that is something I'm willing
to put my life at risk over,

648
00:50:17,779 --> 00:50:20,310
how I'm seen in his eyes.

649
00:50:21,474 --> 00:50:24,971
Charles Vane stood by us
when no one else would.

650
00:50:24,972 --> 00:50:28,575
Charles Vane risked his life for us.

651
00:50:28,576 --> 00:50:29,609
Charles Vane...

652
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,610
Oh, fuck Charles Vane.

653
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:39,528
I know how you felt about him.

654
00:50:40,714 --> 00:50:43,014
I felt the same way, and you know it.

655
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:46,041
But he's dead.

656
00:50:48,488 --> 00:50:50,263
And I can't see what
fucking sense it makes

657
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:52,065
to keep trying to make him happy.

658
00:50:52,066 --> 00:50:55,267
And all it's actually gonna
lead to is you joining him.

659
00:50:58,206 --> 00:51:01,652
If it had been me
strung up in that square,

660
00:51:01,677 --> 00:51:03,742
you'd feel the same way?

661
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:06,460
I came here 'cause we all agreed

662
00:51:06,485 --> 00:51:08,819
we had a chance to take Nassau back,

663
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,651
have a place of our own.

664
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,481
I ain't here to prove anything!

665
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:17,840
I ain't here to figure out who I am.

666
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,827
And I sure as shit ain't
here to pretend a dead man

667
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,163
might think better of me for it.

668
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:27,293
We are all here towards the
end of retaking the island.

669
00:51:27,723 --> 00:51:30,303
In terms of motive,

670
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:32,692
maybe we'll all just have to accept

671
00:51:32,717 --> 00:51:35,141
that we're driven by different things.

672
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:36,495
Yeah?

673
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,111
And what happens when those motives

674
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:39,880
start demanding their own ends?

675
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:41,915
And this thing we're all a part of

676
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,370
starts splitting right down the middle?

677
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:45,796
That isn't going to happen.

678
00:51:46,755 --> 00:51:48,677
It already is.

679
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,911
What did he do?

680
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:58,497
Set a course for Nassau...

681
00:52:02,527 --> 00:52:05,294
to send a message when we return...

682
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:10,873
that this can all end...

683
00:52:14,222 --> 00:52:17,456
if the governor turns over
the one thing he wants.

684
00:52:32,334 --> 00:52:34,668
When I made the choice to see
Charles' sentence carried out,

685
00:52:34,669 --> 00:52:37,847
I did not know what the
consequences would be.

686
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:41,308
I knew it was the only way
to protect our future here,

687
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:43,642
to protect you, so I did it.

688
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,589
And when the backlash followed,

689
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:50,831
the resentment over my
relationship with you,

690
00:52:50,856 --> 00:52:53,119
which I knew could only
be soothed by my pretending

691
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,590
to have no influence
at all, I did that, too.

692
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:59,960
I did all of it, contorted
myself into the role,

693
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:02,596
mutilated myself so that it
would fit because I believed

694
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,230
as long as you believed
I was your partner,

695
00:53:04,231 --> 00:53:05,966
it didn't matter what
anyone else believed.

696
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:08,134
I've never believed you to
be anything less than that.

697
00:53:08,135 --> 00:53:09,603
Good, then can you tell me

698
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:12,229
what the fuck just happened back there?

699
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:15,075
I am asking her to
bear no more sacrifice

700
00:53:15,076 --> 00:53:17,644
than you or I or a dozen others.

701
00:53:17,645 --> 00:53:19,279
You're not asking her to bear anything.

702
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,881
You have saddled her with
the cost of those trials.

703
00:53:21,882 --> 00:53:24,150
You might as well have stolen
the money to pay for it,

704
00:53:24,151 --> 00:53:27,203
but that is not what I am
talking about and you know it.

705
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:31,191
To be my partner in
this, there are things

706
00:53:31,192 --> 00:53:32,476
that you are better off
letting me worry about.

707
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:35,895
That is not what you said.
No more silent partners.

708
00:53:35,896 --> 00:53:37,897
We all bear the burden of this together.

709
00:53:37,898 --> 00:53:40,432
What is it you are not telling me?

710
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,971
I don't want to be
protected. I don't want it.

711
00:53:45,114 --> 00:53:48,041
I need to know why you're behaving
as if victory is so far away

712
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:50,731
when to me, it seems that
it is so close at hand.

713
00:54:07,862 --> 00:54:10,063
When I informed Sarah of my intent

714
00:54:10,064 --> 00:54:12,732
to formally end our marriage,

715
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,391
I did not know what the
consequences would be.

716
00:54:17,305 --> 00:54:18,972
I didn't imagine they
would be significant.

717
00:54:18,973 --> 00:54:21,365
We'd barely spoken in years.

718
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:25,644
Her reaction...

719
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,916
was more significant
than I'd anticipated.

720
00:54:32,245 --> 00:54:33,777
What did she do?

721
00:54:38,977 --> 00:54:43,196
Her family intervened with
a few of my larger creditors

722
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:48,201
and persuaded them to accelerate
my timetables for repayment.

723
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:50,187
And if those creditors call the loans,

724
00:54:50,212 --> 00:54:52,718
it will force the others to follow suit.

725
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:56,819
I would default.

726
00:54:58,522 --> 00:55:00,214
The courts would issue the warrant,

727
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,865
and I would be a fugitive from the law.

728
00:55:05,853 --> 00:55:07,120
England is at war.

729
00:55:07,121 --> 00:55:09,122
There is no money from them
to support our efforts here.

730
00:55:09,123 --> 00:55:13,505
So I have had to assume substantial
private debts to do so...

731
00:55:14,543 --> 00:55:17,387
Debts which grow by the day.

732
00:55:17,855 --> 00:55:19,833
And as it would seem,
the only thing more costly

733
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,391
than our defeats are our victories.

734
00:55:24,316 --> 00:55:26,072
Debts which will
require the swift return

735
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,977
of commerce here if they
are ever to be repaid,

736
00:55:28,002 --> 00:55:30,710
commerce whose return at the moment

737
00:55:30,711 --> 00:55:32,711
seems so very far away.

738
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,824
Why didn't you tell me?

739
00:55:41,322 --> 00:55:44,022
You are not a compromise to me.

740
00:55:48,896 --> 00:55:52,364
I do not regret what I did,
no matter the consequences.

741
00:55:53,795 --> 00:55:56,895
And I didn't want you to have
any reason to think that I did.

742
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:17,824
Her family has the ability to do that,

743
00:56:17,825 --> 00:56:20,225
to manipulate your creditors so easily?

744
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:24,233
Creditors respond to money.

745
00:56:24,565 --> 00:56:27,061
And they respond to influence.

746
00:56:27,803 --> 00:56:29,701
Her family has both.

747
00:56:32,211 --> 00:56:33,977
I understand.

748
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,210
But...

749
00:56:39,847 --> 00:56:42,080
so does mine.

750
00:58:43,242 --> 00:58:45,675
Long John Silver.

751
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:48,801
Welcome home.

752
