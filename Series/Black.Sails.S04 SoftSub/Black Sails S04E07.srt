1
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:15,514
I opened the gates for you.
Handed you this victory.

2
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,716
Your men need to know my
wife is not to be harmed.

3
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:19,551
Even if that order could be given,

4
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,785
no one would heed it.

5
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,356
They've been let loose.

6
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:25,424
If you had suffered such loss...

7
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,934
... is there anything you
can imagine making it right?

8
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:31,430
No, but I imagine getting my
hands on the man responsible for it

9
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:32,731
would be a start.

10
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:35,867
If we fight them together,
there's a good chance we live.

11
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,667
Separate, and we all die.

12
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:39,789
When Flint heads south,

13
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:41,670
we head north.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,643
- What's north?
- Eleanor Guthrie's grandfather.

15
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:48,104
They heard that Nassau had fallen,
and so they came to join us.

16
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:51,316
The revolution you promised has begun.

17
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,365
- Where's Madi?
- I need you to know...

18
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:55,820
that I did everything I
could to keep her safe.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,685
It wasn't your fault.

21
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:15,130
I wasn't able to say good-bye to her...

22
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,503
so I don't know what she would've
wanted me to say to you right now...

23
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:28,573
if anything at all.

24
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:36,548
She and I...

25
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,752
we'd become close.

26
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:47,526
So, I think I have some sense
of what it might've been.

27
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,736
She was curious.

28
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:01,573
And strong.

29
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:06,845
Not made to be hidden
away from the world.

30
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:12,518
She was able to see it...

31
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,379
before she died.

32
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:20,646
And she was fighting for
something she believed in...

33
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:22,439
when she died.

34
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:32,804
You knew her well.

35
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:41,157
I loved her.

36
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,019
And I believe she loved me.

37
00:04:57,346 --> 00:05:00,205
I think she would've wanted
you to know that, too.

38
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:19,183
And you say welcome them in, but...

39
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,100
I mean, they've never been free.

40
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,053
No one's at each
other's throats yet here?

41
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:36,009
Whatever their differences,

42
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:38,395
everyone is here to be part of...

43
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,729
ending colonial rule in the New World.

44
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:42,140
As long as that's a possibility,

45
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,082
no one wants to be the
one to spoil the chance.

46
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:51,983
What's this?

47
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:56,054
Discussing an attack on St.
Ann's Bay as a first strike.

48
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:58,687
They've both been through
there in recent months.

49
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,804
Trying to agree on what kind
of resistance we'd likely face.

50
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,593
How is she?

51
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:14,673
She's breathing.

52
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:17,868
How are you?

53
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:26,084
In St. Ann's Bay, we
can agree that there are

54
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:28,753
two 10-pound guns on the beach.

55
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:31,089
And men-at-arms number at least 80.

56
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:32,957
No more than 100.

57
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:34,539
100?

58
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:37,185
I figured twice that.

59
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:39,864
If we could set enough
men up the coast...

60
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,459
say three times that, give or take...

61
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,037
we could seize the town within a day.

62
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:48,632
If you take St. Ann's,
you'll starve Bridgetown.

63
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,636
She wouldn't last a month.

64
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:53,077
And Barbados has just fallen.

65
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,581
With Bridgetown as a staging ground,

66
00:06:57,606 --> 00:07:00,426
how many men could you muster
to move to the mainland?

67
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:02,888
700, maybe eight.

68
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:06,337
If we could recruit one
slave in three in Barbados,

69
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:11,370
that's 1,200 men we could
land anywhere we chose,

70
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:13,823
with ships to support their landing.

71
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:16,710
That's roughly what
Morgan had in Panama.

72
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,303
It might just be enough
for us to sack Boston.

73
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:21,680
Boston?

74
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:26,562
Fools.

75
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:33,287
You're all fools if you
think this road leads

76
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:35,343
to where he says it does.

77
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:39,590
I have not proven to you my
commitment to our common cause?

78
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:42,460
What happens when our enemy realizes

79
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:44,738
that all it needs to do to defeat us

80
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:47,365
is to take away that common cause?

81
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:49,500
Turn one against the other.

82
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:52,154
And when that happens...

83
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:54,840
as it is all but certain to do...

84
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:56,875
which of us standing here

85
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,517
are likely to be the ones who benefit

86
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:01,679
and which the ones sold
back into their chains?

87
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:03,738
Then what the fuck are you doing here?

88
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:12,456
I saved your men's lives and yours

89
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:15,754
from the fight you started
but could not finish.

90
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,106
And now you would start another...

91
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,322
that no man can hope to finish?

92
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,621
Then leave.

93
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:31,475
But what's happening
here is going to happen.

94
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:34,145
This war is going to begin.

95
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,472
This camp is going to fight it,

96
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,406
with or without you.

97
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,939
They may call you a king,

98
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,226
but only in the kingdom that is no more.

99
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:52,321
We're all free men here.

100
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:56,125
And I wish to stay that way.

101
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:58,970
As do we all.

102
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:03,223
Will you join me?

103
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:31,706
Shh, shh, shh.

104
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,751
We have left the bay for the Delaware.

105
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:49,528
We will be arriving soon.

106
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:51,234
I'll be there in a moment.

107
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:06,469
She ain't been back down here...

108
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,908
since we set sail.

109
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,320
You told her to fuck off.

110
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:16,287
She listened.

111
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:19,633
She told me she ain't got no apology...

112
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:22,204
for what she'd done.

113
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,431
I know.

114
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,577
Part of me wanted to lash out.

115
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:30,116
Betrayed you.

116
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:32,530
Betrayed me.

117
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,633
Refuses to make it right.

118
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:38,970
Mm-hm. And the other part?

119
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:41,103
The other part...

120
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:45,884
knew how easy it would've
been for her to lie.

121
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,616
Say she was sorry when she ain't.

122
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:56,805
I don't know what the fuck to think.

123
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,857
You told her not to come
back down here, didn't you?

124
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:08,725
You'll have plenty of time
to murder her another day.

125
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,905
Right now,

126
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,079
you need to rest.

127
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:07,158
You asked to see me, my Lord?

128
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:27,018
I cannot imagine what sort
of horror this is for you.

129
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:31,783
Please know,

130
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:35,306
to whatever extent
there could be any doubt,

131
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:38,095
that the choices she made in recent days

132
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,558
were made out of concern for you

133
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,301
and out of love...

134
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:45,096
I spoke with Governor Raja...

135
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:49,025
just before he set sail.

136
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,502
I wanted to be certain

137
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:53,171
that our account with him was squared,

138
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:55,406
that we ought to expect
no return by his fleet,

139
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:59,285
considering there were
promises made to him

140
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,079
that remain unfulfilled...

141
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:05,349
to deliver the still missing
cache and Jack Rackham.

142
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:12,423
Governor Raja assured me he had
already written off the missing cache,

143
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:15,850
the war effort being
of paramount importance.

144
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,076
But Captain Rackham...

145
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:24,218
he said he had never
asked for Captain Rackham.

146
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,741
You added that part.

147
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:33,767
A convenient lie to placate Havana...

148
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:37,196
and improve your own prospects
for survival, didn't you?

149
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,017
Didn't you?

150
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:47,148
Yes.

151
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:53,515
Eleanor turned her guns on me.

152
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:57,910
Eleanor betrayed me.

153
00:13:57,935 --> 00:14:01,139
Surrendered Nassau out from under me.

154
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:04,037
None of that sounded like anything
that would ever occur to her to do.

155
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:06,537
Not her. Not after
everything we'd been through.

156
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:12,258
But if it had occurred
first to someone else...

157
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:14,852
- No, sir.
- Someone standing so close to her,

158
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:17,421
who could and would manipulate her

159
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:19,223
to secure their own survival.

160
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:20,491
My Lord, I did no such thing.

161
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:22,193
Not now!

162
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:24,282
Why would I believe you?

163
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:27,171
Was there not an agreement between you

164
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:29,167
that you would be released
from your obligations

165
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:30,343
and returned to your family...

166
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:31,735
May I speak, please?!

167
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:33,426
Jesus, what is it?!

168
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,176
Beg your pardon,

169
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:40,378
but you'd asked to be notified

170
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:43,139
when we were finished dressing the body.

171
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,754
Thank you, Mr. Rawls.

172
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,885
What?

173
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,441
In dressing the body, my Lord...

174
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:00,264
I don't know how to say it.

175
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:02,333
- Leave.
- Beg pardon, ma'am?

176
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:05,470
- Leave now, please.
- I'd be careful if I were you.

177
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:08,481
- Mr. Rawls, get out of this room.
- Mrs. Hudson!

178
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:12,081
You don't want to hear
what he's about to tell you.

179
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:15,901
Not like this.

180
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,455
You don't want to
hear about it this way.

181
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:25,623
Hear what?

182
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,613
I can't quite read this.

183
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:52,950
Trade. The trade tax
set by the general post.

184
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,519
The Society of Friends?
I don't have any friends.

185
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,555
- That's the rules.
- Set by him, is it?

186
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,461
The nine shillings is set in stone.

187
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:02,660
Entry fee: two shillings.

188
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,161
Pilot's fee: two shillings.

189
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:07,398
Pilot's fee departure, paid
in advance: three shillings.

190
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:10,031
It costs more to leave than...

191
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,270
Trading fee. Not trading anything.

192
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:13,971
No matter. Non-negotiable. Sixpence.

193
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:15,573
And I swear to God,
I'm not making this up,

194
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:19,076
Voluntary contribution
to the Society of Friends:

195
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,711
two shillings.

196
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:22,280
Non-negotiable.

197
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,483
This is... this is truly marvelous.

198
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:28,599
- And we're the thieves.
- Not very good ones, apparently.

199
00:16:28,624 --> 00:16:30,454
Did he know where to find Mr. Guthrie?

200
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:33,291
He did, though he didn't
seem terribly optimistic

201
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:35,359
about our chances of
gaining an audience.

202
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:38,124
When he hears the news we are
bringing, he will grant us an audience.

203
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:40,788
No, no. There's no "we."

204
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,836
I have as much to gain and
more to lose than any of us

205
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:48,864
if we fail to see
Governor Rogers removed.

206
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,509
- I believe I should be with you.
- I'm sure you do.

207
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:52,776
The last thing I need to overhear

208
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:55,145
when Mr. Guthrie rejects
our proposal is, uh...

209
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:56,200
Uh, Monsieur Constable,

210
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,491
what sort of reward might one expect

211
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:01,585
for aiding in 'zhe' capture
of a notorious pirate captain,

212
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:04,688
such as, say, oh, Jack Rackham?

213
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:08,073
Really? 'Zhat' much?

214
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:10,093
Huh. Well, what do you know?

215
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:11,562
'Zhere' he is.

216
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:13,163
You'll stay here.

217
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:15,348
I'll be back. You, let's go.

218
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:17,368
Fuck, it's cold!

219
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:32,583
I can no longer feel my balls.

220
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,390
No one should live here.

221
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,274
You're wrong about her.

222
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:43,927
Max.

223
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:48,586
When that animal Berringer
was terrorizing her,

224
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:49,945
threatening to kill her...

225
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,570
unless she agreed to name her
connections to the resistance...

226
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,006
she refused.

227
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:00,978
She's not crossed
anyone, to my knowledge,

228
00:18:01,003 --> 00:18:03,306
who hasn't first crossed her,

229
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,267
present company included.

230
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:09,627
- Jack.
- I heard you.

231
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:23,480
Go see what kind of surgeon
you can engage for Anne.

232
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,367
I'll...

233
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:27,413
do this.

234
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:31,618
What?

235
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:35,813
It's somehow only just occurred
to me how ruined we'll be

236
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:39,683
if I fail to win the man on the
other side of that door to our cause.

237
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:42,520
No home.

238
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:44,021
No cache.

239
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:45,813
Anne on death's door.

240
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:48,157
A ship that can barely sail.

241
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:51,977
But worst of all,

242
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,432
he'll have won.

243
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,544
Woodes Rogers will sit in Nassau

244
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:01,146
and grow old knowing that
he was measured against us

245
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:03,674
and proven the better man.

246
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:07,778
So, don't fail.

247
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:16,866
I once thought like you.

248
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:22,125
That because I had reason
to mistrust the pirates,

249
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:25,554
that it necessarily followed
that I must mistrust them.

250
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,703
But it is not so.

251
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:33,585
For there is also reason to
see common interest with them.

252
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:37,107
I have fought alongside these men.

253
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:39,812
I have fought alongside these men.

254
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:43,110
But I did it so that
I might find security.

255
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:46,383
But what they are now arguing for...

256
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:48,118
does not sound like security to me.

257
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:51,246
There is no lasting
security to be had here.

258
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:53,198
We'll fight to change that.

259
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:55,242
Nothing is lasting.

260
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,962
But months, years,

261
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:00,831
that is meaningful

262
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:02,766
and it can be had here.

263
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,470
You now have the
resources to have it here.

264
00:20:06,645 --> 00:20:08,947
There is a treasure in the ground here.

265
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:11,790
It'd purchase whatever
is needed to survive.

266
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:19,111
No one has ever been this close,

267
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:22,644
this near a chance to change the world.

268
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:25,556
No one changes the world.

269
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:27,549
Not like this.

270
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:29,727
Not all at once.

271
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:34,064
The world is too strong for that.

272
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:01,215
From the moment he started speaking,

273
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,561
I couldn't stop thinking about her.

274
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:08,999
She died for this.

275
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:12,171
She believed in this, and...

276
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:15,172
if it all goes away, then
it was all for nothing.

277
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:23,345
I can't let this be for
nothing. I just can't.

278
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:27,599
It has to mean...

279
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:29,936
something.

280
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,778
When I was drowning over Miranda...

281
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,150
you helped me find my way out.

282
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,952
Look at me.

283
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,093
I will do the same for you.

284
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:13,163
I give you my word.

285
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:17,080
But in order to do that,

286
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:21,387
you have to trust my
judgment for a little while

287
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,278
while yours is reeling.

288
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:29,179
You think Julius gained
momentum from what I said?

289
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,314
Don't worry about it.

290
00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:34,652
Everything is moving forward.

291
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:37,154
Just...

292
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:41,291
trust me.

293
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,306
It's been going on so long.

294
00:22:57,331 --> 00:22:58,954
We will get to the bottom of this.

295
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:00,947
Is it true?

296
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:03,814
I'm sorry?

297
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:06,884
Uh, is it true...

298
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:09,720
that you've come from Nassau?

299
00:23:12,687 --> 00:23:14,805
It's true, isn't it?

300
00:23:15,693 --> 00:23:17,711
You're one of them.

301
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:20,453
You're a pirate.

302
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:25,368
You are!

303
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:29,206
I hear everyone knows everyone
there, even the giants.

304
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:31,274
Will you tell me,

305
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:33,399
did you know Edward Teach?

306
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:35,532
Yeah.

307
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:43,528
And Jack Rackham?

308
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:46,379
Did you know him, too?

309
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:49,392
I heard a story that Jack
Rackham outsmarted Captain Flint

310
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:52,930
to capture a Spanish treasure
galleon right out from under him.

311
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:55,465
Yeah.

312
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:57,200
Knew him, too.

313
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,836
And believe it or not,
that story is true.

314
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:00,663
What about Charles Vane?

315
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:09,997
Charles Vane was my
closest friend in the world.

316
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:13,192
Tell me everything about him.

317
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:20,428
He was the bravest man I ever knew.

318
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,655
Not without fear, just unwilling...

319
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,944
to let it diminish him.

320
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,567
And loyal to a fault.

321
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:34,172
And in a world where
honesty is so regularly

322
00:24:34,197 --> 00:24:35,711
and casually disregarded...

323
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:38,250
I heard he cut off a man's head
and left it as a marker in the sand

324
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:40,133
to anyone who would cross him.

325
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:43,113
It was a little more
complicated than that.

326
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:44,681
- I heard...
- Hmm?

327
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:47,688
... he sometimes butchered
his enemies for amusement,

328
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:49,185
made stew of their flesh.

329
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,751
He was truly an animal.

330
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:53,623
- Stew?
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:24:53,922 --> 00:24:56,359
For what possible...

332
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:58,304
I'm... I beg your pardon,

333
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:00,188
but do you believe this?

334
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:02,518
I read it in a newspaper.

335
00:25:03,057 --> 00:25:05,002
- Oh.
- Mm.

336
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,752
Mr. Guthrie will see you now.

337
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:17,585
Charles Vane was a good man.

338
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:20,183
What I told you was the truth.

339
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:22,652
Put down the newspapers and read a book.

340
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:30,027
Truth isn't nearly as interesting.

341
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,709
I'm sorry, what was that?

342
00:25:32,996 --> 00:25:36,444
Uh, I said the truth isn't
nearly as interesting.

343
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,307
Sir.

344
00:25:57,955 --> 00:26:00,858
I understand you
believe we have business.

345
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:04,627
News of the Bahama Islands
of some sort, Mr....

346
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:06,420
what is it?

347
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,932
Rackham.

348
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:13,224
Captain Jack Rackham.

349
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:18,621
Is that so?

350
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:21,153
The news I bring

351
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:23,713
is of personal concern
to you, Mr. Guthrie.

352
00:26:23,738 --> 00:26:26,645
Would you prefer if we
discussed it privately?

353
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,418
Say what you came to say.

354
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:37,194
Your granddaughter Eleanor is dead.

355
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:44,476
Governor Woodes Rogers
plotted with Spanish forces

356
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:47,612
to help him quell a resistance
movement on New Providence Island

357
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:49,572
by razing it to the ground.

358
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:52,275
And Eleanor was killed as a result.

359
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:56,980
I come to offer an opportunity

360
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,044
to see that offense answered,

361
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,677
and find great commercial
opportunity in the process.

362
00:27:06,156 --> 00:27:09,526
Woodes Rogers bears debts
he cannot hope to repay.

363
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:11,328
Given the ruin Nassau lies in,

364
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:13,030
those debts could be purchased

365
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,591
for a mere fraction of
their value, for pennies.

366
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:18,835
You could own Woodes Rogers

367
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:20,337
and see him imprisoned.

368
00:27:20,437 --> 00:27:22,590
Meanwhile, while Nassau smolders,

369
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:25,442
her real property could
be bought for a song.

370
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:27,777
I bring you the chance, sir,

371
00:27:27,802 --> 00:27:31,689
to own the island, shape
the regime that runs it,

372
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:34,051
and do it all while
seeing justice visited

373
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:35,706
on your granddaughter's murderer.

374
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:37,141
No.

375
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:42,125
No to which part?

376
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,930
All of it.

377
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:48,198
Mr. Guthrie, if you'd allow
me to explain further...

378
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:50,275
I heard what you said.

379
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:53,070
The offense to my family's name

380
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,006
was done a long time ago...

381
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:58,075
by my son.

382
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:01,719
He, his daughter, and all their efforts

383
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:04,096
are parties to that offense

384
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:07,120
and are no longer family of mine.

385
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,554
That is all.

386
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:28,505
She's dead, isn't she?

387
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:37,117
Excuse me?

388
00:28:37,936 --> 00:28:40,304
The news you bring about Eleanor.

389
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:43,520
It's that she's dead, isn't it?

390
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,093
It is.

391
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:49,292
And who are you?

392
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:51,622
Her grandmother.

393
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:57,634
Wait outside.

394
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:59,836
I'll join you shortly.

395
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:14,774
How long had she known?

396
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:20,257
I honestly don't know.

397
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:24,704
Not long, I don't believe.

398
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,610
She rarely included me in her thinking.

399
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:35,977
What I knew of her was mostly observed

400
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:38,579
rather than shared.

401
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:43,413
But one thing I know to be true...

402
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:47,991
whatever risk she took...

403
00:29:48,016 --> 00:29:50,318
or danger she braved...

404
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:54,844
they were all made out of love for you.

405
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:59,162
She saw a life with you

406
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:01,070
and the child...

407
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:08,502
and she was determined to
deliver you all into it.

408
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:18,081
I'd like a moment alone.

409
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:37,738
I am so...

410
00:30:38,217 --> 00:30:40,168
very sorry.

411
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:34,557
I'm sorry.

412
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:48,805
I'm sorry.

413
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:01,984
I am...

414
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,858
I beg your pardon, my Lord.

415
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,013
What is it?

416
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:13,263
We need more supplies.

417
00:32:13,363 --> 00:32:16,609
We found him amongst
prisoners in the interior.

418
00:32:16,656 --> 00:32:19,336
I don't advise that
we consolidate them...

419
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:22,439
Absolutely. I mean, the
wars are our priorities.

420
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:24,841
A ringleader of the pirate militia.

421
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:27,000
He surrendered himself.

422
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,992
Said he would only
speak with you directly.

423
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,415
Speak with me?

424
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:36,007
About what?

425
00:32:36,465 --> 00:32:38,929
He said he wants to make a deal.

426
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:54,671
Follow me, please, Captain.

427
00:32:56,397 --> 00:32:58,581
Those men at that table
are among the wealthiest

428
00:32:58,606 --> 00:33:00,758
in the Pennsylvania Colony

429
00:33:00,843 --> 00:33:04,323
and critical suppliers
to my husband's business.

430
00:33:04,747 --> 00:33:08,117
They consider character to
be of paramount importance

431
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:09,819
in choosing their partners,

432
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,322
and so my husband has
gone to great lengths

433
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:15,986
to assure them that our
family's sordid beginnings

434
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:17,760
are long since behind us,

435
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,329
and you just stood in front of them

436
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:22,299
and proposed that my husband
join you in a revenge plot

437
00:33:22,365 --> 00:33:26,269
against the royal governor
of New Providence Island.

438
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:33,610
I'm afraid I may have
fumbled my case, then, ma'am,

439
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:37,146
but the merits of it remain
and exist well beyond revenge.

440
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:39,749
If you could help me gain
your husband's ear again,

441
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:42,592
this time in private, outside
the presence of those other men...

442
00:33:42,617 --> 00:33:44,153
My husband's commercial interests

443
00:33:44,178 --> 00:33:47,228
have grown 12-fold in
the past three years.

444
00:33:47,478 --> 00:33:49,225
By some estimates,

445
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:52,895
the estate represents the
ninth largest family fortune

446
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,889
in the Americas.

447
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:57,334
Does that sound like
something built by a man

448
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,869
who would discard an
opportunity as promising as this

449
00:33:59,894 --> 00:34:02,330
because of what the
neighbors might think?

450
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,442
No, it doesn't.

451
00:34:05,635 --> 00:34:07,926
So, what does that tell you?

452
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:11,814
It tells me...

453
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:17,354
it tells me that either Joseph Guthrie

454
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:20,332
is among the 10 luckiest
men in the Americas

455
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:21,858
or that your husband's business

456
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:24,827
is not entirely managed by your husband.

457
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:31,938
I see merit to your proposal.

458
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:35,407
Though, I've yet to see your merit.

459
00:34:35,749 --> 00:34:39,852
Why would I even consider taking
on a pirate as a partner like this?

460
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,579
First, I and my partners...

461
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,173
have intimate knowledge
of Nassau's operations.

462
00:34:45,198 --> 00:34:46,716
We've made it work once before

463
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:48,818
and could again with your help.

464
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:50,933
And second,

465
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:56,593
in all the years the Guthrie family
has had a relationship with Nassau,

466
00:34:56,693 --> 00:34:59,729
I imagine I'm the first pirate
to find his way to your ear.

467
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:04,456
So, either I'm the single
luckiest pirate in all creation

468
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:07,770
or I'm of a different
sort to the rest of them.

469
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,966
Haul away!

470
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:22,336
What happened with Mr. Guthrie?

471
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,454
Were you able to speak with him?

472
00:35:24,554 --> 00:35:26,556
- Mm-hmm.
- What did he say?

473
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:28,958
He told me to go fuck myself.

474
00:35:28,983 --> 00:35:30,918
Well, that does not sound good.

475
00:35:30,943 --> 00:35:32,857
The business isn't his.

476
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:35,155
Well, the horses are his,

477
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,589
the cart is his,

478
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:40,002
but it appears the wife is
the one holding the reins.

479
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:42,382
Eleanor's grandmother?

480
00:35:42,553 --> 00:35:44,607
And she is interested.

481
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:46,476
She invited me to return this evening

482
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:49,045
to provide details of our proposal.

483
00:35:49,145 --> 00:35:51,486
Prove that we can be
trusted to manage Nassau

484
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:53,853
in the event of Rogers' removal.

485
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:57,439
And I think you should come with me.

486
00:35:57,995 --> 00:35:59,541
You do?

487
00:36:00,457 --> 00:36:01,906
Why?

488
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:03,993
Because our plan is ludicrous...

489
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:05,762
by any sane measure,

490
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:07,839
and my suspicion is if
she's going to say yes,

491
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:11,478
it's going to be for emotional
reasons rather than financial ones.

492
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:14,737
She would look across
the table and see a woman

493
00:36:14,837 --> 00:36:18,516
with some experience quietly
wielding power over men

494
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,342
without them knowing it,

495
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:23,179
and a woman who might
remind her of herself.

496
00:36:23,204 --> 00:36:26,259
It might go a long way
towards winning her.

497
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:34,624
Do you know who I am?

498
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:39,796
You're part of Long
John Silver's resistance.

499
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:45,668
I am Long John Silver.

500
00:36:49,095 --> 00:36:51,732
The resistance in the interior...

501
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,998
I built it.

502
00:36:55,277 --> 00:36:57,714
I led it. It was mine.

503
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:02,759
I was hitting your supply
lines to the estates,

504
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:06,176
fomenting sabotage in Nassau Town.

505
00:37:08,157 --> 00:37:10,827
Fighting your soldiers
in untold skirmishes.

506
00:37:13,996 --> 00:37:15,965
You killed many of my men,

507
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:18,601
and I got my fair share of yours.

508
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:24,175
Why would you tell me this?

509
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:28,911
Because I want you to know
that I'm withholding nothing.

510
00:37:29,511 --> 00:37:31,613
That I'm telling the truth.

511
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:35,017
And I know what I'm talking about.

512
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:40,523
I don't care about the cause now.

513
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,382
I don't care about Nassau now.

514
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:48,171
I want one thing and one thing only.

515
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:50,600
What is that?

516
00:37:54,036 --> 00:37:56,272
They all turned on me.

517
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:00,142
Discarded what I'd done for them,

518
00:38:00,242 --> 00:38:02,734
the sacrifices I made,

519
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:05,181
and left me for dead.

520
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:11,187
And I want them all to pay for it.

521
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:17,391
I cannot achieve it on my own.

522
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,821
You could...

523
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:24,188
if you were so inclined
and you knew how.

524
00:38:28,037 --> 00:38:30,206
Are you so inclined?

525
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:35,211
Do you know how?

526
00:38:40,683 --> 00:38:44,513
They are strong when Flint
and Silver are united.

527
00:38:44,857 --> 00:38:47,576
But separate the two of them,

528
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:49,458
turn them one against the other,

529
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:51,885
and their world collapses.

530
00:38:52,404 --> 00:38:55,396
I tried once and failed.

531
00:38:56,132 --> 00:39:00,246
But I didn't possess the instrument
necessary to make it work.

532
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:03,152
And you possess it now?

533
00:39:04,283 --> 00:39:05,818
No.

534
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:09,667
You do.

535
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:30,713
You brought a friend.

536
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:33,029
A partner.

537
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:36,505
What sort of partner is that?

538
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:40,509
She's operated significant
commercial interests in Nassau Town,

539
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:43,236
and both before and after
restored colonial rule...

540
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:44,993
Does she speak?

541
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:52,489
There is no business of Nassau's

542
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:55,612
that has not been business
of mine for some time.

543
00:39:55,637 --> 00:39:58,629
And aside from the interference
of Woodes Rogers and his men,

544
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:01,223
my business has been sound.

545
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,768
This substantiates that.

546
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:07,203
Mr. Oliver oversees our operations.

547
00:40:07,303 --> 00:40:10,239
Before I can be convinced
that your proposal is credible,

548
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:13,876
he'll need to be convinced
that your proposal is credible.

549
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,405
- It's interesting...
- When Richard was a little boy,

550
00:40:43,505 --> 00:40:47,643
there was a tomcat that lived
out in the woods behind the house.

551
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:51,163
And it would scratch at the
windows at all hours of the night.

552
00:40:52,448 --> 00:40:56,046
Richard, all of four years old,

553
00:40:56,218 --> 00:40:59,455
would go outside,
still in his nightshirt,

554
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:01,357
and feed it.

555
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,535
My husband disapproved.

556
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,763
He thought it a sign of weakness.

557
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:13,503
Given that kindness is a
condition rare in our family,

558
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:18,374
I suppose it's unsurprising
that it went misdiagnosed.

559
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:22,678
So, Richard would feed the tomcat...

560
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:25,314
and Joseph would flog
him for disobeying,

561
00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:28,128
kick the tomcat for instigating.

562
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:33,022
But the next night,
the tomcat would return,

563
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:36,295
and on and on and on it went.

564
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:40,483
See, none of them was
capable of changing.

565
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,553
The cat a slave to his hunger,

566
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:46,023
my son to...

567
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,624
his decency...

568
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:53,093
my husband to his rage.

569
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:58,098
That would seem to be the history
of Nassau, too, wouldn't it?

570
00:41:58,123 --> 00:42:00,049
A cycle of violence...

571
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:03,537
that benefits none and consumes all.

572
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:06,823
Suppose the question is...

573
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:11,127
in Nassau's story, which
of these roles do you play?

574
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,382
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

575
00:42:17,214 --> 00:42:19,877
There are entries for
your wage laborers here,

576
00:42:19,902 --> 00:42:22,686
but I see no accounting for the others.

577
00:42:23,522 --> 00:42:26,011
I have no other laborers.

578
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:29,879
Your slaves, ma'am.

579
00:42:31,613 --> 00:42:35,862
I own no slaves and
none work in my employ.

580
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,922
I see cargo operations,
uh, transportation of sugar,

581
00:42:39,947 --> 00:42:42,383
building, all sorts of manual labor.

582
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:44,126
That is correct.

583
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,062
In the Bahamas.

584
00:42:46,162 --> 00:42:48,564
And you pay wages for all of that?

585
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:50,199
That doesn't seem very wise to me.

586
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:52,439
You are not from Nassau.

587
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:55,872
In Nassau, slaves have
seen too many of their own

588
00:42:55,938 --> 00:42:59,107
find freedom amongst
the crews on the account.

589
00:42:59,641 --> 00:43:03,779
It costs less to pay wages
than to replace defectors,

590
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,717
or worse yet,

591
00:43:05,742 --> 00:43:08,512
to pay guards to watch
my door as I sleep.

592
00:43:08,537 --> 00:43:11,387
That isn't the only
reason, though, is it?

593
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,724
No, it is not.

594
00:43:27,136 --> 00:43:30,439
In my life, I have been bought and sold.

595
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:32,369
And as I would be no slave again,

596
00:43:32,394 --> 00:43:34,964
and nor would I be a master.

597
00:43:40,377 --> 00:43:42,518
So, how exactly does one rise

598
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:45,354
from a slave plantation
in the French West Indies

599
00:43:45,379 --> 00:43:48,790
to a library in Philadelphia,

600
00:43:48,815 --> 00:43:51,117
trying to remake the world?

601
00:43:52,592 --> 00:43:54,827
What difference does it make?

602
00:44:02,493 --> 00:44:04,455
You are right.

603
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:07,944
Many men have played a
role in Nassau's story,

604
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:12,293
but none have been able to break
the cycle of brutality and failure.

605
00:44:13,582 --> 00:44:15,017
Your granddaughter came as close

606
00:44:15,117 --> 00:44:17,699
as anyone before or since.

607
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:22,291
But at the end of the day and
despite her best intentions,

608
00:44:22,316 --> 00:44:25,427
there was one truth even
she was unable to see.

609
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:28,965
That at some point,

610
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:31,236
progress cannot begin...

611
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:33,955
and suffering will not end...

612
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,291
until someone has the courage
to go out into the woods

613
00:44:37,316 --> 00:44:40,086
and drown the damned cat.

614
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:48,188
Lend us your help,

615
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:50,852
and we will do whatever must be done

616
00:44:50,877 --> 00:44:53,179
to move Nassau forward.

617
00:44:59,428 --> 00:45:02,331
I am intrigued by your proposal.

618
00:45:03,332 --> 00:45:05,167
But there is one question remaining

619
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:08,978
that you will have to show
me you can adequately answer.

620
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,412
What will you do when
the cat fights back?

621
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:40,669
It just arrived from Nassau.

622
00:45:45,471 --> 00:45:47,255
She's alive.

623
00:45:49,245 --> 00:45:51,823
Held hostage by the governor in Nassau.

624
00:45:53,549 --> 00:45:55,517
Unless we bring him the cache

625
00:45:55,617 --> 00:45:58,620
and surrender it to him
by his deadline, she dies.

626
00:45:59,463 --> 00:46:01,523
She's alive.

627
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:03,492
Who else knows about this?

628
00:46:03,592 --> 00:46:05,161
No one.

629
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:07,865
I summoned only the two of you.

630
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,605
My daughter...

631
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,794
is everything to me,

632
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,419
as I believe she is to you.

633
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:19,908
But that cache is
critical to the success

634
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:21,410
of the war we're about to begin.

635
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,978
And worse yet,

636
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:26,282
if it were to be dug out of
the ground under cover of night,

637
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:29,185
it would do irreparable damage
to our allies' trust in us.

638
00:46:29,285 --> 00:46:31,995
So, we don't do it
under the cover of night.

639
00:46:32,254 --> 00:46:33,922
We make the argument.

640
00:46:33,947 --> 00:46:36,159
And this isn't just sentiment.

641
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,167
Madi is important to the
cause in her own right.

642
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:43,565
Some of the men out there
will agree, and we can...

643
00:46:49,305 --> 00:46:51,898
It doesn't matter if some of them agree.

644
00:46:53,175 --> 00:46:55,577
You're suggesting we just refuse?

645
00:46:56,612 --> 00:46:58,552
They'll kill her.

646
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,911
If we even introduce this
question to the men in this camp,

647
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,403
lines will be drawn,
fighting will ensue.

648
00:47:07,022 --> 00:47:09,466
This alliance is far
too fragile at this stage

649
00:47:09,491 --> 00:47:12,261
to withstand that kind of turmoil.

650
00:47:14,296 --> 00:47:17,165
We can pay the ransom
or we can have our war,

651
00:47:17,466 --> 00:47:19,517
but we cannot have both.

652
00:47:20,136 --> 00:47:21,868
A week ago,

653
00:47:21,893 --> 00:47:25,441
you were willing to trade
this money for a fucking fort.

654
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:28,870
And now it's too important
to trade for Madi's life?

655
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:31,380
Things have changed.

656
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,126
Nothing has changed that justifies
trading her life for your war.

657
00:47:35,151 --> 00:47:37,486
No one is saying that we let her die.

658
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:40,756
No? Because that is
certainly what it sounds like.

659
00:47:40,856 --> 00:47:43,159
We will find a way to get her back.

660
00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:46,486
We just cannot sacrifice
the cache in order to do it.

661
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:50,732
Is this war more
important than her life?

662
00:47:52,214 --> 00:47:54,128
Answer the question.

663
00:47:55,471 --> 00:47:57,339
I wanna hear you say it.

664
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,903
Is this war more
important than her life?

665
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:08,114
Right now with what's at stake...

666
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:11,687
- ... yes, it is more important.
- Oh, fuck you! I...

667
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:15,056
We cannot permit Woodes
Rogers to divide us like this.

668
00:48:15,081 --> 00:48:16,333
I will not permit it.

669
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:18,894
Madi would not permit
it, and you know it.

670
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:21,230
But we're not going to
permit him to kill her either.

671
00:48:21,322 --> 00:48:22,483
You cannot guarantee that...

672
00:48:22,508 --> 00:48:25,374
We will sail to Nassau
under cover of night.

673
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:28,061
We will find her. We will kill
anyone who stands in our way.

674
00:48:28,086 --> 00:48:30,322
And we will bring her home.

675
00:48:32,802 --> 00:48:35,374
When you and I are of the same mind...

676
00:48:36,278 --> 00:48:39,514
there is nothing we have
not yet been able to do.

677
00:48:41,617 --> 00:48:43,419
I believe that.

678
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,222
I trust it.

679
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:49,535
Do you?

680
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:34,870
I've heard you were with her.

681
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:39,681
With Eleanor.

682
00:49:42,344 --> 00:49:44,280
How did she die?

683
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:49,667
- What?
- Weapons...

684
00:49:49,692 --> 00:49:52,065
were found inside the house...

685
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:56,581
a soldier who was dead
before the fire consumed him.

686
00:50:01,029 --> 00:50:04,118
I'm asking if she died fighting.

687
00:50:28,165 --> 00:50:30,000
What is that?

688
00:50:30,482 --> 00:50:32,167
Terms.

689
00:50:34,968 --> 00:50:37,299
When this is through, you'll
present this to your people

690
00:50:37,324 --> 00:50:39,273
and advocate to accept them.

691
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,805
Every fugitive slave in
your camp will receive

692
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:46,062
their immediate emancipation.

693
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:48,276
With one condition.

694
00:50:50,412 --> 00:50:52,681
Any escaped slave who
seeks refuge with you

695
00:50:52,781 --> 00:50:54,350
after the ratification of this deal

696
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,568
will be surrendered to the law.

697
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:00,311
And any pirate at any time

698
00:51:00,336 --> 00:51:01,614
who seeks refuge with you

699
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:04,459
will be surrendered to the law.

700
00:51:07,207 --> 00:51:10,257
Why would we ever accept that?

701
00:51:10,282 --> 00:51:12,032
Because if you don't, I will see to it

702
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:14,516
that every man, woman,
and child in that camp

703
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:15,695
is put back into chains.

704
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:17,873
I will see each of
them sold far and wide,

705
00:51:17,973 --> 00:51:19,641
cast out into the world alone.

706
00:51:19,741 --> 00:51:24,078
And then I will burn everything
that remains to the ground.

707
00:51:26,415 --> 00:51:28,384
From here, your outcomes

708
00:51:28,409 --> 00:51:31,562
are bad or worse.

709
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:37,058
That's what defeat looks like.

710
00:52:04,634 --> 00:52:06,788
Eleanor died fighting.

711
00:52:11,067 --> 00:52:13,002
As will I.

712
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:30,646
Thank you.

713
00:52:30,671 --> 00:52:34,201
They're saying you're heading
south and I'm to stay here.

714
00:52:34,232 --> 00:52:37,412
I can't get a straight answer past that.

715
00:52:37,653 --> 00:52:39,020
Sit down.

716
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:48,270
She agreed.

717
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:51,099
Madam Guthrie.

718
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,466
Everything we want for Nassau.

719
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:57,238
Control,

720
00:52:57,473 --> 00:52:59,007
a stake,

721
00:52:59,107 --> 00:53:02,185
Rogers' defeat and humiliation.

722
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:06,247
There's now a real path to have it done.

723
00:53:06,272 --> 00:53:07,991
But...

724
00:53:08,016 --> 00:53:12,463
there is one final test...

725
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:13,989
to prove our worth

726
00:53:14,089 --> 00:53:16,339
and to lessen the risk on her end.

727
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:19,297
What is it?

728
00:53:19,545 --> 00:53:21,447
Flint.

729
00:53:22,664 --> 00:53:25,734
She wants him dead and
she wants me to do it.

730
00:53:25,927 --> 00:53:27,829
Jesus.

731
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:34,219
On some level, they can't be blamed.

732
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:37,430
Flint will stop at nothing

733
00:53:37,455 --> 00:53:40,055
till all the West Indies are ablaze.

734
00:53:40,882 --> 00:53:44,219
Without him, our prospects
of success in Nassau

735
00:53:44,244 --> 00:53:47,334
are certainly greatly improved.

736
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:49,825
And as far as he and I go,

737
00:53:49,925 --> 00:53:51,760
it's not as if he
wouldn't do the same to me

738
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,729
were the roles reversed.

739
00:53:55,408 --> 00:53:59,389
Jack, how are you gonna do that?

740
00:54:00,101 --> 00:54:02,070
I don't know.

741
00:54:03,104 --> 00:54:05,140
I'll have to find him,

742
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,209
get through the army of
maroons he calls allies,

743
00:54:08,234 --> 00:54:10,471
get through Long John Silver,

744
00:54:10,646 --> 00:54:13,996
and the animal whose leash he now holds.

745
00:54:15,495 --> 00:54:17,863
And somehow escape it all alive...

746
00:54:20,188 --> 00:54:22,023
all without you.

747
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,928
But even if you could
do all those things...

748
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,600
I mean, how could you be
someone who would do that?

749
00:54:34,327 --> 00:54:35,904
The world would know
that you were the one

750
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:38,640
to betray every last
one of our brothers.

751
00:54:40,341 --> 00:54:43,211
Betray the memory of Charles Vane.

752
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:49,050
Charles Vane is dead.

753
00:54:52,688 --> 00:54:54,597
I do it for us.

754
00:54:56,825 --> 00:54:59,042
That's how it started.

755
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:01,757
That's how it's going to end.

756
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:08,367
We should be going.

757
00:55:53,849 --> 00:55:55,554
You'll...

758
00:55:56,017 --> 00:55:57,695
you know...

759
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:01,444
I will.

760
00:56:08,429 --> 00:56:10,065
Look lively.

761
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:11,499
Let's get underway.

762
00:56:34,923 --> 00:56:39,972
Seems confident it's
to be done, doesn't he?

763
00:56:40,746 --> 00:56:43,999
To rescue her without paying
the governor his ransom.

764
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:48,579
He is confident in his plan...

765
00:56:49,982 --> 00:56:51,899
as am I.

766
00:56:54,109 --> 00:56:55,756
Maybe.

767
00:56:57,553 --> 00:57:01,157
One of you is more confident
than the other, I think.

768
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:04,052
What are you saying?

769
00:57:08,223 --> 00:57:10,363
You're confident in his plan,

770
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:12,560
maybe because it's a good plan.

771
00:57:12,585 --> 00:57:14,930
Maybe because it's the only plan.

772
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:19,334
But maybe it's just because
if his plan don't succeed,

773
00:57:19,434 --> 00:57:22,871
you'll have to show him that
you prepared for the failure.

774
00:57:24,272 --> 00:57:27,243
That the world ain't
gonna be what he wanted.

775
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:32,080
And that a treasure he
wanted left in the ground

776
00:57:32,555 --> 00:57:34,883
ain't in the ground no more.

777
00:57:41,156 --> 00:57:43,137
And when that happens...

778
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:46,269
and the extreme reaction follows,

779
00:57:46,294 --> 00:57:48,801
it's one of two roads ahead.

780
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:53,391
You're either gonna have to
concede and let him have his way...

781
00:57:54,535 --> 00:57:57,024
or you're gonna have to kill him.

782
00:57:58,473 --> 00:58:00,909
You know this, don't you?

783
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:15,064
