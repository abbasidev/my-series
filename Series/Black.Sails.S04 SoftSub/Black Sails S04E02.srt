1
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:13,959
- They obstructed the harbor.
- I know.

2
00:00:14,043 --> 00:00:15,918
- Two ships they sunk.
- I know, I...

3
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:18,379
- Then why didn't you warn us?
- I did warn you!

4
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:20,626
We don't have sufficient
numbers to move on Nassau,

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,629
but if we could
increase those numbers...

6
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:24,832
- Increase them how?
- The Underhill plantation.

7
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,959
Captured nine more just
east of the fence line.

8
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:29,418
I want the trial started
as soon as possible.

9
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:30,773
What did he do?

10
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:33,832
Set a course for Nassau to
send a message when we return.

11
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,168
When I informed Sarah of my intent
to formally end our marriage,

12
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:39,293
her family persuaded my old creditors

13
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:41,626
to accelerate my
timetables for repayment.

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,144
I would default.

15
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:45,710
Three men know the
resting place of the chest,

16
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:46,833
and one woman.

17
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,585
He told it to me before we left home.

18
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:50,959
There will be no pirate king here.

19
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:53,001
Of that much I am certain.

20
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,861
Long John Silver. Welcome home.

22
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,985
What is this?

23
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:10,376
I said, what's going on here?

24
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:12,678
What do you want from me?

25
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:54,119
Blacksmith pays for these.

26
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:01,329
Jeweler pays for these.

27
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:06,848
The law pays for you.

28
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:12,881
500 pieces for Long John Silver.

29
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:17,058
I'm sorry, I think you're
mistaken. I'm not...

30
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,244
I seen you. Huh?

31
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:24,996
Before.

32
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:27,021
Before you was Long.

33
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:32,158
Now...

34
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:36,912
they say you're supposed
to be a pirate king.

35
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,106
A strongman.

36
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,912
That true?

37
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,495
Hmm.

38
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,537
That's what I thought.

39
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,754
More lies.

40
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,662
So,

41
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,079
you returned.

42
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,763
You're angry.

43
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:05,971
Ah.

44
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:10,104
And you just killed one
of the governor's men.

45
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:15,119
Now write that.

46
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:17,996
I killed who?

47
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,245
Killed him.

48
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,625
What?

49
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,912
500 pieces they pay before you did it.

50
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:31,073
I think more after.

51
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:33,697
Fuck you.

52
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,704
Write.

53
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:46,684
I am told it will begin soon.

54
00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:51,524
The executions of the men

55
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:54,094
captured on the beach yesterday.

56
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,978
It's for the best to have it done.

57
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,812
It could have been you.

58
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:11,471
I gave you...

59
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,245
both of you,

60
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:17,305
a place to stand here.

61
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:20,352
I gave you a life,

62
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:22,835
and you repaid me

63
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,449
by conspiring with my enemies.

64
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:27,502
Ma'am, I don't know what
you think you heard, but...

65
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:29,277
Quiet.

66
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:36,746
I know you were responsible
for Captain Rackham's escape.

67
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:40,871
I know you solicited her
to aid you in the effort.

68
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,623
I know you relayed information
to the pirate resistance

69
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:47,065
throughout the purges here.

70
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,564
I have been monitoring
all of it since it began.

71
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,382
Monitoring?

72
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:55,155
You intercepted his message.

73
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:57,315
The warning that was
to alert Captain Flint

74
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:59,438
of the governor's
obstructing the harbor.

75
00:09:02,814 --> 00:09:05,072
Why aren't we out there?

76
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:08,707
Why didn't you report
us to Captain Berringer?

77
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,273
Let fall!

78
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,023
The continued pirate threat
makes Captain Berringer

79
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:31,023
a necessary, if temporary, evil.

80
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,438
But I do not care for
the idea of having him

81
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,981
trampling through my affairs,

82
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:38,095
encouraged by one scandal
to search for more,

83
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,890
which is why I secured an
agreement from the governor

84
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:44,190
that my informants would be
held immune from any prosecution

85
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:47,520
for their prior associations
with the pirates.

86
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:53,311
This will all pass soon enough...

87
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:55,652
if we let it.

88
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:07,838
My grandfather was a
pirate of another sort.

89
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:10,907
When he was a young
man, he swindled a ship,

90
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,049
hired it to privateers,

91
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:16,199
and earned a share of their
spoils for his trouble.

92
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:19,740
But he had an ambition for
something far greater than plunder,

93
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:22,573
a desire to build
something more permanent.

94
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:25,199
So, plunder purchased more ships.

95
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:27,740
Ships generated more profits,

96
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:29,448
profits became wealth,

97
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:32,817
which became influence,
which became power.

98
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:36,321
By the time I was born,

99
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:40,872
my grandfather was one of the
wealthiest men in the New World.

100
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,657
If I go to him,

101
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,657
if I plead our case
and gain his support,

102
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,929
that might be all we
need, all Nassau needs,

103
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:55,371
to emerge from this intact.

104
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:00,718
He could pay my debts?

105
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:03,807
Several times over, yes.

106
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:06,657
He could send us ships?

107
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,770
And guns?

108
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:10,361
And mercenaries?

109
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,603
Yes.

110
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:15,550
But?

111
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:18,603
My father was ill-favored by his family,

112
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:20,603
and that was before he
made their name synonymous

113
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:23,020
with piracy in the West Indies.

114
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:25,062
And all I've done
since is make their name

115
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:27,229
synonymous with scandal in London.

116
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:30,728
It is far from a foregone conclusion

117
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:33,602
that they'll be inclined
to offer me their help.

118
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:37,187
But,

119
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:40,187
given our state of affairs,

120
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,092
it seems more than worth a try.

121
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,853
And unlike in the past...

122
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,562
I now have something to offer them

123
00:11:48,602 --> 00:11:50,965
that may make the ask more attractive.

124
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,437
What's that?

125
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:56,812
You.

126
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:01,562
They can purchase ships
and influence and power,

127
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:04,489
but they cannot purchase
what they ultimately want.

128
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:07,395
And that is for the family to
be known within London society

129
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:10,737
for something more than being
a backwater merchant clan.

130
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,145
Calling you a part of it
certainly wouldn't hurt matters.

131
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:22,602
What is it?

132
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,145
Steady, now.

133
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:38,978
She drifted into the
harbor a little while ago.

134
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:44,847
A message from Teach upon his return.

135
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:48,681
There he intends to sit.

136
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,536
Denying passage in or out of the bay.

137
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:57,865
If we cede to his demand, he will leave.

138
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:00,188
What demand is that?

139
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,354
That we surrender to him the
woman he holds responsible

140
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:04,382
for the murder of Charles Vane.

141
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:11,499
He also holds 61 more of my
men prisoner aboard his ship.

142
00:13:13,187 --> 00:13:15,251
If we refuse,

143
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:19,020
he promises they will meet
the same fate as these men.

144
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,601
He won't turn her over.

145
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,354
Not for 60 men.

146
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,020
Not for 600 men.

147
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:36,602
No.

148
00:13:36,645 --> 00:13:38,602
I don't expect he will.

149
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:43,868
Nor do we have the stores to
maintain this blockade for long.

150
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,356
So we need to move quickly.

151
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:49,142
You'll gather your men.

152
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:51,934
You will stand ready to
depart upon nightfall.

153
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,922
And whilst the enemy
remains focused on us,

154
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:55,763
you will make your landing to the west

155
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:58,187
and move undetected into town.

156
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,601
You will find Eleanor Guthrie

157
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:04,127
and you will bring her
out of Nassau, back here.

158
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,761
There ain't no good
way in from the west.

159
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,250
I agree. Perhaps an
approach from the lagoon.

160
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:15,483
Do it.

161
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:48,602
We depart for the Underhill
plantation on the hour,

162
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:51,728
arrive just before dark,
approach from the east,

163
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:54,020
eliminate the overseers,

164
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:56,020
secure the main house, and in so doing

165
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,479
establish a camp
capable of Billy's plan.

166
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:02,556
Your plan.

167
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,065
You will be leading our forces.

168
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:06,730
Does that not make it your plan, too?

169
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,730
What choice do I have?

170
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,181
I must say, it, uh,
caught me by surprise,

171
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:16,357
your assertion that Mr. Silver

172
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,690
had revealed the whereabouts
of the buried cache.

173
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:23,358
- Assertion?
- Maybe he told you.

174
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:26,981
Felt close enough to you
to share it, or maybe...

175
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,894
you saw an opportunity

176
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:32,981
to counter my leverage with Billy.

177
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:35,748
And all it took was a lie

178
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,243
that's terribly
inconvenient to disprove.

179
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:45,572
And what choice did I have?

180
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:48,065
The moment we arrived,

181
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,607
it was instantly clear to me...

182
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,730
he is the one keeping
this place together.

183
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:57,729
His men look up to him, rely on him,

184
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,315
trust him.

185
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,826
Many of your men even
trust him, as well.

186
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:07,357
He is going to be relevant
to what happens next here.

187
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:10,049
That much is painfully obvious.

188
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:13,981
And your first instinct
is to dismiss him.

189
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,729
Had I not stepped in,

190
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,174
who knows how destructive
that could have become

191
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:19,741
for everyone?

192
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,968
Can't sit still and
let him hold us hostage.

193
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:55,633
Can't fight him directly

194
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:58,633
or we risk losing what
few soldiers we have left.

195
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,008
And even if I could slip a ship past him

196
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:02,726
to seek aid from your
family in the colonies,

197
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:04,834
you'd have to be on that ship.

198
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:07,158
And you'd never get that
far before he caught you.

199
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:09,815
I won't risk that.

200
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,383
All right.

201
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,042
Here's what we're gonna do.

202
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:22,667
I board the sloop...

203
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,000
- No.
- ... and I run.

204
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,459
You just said it's
too far to outrun him.

205
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,874
To Philadelphia it's too far,

206
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,334
but I can make safe
harbor somewhere nearer.

207
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:31,428
Outrun for a day, pull
him away from here,

208
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:32,873
then seek shelter in a friendly port

209
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:34,225
strong enough to prevent his entry.

210
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,209
Meanwhile...

211
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:37,667
the door will be open for you

212
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:40,336
to reach your grandfather
and gain his aid.

213
00:17:43,183 --> 00:17:45,000
Why you?

214
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:47,417
Why not have someone else lead him away?

215
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,394
Because he won't leave that
position to chase someone else.

216
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:52,298
He'd chase you,

217
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:54,125
and I believe, given the opportunity,

218
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,873
he might chase me for a chance

219
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,307
at ending this regime once and for all.

220
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:04,209
From where I stand, it's
the only way out of this.

221
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:11,501
Insurrection against the
lawfully appointed governor,

222
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:14,128
high seas piracy, treason.

223
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:16,751
Does the accused have any words to say

224
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:18,834
in his own defense?

225
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:22,308
Fuck... you.

226
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:23,874
- Oh, get him.
- This is injustice!

227
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,129
Fuck you!

228
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,626
Fuck you!

229
00:18:29,084 --> 00:18:31,153
Gentlemen, that's enough!

230
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,720
Get out there. Go on.

231
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,802
Bring in the next man!

232
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:40,626
It's been like that all day.

233
00:18:43,316 --> 00:18:46,065
We've condemned a
dozen men since morning.

234
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:48,065
And between them,

235
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:51,226
I've yet to see an ounce of remorse.

236
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,817
Savages to the bitter end.

237
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:01,490
When you condemn a dozen
men in as many hours,

238
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,692
perhaps remorse is a bit much to ask.

239
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:07,375
You object to these trials.

240
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,065
I do not object to trials,

241
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,316
I do not object to hangings.

242
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:15,316
What I do object to,
however, is spectacle,

243
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:17,650
certain to increase defiance and anger

244
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,608
rather than sooth it.

245
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,065
We should be moving past this,

246
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:24,064
not wallowing in it.

247
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,278
That's a very noble perspective.

248
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:30,191
And I might share it were it
not for the soldier of mine

249
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:33,400
found with his throat
slit this morning...

250
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:36,525
with a note attached...

251
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:40,483
threatening that any
further hanging of pirates

252
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:42,483
would be met with more reprisals.

253
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:47,692
A note attributed...

254
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:50,733
to Long John Silver.

255
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,650
I believe our current
war is far from over.

256
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:58,233
I believe there are yet
still radicals amongst us

257
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:01,692
eager to do us harm in the
name of their pirate king.

258
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:07,065
And I believe there is
more you could be doing

259
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:10,794
to aid us in ferreting
out those radicals.

260
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:16,817
If you choose to.

261
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:24,400
I am very sorry for
the loss of your man,

262
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:26,817
and I will be vigilant, as I always am,

263
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,858
about any information
that might allow us

264
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:31,065
to make Nassau safe.

265
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,858
But promises were made

266
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,650
by the governor to me,

267
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,817
by me to my informants.

268
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:40,791
And if oaths are no longer kept here,

269
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:43,817
if boundaries are no
longer respected here,

270
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,818
then there is no civilization
left here to defend,

271
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:51,394
and I do not know what
we are fighting for.

272
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:57,556
In a matter of hours,

273
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:01,418
the governor and his wife will set
sail from here aboard separate vessels

274
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:04,316
to seek aid in our efforts.

275
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:06,582
He to Port Royal,

276
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:09,340
she to Philadelphia.

277
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:13,817
I alone am to be left in
charge of Nassau's security.

278
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:17,858
And I gave our lord
governor my solemn oath

279
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:20,693
that I would see it protected...

280
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:24,233
against any and all enemies.

281
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:28,064
I look forward very much

282
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:30,879
to be working with you to that end.

283
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:41,736
Philadelphia?

284
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:45,040
What is in Philadelphia worth
leaving things here in this state?

285
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:46,608
My grandfather spent his winters there

286
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:48,767
negotiating with his
suppliers for the spring.

287
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,583
I'll find him there and
secure his assistance.

288
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,316
I must strongly advise against it,

289
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:55,595
against you and the governor
being gone in this moment.

290
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,801
We are so very close to winning this war

291
00:21:57,826 --> 00:22:00,191
and finally bringing
Nassau out of the dark.

292
00:22:00,498 --> 00:22:03,287
But I fear we cannot complete
the victory on our own.

293
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,050
We're going to need help, and this
is the only way I know how to get it.

294
00:22:06,082 --> 00:22:08,672
You and I both know that there
are men on both sides of this war

295
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:11,144
whose identities are so
enmeshed in this conflict

296
00:22:11,145 --> 00:22:14,605
that they are more afraid of ending
it than they are of losing it.

297
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,145
And I believe you are about
to elevate one of those men

298
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:19,793
into a position of significant power.

299
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:21,563
That may very well be,

300
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:24,022
but Captain Berringer is loyal.

301
00:22:24,145 --> 00:22:26,271
Captain Berringer is strong.

302
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:28,145
And at this moment, Captain Berringer

303
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:30,897
is a man before whom
Nassau lives in terror.

304
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:33,772
Right now, that might be what she needs.

305
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:38,145
The governor will return
soon and I soon thereafter.

306
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:40,943
We just need things to hold until then.

307
00:22:41,388 --> 00:22:43,772
And this seems like
our best chance at it.

308
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:05,271
"More lies."

309
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,754
Who else's lies am I to
be held responsible for?

310
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,232
I heard a story once...

311
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:26,396
told to me by Captain Flint,

312
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,145
who knows Nassau's history
as well as any other.

313
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:35,020
A story about a man
consigned to the wrecks.

314
00:23:35,925 --> 00:23:39,758
A man who was quite
specifically disfigured.

315
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,623
A man who sailed with Edward Teach

316
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:45,627
in his early days.

317
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,623
One of his most trusted men...

318
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:53,446
and one of the deadliest
men that Nassau ever knew.

319
00:23:55,658 --> 00:23:59,480
I heard that on the day
Governor Thompson fled,

320
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:03,105
it was actually this
man who wielded the knife

321
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:05,271
that killed his wife and son.

322
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:09,105
So, all Teach and
Jennings and the giants

323
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:12,274
were hailed as the fathers
of the pirate republic.

324
00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:16,730
It was actually another
who cut the cord.

325
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:23,878
I heard his name was...

326
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,049
Israel Hands.

327
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,570
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

328
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,563
Though, given the rest of the story,

329
00:24:44,688 --> 00:24:48,146
it is of some curiosity to
me that you're still here.

330
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:51,145
See, I heard that when Captain Teach

331
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:54,480
began to see Charles
Vane as his heir apparent,

332
00:24:54,563 --> 00:24:57,605
Israel Hands became
jealous of Teach's affection

333
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:00,022
and that it led to a
falling out with the captain

334
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:03,313
that was most humiliating.

335
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:08,145
A degrading beating before
all the crews on the beach.

336
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:10,753
A pistol shot just missing his eye,

337
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,730
rendering him a misshapen wretch.

338
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:18,145
You talk too much.

339
00:25:27,396 --> 00:25:29,856
So, you can understand my confusion,

340
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:31,271
given that Nassau's first king

341
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:34,733
embarrassed you so
thoroughly and so publicly,

342
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:37,480
forbade any other crew from having you.

343
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:39,926
Why on earth would you have stayed?

344
00:25:41,368 --> 00:25:43,772
I sincerely hope it isn't
because you're still holding out

345
00:25:43,897 --> 00:25:46,601
for some sort of apology from Teach.

346
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,891
Fuck Teach.

347
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:03,962
Yeah, fuck Teach.

348
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:05,529
Huh?

349
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:07,823
We are brothers that
sail beneath the black.

350
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:10,660
How can a man like
that be the best of us?

351
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:17,143
Well, they followed Teach,
and where did it lead?

352
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,998
An English governor raising
his flag over Nassau.

353
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:26,430
Fuck Teach.

354
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,591
He was almost the end of us.

355
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:32,628
But now I'm here...

356
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:35,877
and things are about to begin again.

357
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,246
You?

358
00:26:40,323 --> 00:26:43,908
Who are you that I ought
to pay you any mind?

359
00:26:44,674 --> 00:26:46,559
I'm no one.

360
00:26:48,022 --> 00:26:49,867
From nowhere.

361
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,533
Belonging to nothing.

362
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:57,223
I'm a wretch like you.

363
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:59,728
And yet...

364
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:04,896
mountains of gold have changed
hands because I chose it.

365
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:09,210
Thousands of men in Nassau
are living in fear of my return

366
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:10,876
because I decreed it.

367
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:14,793
Hundreds of dead redcoats in
a forest not far from here,

368
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:17,335
because I made it so.

369
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:22,457
I'm the reason grown
men lie awake at night.

370
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:27,609
I am a new beginning for Nassau.

371
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:35,693
And you'd trade all of that for what?

372
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:38,899
500 pieces?

373
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,806
You think you're worth more?

374
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,703
To the right people.

375
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:53,999
Who?

376
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,128
Who would pay so much for you?

377
00:28:27,223 --> 00:28:28,680
Enough.

378
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:35,196
Is she asleep yet?

379
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,870
Audrey?

380
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:40,437
Are you asleep yet?

381
00:28:41,064 --> 00:28:42,310
Yes.

382
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:47,785
Your daughter.

383
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:54,712
Ruth, fix some more
hot water, would you?

384
00:28:58,574 --> 00:29:00,159
Ruth?

385
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,037
What is it?

386
00:29:16,062 --> 00:29:18,895
We're under attack!

387
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,270
Move! Move!

388
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:24,978
The main slave quarters.

389
00:30:25,003 --> 00:30:27,545
Take as many extra weapons as you can.

390
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,153
Let's get them armed.

391
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:31,270
It's only a matter of
time before militia arrive

392
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:33,352
from other estates that heard the alarm.

393
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:12,970
Wait!

394
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:19,226
If you shoot,

395
00:31:19,594 --> 00:31:21,338
I'll have to do the same.

396
00:31:48,468 --> 00:31:50,092
Hello, Ruth.

397
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:09,654
You knew my father.

398
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:15,003
I had heard that you might be coming

399
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:17,634
to set us free.

400
00:32:18,392 --> 00:32:19,811
Yes.

401
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:23,670
I'm glad that you came.

402
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:27,532
And now...

403
00:32:28,462 --> 00:32:30,484
I need you to go.

404
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:01,637
They say your ship is ready to depart.

405
00:33:02,852 --> 00:33:05,062
The launch awaits you at the jetty.

406
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:11,395
I should be going.

407
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,978
How long do you think to Port Royal?

408
00:33:20,062 --> 00:33:21,545
I'll make it.

409
00:33:22,395 --> 00:33:24,837
I promise you I will make it.

410
00:33:24,862 --> 00:33:27,370
Don't you dare let him
catch you, don't you dare.

411
00:33:27,395 --> 00:33:29,062
I won't.

412
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,191
You wait until morning to depart.

413
00:33:35,395 --> 00:33:37,853
I don't want him lurking in the dark
out there awaiting another departure.

414
00:33:37,878 --> 00:33:39,379
I know.

415
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,852
I hear Philadelphia is lovely.

416
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:46,852
Try not to dawdle there.

417
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:52,437
I will see you back here again.

418
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:54,169
Soon.

419
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,701
Soon.

420
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:08,504
He wants to know when you're leaving.

421
00:35:11,466 --> 00:35:14,300
You have no intention
of leaving, do you?

422
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:20,477
What exactly do you suggest I tell him?

423
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:22,394
Whatever the fuck you wanna tell him.

424
00:35:22,477 --> 00:35:23,723
Anne.

425
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:26,686
At a certain point,
there is a good chance

426
00:35:26,711 --> 00:35:29,958
he'll just decide to kill you
than take your no for an answer.

427
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:31,852
He can try.

428
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:33,519
"He can try."

429
00:35:33,644 --> 00:35:36,269
I'll pass that one along.

430
00:35:38,356 --> 00:35:40,941
I go looking for Eleanor Guthrie,

431
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:44,059
you know I'm gonna find her, too.

432
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,447
Max.

433
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,405
Said if I turned over
the cache, you'd be safe.

434
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,797
And it ain't just the lie.

435
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:05,519
She tried to take you away from me.

436
00:36:11,218 --> 00:36:13,217
When I left that island...

437
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:18,368
all I could think about was
having a chance to make her pay...

438
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:21,019
for what she done.

439
00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:25,811
Now that we're here...

440
00:36:28,894 --> 00:36:31,019
it would be so easy.

441
00:36:34,602 --> 00:36:36,484
And I don't wanna do it.

442
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:43,059
Don't wanna live with it after.

443
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:48,519
The sight of her hurt in that way.

444
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:53,128
Just don't want it.

445
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:02,619
That fucking island.

446
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:07,269
Makes you do shit you don't wanna do.

447
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:14,465
How is it we haven't
figured that out by now?

448
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:20,211
What the hell are we
doing back here, Jack?

449
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:29,811
It's the governor's banner!

450
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:32,059
Glass, please. Quickly.

451
00:38:03,922 --> 00:38:05,811
Well, the good news is...

452
00:38:05,894 --> 00:38:07,852
Ben's squad just found a
storehouse filled to the ceiling

453
00:38:07,936 --> 00:38:09,936
of salt pork, corn.

454
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:12,852
They must have been readying
a shipment back into Nassau.

455
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:15,644
So, between that and the
ordinance we just scavenged,

456
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:18,686
we may be better supplied than the
British in Nassau at this moment.

457
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:22,486
That said,

458
00:38:22,622 --> 00:38:25,410
the strangest thing just happened
out by the slave quarters.

459
00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:27,204
The doors were locked...

460
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,760
from the inside.

461
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:34,657
How did you know that?

462
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,084
What?

463
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:45,241
What did she tell you?

464
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:50,479
When I acquired those weapons
we used to fight the British,

465
00:38:50,558 --> 00:38:54,058
it apparently aroused suspicion
amongst the estate owners,

466
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:57,059
concerned that the alliance
between your people and mine

467
00:38:57,102 --> 00:39:01,310
might prove dangerous to maintaining
control over their holdings,

468
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:03,643
so they took precautions...

469
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:07,747
against any move that
might incite revolt.

470
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:11,120
Any man who had a woman,

471
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:15,519
any woman who had a child was separated.

472
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,655
With families distributed amongst
the other plantations on the island,

473
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:23,185
if any one community revolted...

474
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:26,710
or by inaction allowed
an estate to be toppled,

475
00:39:26,843 --> 00:39:29,468
their husbands and wives...

476
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:32,109
and children who are held
on the other plantations

477
00:39:32,134 --> 00:39:36,014
would be punished most severely.

478
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:39,635
If we complete this conquest,

479
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,368
if we force a situation

480
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:44,426
which might see these people's
husbands and wives and children

481
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,426
brutalized this way,

482
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:50,299
many of them would die by their own
hand before they let that happen.

483
00:39:50,883 --> 00:39:53,098
We'll move quickly, take the
other plantations as well.

484
00:39:53,123 --> 00:39:55,123
To seven different estates?

485
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,635
Wait a minute.

486
00:39:58,718 --> 00:40:01,718
- We have no choice.
- You want to withdraw?

487
00:40:01,843 --> 00:40:04,177
If we don't, knowing full well the cost,

488
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,054
it will be the end of
whatever trust exists

489
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,177
between us and the slaves on the island,

490
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,927
or anywhere, for that matter.

491
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:12,299
The end of any alliance
that might be between us.

492
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,027
How is leaving them here any better?

493
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:15,885
The only way to free them safely

494
00:40:15,968 --> 00:40:17,301
is if it is all at once.

495
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:19,885
Simultaneous revolts across the island

496
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,760
initiated by one very loud

497
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:24,300
and very clear signal
that will be heard by all.

498
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:26,570
- If we take Nassau first...
- Take it first?

499
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:28,635
... it would demonstrate
to the slave communities

500
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,052
the viability of our enterprise.

501
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:33,927
Show them that beyond
revolt lies a safe harbor

502
00:40:34,052 --> 00:40:35,885
with allies strong
enough to protect them.

503
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:39,718
It is the only way to ensure that
the greatest number of them survive.

504
00:40:41,135 --> 00:40:43,919
I lost six men tonight.

505
00:40:45,135 --> 00:40:47,177
The men I have left know this estate

506
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,052
means supplies and full stomachs.

507
00:40:49,077 --> 00:40:51,202
They know they are stronger with it.

508
00:40:51,227 --> 00:40:55,260
And, thus, fewer of them will die in
the weeks ahead than would without it.

509
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,927
- And you want to walk away.
- We didn't come here to take an estate.

510
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:01,301
We came here to make a statement,

511
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:04,736
not just to expel England,
but to defeat them.

512
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:06,928
And to do it together. That
has always been the goal.

513
00:41:06,953 --> 00:41:11,237
And right now, that requires a
painful but necessary tactical retreat.

514
00:41:13,144 --> 00:41:15,103
I'm asking you...

515
00:41:15,996 --> 00:41:17,788
please...

516
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,015
don't do this.

517
00:41:27,343 --> 00:41:29,299
Militia's approaching.

518
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,489
The neighboring estates must've
heard the guns and rallied.

519
00:41:35,186 --> 00:41:37,520
This was never gonna be easy.

520
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,035
It just is what it is.

521
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,710
There's been a change in circumstances.

522
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:56,203
We need to be gone before
that militia arrives.

523
00:41:56,228 --> 00:41:58,162
Gather all the weapons you can.

524
00:41:58,245 --> 00:42:00,995
- We're gonna be moving back towards...
- We're not going anywhere.

525
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:05,410
Henry, Davis, restrain the captain.

526
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:09,369
What are you doing?

527
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:13,535
I'm through following you down
a path only you seem able to see.

528
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:17,109
Towards a victory only
you seem able to define.

529
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,161
We will hold our position here

530
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:20,567
until we can find our way into Nassau

531
00:42:20,592 --> 00:42:22,535
and free the rest of the men.

532
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,660
And we will do it without you.

533
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:26,123
Do it.

534
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:30,048
The rest of you form a firing
line to repel that militia.

535
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:48,376
Are you sure you want to keep
following him down that path?

536
00:42:54,785 --> 00:42:56,730
Stand your men down...

537
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,744
and follow me away from here,

538
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,535
for any man who offers
resistance to that militia

539
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:04,301
will be held responsible for...

540
00:43:04,326 --> 00:43:05,408
Fire!

541
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,750
Plantation men!

542
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:52,910
- It's over now!
- We're under attack!

543
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,438
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Fall back!

544
00:43:58,952 --> 00:44:01,369
Fall back to the corn field!

545
00:44:23,086 --> 00:44:24,919
It's been confirmed.

546
00:44:24,944 --> 00:44:26,678
The governor was spotted
boarding the brig.

547
00:44:26,703 --> 00:44:28,702
They're hauling back
their anchor as we speak.

548
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:39,994
He'll be gone within the hour,

549
00:44:40,185 --> 00:44:43,660
off in search of aid, no doubt,
to secure his possession of Nassau,

550
00:44:43,785 --> 00:44:45,408
win the war for England.

551
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,408
And with him will depart
a number of soldiers,

552
00:44:48,409 --> 00:44:49,744
diminishing the number of bodies

553
00:44:49,827 --> 00:44:51,952
between us and Eleanor Guthrie.

554
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:56,749
That many fewer obstacles between
us and justice for Charles' murder.

555
00:44:56,774 --> 00:45:00,161
If you still wish Anne to lead
the vanguard to do it, tell me now.

556
00:45:00,186 --> 00:45:01,811
I'll have it done.

557
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:09,624
Would you like to know what I think?

558
00:45:12,201 --> 00:45:14,248
I think Anne is right.

559
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:17,535
She said something to me earlier.

560
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:20,293
She said only a fool would give his life

561
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:22,783
to earn the admiration of a corpse.

562
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:30,744
I wanted to strangle her.

563
00:45:31,156 --> 00:45:34,410
But part of me could not
help but note in that moment

564
00:45:34,535 --> 00:45:37,827
she sounded an awful lot
like someone else I once knew,

565
00:45:38,052 --> 00:45:41,136
someone you and I both once knew

566
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:43,181
who shared...

567
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:46,827
Anne's mistrust of sentimentality.

568
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:01,244
And just after he joined my crew...

569
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:07,827
I spent two weeks careening on
this shit island with no name.

570
00:46:09,727 --> 00:46:12,409
I knew right away he was
different than the others.

571
00:46:14,197 --> 00:46:17,066
He was so like me when
I was a younger man.

572
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:20,286
And that he and I

573
00:46:20,409 --> 00:46:23,369
somehow were fated to
matter to one another.

574
00:46:26,777 --> 00:46:29,827
I was consumed with the question
of whether our similarities

575
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:31,410
would be a blessing or a curse.

576
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:39,520
So, whilst the others were careening,

577
00:46:39,794 --> 00:46:42,564
a number of us were inland

578
00:46:43,162 --> 00:46:45,454
by a spring.

579
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:50,516
The sun climbs up over
the top of the trees...

580
00:46:51,021 --> 00:46:54,894
in just a way that it
shines off the pool...

581
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:58,370
lighting up all around us.

582
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:03,118
In that moment,

583
00:47:03,895 --> 00:47:06,197
a bird lands on the water...

584
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:10,139
massive, snow-white beast,

585
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,454
big as a boar.

586
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,894
To this day, I've never
seen anything like it.

587
00:47:18,145 --> 00:47:20,569
Between the sun and the size of it,

588
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,246
it just felt...

589
00:47:25,607 --> 00:47:27,190
meaningful.

590
00:47:29,772 --> 00:47:33,151
The answer to a question I
did not yet know how to ask.

591
00:47:34,772 --> 00:47:36,429
I told him...

592
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,479
that there were men in the east...

593
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:44,732
who would have seen in that
bird the darkest of all omens,

594
00:47:44,772 --> 00:47:46,693
bringer of death.

595
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,106
But then,

596
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:51,954
there are other men near Clifton...

597
00:47:51,979 --> 00:47:54,334
my... my mother's home...

598
00:47:55,607 --> 00:47:59,482
who would've called it
a sign of great fortune,

599
00:47:59,898 --> 00:48:01,771
an indication from the heavens

600
00:48:01,772 --> 00:48:05,368
that someone up there
favored our endeavor together.

601
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:17,487
And I asked him what
he thought it meant.

602
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,101
"Dinner."

603
00:48:34,153 --> 00:48:37,382
I don't know what made
me think of that story.

604
00:48:43,772 --> 00:48:47,773
There are moments in the dead
of night when I can't sleep,

605
00:48:48,063 --> 00:48:52,023
and I wonder if I will ever
be able to truly rest again

606
00:48:52,148 --> 00:48:56,034
until I know that Eleanor Guthrie
has paid for what she took from me.

607
00:48:57,315 --> 00:48:58,732
And then there are other moments

608
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:03,190
when I wonder if it would actually
please him to see her dead,

609
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,940
to know the scales had been evened.

610
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:08,773
Or if despite all they had been through,

611
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,773
despite the anger and
the blood and the betrayal

612
00:49:11,898 --> 00:49:14,732
and all he'd done to her and she to him,

613
00:49:14,772 --> 00:49:17,771
despite what I or you or what
anybody else might think of it,

614
00:49:17,772 --> 00:49:19,524
if wherever he was,

615
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:22,524
he still didn't just
a little bit love her.

616
00:49:24,607 --> 00:49:26,524
I wonder if he were here now,

617
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:30,714
watching us battle with the
choice to kill her in his name

618
00:49:30,815 --> 00:49:32,898
or defeat the governor

619
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:35,898
and perhaps therein win the
war we all together started,

620
00:49:35,982 --> 00:49:39,913
if he might call us fools.

621
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:43,772
And then I wonder if maybe we
don't have to work that hard

622
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:45,820
to imagine what he'd say.

623
00:49:47,772 --> 00:49:50,074
Maybe we've already heard it,

624
00:49:50,772 --> 00:49:54,995
and the only choice is
whether we choose to listen.

625
00:50:04,772 --> 00:50:06,982
Cannon fire from the port!

626
00:50:18,379 --> 00:50:19,961
He's underway, Captain.

627
00:50:20,124 --> 00:50:21,962
Using the fort guns for cover.

628
00:50:22,402 --> 00:50:24,296
Do we pursue?

629
00:50:33,184 --> 00:50:34,755
Slip the cables.

630
00:50:36,337 --> 00:50:38,412
Set a course to overtake her.

631
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:40,205
Slip the cable!

632
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:42,023
Set course to pursue!

633
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:23,794
Ma'am?

634
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:54,914
Long John Silver.

635
00:52:55,441 --> 00:52:58,821
So big a name for so small a man.

636
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,503
What is it you have to say to me?

637
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:05,702
You owe me.

638
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:08,146
Certainly your fortune.

639
00:53:08,171 --> 00:53:10,348
Probably your life.

640
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:14,388
You might wanna consider that
and then choose a new tone,

641
00:53:14,796 --> 00:53:17,838
especially given that
in the very near future

642
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,788
your life might end up
in my hands yet again.

643
00:53:21,961 --> 00:53:23,685
Is that so?

644
00:53:26,678 --> 00:53:28,720
Is Teach still free?

645
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,585
Is Rackham?

646
00:53:34,055 --> 00:53:35,807
Is Flint?

647
00:53:41,813 --> 00:53:44,838
This war may feel over,

648
00:53:45,186 --> 00:53:48,373
but as long as we're all
free, it's far from it.

649
00:53:48,787 --> 00:53:51,713
And if somehow we prevail in Nassau,

650
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:53,588
what happens to former friends

651
00:53:53,713 --> 00:53:56,961
who've since aligned themselves
so warmly with the governor?

652
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:01,960
I've come to offer you a chance

653
00:54:01,961 --> 00:54:04,087
to earn back our friendship.

654
00:54:04,405 --> 00:54:07,546
Or, more specifically, to buy it back.

655
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,138
An amount of money that
proves your desire to come...

656
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,404
No.

657
00:54:13,711 --> 00:54:15,588
No?

658
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:18,813
I am tired of this.

659
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,688
This thing that perpetuates itself

660
00:54:21,713 --> 00:54:25,379
with anger and bluster and blood.

661
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:28,664
I do not want to be your friend.

662
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:32,153
What I want is for all of this to end.

663
00:54:32,472 --> 00:54:36,224
For it to end, you must end.

664
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,486
I imagine I have some obligation

665
00:54:44,511 --> 00:54:46,582
to surrender you to Captain Berringer,

666
00:54:46,607 --> 00:54:49,669
but the spectacle he would
make of your trial and execution

667
00:54:49,694 --> 00:54:53,900
would only fan the flames of
what is burning in Nassau now.

668
00:54:54,348 --> 00:54:57,439
I am tempted to put the sword
to you and your man both,

669
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:59,889
and bury this story for good,

670
00:55:00,014 --> 00:55:01,471
but what am I...

671
00:55:01,514 --> 00:55:05,223
if I spend my days pleading
for a return to civility

672
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:08,442
and then do dark things
under the cover of night?

673
00:55:08,784 --> 00:55:10,659
So, you will remain in my custody

674
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:14,139
until I can find a place
far from here to deposit you.

675
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:16,447
You will be gone,

676
00:55:16,472 --> 00:55:18,471
but you will live.

677
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:22,598
And for that, I will consider
whatever debts I may owe you

678
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:24,576
to be paid in full.
