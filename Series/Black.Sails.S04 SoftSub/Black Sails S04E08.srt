1
00:00:12,116 --> 00:00:15,449
Lend us your help and we
will do whatever must be done

2
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,310
to move Nassau forward.

3
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:19,998
She agreed. Madam Guthrie.

4
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:22,741
Everything we want for Nassau.

5
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:26,951
But Flint... she wants him
dead, and she wants me to do it.

6
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:29,982
They all turned on me, and I
want them all to pay for it.

7
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:31,256
I tried once,

8
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,592
but I didn't possess the
instrument to make it work. You do.

9
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,121
Nothing justifies trading
her life for your war.

10
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:39,307
No one is saying that we let her die.

11
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:42,138
- You cannot guarantee that...
- We will sail to Nassau.

12
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:44,635
And we will find her and
we will bring her home.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,065
You're confident in his plan
maybe because it's a good plan.

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,506
But maybe you'll have to show him
that you're prepared for the failure

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,717
and that a treasure he
wanted left in the ground...

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,090
ain't in the ground no more.

18
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:50,380
Seemed only fair that I remind you...

19
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:52,339
that our fates are now linked.

20
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:55,708
If this plan to secure the
cache ends badly for me,

21
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:59,025
you can be certain it
will end badly for you.

22
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:11,631
It was where I said it would be, was it?

23
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,080
That's how close Mr. Gates was to Flint.

24
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:31,580
Stored his most prized
possessions in his cellar.

25
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:33,992
Avery's journals.

26
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:37,663
Despite that measure of trust,

27
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:40,401
all it took was a disagreement
over a little money

28
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:42,260
for Flint to kill him.

29
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:47,297
There are no two people close enough

30
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:49,738
that something cannot separate them.

31
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,600
Some point at which they were
never fully connected to begin with.

32
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:05,966
It happened with Gates and Flint.

33
00:06:08,622 --> 00:06:11,151
It will happen with Flint and Silver.

34
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:27,280
This plan will work.

35
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:31,079
You want the exchange of the
money to happen off this island,

36
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,452
somewhere no one need know of it.

37
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:36,291
There it is.

38
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,404
You'll lead them there...

39
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:43,521
and they will follow you.

40
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,957
Kofi and his men are
on their way to Nassau.

41
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:30,371
What happens after this?

42
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,065
They'll use resistance routes

43
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,023
to evade detection by
the governor's soldiers.

44
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:38,464
They're probably already
nearing town by now.

45
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:40,206
They'll find friends there,

46
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:42,534
discover through them
where Madi is being held,

47
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:45,413
and be back to the beach
for us to recover by morning.

48
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:47,204
Once we know where she is,

49
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,039
we'll move to get her out of there.

50
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,705
What happens after all of it?

51
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:57,055
Assume your plan succeeds,

52
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,580
and we retrieve her alive.

53
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:02,171
Assume your war begins...

54
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,248
spreads throughout the New World.

55
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,741
I saw what came of Nassau
when it was touched by it.

56
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:14,080
In the first instant,

57
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:18,705
it was deprived of
Eleanor Guthrie's commerce

58
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:21,079
or Jack Rackham's prosperity

59
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,320
or Woodes Rogers' oppression.

60
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:27,755
There's nothing in Nassau but horror.

61
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:33,099
You said it was just a transition.

62
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:36,663
That something better lay beyond it,

63
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:39,039
something meaningful.

64
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:43,605
But what if that isn't so?

65
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,405
What if the result of this
war isn't beyond the horror?

66
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:54,905
What if it is the horror itself?

67
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,080
Have you given this any thought at all?

68
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:29,079
If we are to truly reach a moment

69
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,834
where we might be
finished with England...

70
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,499
cleared away to make
room for something else...

71
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:45,508
there most certainly lies a dark
moment between here and there.

72
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,687
A moment of terror...

73
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,643
where everything appears
to be without hope.

74
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:55,126
I know this.

75
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:02,600
But I cannot believe
that that is all there is.

76
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:10,180
I cannot believe we are
so poorly made as that.

77
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,784
Incapable of surviving in the
state to which we are born.

78
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:23,456
Grown so used to the yoke that
there can be no progress without it.

79
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,391
It's a lot to ask...

80
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:36,344
to wager so much
suffering on blind faith.

81
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:41,282
Well, it isn't entirely faith.

82
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,373
We'll have the right people
in place to lead us through it

83
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:48,943
and hold the world together
while it finds its balance.

84
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,997
You think so much of what you
and I can accomplish together.

85
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,622
You and her.

86
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,538
You and Madi.

87
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:06,111
She's as wise as her father.

88
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:09,939
She's as strong as her mother.

89
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:12,455
There isn't a man or woman in Nassau

90
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,330
who'd argue that she
isn't the best of them all.

91
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:21,908
The cache is critical to
our war, but so is she.

92
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:25,647
Critical to holding
our alliance together.

93
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:31,487
We absolutely must get her back alive.

94
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:35,236
And you think I'm the one best suited

95
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,695
to lead our people through this?

96
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:41,796
I think that you are the best of us.

97
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,758
The two of you together
are the world in balance.

98
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:54,829
For all the damage Billy's
done, at least he got that right.

99
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:13,351
Better.

100
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:18,072
Sorry I was not here
to do this yesterday.

101
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:21,695
The meetings with Madam Guthrie
and her man grow longer every day.

102
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:25,987
I believe I am gaining her trust.

103
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,278
I believe I have persuaded
them our proposal is sound,

104
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,987
and still the questions continue.

105
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:33,862
But I feel as though
something is coming,

106
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:36,695
a moment in which this
will cease to be our idea

107
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,567
and become her own.

108
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:44,259
If I am able to reach that moment

109
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:46,487
and emerge from it a
true partner to her,

110
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,695
if Jack is able to fulfill
his end of the bargain,

111
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:53,119
I am beginning to see a
future for us in which...

112
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:58,574
Why are you doing this?

113
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:03,855
Talking about us like it's a thing?

114
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:07,403
A future?

115
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:11,633
I don't know who broke it first.

116
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:15,237
But it broke.

117
00:13:17,307 --> 00:13:20,218
And there ain't no putting
it back together again.

118
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,233
Are you all right?

119
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:48,779
Wait.

120
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,854
Is there something you need?

121
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,511
Yeah.

122
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,058
There is.

123
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:13,404
They waited an hour before disbanding.

124
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:18,236
Evidently, that is the lifespan
of "the governor is on his way"

125
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:20,237
as a viable measure of delay.

126
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,955
The solution to our
problems is not going to come

127
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,894
from a council meeting.

128
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:29,620
They are losing faith in you.

129
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,236
They see the problems we face
in rebuilding this colony,

130
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:37,407
the dangers if we fail.

131
00:14:37,653 --> 00:14:39,737
And they are growing more
and more skeptical by the day

132
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,313
that you have anything
in the way of a solution.

133
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:46,112
My fear is it's worse than that.

134
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:52,770
My fear is they will learn
what your solution actually is.

135
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:58,930
I know you intend to
ransom away that slave woman

136
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:00,903
to Captain Flint and his maroon allies

137
00:15:00,904 --> 00:15:04,270
in exchange for the
pirates' cache of gems.

138
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:07,236
As brazenly as you pursued this bargain,

139
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:10,195
did you really believe that
no one would find out about it,

140
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:12,146
that I wouldn't find out?

141
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:19,889
My wife made the bargain
for the cache, Mr. Soames.

142
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,848
All I'm going to do is collect.

143
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:24,848
The pirates are gone, sir.

144
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:26,495
The threat that they
presented us is done!

145
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,778
The threat the pirates
present has never been greater.

146
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,028
Their intent is to cause
terror and destruction

147
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,402
until civilization
simply ceases to function.

148
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:36,400
- The threat will not...
- The defense of civilization...

149
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:38,627
is not your responsibility, sir!

150
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:44,716
Your duty is to restore
stable profits to Nassau.

151
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:47,111
And the men charged to
follow you to that end

152
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,857
are already questioning
their trust in you.

153
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,236
If they see pirates return here,

154
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:55,168
if they see skirmishes
begin again on this island

155
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:58,068
and they know that it was
because you invited it...

156
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:02,573
then you are going to have
a mutiny on your hands, sir.

157
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:17,334
"I fear for my husband's safety...

158
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,360
"from men I've long called enemies,

159
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:22,778
"from men I once called friends.

160
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:25,701
"I will move heaven and
earth to protect him,

161
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:27,053
"but while playing this role,

162
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,857
"the limits of my
influence are ever-present."

163
00:17:34,862 --> 00:17:39,136
I was just packing everything
away as you asked, my Lord.

164
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:41,175
Ready my things.

165
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:44,300
I sail at first light.

166
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,007
She must've slipped in
behind us during the night.

167
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,944
She's already at anchor.

168
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:14,983
Looks like she's been waiting for us.

169
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:18,054
It looks like she knew
where to wait for us.

170
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,680
Jesus Christ!

171
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:21,461
On their rail!

172
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:31,111
He caught them.

173
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:33,354
How's that possible? Overnight?

174
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:05,314
All up on deck!

175
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:34,819
Back the fore-topsails. Bring us about.

176
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,655
- Back the fore-topsails!
- Gun crews at the ready!

177
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,062
Bring us about!

178
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:39,363
What are you doing?

179
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:42,195
We bring our guns to bear, he'll
think twice about killing her.

180
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:43,736
Belay that order!

181
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:45,437
Belay that order!

182
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,764
Go get it. Bring it up here right now.

183
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:55,427
Go get what?

184
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:03,736
What did you bring with us?

185
00:20:04,322 --> 00:20:07,052
Your plan failed. We're
moving onto my plan.

186
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:09,736
Do not repeat your order.

187
00:20:09,737 --> 00:20:10,944
Do not think about it.

188
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,420
Bring it up here.

189
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,867
Get it where they can see it.

190
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:51,211
Signal him.

191
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,366
Go!

192
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:57,402
Signal the Eurydice.

193
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:58,944
Do it now!

194
00:20:58,945 --> 00:21:00,694
Strike the bell!

195
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:13,471
Open it.

196
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:58,360
He's hauling up the anchor.
Where the fuck is he going?

197
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:01,104
Wherever he's going, we follow him.

198
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:23,157
This should be good.

199
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,903
What is it I can do
for our lord governor?

200
00:22:29,904 --> 00:22:32,354
I don't come on behalf
of the governor, ma'am.

201
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,962
You are Governor Rogers'
woman, are you not?

202
00:22:36,987 --> 00:22:38,096
I am...

203
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:41,461
which is why I believe you and
I may be able to help each other.

204
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:48,986
Really, ma'am, someplace
private may be more appropriate.

205
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:53,878
Privacy always comes with a price, dear.

206
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:57,662
Let's see what it is you
have to say first, shall we?

207
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,437
I'm sure you would, yeah.

208
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:11,454
The governor moves in a dark
and destructive direction.

209
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:15,118
His grief and his anger...

210
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:20,111
I believe, have unmoored
him from sound judgment

211
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:23,527
and have left us all in grave
danger if he is not reined in.

212
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:25,728
You've noticed this, have you?

213
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:32,106
You were excluded from the council.

214
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:36,603
On the outside of its goings-on.

215
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:40,043
I don't know what information
you were privy to...

216
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:42,187
I appreciate your concern.

217
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:44,652
Come back when you like.

218
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:47,437
I may be able to help
you get back inside.

219
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:52,349
Back on the council?

220
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,478
Go on.

221
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,104
I found a journal Eleanor kept.

222
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:13,285
In it, she mentioned...

223
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,581
that when Nassau last threatened
to descend into chaos...

224
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:22,437
you were the one to whom she
turned to help prevent it.

225
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:27,248
The men surrounding the governor now

226
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:30,733
have all failed to challenge
him in any meaningful way.

227
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:34,277
I am hoping that if I could provide you

228
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:37,474
with information from
inside his office...

229
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,224
it might help you maneuver
your way back onto the council.

230
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:46,437
That sounds an awful
lot like treason to me.

231
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:52,236
And what exactly, aside
from good government,

232
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:55,145
do you hope to gain from this, hmm?

233
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:05,354
Eleanor promised me passage to London.

234
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,212
A release from my service,

235
00:25:09,237 --> 00:25:11,437
that I might return home.

236
00:25:14,237 --> 00:25:15,873
If I help you...

237
00:25:17,237 --> 00:25:19,232
will you help me?

238
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:39,736
When you asked me if
I could help you learn

239
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:41,511
where the governor's ship went...

240
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:45,360
to what place he drew Captain Flint,

241
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:48,354
I thought it unlikely
I could be of much help.

242
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:55,437
But you will never believe what
just walked through my door.

243
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:07,358
- Is that not it?
- What?

244
00:26:07,612 --> 00:26:09,444
We don't seem to be
preparing for a landing.

245
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:11,562
Is that not our destination ahead?

246
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,897
No, it isn't.

247
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:16,499
It's a way-point.

248
00:26:16,904 --> 00:26:19,236
Two features on that
island are the markers.

249
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:23,236
Maybe two peaks or some
points along the coast.

250
00:26:23,237 --> 00:26:25,444
You run a line through them,
and that direction becomes

251
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:28,507
the course the governor will set
to reach our final destination.

252
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:33,446
How do you know that?

253
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:38,237
I don't understand.

254
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:40,111
If the governor knows our destination,

255
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:43,903
why can't he just plot a course
directly to a spot on the chart?

256
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:47,236
Because Skeleton Island
is not on any chart,

257
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:51,187
not on any civilized one, at any rate.

258
00:26:51,913 --> 00:26:53,420
Remote.

259
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:56,986
Well outside any
established trade route.

260
00:26:56,987 --> 00:26:58,998
It's been used from time to time

261
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:01,450
for transactions neither party...

262
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:03,848
wished would ever be acknowledged.

263
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,236
Of course I love her.

264
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:12,941
I let you try it your way!

265
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,754
I did trust you.

266
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:17,360
But I'm through wagering
with her life now.

267
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:20,277
If what it takes to secure her
release is to turn over the cache,

268
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:22,526
I'm very glad I brought it with us.

269
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:25,550
We had it.

270
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,277
We had it in our hands.

271
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,647
This war was breathing
air, it was alive.

272
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:33,527
Now Julius is back in that camp,

273
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,195
pointing to a hole in the ground,

274
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,360
telling anyone who will listen,

275
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:39,360
"This is what it looks like
when you trust a pirate."

276
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,444
Yesterday, he had nothing.

277
00:27:41,445 --> 00:27:43,746
He was shouting at the rain.

278
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:46,825
Now you've given him all he
needs to kill this war dead.

279
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,308
My God.

280
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:52,527
The number of times I
have followed you blindly,

281
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:54,027
backed you with the men blindly,

282
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:56,360
put men in the fucking ground...

283
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:58,582
good men, friends... because you said,

284
00:27:58,607 --> 00:27:59,986
"I know the way.

285
00:27:59,987 --> 00:28:01,444
"Don't ask me how.

286
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:03,019
"Just do as I say."

287
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:05,759
I may not have understood it,
I may not have supported it,

288
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,253
but I did it!

289
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:10,652
And God damn it, right now
you're going to return the favor!

290
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,652
We will find a way to
put it all back together

291
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,453
with whatever we have
left at our disposal.

292
00:28:18,237 --> 00:28:22,404
But do not ask me to choose
between a war and a wife.

293
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:25,437
I do not think you're
going to like the answer.

294
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:32,069
Whatever must be done
to secure Madi's release,

295
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,853
I'm going to do it.

296
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:37,778
I do not expect your understanding,

297
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:40,270
but I demand your support.

298
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:43,147
As my partner,

299
00:28:43,987 --> 00:28:45,770
as my friend.

300
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,069
Do I have it?

301
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:57,853
Do I have it?

302
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:08,103
Yes.

303
00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:47,715
I got what you asked.

304
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:56,848
These are the ships either in
port or soon expected to be...

305
00:30:57,111 --> 00:30:59,602
and willing to accept passengers.

306
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:08,437
You really intend to leave...

307
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:11,999
whether Jack returns alive or not?

308
00:31:13,237 --> 00:31:15,180
Jack will return.

309
00:31:16,445 --> 00:31:19,040
Jack went to hunt Captain Flint.

310
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:22,016
Chances are good you've
seen the last of him.

311
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:36,437
You killed a friend of mine.

312
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:40,660
Her name was Charlotte...

313
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:44,937
and you did it for reasons
that had nothing to do with her.

314
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:51,210
There were men I knew that
would've killed you for me.

315
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,312
I wanted to ask them.

316
00:31:56,237 --> 00:31:57,853
Had the money.

317
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:02,020
But Max refused.

318
00:32:04,403 --> 00:32:06,774
I couldn't tell then if it was...

319
00:32:06,947 --> 00:32:09,110
because she was afraid of you.

320
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,782
Wouldn't have blamed her. I was.

321
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,783
Or if it was something else.

322
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:22,236
But I respected her wishes.

323
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,111
Obeyed when she said we'd protect
you despite what you'd done.

324
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,770
Do you know why?

325
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,293
Because despite the world
reminding her every day of her life

326
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,623
that she's undeserving of
being given anything by it,

327
00:32:37,237 --> 00:32:40,998
that she was unworthy of what little
she'd managed to take from it...

328
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:43,842
despite all of that,

329
00:32:44,403 --> 00:32:46,645
she never believed a word of it.

330
00:32:49,112 --> 00:32:51,067
That woman has been fighting
the whole goddamn world

331
00:32:51,092 --> 00:32:52,895
since the day she was born.

332
00:32:54,945 --> 00:32:57,312
She's a breath away
from winning that fight.

333
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,558
For whatever reason,

334
00:33:03,205 --> 00:33:05,780
she wants to share the spoils with you.

335
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,437
And you'd walk away.

336
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:16,530
You killed my friend.

337
00:33:17,987 --> 00:33:19,817
I wanted you to know that.

338
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:15,824
We are not going to Mr. Grace's library.

339
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:24,652
I understood there was someone
you wanted me to meet there today.

340
00:34:24,653 --> 00:34:26,770
Has something changed?

341
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:46,569
Walk with me.

342
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:03,069
Those are the pirates.

343
00:35:03,345 --> 00:35:05,040
They've inhabited the east bank,

344
00:35:05,065 --> 00:35:08,025
across from Springett Island for years.

345
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:11,486
The governor promises this is
the year he'll chase them off,

346
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:13,645
but there they are.

347
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:19,848
Seven major shipping
concerns in the city here.

348
00:35:20,645 --> 00:35:23,652
In less than 10 years, more
goods will move through here

349
00:35:23,653 --> 00:35:27,403
than any English-speaking
port outside London.

350
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,226
There will be civilization here.

351
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:33,478
Where will the pirates be?

352
00:35:35,487 --> 00:35:39,268
On the east bank, across
from Springett Island.

353
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:41,104
Why?

354
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:43,444
Because the shipping concern

355
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:47,200
charges a premium for the
risk the pirates present.

356
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,652
I assume the governor,
too, profits from this.

357
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:54,224
There is theft, but everyone benefits.

358
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:57,195
Why would anyone want to end it?

359
00:36:00,904 --> 00:36:03,728
How well did you know my granddaughter?

360
00:36:06,737 --> 00:36:08,543
I knew her well.

361
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:10,765
Was she happy?

362
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:13,613
Happy?

363
00:36:13,816 --> 00:36:16,236
There are things I know about Nassau,

364
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:17,878
about her.

365
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:21,700
There are things that are
harder to know across an ocean.

366
00:36:23,237 --> 00:36:25,687
I honestly do not know.

367
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:30,944
Her grandfather disowned
her some time ago,

368
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:35,255
assumed she'd simply become
one with the wild men.

369
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:37,759
When the trial began

370
00:36:37,784 --> 00:36:42,158
and Guthrie became a contemptible
name to utter in London,

371
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:44,323
didn't help matters.

372
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:48,889
But I held out hope from the beginning.

373
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:53,686
A fantasy that despite
what we'd heard of her,

374
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,843
she was learning, growing.

375
00:36:58,237 --> 00:37:01,239
And that someday,
she'd seek me out and...

376
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,216
a woman who reminded me of myself

377
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:07,809
when I was younger would
arrive in Boston and...

378
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:11,207
I'd walk the Charles with her and...

379
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:15,387
teach her the things a
woman can do in this world.

380
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:20,797
It's the wrong river
and the wrong woman,

381
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:25,656
but perhaps to get even this
close to a fantasy is something.

382
00:37:26,904 --> 00:37:31,422
So, let us assume that we're
past conversations about ledgers

383
00:37:31,653 --> 00:37:35,569
and that the measuring of
you and your proposal are done

384
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:39,611
and that we are partners in a venture...

385
00:37:39,612 --> 00:37:43,437
to acquire and reform Nassau.

386
00:37:45,237 --> 00:37:48,566
So, now all that's left to
know about this venture...

387
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,265
is who is going to lead it.

388
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,150
Edward Houghton.

389
00:38:03,278 --> 00:38:07,283
The only male heir to his
family's banking operation.

390
00:38:07,331 --> 00:38:10,080
Supremely uncurious,

391
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:13,212
bordering on dim, but
fundamentally decent.

392
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:17,736
The investments he's overseen
have shown modest gains at best

393
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:20,444
and losses more frequently.

394
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:23,979
This is not the man you would
like to put in charge of Nassau.

395
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:28,176
I'd like to put you in charge of Nassau.

396
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,005
But on this particular issue,

397
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:33,333
the world won't much
care for what I'd like.

398
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,934
And of the men available,
this one has merits.

399
00:38:37,237 --> 00:38:40,195
His family would be
relieved beyond measure

400
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:44,354
that he'd found himself a future
far away from their business.

401
00:38:45,237 --> 00:38:47,236
He'd come with money,

402
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:50,120
he'd open doors to new partners...

403
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:55,561
and he'd be most amenable to doing
whatever else you told him to do.

404
00:38:56,862 --> 00:39:00,195
You think he would listen
to me as an advisor?

405
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:12,136
You think he would
listen to me as a wife.

406
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:22,694
I suppose it needn't be him.

407
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,819
But to have the kind of
control you will need to have,

408
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,281
there will need to be
someone occupying the role,

409
00:39:29,312 --> 00:39:30,961
and that someone...

410
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:34,527
solves a number of problems all at once.

411
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:38,187
Money, limited ambition...

412
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:42,153
and reform-minded parents

413
00:39:42,154 --> 00:39:44,895
would find your story most intriguing.

414
00:39:49,861 --> 00:39:54,411
In terms of your obligations to him,

415
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:56,736
there are plenty of
ways for a man like that

416
00:39:56,737 --> 00:40:00,178
to retain satisfaction
in a place like Nassau

417
00:40:00,203 --> 00:40:03,654
with little or no
participation from you.

418
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,486
You'd likely retain as much freedom

419
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,396
in that regard as you desired.

420
00:40:11,237 --> 00:40:14,236
To rise from where you began...

421
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:15,879
to where you now stand,

422
00:40:15,904 --> 00:40:19,192
I cannot imagine the
road you've traveled.

423
00:40:20,237 --> 00:40:22,652
The humiliations...

424
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,957
and the sacrifices

425
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:27,187
and the defeats...

426
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:30,195
and the illusions maintained

427
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:33,528
at so great a cost
to your sense of self.

428
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,195
But that road has led you to me.

429
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,770
I am the gate through which your
journey becomes something else.

430
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,582
I can make the dreams
you have built real.

431
00:40:55,737 --> 00:40:59,145
The toll is small, but it must be paid.

432
00:41:00,452 --> 00:41:02,588
Tell me you're ready to pay it...

433
00:41:03,612 --> 00:41:05,903
and you and I will walk downstairs,

434
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:08,444
I will introduce you to him,

435
00:41:08,445 --> 00:41:09,719
and... as I imagine,

436
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:12,502
you'll have no difficulty
taking things from there.

437
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:18,853
Our partnership may move
forward fully formed.

438
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,229
Are you ready to do it?

439
00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:39,569
That is a very old man.

440
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,186
The governor's woman overheard his ship

441
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,444
was bound for Skeleton Island.

442
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:47,611
That man, I have it on good authority,

443
00:41:47,612 --> 00:41:51,277
is the last man on this
island once sailed with Avery.

444
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:54,085
Claims to have been to Skeleton Island

445
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,145
and can show us the way.

446
00:41:58,737 --> 00:42:00,624
And you believe he can do it?

447
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,127
Two possible outcomes
as far as I can tell.

448
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:05,819
One, he fails,

449
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,955
in which case we sail
around till we tire of it,

450
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,971
then go back to the camp.

451
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,760
Or two,

452
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:16,682
by some miracle, he actually
succeeds in getting us there.

453
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:22,258
And I can't tell which of
the two is of more concern.

454
00:42:22,528 --> 00:42:24,236
What does that mean?

455
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:27,736
Killing Flint was already going
to be a near impossible feat.

456
00:42:27,737 --> 00:42:31,187
Now we need to evade the
governor and his soldiers as well.

457
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:34,527
Wouldn't it make a whole lot more sense

458
00:42:34,528 --> 00:42:36,819
to just wait for the
governor to kill him for us?

459
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,736
If Woodes Rogers secures that cache,

460
00:42:38,737 --> 00:42:41,652
he secures his position here as well.

461
00:42:41,653 --> 00:42:44,541
Negates our plan to see him removed.

462
00:42:44,566 --> 00:42:45,783
- He wins.
- Yeah, but...

463
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:49,152
Everything we need is on that island.

464
00:42:49,548 --> 00:42:52,072
Flint, Rogers,

465
00:42:52,097 --> 00:42:54,074
and my cache of gems.

466
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:58,668
If that very old man over
there can get us there...

467
00:42:59,904 --> 00:43:02,104
why are we still standing here?

468
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:26,212
If you leave him alive long enough,

469
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:29,020
he's going to make you pay for it.

470
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,312
He won't move against me.

471
00:43:36,392 --> 00:43:38,218
This will pass.

472
00:43:39,361 --> 00:43:41,982
And that's the end of this conversation.

473
00:43:44,904 --> 00:43:46,849
So many lies...

474
00:43:47,237 --> 00:43:49,687
to deny a simple truth.

475
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,687
What?

476
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:56,030
The crown does not divide.

477
00:43:56,055 --> 00:43:57,778
It cannot be shared.

478
00:43:57,779 --> 00:43:59,986
You know it. You want it done.

479
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:02,645
You just don't know how to ask yet.

480
00:44:10,445 --> 00:44:12,638
Hear me very clearly.

481
00:44:13,732 --> 00:44:17,354
There is no hidden message
and no equivocation.

482
00:44:18,663 --> 00:44:21,236
You will make no move against him.

483
00:44:21,237 --> 00:44:23,153
You will not speak of doing so

484
00:44:23,154 --> 00:44:26,354
to any man on this crew nor to me again.

485
00:44:27,096 --> 00:44:30,963
Do it and you'll answer for it.

486
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,347
Fuck you doing out here?

487
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,360
It's a fucking mess
out here. Come inside.

488
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:07,778
Or don't.

489
00:45:08,987 --> 00:45:10,437
I don't care.

490
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,185
It happened.

491
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:19,850
She has committed to the plan, to me.

492
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,713
The moment we have been working
towards since we arrived...

493
00:45:25,511 --> 00:45:27,316
it happened.

494
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,318
That's good news.

495
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,420
So, why do you look like that?

496
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:40,236
I told her I could not agree to it.

497
00:45:40,992 --> 00:45:43,236
You told her no?

498
00:45:43,237 --> 00:45:47,717
She needs for there to be a man
in the governor's office, not Jack.

499
00:45:47,742 --> 00:45:52,195
A man of her choosing, and
she wants me to be his wife.

500
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:54,236
His wife?!

501
00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:58,346
In name only and for
appearance's sake, nothing more.

502
00:45:58,653 --> 00:46:01,197
The power would rest with us.

503
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:06,182
Just for appearance?

504
00:46:07,737 --> 00:46:09,533
And you said no?

505
00:46:11,237 --> 00:46:13,088
Why would you do that?

506
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:21,064
I remember when I first met Eleanor,

507
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:23,002
how stunned I was.

508
00:46:23,237 --> 00:46:25,869
A woman who spoke the way she did,

509
00:46:26,237 --> 00:46:29,527
who had no fear of the world
or the men who reigned over it.

510
00:46:29,528 --> 00:46:33,345
When I became her lover, I
watched the decisions she made...

511
00:46:34,237 --> 00:46:36,666
and resolved to learn from them.

512
00:46:37,445 --> 00:46:40,236
When I became her rival, I
watched the mistakes she made

513
00:46:40,237 --> 00:46:42,861
and resolved never to repeat them.

514
00:46:43,026 --> 00:46:44,732
But at the end,

515
00:46:44,757 --> 00:46:48,401
when I felt I had
surpassed her in every way,

516
00:46:48,737 --> 00:46:50,706
it seemed as though there was something

517
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:53,461
she was still trying to say to me.

518
00:46:55,945 --> 00:47:00,819
Surrendering everything she
had sacrificed so dearly for,

519
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,657
because it would have come at
the expense of the one she loved.

520
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:09,451
She was trying to tell me,
I just could not hear her,

521
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:11,782
about what is truly important.

522
00:47:13,401 --> 00:47:16,393
I said no to Marion Guthrie's plan...

523
00:47:17,612 --> 00:47:19,611
despite having no alternative

524
00:47:19,612 --> 00:47:23,400
and at the risk of
losing the entire endeavor

525
00:47:24,072 --> 00:47:27,529
because I refuse to
situate a man in a position

526
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,944
where he might interfere one day

527
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:33,437
with my ability to
repair things with you.

528
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:46,520
You are the bravest
person I have ever known.

529
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:52,437
The truest person I have ever known.

530
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,280
And I betrayed you and it sickens me.

531
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:11,020
I am so sorry for working so
hard to protect the wrong things.

532
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:15,391
For failing to see that
there is nothing important

533
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:17,735
that does not include you.

534
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,236
The story, as it was recounted to me,

535
00:49:23,237 --> 00:49:27,681
is that Avery was the first
Englishman to find the island.

536
00:49:30,653 --> 00:49:32,486
The Spanish had been using it to conduct

537
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,056
illicit transactions for decades.

538
00:49:35,862 --> 00:49:38,212
Avery plans to lie in wait for them.

539
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:42,319
He and his crew of 44 arrive...

540
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,236
and sail inland.

541
00:49:52,237 --> 00:49:54,111
But as they move up the inlet,

542
00:49:54,112 --> 00:49:57,382
they see something most unexpected.

543
00:50:04,728 --> 00:50:06,845
She was Spanish,

544
00:50:07,135 --> 00:50:09,939
but not one of the ships
they'd been hunting.

545
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,595
This ship had been there
far longer than that.

546
00:50:15,695 --> 00:50:18,611
Captain's log identifies
her having set sail

547
00:50:18,612 --> 00:50:21,977
from Havana in 1636.

548
00:50:22,237 --> 00:50:24,782
31 souls aboard.

549
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:28,599
Avery finds the remains of all 31.

550
00:50:29,645 --> 00:50:31,102
Slaughtered.

551
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,836
Brutally so.

552
00:50:33,779 --> 00:50:35,277
Evidence that a number of them

553
00:50:35,278 --> 00:50:38,728
had been dismembered while still alive.

554
00:50:39,779 --> 00:50:41,778
There were natives on the island?

555
00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:45,836
All 31 bodies were
found still on the ship,

556
00:50:46,237 --> 00:50:48,270
locked inside the hold.

557
00:50:49,196 --> 00:50:51,047
Locked from within.

558
00:50:52,487 --> 00:50:54,812
They ate each other alive.

559
00:50:57,445 --> 00:51:01,197
Avery claimed to have seen the log.

560
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:05,236
It said that the crew
had refused to go inland

561
00:51:05,237 --> 00:51:07,609
to forage for food or for fresh water.

562
00:51:09,813 --> 00:51:12,028
That the first men in had returned,

563
00:51:12,029 --> 00:51:15,069
reporting sounds coming from the forest.

564
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,402
The men said it sounded to them...

565
00:51:21,575 --> 00:51:23,609
like the voice of God...

566
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,341
warning them to stay away.

567
00:51:57,863 --> 00:52:01,736
It's an open question how much
of this story Avery invented.

568
00:52:01,737 --> 00:52:04,831
But what is undeniably true...

569
00:52:04,945 --> 00:52:08,319
is how undeniably effective
that story has been

570
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,493
in achieving a result.

571
00:52:21,787 --> 00:52:23,944
Captain...

572
00:52:23,945 --> 00:52:26,498
It's no accident that Billy chose it.

573
00:52:27,237 --> 00:52:31,212
A place likely to put
us all out of balance,

574
00:52:31,237 --> 00:52:34,520
where our imaginations might run wild...

575
00:52:34,545 --> 00:52:38,362
and our darkest impulses somehow made...

576
00:52:38,846 --> 00:52:41,259
far more difficult to resist.

577
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:45,555
If we are to survive this experience...

578
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,236
if our cause is to survive,

579
00:52:49,532 --> 00:52:53,032
some of us must find a way
to keep our wits about us

580
00:52:53,057 --> 00:52:55,402
on behalf of those who cannot.

581
00:52:56,094 --> 00:52:58,430
See the truth ahead of us,

582
00:52:58,455 --> 00:53:01,305
through the fear and the haze.

583
00:53:03,237 --> 00:53:05,970
Mr. Silver, I fear,

584
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:09,367
is compromised in this regard.

585
00:53:10,737 --> 00:53:12,437
At this moment...

586
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:18,229
I find myself in need of a new partner.

587
00:54:21,487 --> 00:54:24,020
I knew it would come to this.

588
00:54:25,008 --> 00:54:27,194
I tried to tell him.

589
00:54:32,955 --> 00:54:35,123
We fight,

590
00:54:35,487 --> 00:54:38,310
only two outcomes I can see...

591
00:54:38,612 --> 00:54:42,375
I die or you die.

592
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,517
Either way, he's gonna
take me to blame for it.

593
00:54:47,403 --> 00:54:50,849
That's how far you've
burrowed into his head.

594
00:54:51,653 --> 00:54:54,007
He won't put you out of it

595
00:54:54,032 --> 00:54:57,437
until he sees you for what you are.

596
00:55:03,196 --> 00:55:04,693
Go.

597
00:55:41,904 --> 00:55:43,895
Do you see it now?

598
00:55:53,112 --> 00:55:54,784
Do you see it?

599
00:55:57,737 --> 00:55:59,561
Prepare a launch.

600
00:56:37,445 --> 00:56:39,986
Captain Flint killed one of my men...

601
00:56:39,987 --> 00:56:42,437
and managed to haul the cache to shore.

602
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:46,236
I came in the hopes my
presence might buy us some time

603
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:48,623
before you reacted to this news...

604
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:52,998
and until I am able to
remedy the situation.

605
00:56:53,774 --> 00:56:56,131
What sort of remedy is that?

606
00:57:02,945 --> 00:57:05,627
I sent six of my men after him.

607
00:57:06,567 --> 00:57:08,923
The best men I have left.

608
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:13,525
Their orders, in no uncertain terms,

609
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:16,236
are to track Captain Flint...

610
00:57:16,237 --> 00:57:18,062
and retrieve the cache.

611
00:57:18,896 --> 00:57:20,588
There was another order...

612
00:57:24,997 --> 00:57:26,666
wasn't there?

613
00:57:32,278 --> 00:57:33,813
Yes.

614
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,532
What else did you tell them to do?

615
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,694
I instructed them to kill Captain Flint.
