1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,124
Your plan failed.

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,877
We're moving on to my plan.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,418
Go get it. Bring it up here right now.

4
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:18,918
Go get what?

5
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:21,960
We had it in our hands.

6
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:24,251
This war was breathing
air. It was alive.

7
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:27,460
Do not ask me to choose
between a war and a wife.

8
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:28,793
Skeleton Island,

9
00:00:28,818 --> 00:00:30,877
well outside the
established trade route.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,543
It's no accident that Billy chose it...

11
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:36,124
a place likely to put
us all out of balance.

12
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,460
That man, I have it on good authority,

13
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:42,002
claims to have been to Skeleton
Island, and can show us the way.

14
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:44,877
I find myself in need of a new partner.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,251
If our cause is to survive,

16
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:50,760
some of us must find a way
to keep our wits about us

17
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:52,950
on behalf of those who cannot.

18
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:56,124
I sent six of my men after him.

19
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,859
I instructed them to kill Captain Flint.

21
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:23,509
What are we looking at?

22
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,900
Nassau.

23
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,100
Thereabouts.

24
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:31,002
A few days over the horizon,

25
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,951
just waiting for us.

26
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:36,835
Can't you see it?

27
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:41,124
After I just climbed that fucking hill,

28
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,585
are you being serious right now?

29
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:49,537
In a few weeks time,

30
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,918
I will lead a pirate fleet of
unprecedented strength over that horizon

31
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:56,877
into a battle of
unprecedented importance.

32
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,960
With a little luck,

33
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:05,125
that battle will end with us taking
Nassau and beginning a revolution.

34
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,460
I cannot do it without you.

35
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,585
So it would benefit all
involved, you not the least,

36
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:18,668
if, when the battle begins, you
aren't killed by the first fool

37
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:21,293
lucky enough to swing a sword your way.

38
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,124
You wanna teach me to fight?

39
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,918
I know you know how to fight.

40
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:30,090
I want to teach you how
to fight and not die.

41
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:35,746
You'll have more control with that.

42
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:40,168
I know how you feel about
being seen without the leg,

43
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:42,988
but when the fighting truly begins,

44
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:45,640
all that matters is what
makes for the greatest...

45
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,434
advantage.

46
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,996
The men...

47
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:56,121
I have to manage how they see me.

48
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:00,676
I understand that's part of my job.

49
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,574
But for pride to be an
issue between you and I...

50
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:07,124
well, I...

51
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,251
I think we're playing past that by now.

52
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:10,831
Don't you?

53
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:12,960
Hmm.

54
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:30,085
Do you really imagine
a few weeks of this

55
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,209
is going to make much of a difference?

56
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:34,835
Am I not what I am at this point?

57
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,960
It's better than nothing.

58
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:41,207
Right.

59
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,753
You're not concerned about this?

60
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:48,970
Concerned?

61
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:53,125
Well, you say you'll
be teaching me to fight.

62
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,752
But if every man fights differently,

63
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:58,124
seems to me what you'll
really be teaching me

64
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:00,018
is how to defeat you.

65
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:06,021
I'll take my chances.

66
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:08,443
Shall we?

67
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,911
Tell me you know where they are.

68
00:06:48,936 --> 00:06:52,418
Laid eyes on Flint and the other
just as we entered the trees.

69
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:55,085
At some distance, but we saw them.

70
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,786
Sent the men after them.

71
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:58,585
Carrying that chest, they won't get far.

72
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,833
Well, Flint doesn't need to get far.

73
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:06,309
All he needs is to bury that gold
somewhere unknown and he's won.

74
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,044
How long did he give you?

75
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,723
The governor.

76
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:13,918
He said I have till sunrise
tomorrow to return the cache.

77
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:16,209
But I don't think we're
going to have that long.

78
00:07:16,293 --> 00:07:18,997
He gave me the time for
his benefit, not mine.

79
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,251
He's preparing to make a move.

80
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:25,835
I know not what, but
he's preparing for it.

81
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:28,335
And there's little I can do
about it until I secure that chest

82
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:30,255
and have it to bargain with.

83
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:56,498
Which one of them is going to prevail?

84
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,701
Which one?

85
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:04,293
Mr. Silver assures me he can
retrieve the cache from Flint

86
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,873
and resume our transaction
on its original terms.

87
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:11,358
If he is incorrect...

88
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,676
I will have some
difficult choices to make.

89
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:18,770
You know the two of them.

90
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,612
Now that they're facing
each other as opponents,

91
00:08:20,637 --> 00:08:24,002
I'm asking what sort of
outcome I should expect.

92
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:27,411
Silver has the men.

93
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:29,293
And...

94
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,489
Flint is on his own out
there and disadvantaged.

95
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,014
That said...

96
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:40,752
Flint's been on his
own and disadvantaged

97
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:43,006
countless times since I've known him.

98
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,647
And here we are.

99
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:53,135
Suppose what I'm saying is...

100
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:57,284
if I were you, I would
assume the worst...

101
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,778
and act accordingly now
while you know you still can.

102
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:13,872
My Lord, the mist is heavy.

103
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:17,830
It may be our best chance to
move with minimal casualties.

104
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,683
I'd like to see her again.

105
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:37,209
She'll never accept your offer.

106
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:38,835
You are, for now,

107
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:41,793
a necessary evil here.

108
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:44,003
Do not test my patience.

109
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:49,656
Bring her up from below.

110
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:51,015
Now.

111
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:11,124
What's this?

112
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,459
We tracked him this far,
but the trail splits in two.

113
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,834
Well, it seems he may
intend to divide our numbers,

114
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:18,626
improve his chances.

115
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:21,124
If they say you know his
mind as if it were your own,

116
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,995
we thought you might have a better idea

117
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,018
which way he went than we could.

118
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:29,158
How in the fuck would I know
which way he decided to go?

119
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:32,385
All Flint needs is an hour, maybe less,

120
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,176
to conceal that chest in a way
we couldn't hope to recover.

121
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:37,124
Every moment we stand here deliberating

122
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,783
is a moment closer to his victory.

123
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,133
The three of you, that way.

124
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:44,455
You, the other trail now!

125
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:55,542
He's right.

126
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:59,461
Flint likely seeks to separate
them, gain an advantage.

127
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,701
I know.

128
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:05,542
So it's likely you've just sent

129
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:08,244
one of those two groups to their death.

130
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,422
As long as they expose his position.

131
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:16,368
I wonder if he knows...

132
00:11:17,418 --> 00:11:19,824
just how much you learned from him.

133
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:41,124
Your opponent's wrist

134
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,751
is from whence the attack is born.

135
00:11:43,752 --> 00:11:48,018
It is its past tense from
which it cannot separate itself.

136
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:51,834
The end of the blade,
where the attack arrives,

137
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:53,373
is its present tense,

138
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:55,598
which also cannot be denied.

139
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:58,459
You're still watching my eyes,

140
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,910
which is a good way of
getting yourself killed.

141
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:03,417
How exactly is one supposed to watch

142
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,604
two points in space at the same time?

143
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:07,104
Practice.

144
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:09,834
All warfare is the same.

145
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:12,125
Two questions are of
paramount importance...

146
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:14,084
who was my opponent yesterday,

147
00:12:14,085 --> 00:12:15,375
and who is he today?

148
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:18,807
Answer those two questions, and
there is very little he can...

149
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,493
hide from you.

150
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:29,618
What?

151
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:34,388
Who you were.

152
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:40,619
I have no idea who you were.

153
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:45,549
Not before we found you, at any rate.

154
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:48,329
Jesus Christ,

155
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:50,002
don't do that.

156
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:52,424
If you want to know where
I come from, just ask.

157
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,311
I think I just did.

158
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,081
You know all there is to know.

159
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:05,084
I was born in Whitechapel,
never knew my mother.

160
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:08,310
I had a wholly unremarkable youth.

161
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:09,967
- Spent most of it at a home for...
- Home for boys.

162
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:11,639
I know, I know.

163
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:16,834
You, uh... you told me once or
twice of your experiences there.

164
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:20,511
Except it isn't true.

165
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:23,054
Is it?

166
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:27,067
Why would you say that?

167
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:30,020
I remember when you first told me,

168
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:32,310
it sounded like a... invention.

169
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,637
About one story that bled into others

170
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:38,278
I'd heard told elsewhere to the crew.

171
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:41,434
I didn't think much of it at the time.

172
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:45,571
I suppose I assumed that if you
ever became somebody worth knowing,

173
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:48,153
I'd learn the truth of it eventually.

174
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:49,738
Only...

175
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,950
in this moment, I'm
realizing that never happened.

176
00:13:57,114 --> 00:14:00,249
And what is of some
concern to me is that...

177
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,601
despite how invested we each
are in the future of the other...

178
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:08,314
you just told me that story again.

179
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:12,960
Why is that?

180
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:24,397
It isn't important.

181
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:28,479
All right.

182
00:14:29,614 --> 00:14:32,784
Although, you know
that isn't true either.

183
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:36,156
Why isn't it true?

184
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:40,834
I'm sorry, the more I
try and dismiss this, I...

185
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,460
You know my story.

186
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:55,760
Thomas, Miranda, all of it.

187
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:59,488
Know the role it played in motivating me

188
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:00,905
to do the things that I've done,

189
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:02,730
the things I will do.

190
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,147
It has made me transparent to you.

191
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,988
Not only that, but when
I told you this story,

192
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:17,153
you insinuated yourself into it.

193
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:19,905
The latest in a line
of ill-fated partners,

194
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:22,571
situating yourself such that...

195
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:25,880
were you and I ever to come to blows...

196
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:32,897
I'd be forced to hesitate
before doing you any harm.

197
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,113
- Slow down, I...
- I'm not angry with you.

198
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:39,689
It's just...

199
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:43,265
you know my story.

200
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,488
And for some reason, I cannot figure...

201
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:48,906
I don't want you to know mine.

202
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,850
Wait a minute.

203
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:00,904
I...

204
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:03,153
I understand your concern.

205
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:05,189
I just...

206
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:12,354
We'll resume tomorrow.
Is that all right?

207
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,326
We found him.

208
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:39,196
I don't see the chest.

209
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:41,946
Track marks go back 200 yards.

210
00:16:42,822 --> 00:16:44,772
He dragged it here.

211
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,354
Should we fetch Mr. Hands?

212
00:18:03,822 --> 00:18:05,730
We should head back.

213
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:35,993
You sailed with Avery.

214
00:19:40,757 --> 00:19:42,589
Long time ago.

215
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,231
20 years?

216
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:47,848
More, even, maybe?

217
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,279
More, aye.

218
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,897
Mm-hmm.

219
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:57,314
You do know where you're going, yes?

220
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:06,178
No, seriously, I've got
quite a lot riding on this.

221
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:10,488
One day, you'll leave the account.

222
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:14,496
Take a wife, father children.

223
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,196
See less and less of the sea

224
00:20:17,197 --> 00:20:21,446
until she becomes like a
painting hanging on the wall,

225
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:24,683
static and irrelevant...

226
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:27,275
to your daily existence.

227
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:32,302
But she'll keep on calling you.

228
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:36,153
And when she does,

229
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:38,154
you'll step into that painting

230
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,091
and feel the swell beneath your feet.

231
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:44,613
It'll all come back

232
00:20:44,614 --> 00:20:47,185
as if it were like yesterday.

233
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:50,099
Is that so?

234
00:20:53,526 --> 00:20:55,571
I've watched you and yours

235
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:59,581
handle the account
since I and mine left it.

236
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:04,696
Accomplish things that
no one I ever sailed with

237
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,511
could dream of.

238
00:21:07,673 --> 00:21:10,255
From what I've overheard,

239
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,964
if you reach Skeleton Island,

240
00:21:13,364 --> 00:21:15,768
might mean the end of the governor.

241
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:22,225
Maybe keep the account
alive a little while longer.

242
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:25,354
Is that so?

243
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:29,787
That and more.

244
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:36,770
Then I'll take you to it.

245
00:21:37,154 --> 00:21:40,466
Hold on to this for as long as you can,

246
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:43,696
for all of us who once had it...

247
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:45,730
and walked away.

248
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,377
You have no idea the
restraint this takes.

249
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:19,540
How urgent the instinct
towards violence.

250
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,613
How certain the conviction
that it would be deserved,

251
00:22:23,614 --> 00:22:26,954
given what you and your
partners have destroyed,

252
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:30,337
what you've taken from me.

253
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:37,237
To me,

254
00:22:37,238 --> 00:22:41,005
compromise seems a
loathsome, unbearable act.

255
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:44,154
What compromise can there be

256
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:47,564
with the man responsible
for the death of my wife?

257
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:53,060
Or with those who would follow him?

258
00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:01,237
You're luckier than you know...

259
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:09,386
so much luckier than you know

260
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:14,030
that in this moment I can still hear
the faintest of voices in my head

261
00:23:14,031 --> 00:23:16,529
arguing against the alternative.

262
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:23,561
If I must compromise
to avert a dark end,

263
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:26,741
then so must you.

264
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,696
I've offered you
freedom for your people.

265
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:34,710
I have offered you more than
you have any right to expect.

266
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:37,522
And still, you will not say yes.

267
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:41,853
So I come to you one last time,

268
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,243
to ensure you cannot say no.

269
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:49,946
- Accept the treaty...
- I will consider no treaty of yours.

270
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:52,174
... and John Silver lives.

271
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:56,872
Refuse...

272
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:00,481
and he dies...

273
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:04,848
along with the rest of the
men who followed him here.

274
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:09,179
And from what I understand,

275
00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:12,414
he is the one who matters most to you.

276
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,153
The one with whom you might lead a life

277
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:18,354
if you can set aside
your pride in this moment.

278
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:27,387
Do not make the same mistake I did.

279
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:31,730
Do the deal.

280
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,796
The voice you hear in your head...

281
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,321
I imagine I know who it sounds like,

282
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:45,436
as I know Eleanor wanted those things.

283
00:24:46,073 --> 00:24:48,153
But I hear other voices.

284
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:52,702
A chorus of voices.

285
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,605
Multitudes.

286
00:24:57,405 --> 00:24:59,811
They reach back centuries.

287
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:05,237
Men and women...

288
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:08,153
and children who'd lost their lives...

289
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:09,994
to men like you.

290
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:14,237
Men and women and children

291
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:16,438
forced to wear your chains.

292
00:25:17,922 --> 00:25:20,080
I must answer to them

293
00:25:20,405 --> 00:25:22,189
and this war...

294
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,780
their war...

295
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:26,571
Flint's war...

296
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:28,924
my war...

297
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:33,152
it will not be bargained
away to avoid a fight,

298
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:37,153
to save John Silver's life...

299
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:39,206
or his men's...

300
00:25:39,614 --> 00:25:41,128
or mine.

301
00:25:43,154 --> 00:25:45,530
And you believe what you will,

302
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:49,803
but it was neither I nor Flint...

303
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:53,186
nor the Spanish raider
who killed your wife.

304
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:58,153
That, you did.

305
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:09,199
Sergeant.

306
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:17,354
Take her below.

307
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:35,488
- Are your men ready?
- They are, my Lord.

308
00:26:35,489 --> 00:26:37,073
Then we move now.

309
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:38,714
Ready the launches.

310
00:27:08,154 --> 00:27:10,595
- Any sign of them?
- No.

311
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,588
Nor the chest, nor any trail for either.

312
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:19,009
- We should move.
- Move where?

313
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:23,171
Flint's almost certainly
disposed of the cache by now.

314
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:26,897
For all we know, he's headed
back to the Walrus as we speak.

315
00:27:27,322 --> 00:27:29,863
Leverages his sole knowledge
of the chest's location

316
00:27:29,864 --> 00:27:31,738
to gain control of the men.

317
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:35,163
Then maybe attempts to
rescue Madi, maybe not.

318
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,116
Maybe he's already factored
her death into this.

319
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:41,189
A martyr to feed the cause.

320
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,518
Fuck him...

321
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,159
for dictating this outcome to me,

322
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:53,620
for swearing his
friendship falsely to me,

323
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:56,495
for his arrogance,

324
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,956
his indifference.

325
00:28:00,864 --> 00:28:03,273
So, what are you gonna do about it?

326
00:28:05,656 --> 00:28:07,987
You've been warned so many times...

327
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:10,839
by Billy, by me, by Flint's own actions.

328
00:28:10,864 --> 00:28:14,129
And despite that, despite this,

329
00:28:14,154 --> 00:28:16,655
I think when we meet him again,

330
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:20,532
you will look for reasons
to forget it all again.

331
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:24,153
You've come all this way,
traveled all this distance,

332
00:28:24,154 --> 00:28:25,723
and when he starts talking,

333
00:28:25,748 --> 00:28:28,245
you won't have learned a goddamn thing.

334
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:36,547
We've come all this way.

335
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:41,586
How far are we from
where the paths split?

336
00:28:41,947 --> 00:28:43,404
Hm.

337
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:45,742
Two hundred yards, give or take.

338
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:47,438
More.

339
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:53,056
He never would have got
this far ahead of your men

340
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:54,821
carrying that chest.

341
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:59,022
The chest was never here.

342
00:29:01,822 --> 00:29:03,631
He left it behind.

343
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:19,082
You think they'll figure it out
that we dropped it down here?

344
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:22,153
We need to get it in the ground.

345
00:29:22,154 --> 00:29:23,522
Come on.

346
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:36,153
Heard some talk in the
camp before we left.

347
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:39,153
They were talking about what
happens when it's over...

348
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,153
if the war ends up what
everyone says it will be...

349
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,195
about the spoils we all
stand to gain from it.

350
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:47,546
But what you're talking about
is bigger than that, isn't it?

351
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,613
But if we succeed...
if we are to succeed

352
00:29:51,614 --> 00:29:54,738
and leave this island
with the alliance intact,

353
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:56,488
I'm having a hard time
seeing how Mr. Silver

354
00:29:56,489 --> 00:29:58,658
can be a part of that now.

355
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:00,564
He'll come round.

356
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:02,738
Once she's safe,

357
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:05,821
then he'll be able to
see things clearly again.

358
00:30:05,822 --> 00:30:07,196
I hope so.

359
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:10,056
If not, if he needs to go...

360
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:14,048
You're too important to what comes next

361
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:16,329
to have to bear a burden like that.

362
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:21,180
So, when the time comes, I'll do it.

363
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,153
Fuck!

364
00:30:32,154 --> 00:30:33,946
You're still leaning forward.

365
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:35,838
Let's go again.

366
00:30:41,031 --> 00:30:43,153
I have no story to tell.

367
00:30:51,154 --> 00:30:52,571
It all might seem as though I'm trying

368
00:30:52,572 --> 00:30:54,772
to conceal something from you, but...

369
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,400
truth is...

370
00:30:59,114 --> 00:31:01,354
there is no story to tell.

371
00:31:05,408 --> 00:31:08,025
No one's past is that unremarkable.

372
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:13,231
Not unremarkable, just...

373
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:16,564
without relevance.

374
00:31:24,662 --> 00:31:26,488
A long time ago, I absolved myself

375
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:28,716
from the obligation of finding any.

376
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:32,655
No need to account for
all my life's events

377
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:35,696
in the context of a
story that somehow...

378
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:37,459
defines me.

379
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:41,834
Events, some of which, no one
could divine any meaning from...

380
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:46,529
other than that the world is
a place of unending horrors.

381
00:31:51,614 --> 00:31:54,236
I've come to peace with the knowledge...

382
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:56,900
that there is no storyteller

383
00:31:57,572 --> 00:31:59,955
imposing any coherence,

384
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:03,916
nor sense, nor grace upon those events.

385
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:09,106
Therefore, there's no duty
on my part to search for it.

386
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:13,861
You know of me all I
can bear to be known.

387
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:17,127
All that is relevant to be known.

388
00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:22,471
That is to say, you know
my genuine friendship...

389
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:24,153
and loyalty.

390
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:34,662
Can that be enough and there
still be trust between us?

391
00:32:49,895 --> 00:32:51,166
Again.

392
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:15,841
We're nearing the turn point.

393
00:33:16,154 --> 00:33:17,571
Good.

394
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:19,780
That's good.

395
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,863
Once the range marks align,

396
00:33:21,864 --> 00:33:24,153
we'll have a sense what
direction we're to head in

397
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:25,939
to reach the island.

398
00:33:28,197 --> 00:33:30,988
How far out, do you think?

399
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:32,237
Oh...

400
00:33:32,238 --> 00:33:34,153
could be a few days,

401
00:33:34,154 --> 00:33:36,273
maybe less.

402
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,637
When we sailed for the Urca gold,

403
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:47,958
I remember something of this feeling.

404
00:33:48,377 --> 00:33:50,702
So much to be gained.

405
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,237
But this is different, isn't it?

406
00:33:55,238 --> 00:33:56,446
How so?

407
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:58,628
Well, then,

408
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:01,196
even a complete and thorough success

409
00:34:01,197 --> 00:34:03,894
meant a qualified victory.

410
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:06,072
On some level, whether we were prepared

411
00:34:06,073 --> 00:34:07,655
to acknowledge it out loud or not,

412
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:09,941
I believe we both knew the
fortune would likely cause

413
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:12,655
as many problems as it would solve.

414
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:14,439
But now,

415
00:34:14,464 --> 00:34:18,072
if that man out there can
fulfill his promise to us,

416
00:34:18,073 --> 00:34:21,605
if we can prevail over
Flint and the governor...

417
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,191
and I feel we can...

418
00:34:24,822 --> 00:34:27,933
I don't know why, but I feel it.

419
00:34:29,238 --> 00:34:31,230
Am I mad?

420
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:33,714
Tell me. I'm asking.

421
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,238
I don't think you are.

422
00:34:38,614 --> 00:34:40,214
I've...

423
00:34:41,154 --> 00:34:43,604
thought the same thing.

424
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,863
The result ahead of us...

425
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:49,905
promises to be a victory...

426
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:51,856
of a different sort.

427
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,354
A true victory.

428
00:34:57,822 --> 00:34:59,480
Freedom...

429
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:03,397
in every sense of the word.

430
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,675
How many men in the history of
the world have ever known it?

431
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,769
How remarkable a moment is this?

432
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:20,279
How fortunate are we to be
standing on the threshold of it?

433
00:35:22,013 --> 00:35:23,441
Yes?

434
00:35:28,497 --> 00:35:30,032
What is it?

435
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:47,671
James said he saw him
clutch for his chest.

436
00:35:47,696 --> 00:35:50,562
Then... he just dropped.

437
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:54,586
Mm-hmm.

438
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:06,569
Mm-hmm.

439
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,912
- Should we...?
- Mm-hmm.

440
00:36:12,864 --> 00:36:14,943
His heart gave out.

441
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:21,153
So, you asked him to recount for you

442
00:36:21,154 --> 00:36:22,901
what he knew days ago, yes?

443
00:36:22,926 --> 00:36:25,452
- Of course.
- 'Course you did. Good.

444
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,354
And you can get us to our destination
without his assistance, yes?

445
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,000
His heart gave out!

446
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:36,184
Do not fuck with me.

447
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:41,153
Of course I can, truly.

448
00:36:41,154 --> 00:36:43,788
I'm almost certain I can figure it out.

449
00:36:53,256 --> 00:36:55,842
Get the fuck up and sail.

450
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:08,006
All is well?

451
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:12,147
I thought I heard it.

452
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:17,540
Thought you heard what?

453
00:37:21,154 --> 00:37:22,884
A woman.

454
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:25,730
Or what sounded like a woman.

455
00:37:27,864 --> 00:37:29,728
Wailing...

456
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:31,964
just faintly from the trees.

457
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:43,380
Mr. Wallis swears he saw a mermaid

458
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:45,239
swimming beneath the surface.

459
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:49,153
Mr. Jones heard the voice of his mother

460
00:37:49,154 --> 00:37:52,124
accusing him of
infidelity to her memory.

461
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,153
The mind is prone to
mischief, I suppose.

462
00:37:55,154 --> 00:37:56,363
Mm-hmm.

463
00:37:56,364 --> 00:37:59,072
Especially in a place like this...

464
00:37:59,097 --> 00:38:01,202
remote and...

465
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,189
full of stories.

466
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:09,494
There are no monsters in the dark...

467
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:13,098
though there are dangers.

468
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:17,253
Let's take care to tell the difference.

469
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:20,354
Lay our attention on the latter.

470
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:45,231
Fuck!

471
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:55,363
Hey, the hold's on fire!

472
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,596
What happened?

473
00:43:01,365 --> 00:43:03,384
Men in the water!

474
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:07,509
Launches in the water!

475
00:43:09,012 --> 00:43:11,177
From the Eurydice!

476
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:12,806
Oh, good God.

477
00:43:19,114 --> 00:43:21,595
Don't wait for me! Go!

478
00:43:47,114 --> 00:43:49,106
They'll be upon us soon.

479
00:43:53,435 --> 00:43:55,542
You'll have to put it in the ground.

480
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:01,683
Can you do it?

481
00:44:03,572 --> 00:44:05,354
I'll stall them.

482
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:22,772
Jesus!

483
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:31,130
We need to get above.

484
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,154
You said our only chance of saving
the ship is to flood this hold.

485
00:44:34,155 --> 00:44:35,986
It's too far gone.

486
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:39,236
In a couple of minutes that
fire will reach the magazine.

487
00:44:39,548 --> 00:44:41,408
What choice do we have?

488
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:43,833
Abandon ship.

489
00:44:44,205 --> 00:44:45,238
Abandon ship!

490
00:44:45,263 --> 00:44:47,463
- Abandon ship!
- All hands!

491
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:25,153
It would be preferable to me

492
00:45:25,154 --> 00:45:27,744
if we resolved this another way.

493
00:45:32,656 --> 00:45:34,897
Cache is in the ground by now.

494
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:38,821
And I'll need as many men as we can get

495
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:40,869
for what comes next.

496
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:44,065
That includes you.

497
00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:57,038
He'll be here in a moment.

498
00:46:00,197 --> 00:46:04,153
You still think you'll persuade
him to see this all your way?

499
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:07,397
I don't think so.

500
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:11,153
But I'd prefer not to find out.

501
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,153
That's enough!

502
00:46:50,154 --> 00:46:51,897
Tell me where it is.

503
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:54,030
- I can't do that.
- Fuck you! Where is it?

504
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:56,343
- You're making a mistake.
- Fuck you! Where is it?

505
00:46:56,368 --> 00:46:57,777
In the ground...

506
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,617
where it stays until Madi is freed,

507
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,814
and we gather it and return
it to the camp, all of us.

508
00:47:12,824 --> 00:47:15,562
I know you cannot see why this must be.

509
00:47:16,242 --> 00:47:18,156
But it must be.

510
00:47:18,561 --> 00:47:20,609
And every moment we waste is a moment

511
00:47:20,697 --> 00:47:22,988
we could be working to retrieve her.

512
00:47:22,989 --> 00:47:25,655
That's all this has ever been, isn't it?

513
00:47:25,851 --> 00:47:28,390
A partnership only
insofar as it enables you

514
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:31,648
to do whatever it is that matters
to you in any given moment.

515
00:47:31,968 --> 00:47:35,279
And right now it matters far less
to you whether she lives or dies

516
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,967
than it happens your way, on your terms.

517
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:42,279
I think you know it's far
more complicated than that.

518
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,314
I'm certain she does.

519
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,000
Hup!

520
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,153
Even if you could kill me,

521
00:47:53,154 --> 00:47:55,780
even if that somehow helped
you see her alive again,

522
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:58,328
how are you going to explain it to her?

523
00:47:58,898 --> 00:48:01,488
She believes in this as much as I do.

524
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:03,153
You know this.

525
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,738
If it costs the war to save her,

526
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:07,711
you'll have lost her anyway.

527
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:10,655
Even you cannot construct a story

528
00:48:10,656 --> 00:48:12,859
to make her forgive you that.

529
00:48:19,442 --> 00:48:20,859
You do this,

530
00:48:20,884 --> 00:48:22,876
and you're gonna regret it.

531
00:48:48,114 --> 00:48:50,273
No! Don't!

532
00:49:51,086 --> 00:49:54,664
Swim for the shore!
Try to reach the shore!

533
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,694
Get to the shore! Away from the ship!

534
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,660
Can't you see it?

535
00:51:05,326 --> 00:51:08,652
It isn't utility that's
behind his investment in me...

536
00:51:09,822 --> 00:51:12,354
nor necessity, nor dependency.

537
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,273
I understand you fear a false motive.

538
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:21,814
But this much is clear to me now...

539
00:51:24,154 --> 00:51:26,354
I have earned his respect.

540
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:33,354
And after all the tragedies
that man has suffered...

541
00:51:36,154 --> 00:51:38,153
the loss of Thomas,

542
00:51:38,154 --> 00:51:40,354
