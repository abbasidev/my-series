1
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,688
My instinct is the
same now as it was then.

2
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:16,896
I will show them what
the consequences are

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,757
for threatening that
which I hold most dear.

4
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:22,715
Secure the rest of them.

5
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:24,917
Set a course for Nassau.

6
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,646
- You want to withdraw?
- If we don't,

7
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:28,312
it will be the end of whatever trust

8
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:30,563
exists between us and
the slaves on the island.

9
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:32,479
The only way to free them safely

10
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:33,855
is if it is all at once...

11
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:36,312
simultaneous revolts across the island.

12
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:39,832
Billy and his men are our enemies
now, but these men are not.

13
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:42,021
Why do we need an escort to the fort?

14
00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:43,771
Quickly, please. We
don't have much time.

15
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:45,469
Threats have been made.
The story's been told.

16
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:49,563
Everyone in Nassau knows what
Long John Silver's return means,

17
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:52,049
what's expected of them
when he does return.

18
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:54,834
All that remains is for him to return.

20
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:53,021
We're not apart on this island.

21
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,630
We cannot be apart.

22
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,655
Many of you have got kin
at the Underhill estate.

23
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,279
A reminder of how our fates
are bound together here.

24
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:08,146
And then that kin of
yours aided in a revolt

25
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,078
where three...

26
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:12,978
Mr. Underhill, his wife,

27
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:15,226
and nine-year-old daughter

28
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,894
were murdered in cold blood.

29
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:22,313
What happened there is paid for here.

30
00:03:22,396 --> 00:03:26,716
I pray a lesson that will
not soon be forgotten.

31
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,146
Have you got something to say, Julius?

32
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:52,759
Get them back in the barracks.

33
00:03:52,974 --> 00:03:55,144
- Nassau's fallen.
- Aye.

34
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,813
Get them back inside!

35
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:16,896
- Come on, protect the lady!
- It's okay, it's okay! Stay down.

36
00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:21,646
- Quick, get on out of here!
- Help her up! Help her up!

37
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,729
Get on!

38
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:25,521
Go, go, go!

39
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,187
- Over here!
- Yah! Yah!

40
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:47,975
Yah!

41
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:54,980
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

42
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:56,539
Is there a list of
everyone who made it inside?

43
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,071
- Yes, ma'am.
- Bring it to me, please.

44
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:00,489
And find Max as well. I need
to speak with her right away.

45
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,105
Move the harbor-facing guns.

46
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,375
I want them pointed toward the town

47
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,695
and ready for our first barrage.

48
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,896
- What is going on here?
- Everything is under control, ma'am.

49
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:09,614
We'll have our counterattack
underway before nightfall.

50
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,313
We're not moving those guns.

51
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,396
There will be no barrage and
there will be no counterattack.

52
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,105
I beg your pardon?

53
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:17,068
Firing those guns isn't
likely to achieve anything

54
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:19,036
other than advertising
our panic and fear.

55
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:20,769
Not to mention wasting shot and powder,

56
00:05:20,794 --> 00:05:22,794
which will be invaluable when
the time does come for its use.

57
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:24,068
With all due respect, madam,

58
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:26,052
it is our duty to do
everything within our power

59
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,368
- to retake Nassau town.
- It's lost.

60
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,081
For the moment, Nassau town is lost.

61
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:34,146
That much is painfully clear.

62
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:36,884
It is our duty now to
secure ourselves here,

63
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,217
conserve resources,

64
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:39,688
and hold out until the governor returns

65
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:42,838
with whatever aid he was able to
muster to combine with our force.

66
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:44,494
Then we will launch a credible assault

67
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,038
to drive out Captain Flint and his men.

68
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:48,563
I've ensured we have stores
and provision to last us weeks.

69
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:50,408
But what if the
governor does not return?

70
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,920
He will return.

71
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,188
And we will be prepared to join him
in fighting our enemy when he does.

72
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,105
Mrs. Rogers.

73
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,566
Is that the list?

74
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:00,832
- Yes, ma'am, but...
- Where is Max?

75
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:03,229
- I thought I asked you to fetch her.
- She's not here, ma'am.

76
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:04,791
She isn't here? What do
you mean she isn't here?

77
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:06,496
She was the first name
I gave you to secure.

78
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,651
I sent two of my best
men to retrieve her.

79
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:12,938
But apparently between there
and here, they were unsuccessful.

80
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,538
Nassau works best when its men know

81
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:34,913
what crews they belong to

82
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:36,830
and what captains they answer to.

83
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:40,162
Without structure, disorder
is only to be expected.

84
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:42,197
Now, you will begin...

85
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:44,411
with men that you know and trust.

86
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:47,076
And from there, you will
begin to reorganize your crews

87
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:48,550
as quickly as possible.

88
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,955
Crews? With no ships?

89
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,413
Well, we've all hunted
small... piraguas or less.

90
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,196
It'll have to start there
until things are settled.

91
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,967
But it is the only way there will be

92
00:06:57,992 --> 00:07:00,360
any semblance of order in the meantime.

93
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:02,151
There aren't gonna be many men out there

94
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:04,476
eager to take orders anytime soon.

95
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:06,610
You were chosen...

96
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,579
because I thought you were worthy
to be the first captain's counsel

97
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,435
of a restored Nassau.

98
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:13,782
Do I need to reconsider?

99
00:07:17,274 --> 00:07:18,885
You heard him.

100
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:29,413
What did he think?

101
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:31,162
He was going to get a
different answer from me?

102
00:07:31,163 --> 00:07:33,913
Well, if in doubt, ask
someone else, I suppose.

103
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:37,287
The more they realize there is
no daylight between you and I,

104
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:40,409
the more they will learn to
accept our shared authority.

105
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:43,287
Is it safe, then, to admit
that I'm not sure he's wrong?

106
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,163
It's bad out there.
Worse than I anticipated.

107
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:49,496
All life begins in violence
and wailing. It will pass.

108
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,288
A lot of things begin
with violence and wailing.

109
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:54,162
A lot of them end up that way, too.

110
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:57,162
- Though, I admire your optimism.
- Captain.

111
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:58,996
What news from the beach?

112
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,538
The governor's close council
and several dozen soldiers

113
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:03,663
have managed to secure
themselves inside the fort.

114
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:05,996
- Eleanor Guthrie, is she among them?
- She is.

115
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,913
And she sent a note.

116
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,663
She sent it?

117
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:12,163
She's taken charge of them all already?

118
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,930
It's an offer of an exchange.

119
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:17,663
20 of our men captured
during the invasion

120
00:08:17,746 --> 00:08:19,639
and held in the fort...

121
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:21,687
for Max.

122
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,204
20 men following orders would
make a big difference out there.

123
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:28,162
I agree. Unfortunately,
I don't think we have Max.

124
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:29,788
Do we have Max?

125
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:32,370
Does anyone know where she is?

126
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:36,301
All right. Grab some men.

127
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:37,935
Set about finding her.

128
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,563
She's not in the fort. She
couldn't have gotten very far.

129
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:43,248
And Billy?

130
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:50,614
Where is Billy?

131
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,871
I couldn't say. I saw some
of his men by the beach,

132
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:57,246
but I assumed we were keeping
our distance from them.

133
00:08:57,735 --> 00:08:59,454
Keeping our distance?

134
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:03,329
He's stolen the army that
pledged its allegiance to us,

135
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:05,080
not to mention the damaged he's caused

136
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:07,856
with our alliance to the slave
communities on this island.

137
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:12,047
There are a thousand men out there
who've been awaiting my arrival.

138
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:16,697
They're now armed and angry and
I haven't yet said a word to them.

139
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:19,913
If the first five are,
"Billy Bones has crossed you,"

140
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:22,541
would you care to
guess what happens next?

141
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:25,746
Go out there and put forth the word.

142
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,621
If Billy isn't in this
room within the hour,

143
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:29,476
I promise him...

144
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,522
he will regret it.

145
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,227
You heard him.

146
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,864
Sails!

147
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,060
South-southwest!

148
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:13,572
Heading north.

149
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:15,680
She's coming from Nassau.

150
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:18,300
A boat that small headed to open water?

151
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:23,820
- Set a course to intercept her.
- Aye, sir.

152
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,519
Coming aboard.

153
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:32,579
Mr. Rawls!

154
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:34,407
Governor. Thank you.

155
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,344
You've no idea how
grateful we are to see you.

156
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,785
What happened in Nassau?

157
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,952
The pirates, they took it.

158
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:44,319
They killed him, Captain
Berringer, right in the square.

159
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,369
Slit his throat on the gallows.

160
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,325
We just barely escaped
before it was all overrun.

161
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:52,452
- Gloucestershire, has she departed yet?
- Sir?

162
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:53,773
My ship in the harbor,

163
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:55,476
the one that was to depart
for Philadelphia with my wife,

164
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,265
was she still there when you left?

165
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:06,368
I am about to make haste to Nassau.

166
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:07,827
I cannot afford to tow that sloop along.

167
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:09,493
You will take her and
sail for Port Royal

168
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:11,044
where you will deliver
the prisoners in her hold

169
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:12,877
to Governor Addison and
his men. Do you understand?

170
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:14,368
I... I could send Mr. Chase, sir...

171
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,080
I would like for it
to be you, Lieutenant.

172
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:17,787
There are 42 pirates in
the belly of that ship

173
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:19,771
and I can spare no more than
a handful of men to see to her.

174
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:22,185
I beg your pardon, my
Lord. I want to be a part...

175
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,919
I understand you wanna be part
of the fight that's coming.

176
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:25,860
I understand you want
retribution for Captain Berringer.

177
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,885
Right now, the successful
transfer of those prisoners

178
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,424
is what I need from you.

179
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:31,996
Do you understand me?

180
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,011
Yes, my Lord.

181
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,038
There's a fight

182
00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:12,761
soon to be underway in Nassau.

183
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,344
A fight that...

184
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:18,678
we are entitled to be a part of.

185
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:23,120
A fight to answer a cowardly crime.

186
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:25,981
A fight...

187
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:28,608
that's been stolen from us

188
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,866
by you fucking people.

189
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:34,845
So...

190
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:37,465
the way I see it,

191
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:41,726
each one of you owes us a fight.

192
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:44,480
And Mr. Milton...

193
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:48,108
is here to collect.

194
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,337
Excuse me.

195
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,663
Still reports coming in.

196
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,204
Gonna need more muskets!

197
00:13:04,537 --> 00:13:07,954
I think we're all properly angry

198
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,788
about what he did on
the Underhill estate.

199
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:11,963
- What he did?
- Yes.

200
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:16,329
But a very wise woman recently told me

201
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:19,720
that one should not allow
their personal feelings

202
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,663
to cloud the reality of the situation,

203
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:24,615
which in both that case and this...

204
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:29,120
is that Billy has influence
that is best not ignored.

205
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:31,929
That sounds like good advice.

206
00:13:32,064 --> 00:13:36,064
Was it given before or after
he tried to kill the two of you?

207
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:39,076
Here he comes.

208
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:05,048
The Boyd brothers launched a raid

209
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:07,413
on one of the governor's
munition stores.

210
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:10,422
We just managed to put it down.

211
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:13,591
I think we can all
agree it helps none of us

212
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:15,769
to have those idiots armed to the teeth.

213
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,827
Yeah.

214
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,362
Lest you think I've been avoiding you.

215
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:28,120
We've had our hands full out there,

216
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:30,838
trying to manage the transition.

217
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,204
That's good.

218
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:36,120
Though, uh,

219
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,362
I think we ought to discuss...

220
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:42,404
what it's a transition to.

221
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:45,766
Certainly.

222
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:49,167
Where would you like to begin?

223
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,109
What happened on that estate?

224
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:55,871
Was the aftermath not what we feared?

225
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,314
As it will be difficult
to fully defend Nassau

226
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:15,246
without the assistance of the
slave communities of this island,

227
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:18,621
as our relationship
with those communities

228
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:22,672
is likely severely damaged
as a result of this,

229
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:24,942
it will be critical...

230
00:15:25,428 --> 00:15:28,369
that she proceed to the estate at once

231
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,704
and attempt to repair that relationship

232
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,228
to whatever extent is possible.

233
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,962
Can we trust...

234
00:15:35,987 --> 00:15:37,311
that you will guarantee

235
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:40,083
she will be received there safely?

236
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,274
'Course we can.

237
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,120
Of course Billy would never violate

238
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:52,121
the trust I place in him as a brother...

239
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,440
as a friend,

240
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:59,121
to allow harm to come
to those closest to me.

241
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:02,196
For if Billy

242
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:05,287
were to do something
as disloyal as that,

243
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:07,704
he knows I'd stop at nothing

244
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:10,496
to see that offense repaid against him.

245
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:14,558
- I will see to it.
- I should fucking hope so.

246
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:18,881
Is everyone feeling better...

247
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:23,253
now they've got that off their chests?

248
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:29,919
I ask as I'm wondering
when would be a good time

249
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:32,014
for us to talk about Max.

250
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:35,653
What about her?

251
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:39,122
You don't think there's anything
going on in Nassau right now

252
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:41,298
that I don't know about, do you?

253
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:45,547
I'm aware of the prisoner exchange

254
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,547
offered by the holdouts in the fort.

255
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,089
Meaning what?

256
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:52,236
You're going to help us find her?

257
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:54,143
Find her?

258
00:16:57,547 --> 00:16:59,198
I have her.

259
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:10,380
I am responsible...

260
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:14,523
for delivering all 42 of
you to the law in Port Royal.

261
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,381
Let me dispel that
notion for you right away.

262
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,988
It won't be happening.

263
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:27,505
I assume there is some token number

264
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,654
I must actually deliver
for appearance's sake.

265
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:34,923
How many that is I...
I honestly couldn't say.

266
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:44,714
You're the captain now
that Teach is dead, yes?

267
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:47,740
I am.

268
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:50,557
Then you choose.

269
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,214
Choose?

270
00:17:55,298 --> 00:17:59,254
Which of your men is
going to be the first?

271
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:03,797
Fuck you.

272
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:09,979
You choose...

273
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,908
or it starts with your partner here.

274
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:26,850
Mr. Carver.

275
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:12,283
- Come on!
- Ah!

276
00:19:55,556 --> 00:19:57,367
Who's next?

277
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:16,641
We'd found her with a small escort,

278
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,165
trying to move her up
to the fort, I assume.

279
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:23,334
If you want her,

280
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:26,696
I think there are some things
we ought to discuss first...

281
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,725
about our transition.

282
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,184
And I think it would be for the
best if it was just you and I.

283
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:53,381
I'm walking out of here with her.

284
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:55,853
To whatever extent you think
you have leverage enough

285
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:58,123
to extort something from me over it...

286
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,048
I'd reconsider.

287
00:21:02,906 --> 00:21:04,323
Five minutes.

288
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:06,464
Five minutes?

289
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:09,152
You listen to what I have
to say for five minutes,

290
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:10,812
and she's yours.

291
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,340
Do we have a deal?

292
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:17,269
Clock's ticking.

293
00:21:21,631 --> 00:21:23,631
Have you stopped to ask yourself...

294
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:25,715
why they want her so badly?

295
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:29,048
Because when I first heard
what happened in the harbor,

296
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:32,071
I knew it couldn't have been
Featherstone that fucked us.

297
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:34,106
He's been with us from the start

298
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:36,380
and he wouldn't have had the
nerve to cross me like that.

299
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:38,756
So, I knew it had to be someone else,

300
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,881
someone in proximity to him.

301
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:43,380
Someone bold enough to want to cross us

302
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:46,074
and dangerous enough to follow through.

303
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:51,125
So, from there, the list
got very short very quickly.

304
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:54,315
Max fucked us.

305
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,547
If it wasn't for her, we
likely take Nassau whole,

306
00:21:57,572 --> 00:22:00,583
fleet intact, no prisoners in the fort,

307
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:02,987
no fight between you and I.

308
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:06,897
Instead,

309
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:09,371
here we are.

310
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:12,325
Now, one would think

311
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:15,146
we could go a long way towards
soothing all that chaos out there,

312
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:16,754
and the anger driving it...

313
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:18,547
if we could draw everyone together

314
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:21,380
to see justice done to the
one responsible for all of it.

315
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,620
- All of it?
- Enough of it.

316
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,269
Did they not hold their
trials in her tavern?

317
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:30,381
Did she not finance the regime directly?

318
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:32,234
You don't think I could
sell that out there?

319
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,381
Because Eleanor Guthrie knows I could.

320
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:36,380
That's why the first thing she asked for

321
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:39,756
the moment those gates
closed behind her was Max.

322
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:42,964
That's how valuable she could be to us.

323
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:46,178
And you wanna trade
that away for 20 men?

324
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:49,256
Those 20 men are your brothers.

325
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:53,479
Those men's lives mean as
much to me as they do to you.

326
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:57,134
And I assure you...

327
00:22:57,467 --> 00:23:00,547
they mean a hell of a lot more
to me than they do to Flint.

328
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:02,480
You know as well as I do

329
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:04,123
the only reason he wants them free

330
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:06,540
is because the only
soldiers in town are mine

331
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:08,708
and the prisoners in the fort
are likely to still follow his...

332
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,107
I'm going to stop you right there.

333
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:13,793
From the moment you began
concocting this story,

334
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:17,106
I knew it was with an eye
towards pushing him out.

335
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:20,048
- Separating the two of us so you can...
- The two of you?

336
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:22,769
How long ago was it
that the two of us agreed

337
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:24,995
that Flint threatened
to be the end of us all?

338
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:28,714
That he would find ways of
driving us over and over again

339
00:23:28,797 --> 00:23:31,422
into that storm till
there was none of us left?

340
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:33,404
We survived him...

341
00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:35,072
you and I.

342
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:38,340
And now you want to
follow him into what?

343
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:40,340
A massive slave revolt?

344
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:43,050
A war against the British Empire?

345
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:46,983
How is this not just the next storm

346
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,189
in a very long line of them?

347
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,714
You told me once that the
people he holds closest

348
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:16,693
are the most at risk of
being consumed by him.

349
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:20,542
And he and I have
discussed it at length.

350
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:24,717
So, I thank you for your concern.

351
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:27,714
But I'm going to be just fine.

352
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:30,380
And I'm not talking about you.

353
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:33,699
I understand that you've
come to care for her.

354
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,479
Madi.

355
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:43,265
Be very...

356
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:46,238
very careful, Billy.

357
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:48,995
If anyone is at risk

358
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,477
of being consumed by
his need for this war...

359
00:24:55,106 --> 00:24:56,749
it's her.

360
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:06,381
Time's up.

361
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:20,555
I heard you were there.

362
00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:23,078
What?

363
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:26,394
The last time when we
ran off the English,

364
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:28,382
took control.

365
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:31,756
I heard you was a navy man then.

366
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,926
Heard you saw it all.

367
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:39,464
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

368
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:41,881
That was a good day for me.

369
00:25:41,964 --> 00:25:43,900
Did a thing no one else would.

370
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:45,852
Or could.

371
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:51,019
Thought I'd earned a place by
Blackbeard's side for an age.

372
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:53,672
Turns out it wasn't nearly so long

373
00:25:53,697 --> 00:25:55,332
as I thought it would be.

374
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:59,350
Before Blackbeard decided
he could do better than me.

375
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:04,964
Is there a point you're trying to make?

376
00:26:09,505 --> 00:26:12,725
You're counseling Long John
Silver to be reasonable.

377
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,999
Hmm?

378
00:26:14,092 --> 00:26:15,759
To do what you want him to do

379
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,968
instead of what he wants to do.

380
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:22,206
Just wondering how long
you think he'll suffer it...

381
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,381
before he decides he
can do better than you.

382
00:26:32,835 --> 00:26:34,835
Go get her now.

383
00:26:37,036 --> 00:26:38,702
What the hell happened in there?

384
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:42,173
We won. That's all that matters.

385
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:07,187
There will be no
mission to Philadelphia.

386
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:10,759
I assume that much is clear by now.

387
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:23,414
Our chances of success there
were slim to begin with.

388
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,181
That the idea that I might
stand in front of my grandfather

389
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:31,626
and suggest that Nassau
is still a viable concern,

390
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,633
worthy of his investment, when...

391
00:27:33,658 --> 00:27:36,324
refugees are fleeing in droves...

392
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:40,144
planters face a revolt
of their laborers...

393
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:44,381
and men with swords murder
wantonly in the streets.

394
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:48,340
Oh, Christ.

395
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:52,260
I am right back where I started.

396
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,165
Every fight I have ever won...

397
00:27:58,131 --> 00:27:59,786
every death I have escaped,

398
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,811
every sacrifice I have
had bled out of me,

399
00:28:02,884 --> 00:28:04,365
it will all have to be repeated

400
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,378
just to get things back to
where they were a few hours ago.

401
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:10,881
There's some kind of
hell it seems to me to be.

402
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:19,242
But I want you to know,

403
00:28:19,736 --> 00:28:21,044
at the first opportunity,

404
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,679
I will see you returned back home.

405
00:28:23,923 --> 00:28:25,595
I gave you my word.

406
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,531
I intend to honor it.

407
00:28:27,928 --> 00:28:31,340
This fight ahead does not belong
to you, nor to your children.

408
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:34,214
I won't have you bear any more of it.

409
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:52,439
Would you consider joining me?

410
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,106
To London?

411
00:28:58,768 --> 00:29:01,147
You have been living in
our home for some time now.

412
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:04,339
I don't imagine there's much about
my husband and I that you don't know.

413
00:29:04,964 --> 00:29:07,589
With the debt he owes, he is
going to be fighting this fight

414
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:09,473
for the rest of his life.

415
00:29:11,008 --> 00:29:13,052
And for as long as he
is chained to this place,

416
00:29:13,077 --> 00:29:14,436
then I am as well.

417
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:18,756
I wonder, ma'am, if he
might want you to leave.

418
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:20,639
Especially...

419
00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:23,425
when he learns of your...

420
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,134
current state of being.

421
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:33,527
I beg your pardon, ma'am,

422
00:29:34,116 --> 00:29:37,033
but seeing what I see in your service...

423
00:29:37,616 --> 00:29:40,522
I fear there are things
I may know about you

424
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:42,839
that even the governor
does not yet know.

425
00:29:57,707 --> 00:30:01,180
I have grown quite fond of you, ma'am.

426
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:05,760
You are someone who is
determined to be better today

427
00:30:05,785 --> 00:30:07,870
than you were yesterday.

428
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:10,908
And in this world,
that is in short supply.

429
00:30:11,896 --> 00:30:15,284
And so I find myself
feeling protective of you.

430
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:20,422
And if I am feeling that way,

431
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:24,381
fearing the thought of you bearing
a child in this environment...

432
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:29,380
I can only imagine how concerned

433
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:31,381
your husband would be.

434
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:38,464
When my family first arrived here...

435
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:42,068
I remember my...

436
00:30:42,713 --> 00:30:45,402
mother and father had
a terrible argument.

437
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:51,214
She told him that this was
no place for a little girl.

438
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:54,743
That it was cruel.

439
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:01,237
I stay,

440
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:05,498
and our child is raised
amongst all this brutality.

441
00:31:07,672 --> 00:31:09,725
I go, and my husband...

442
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,405
is left alone to face it on his own.

443
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:17,727
Amazing, this place.

444
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:22,380
Somehow leaves no options other
than to hurt the ones you love.

445
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:28,189
Ma'am, there's a messenger at the gate.

446
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:30,548
They've agreed to the exchange.

447
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:35,863
That's it!

448
00:31:35,923 --> 00:31:37,646
Another one now!

449
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:40,735
Knock his fucking teeth out.

450
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:47,119
Any man stood a chance
against him is dead.

451
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:51,505
If we don't try something
they ain't expecting,

452
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:53,923
then we're all fucking dead.

453
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,631
If any of the men who stood
a chance to beat him are dead,

454
00:31:57,656 --> 00:31:59,690
then what do you suggest?

455
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:03,031
Any man.

456
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:07,464
Absolutely... absolutely you can not.

457
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:09,823
The ones of us they don't get down here,

458
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:12,348
we're just gonna swing in
Port Royal in a few days.

459
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:14,756
- Get up. Get up!
- You gotta trust me.

460
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:18,629
He asks you for a name,

461
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,923
you don't say shit.

462
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,598
And you let him take me.

463
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,380
Another name, Captain.

464
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:35,055
Captain?

465
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:38,270
Will you be choosing or will I?

466
00:32:41,381 --> 00:32:43,110
All right.

467
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:48,098
Her.

468
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:09,381
Nice and slow.

469
00:33:09,464 --> 00:33:11,589
You like it rough, don't you?

470
00:33:15,422 --> 00:33:17,528
Make her bleed.

471
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:26,200
I think she likes you, Mr. Milton.

472
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,764
Well, take her!

473
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:37,924
Yes, my love.

474
00:33:53,505 --> 00:33:55,186
Get up. Get up!

475
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:57,575
Ooh.

476
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,756
On your feet. Get up!

477
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,315
Come on, Mil, what you waiting for?

478
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,617
Come on, get up!

479
00:34:09,642 --> 00:34:11,144
On your feet.

480
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:14,869
Come on, my pretty.

481
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,266
Anne, get up.

482
00:34:49,062 --> 00:34:50,074
Move!

483
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:33,595
I would think some sort of
thanks might be in order.

484
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:38,547
Billy was more than ready to
throw you to the wolves out there.

485
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,797
And to be honest,

486
00:36:40,822 --> 00:36:44,530
I was undecided about whether to
go through with this deal at all.

487
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,758
Sure..

488
00:36:47,244 --> 00:36:50,411
I get my men back in exchange for you.

489
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:53,030
But something tells me...

490
00:36:53,348 --> 00:36:55,256
if I free you,

491
00:36:55,868 --> 00:36:59,222
you'll find a way to be
a problem for me again,

492
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:01,380
and soon.

493
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,340
Of course not.

494
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,068
Why would I do that?

495
00:37:12,256 --> 00:37:14,505
When you and I last saw each other...

496
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,945
you had every reason to see me killed.

497
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,173
Certainly would've solved
a lot of problems for you.

498
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:29,381
And yet you didn't.

499
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:33,381
Why?

500
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,439
You know,

501
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,907
I've had a rough few days owing to you.

502
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,380
I'd be angrier about it,

503
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:47,467
but I'm a little preoccupied
being angry with other people.

504
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:52,048
I just asked you a simple question.

505
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,454
Why didn't you kill me
when you had the chance?

506
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:02,566
It would have solved some problems.

507
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:07,308
It would have caused others
that I chose not to live with.

508
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,422
What sort of problems
would it have caused?

509
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:15,366
That I would have had to live with it.

510
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,526
You said you wished to send me away.

511
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,889
Somewhere where I couldn't return.

512
00:38:32,152 --> 00:38:33,992
Out of curiosity,

513
00:38:34,634 --> 00:38:36,960
how were you planning to manage that?

514
00:38:41,048 --> 00:38:43,381
When Anne was recruiting
spies in Port Royal,

515
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:46,062
she met a man with an
estate in the wilderness,

516
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:48,211
north of Spanish Florida.

517
00:38:48,808 --> 00:38:51,381
A reform-minded man...

518
00:38:51,422 --> 00:38:54,631
who uses convicts as laborers.

519
00:38:54,944 --> 00:38:58,857
Convicts he solicits
from prisons in England

520
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:03,230
where their treatment
is far less humane.

521
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:06,574
This man, we were told,
found it profitable

522
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,353
to offer his services
to wealthy families,

523
00:39:09,505 --> 00:39:12,881
some of the most prominent
in London on occasion,

524
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:16,704
with a need to make troublesome
family members disappear.

525
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:19,372
Cared for,

526
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:21,358
tended to,

527
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,435
but never to be seen
or heard from again.

528
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:27,822
What families?

529
00:39:28,886 --> 00:39:30,689
What families?

530
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:33,996
Do you know what families
in London made use of this?

531
00:39:35,964 --> 00:39:38,048
I have no idea.

532
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:43,239
They're ready.

533
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:24,911
Billy told me I should worry...

534
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:27,673
that you will be Madi's end.

535
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:30,871
That's all he wanted
in exchange for Max.

536
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:33,381
For me to sit still...

537
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:36,380
while he warned me that your commitment

538
00:40:36,381 --> 00:40:39,650
to the greatest possible
victory in this war of ours...

539
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:44,381
would consume her and
eventually lead to her death.

540
00:40:46,256 --> 00:40:47,714
Well, that's a smart
thing for him to say

541
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:50,482
if his intent is to split us apart.

542
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:53,797
I suppose we should've
expected nothing less.

543
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,565
Do I need to be concerned

544
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,549
that you took almost two
hours to tell me about it?

545
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:08,381
We are at our least rational...

546
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:11,802
when we're at our most vulnerable.

547
00:41:13,422 --> 00:41:15,214
If nothing else, this is a good reminder

548
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,363
that without a doubt

549
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,497
she is the point at which
I'm my most vulnerable.

550
00:41:24,189 --> 00:41:26,672
The thought of losing her...

551
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:33,231
I see.

552
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:37,992
If we assume...

553
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,173
that we are on the verge

554
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,984
of some impossible victory here,

555
00:41:43,464 --> 00:41:45,881
a truly significant thing...

556
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:51,014
if we assume that is real
and here for the taking...

557
00:41:53,216 --> 00:41:56,881
wouldn't you trade it all to
have Thomas Hamilton back again?

558
00:42:02,298 --> 00:42:04,422
I think if he knew how close we were

559
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:07,464
to the victory he gave
his life to achieve...

560
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:10,923
he wouldn't want me to.

561
00:42:13,422 --> 00:42:14,881
I see.

562
00:42:16,381 --> 00:42:18,867
Though, that wasn't really
what I asked, was it?

563
00:42:22,861 --> 00:42:27,595
Assume his father was just
as dark as you say, but...

564
00:42:28,483 --> 00:42:31,872
was unable to murder his own son,

565
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:34,260
assume he found a way...

566
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,071
- to secret Thomas away from London...
- He didn't.

567
00:42:40,048 --> 00:42:43,340
Would you trade this war to make it so?

568
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:48,873
It is some kind of hell

569
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:52,635
to be forced to choose one
irreplaceable thing over another.

570
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:58,991
And while Billy's motive to
separate us is painfully transparent,

571
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:01,422
it took me two hours
to tell you about it

572
00:43:01,505 --> 00:43:05,618
because try as I may to get the
conversation out of my head...

573
00:43:07,814 --> 00:43:09,786
I just can't seem to do it.

574
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:14,861
The closer we get to
the end of this journey,

575
00:43:14,886 --> 00:43:17,219
the more the contradictions
will accumulate...

576
00:43:20,158 --> 00:43:23,030
confusing issues we
once thought were clear.

577
00:43:25,626 --> 00:43:28,062
I suppose the good news
is that's how we'll know

578
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,756
we're finally getting
somewhere interesting.

579
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:34,381
- All clear!
- Clear the fort!

580
00:43:53,995 --> 00:43:55,745
Close the gate!

581
00:44:31,631 --> 00:44:33,714
What can I do for you, ma'am?

582
00:44:39,154 --> 00:44:41,048
Why are they still in chains?

583
00:44:41,073 --> 00:44:43,990
We freed the ones that understood
we came as friends here,

584
00:44:44,217 --> 00:44:45,979
not as enemies.

585
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:50,048
But some, it seemed, bore us ill will

586
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:53,014
over some of the consequences
of our victory here.

587
00:45:02,923 --> 00:45:04,380
You have to know,

588
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:06,839
it is important to ask
to repair the alliance

589
00:45:06,864 --> 00:45:09,372
between Captain Flint's people and ours.

590
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:11,928
Important to me.

591
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:14,048
After you fled,

592
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:17,255
the pirates sent warnings
to the other estates that...

593
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,201
any violence done to the slaves

594
00:45:19,226 --> 00:45:21,380
in their possession
for what happened here

595
00:45:21,381 --> 00:45:23,298
would be answered.

596
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:31,493
The next morning, an
answer was left by the gate.

597
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,380
A sack filled with fingers.

598
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,936
White fingers.

599
00:45:41,797 --> 00:45:44,714
Reprisals were visited
upon our loved ones

600
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:46,447
upon the Edwards estate.

601
00:45:48,048 --> 00:45:50,372
Reprisals of the cruelest kind

602
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,793
intended to instill fear,

603
00:45:53,872 --> 00:45:56,923
break spirits, reassert control.

604
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,455
It did not have the intended effect.

605
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:05,740
They revolted.

606
00:46:06,038 --> 00:46:08,814
One of the men there started it.

607
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:11,381
A man named Julius.

608
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:15,131
Now he's forming an army out there,

609
00:46:15,362 --> 00:46:18,380
organizing, building strength,

610
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:22,735
an army with designs on
taking and holding Nassau.

611
00:46:24,873 --> 00:46:27,797
But with as much anger
towards the pirates

612
00:46:27,881 --> 00:46:31,547
and anyone who would call
himself friend to a pirate

613
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:34,139
as they do towards the English.

614
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:40,380
That is why they are still in chains,

615
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:43,756
out of fear that they might
rise up and join Julius's army

616
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,923
before ever submitting to yours.

617
00:46:46,006 --> 00:46:47,589
We tried to prevent the reprisals

618
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:48,923
the moment we learned of them,

619
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,282
Captain Flint and I.

620
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,766
- They must know that.
- They know.

621
00:46:53,115 --> 00:46:55,589
But they also know that
when it comes to these men,

622
00:46:55,672 --> 00:46:59,012
neither you nor Captain Flint
are fully in control of them.

623
00:47:01,464 --> 00:47:04,036
Then we will get control of them.

624
00:47:06,028 --> 00:47:09,589
You must see by now that when
you wage war on the world,

625
00:47:09,614 --> 00:47:11,364
the world fights back.

626
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:14,639
Your mother knew that.

627
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,380
Knew that the best one can do

628
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:19,672
is to find a place you can protect,

629
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:22,896
build a wall, and save who you can.

630
00:47:23,788 --> 00:47:26,896
You'd be wise to learn from her example.

631
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:46,822
I'm sorry for what happened today.

632
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,223
The moment I realized
what was about to happen,

633
00:47:49,248 --> 00:47:51,248
I sent men to find you.

634
00:47:56,381 --> 00:47:59,631
I'm just thankful we were
able to get you in time.

635
00:48:00,763 --> 00:48:02,755
You are sorry...

636
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:06,544
for what happened today.

637
00:48:08,683 --> 00:48:10,923
What happened today...

638
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,306
was exactly what I have
been warning you about

639
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:17,961
from the moment you and your
husband first arrived here.

640
00:48:17,986 --> 00:48:19,405
Again...

641
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,927
and again, and again.

642
00:48:23,612 --> 00:48:25,756
That the decisions
you made at every turn

643
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,381
would eventually lead us to this.

644
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:32,677
Everything I have is gone...

645
00:48:32,902 --> 00:48:34,408
because of it.

646
00:48:37,256 --> 00:48:39,380
If you wish to apologize,

647
00:48:40,086 --> 00:48:42,183
what happened today...

648
00:48:42,573 --> 00:48:44,929
does not begin to cover it.

649
00:48:49,381 --> 00:48:51,381
Where would we have gone?

650
00:48:53,256 --> 00:48:54,703
What?

651
00:48:57,592 --> 00:49:00,597
A long time ago, you asked
me to leave Nassau with you

652
00:49:00,622 --> 00:49:02,381
to avoid ruin.

653
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:05,304
If I had said yes,
where would we have gone?

654
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,175
I have no idea.

655
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:13,095
I was so close to saying yes.

656
00:49:14,797 --> 00:49:17,959
There were good reasons
to say yes and...

657
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,356
I heard it in my mind,

658
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:23,340
tried to speak it over and over again.

659
00:49:23,943 --> 00:49:26,687
But when the moment finally came...

660
00:49:29,256 --> 00:49:32,381
I had put so much of
myself into this place,

661
00:49:32,422 --> 00:49:36,214
in that moment, I honestly didn't
know where I ended and it began.

662
00:49:39,048 --> 00:49:43,707
There may be ways of severing
oneself in that way...

663
00:49:45,256 --> 00:49:48,747
sacrificing one part to save the other.

664
00:49:50,422 --> 00:49:52,185
But...

665
00:49:52,353 --> 00:49:54,053
in that moment...

666
00:49:56,422 --> 00:50:00,422
I honestly couldn't find something
sharp enough to make the cut.

667
00:50:04,683 --> 00:50:06,982
What would have been enough?

668
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:19,298
I truly am sorry.

669
00:50:20,381 --> 00:50:21,957
For all of it.

670
00:50:23,116 --> 00:50:26,602
If there was a way I could
make things right here,

671
00:50:26,627 --> 00:50:28,586
I'd do it.

672
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,414
But now,

673
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,684
given everything you have
seen here in recent months...

674
00:50:37,006 --> 00:50:39,381
can you honestly say that you believe

675
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:42,801
that Nassau will ever really
be what you wanted it to be?

676
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:49,269
Neither can I.

677
00:50:53,177 --> 00:50:57,518
But there may be a way that we
can take something from it...

678
00:50:58,939 --> 00:51:00,756
if you'll help me.

679
00:51:04,414 --> 00:51:05,659
What is it?

680
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:07,923
Sails have been spotted on the horizon.

681
00:51:08,006 --> 00:51:09,381
Sails?

682
00:51:09,464 --> 00:51:11,247
Whose sails?

683
00:51:18,214 --> 00:51:19,803
The Revenge?

684
00:51:19,828 --> 00:51:21,380
Are we certain?

685
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:23,239
She's a man-of-war and she approaches

686
00:51:23,264 --> 00:51:25,350
from Captain Teach's
last sighted position.

687
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:28,923
If it were Teach returning,

688
00:51:29,164 --> 00:51:31,639
wouldn't he be flying his
banner as he approached?

689
00:51:38,019 --> 00:51:39,977
Sails on the horizon!

690
00:51:41,652 --> 00:51:43,131
They are saying there are no signs

691
00:51:43,214 --> 00:51:45,380
of a prize ship anywhere on the water.

692
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,464
So, at least it is unlikely

693
00:51:47,547 --> 00:51:50,743
Captain Teach caught the
governor's sloop before returning.

694
00:51:51,616 --> 00:51:54,295
Teach would never have
given up so quickly.

695
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,380
If it is his ship,

696
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,433
then in all likelihood, the
governor's ship was captured.

697
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,380
Ma'am?

698
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:06,553
Perhaps you would like to wait below...

699
00:52:07,498 --> 00:52:10,053
in case the news is not what we hope.

700
00:52:10,284 --> 00:52:11,992
She's raising a banner.

701
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,380
British colors.

702
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,460
She's flying the governor's banner!

703
00:52:18,631 --> 00:52:20,818
And those are his signs!

704
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:22,589
It's him!

705
00:52:44,006 --> 00:52:45,797
Make a course towards the fort.

706
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:48,714
As close as we can get.

707
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:50,714
Ready the men.

708
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:52,547
We'll make our landing under
cover of the fort's guns,

709
00:52:52,572 --> 00:52:54,848
reinforce them, and
move to retake Nassau.

710
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,380
Ma'am?

711
00:53:06,381 --> 00:53:08,381
Shall I begin moving
the guns to the beach?

712
00:53:10,763 --> 00:53:12,097
Yes.

713
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:13,547
Yes, of course.

714
00:53:13,781 --> 00:53:15,697
Let me know when it's done.

715
00:53:24,464 --> 00:53:26,342
Heave!

716
00:53:26,714 --> 00:53:29,006
Heave!

717
00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:30,549
Ready?

718
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:34,292
They will all be preparing
for the fight ahead of us.

719
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:38,926
Would you like to tell me what
it is you are preparing to do?

720
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:53,898
An hour, maybe less,

721
00:53:53,923 --> 00:53:56,144
until his guns are in range of the
beach and he starts his landing.

722
00:53:56,169 --> 00:53:57,964
Once he can bring his broadsides to bear

723
00:53:57,989 --> 00:53:59,381
in concert with the fort's power,

724
00:53:59,422 --> 00:54:01,985
it'll be hard to keep
his men off the sand.

725
00:54:02,813 --> 00:54:04,799
Do we need to consider falling back?

726
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:05,964
No.

727
00:54:06,048 --> 00:54:09,023
If we leave Nassau now,
we may never get her back.

728
00:54:10,931 --> 00:54:13,014
My men can defend this beach.

729
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:23,380
We'll have the numbers.

730
00:54:23,381 --> 00:54:24,781
The first barrage, maybe.

731
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:26,547
But as soon as those
soldiers hit the beach,

732
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:28,714
nine in 10 of ours will flee.

733
00:54:28,797 --> 00:54:32,173
With Nassau at stake, that's
not a gamble I'm willing to take.

734
00:54:32,256 --> 00:54:33,975
What choice do we have?

735
00:54:34,046 --> 00:54:36,254
Well, that's a very good question.

736
00:55:26,503 --> 00:55:29,311
Should this fight above us come to pass,

737
00:55:29,582 --> 00:55:33,256
at best, the outcome is not certain.

738
00:55:33,911 --> 00:55:35,609
But what is certain

739
00:55:35,634 --> 00:55:39,062
is that many will die
and much will be lost.

740
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,036
I think we've all seen
our fair share of loss

741
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:45,923
and I have had enough of it.

742
00:55:47,422 --> 00:55:51,163
So, I'd like to ensure that
this fight does not come to pass.

743
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:54,505
How do you suggest we do that?

744
00:55:54,805 --> 00:55:58,631
I am prepared to surrender the
governor's remaining forces to you...

745
00:55:59,017 --> 00:56:00,716
control of the fort,

746
00:56:00,747 --> 00:56:02,858
its guns, its magazine,

747
00:56:02,938 --> 00:56:05,505
the unconditional release of
the remainder of your prisoners.

748
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:07,113
All of it.

749
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:10,714
- You're prepared to do all of that?
- Yes.

750
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:14,176
In exchange for what?

751
00:56:15,523 --> 00:56:18,144
In exchange for the cache.

752
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:25,116
The chest with the remains
of the Urca treasure.

753
00:56:25,141 --> 00:56:27,214
I'm told it is hidden...

754
00:56:27,298 --> 00:56:28,931
buried in a secret place known only

755
00:56:28,956 --> 00:56:31,430
to Captain Rackham and the two of you.

756
00:56:32,938 --> 00:56:34,422
I get the cache,

757
00:56:34,447 --> 00:56:37,740
and guaranteed safe passage off the
island for everyone in this fort...

758
00:56:39,256 --> 00:56:41,380
and you get Nassau.

759
00:56:42,285 --> 00:56:44,471
The money isn't ours to give.

760
00:56:45,256 --> 00:56:47,380
We have partners who
would almost certainly

761
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:50,203
rather fight this out
than lose their treasury.

762
00:56:50,228 --> 00:56:52,714
Your partners are your problem.

763
00:56:52,797 --> 00:56:55,697
There is a reason why I
invited you here and not them.

764
00:56:55,832 --> 00:56:58,505
As soon as the governor's
ship is in range of the beach,

765
00:56:58,589 --> 00:57:01,006
this offer disappears.

766
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:05,100
I will not undermine his
position once the shooting starts.

767
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:10,214
So, right now in this moment,

768
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:13,048
what do you want to do?

769
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:19,036
How?

770
00:57:20,778 --> 00:57:22,340
How would you see it done?

771
00:57:22,381 --> 00:57:24,340
One of you surrenders himself

772
00:57:24,381 --> 00:57:28,089
and remains here to ensure
these terms are honored.

773
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,571
You send someone to retrieve the cache,

774
00:57:31,596 --> 00:57:34,131
and once it arrives, I
take possession of it.

775
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:36,381
And my people exit the fort

776
00:57:36,464 --> 00:57:38,505
to a transport waiting
to take us away from here.

777
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:40,835
The answer is no.

778
00:57:41,097 --> 00:57:43,356
Absolutely no.

779
00:57:43,676 --> 00:57:45,643
If she thought she could win this fight,

780
00:57:45,668 --> 00:57:47,866
why would she be offering
to sell the victory to us

781
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:49,308
even for a fortune?

782
00:57:55,131 --> 00:57:57,381
I have had enough of this.

783
00:57:58,881 --> 00:58:01,261
And I am ready for it to end.

784
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,277
No.

785
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,505
Trust me.

786
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:52,907
