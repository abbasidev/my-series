1
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:13,818
It's lost. For the moment,
Nassau town is lost.

2
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:15,356
That much is painfully clear.

3
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,513
It is our duty now to
secure ourselves here.

4
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:19,194
I think we're all properly angry

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,484
about what he did on
the Underhill estate,

6
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:25,097
but Billy has influence
that is best not ignored.

7
00:00:25,196 --> 00:00:29,077
Billy told me I should worry
that you will be Madi's end.

8
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:31,335
After you fled, reprisals were visited

9
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:33,971
upon our loved ones
upon the Edwards estate.

10
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:36,408
I wonder, ma'am, if he
might want you to leave

11
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:39,276
when he learns of your
current state of being.

12
00:00:39,377 --> 00:00:42,079
She's flying the
governor's banner. It's him!

13
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:44,616
Ready the men. We'll make our landing
under cover of the fort's guns,

14
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:46,618
reinforce them, and
move to retake Nassau.

15
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:49,887
I am prepared to surrender the
governor's remaining forces to you,

16
00:00:49,987 --> 00:00:51,889
control of the fort, all of it,

17
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,525
in exchange for the cache.

18
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,728
- No.
- Trust me.

19
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:23,149
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

20
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:21,573
Give me a hand with this chest.

21
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,761
Where have you been?

22
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:53,204
And where's Flint?

23
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:56,294
In a moment, a woman I don't know

24
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:58,496
is going to walk out of that fort.

25
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:00,298
She's going to move towards a longboat

26
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:01,832
in which we'll have placed two men

27
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:04,268
to row her to Governor Rogers' ship.

28
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,703
We have ensured that
she'll arrive unharmed

29
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:09,763
to deliver a message to the governor.

30
00:04:10,154 --> 00:04:12,300
We ensured?

31
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,368
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:14,468 --> 00:04:17,071
When and why did we decide to do that?

33
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:19,107
Because Captain Flint
has offered himself

34
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:23,011
as collateral to Eleanor
Guthrie inside the fort.

35
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:26,037
If we breach our pledge, he dies.

36
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:30,051
Collateral?

37
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:31,852
What the fuck are you talking about?

38
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,615
To guarantee our compliance...

39
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:38,159
as part of a bargain
in which the British

40
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:41,129
will be surrendering
their position in Nassau.

41
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:45,339
Every man on the beach
will need to be told.

42
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:49,113
Pass the word.

43
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:50,806
Now.

44
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:57,245
I would appreciate it
if you'd double check...

45
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:00,714
- ... the transport.
- Yes, ma'am.

46
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:04,756
There are some supplies that I would
like to be transported over, too.

47
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:06,451
Thank you.

48
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,190
Go and find Mrs. Hannah.

49
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,881
She'll know what to do.

50
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,431
No one will harm you out there.

51
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,550
How can you be so sure?

52
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:23,271
Because they know if anything
happens to you, Flint dies.

53
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:26,895
No one is going to test me to
see if I'm serious about that.

54
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:32,980
When you get to the
ship, when you get to him,

55
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:34,984
you know what to say to him.

56
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,744
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:40,121
And you know what not to say to him.

58
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:43,224
If he balks about leaving,

59
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:45,674
which he is almost certain to do...

60
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:47,695
it might help if he knew

61
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:51,010
it wasn't just your welfare
that was in question.

62
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,697
I won't have him learning
about it like this.

63
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:56,846
I just won't.

64
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,424
I understand.

65
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:07,883
You should be going.

66
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:04,865
Eleanor Guthrie...

67
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:09,510
Eleanor Guthrie told you
she'd surrender the fort

68
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,212
and all of Nassau with it

69
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:14,988
if Flint agreed to act as her
hostage to guarantee the deal?

70
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:20,332
Are you really gonna make me ask?

71
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:24,425
It wasn't all she got.

72
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:28,573
What else did she get?

73
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,864
It was agreed...

74
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:33,033
that in addition to guaranteeing

75
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:34,472
the safe departure from the island

76
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:36,495
of her and all her people...

77
00:07:37,838 --> 00:07:40,073
that we would retrieve
and surrender to her

78
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:43,079
the cache of gems remaining
from the Urca gold.

79
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,390
It guarantees a quick victory

80
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:50,951
to a fight we'd otherwise be
far from guaranteed to win.

81
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:53,204
Guaranteed?

82
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:55,712
When is anything ever...?

83
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,627
- And you agreed to this?
- I didn't agree to anything.

84
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:02,330
The offer was put to Captain
Flint. He had little time to decide.

85
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,368
I trust his judgment.

86
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:27,321
They're right in our path.

87
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:32,893
What do you want to do?

88
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,448
I have this.

89
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,112
What the hell is this?

90
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:47,988
Mrs. Rogers has asked
me to relay a message

91
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:51,058
- that is of the utmost importance.
- I should certainly hope it is.

92
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:54,129
- She intends to surrender her position.
- What?

93
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:56,650
She has negotiated an
arrangement with Captain Flint

94
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,588
in which he will pay for this
surrender with the stolen cache of gems

95
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:03,253
to secure your future together.

96
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,125
She asks that you withdraw

97
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,318
to allow for this
transaction to proceed,

98
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:11,197
retire to Port Royal for a
fortnight and await her arrival.

99
00:09:11,222 --> 00:09:13,189
- If she has not arrived...
- Someone clear that launch.

100
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:14,723
Mr. Molin, get us underway. We proceed.

101
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:16,166
- Prepare to make our landing.
- My Lord.

102
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:17,690
Clear away that launch.

103
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:19,315
Prepare for landing!

104
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:25,145
Is the governor still approaching?

105
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,704
He is, ma'am.

106
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:39,240
If I wanted to fire a warning shot,

107
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:41,577
how close would I have to
aim for it to be effective?

108
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:44,358
How close?

109
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,934
I'm not interested in holing his ship,

110
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:49,758
but need him to understand
that I am committed to this.

111
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,667
What's the distance to his ship?

112
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:55,995
What's the distance
to the governor's ship?

113
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:58,013
1,200 yards, approximately.

114
00:09:58,038 --> 00:09:59,706
Closing.

115
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:04,161
I'd lead her by two ship lengths.

116
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:20,515
Continue our approach.

117
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,610
Again, please.

118
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:32,392
Ma'am.

119
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:34,818
Again, please.

120
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:39,134
Reload.

121
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:42,956
I beg your pardon, my Lord,

122
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:45,826
but she demanded that
I relay what follows...

123
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:47,953
her words precisely...

124
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:50,598
in spite of any protest you offered.

125
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:56,032
She says she knows
that you will be angry

126
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,321
and that this will be hard
for you to understand...

127
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:01,776
... but she said...

128
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,196
She said you should trust
that her commitment to you

129
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:18,123
remains inviolable...

130
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:21,962
and that this is no betrayal...

131
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,623
but an act of love.

132
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:29,960
And an act she is determined

133
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:31,835
to see through to its end.

134
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:48,607
Mr. Molin.

135
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:54,024
Come hard to starboard and make
your course north-northwest.

136
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:57,036
- Sir?
- Stand down the gun crews.

137
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:03,172
Hard to starboard.

138
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:05,515
Set course north-northwest.

139
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:07,517
Stand down the gun crews.

140
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:09,849
Set course for north-northwest.

141
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,351
Thank you.

142
00:12:58,063 --> 00:12:59,665
Are you all right?

143
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,435
I am.

144
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:06,961
What happened?

145
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,918
I heard the governor
took Captain Teach's ship

146
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:11,611
and threatened an invasion.

147
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:14,720
Why now does he sail away?

148
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:19,137
Flint just agreed to trade the cache

149
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:21,246
in exchange for a complete surrender.

150
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,499
To trade it?

151
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:25,771
- All of it?
- All of it.

152
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:27,546
The money that was to be our treasury

153
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:31,312
upon which the viability of this
entire enterprise was premised.

154
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:35,005
If this bargain
consummates, it will be gone.

155
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:47,575
So much to give up.

156
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,309
But I think he made the right decision.

157
00:13:58,193 --> 00:14:01,605
Controlling Nassau without
the cache will be a challenge,

158
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,503
but one I don't think can be avoided.

159
00:14:06,474 --> 00:14:07,975
You're kidding me!

160
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:10,244
No.

161
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:13,302
Are you kidding me?

162
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,654
You did not see what I saw
at the Underhill estate.

163
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,256
There has been immeasurable,
unspeakable suffering on this island

164
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:29,583
as a result of Billy's actions.

165
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:31,472
Whatever trust may have been

166
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:34,573
between the slaves here
and our alliance is gone.

167
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:37,504
This enterprise is on
the verge of collapse

168
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:40,871
and it cannot withstand a fight
against the governor's men right now.

169
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:44,074
What price can be too
high to prevent it?

170
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:48,139
Drastic measures will need to be taken

171
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:51,206
of which, I'm afraid, this
will only be the first.

172
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:54,007
What is that supposed to mean?

173
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:58,456
The damage done to this
alliance was caused by Billy.

174
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:01,934
It may be that the only
way to repair this damage

175
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:05,098
is to remove that which caused it.

176
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:07,909
Remove him?

177
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:11,485
It will be the only way to regain
the trust of those slave communities

178
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,158
uncertain about what
this alliance stands for.

179
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:18,196
And you know as well as I

180
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:21,089
Billy cannot exist alongside
Captain Flint for long.

181
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:23,781
Sooner or later, one
or the other must go.

182
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,321
If we win Nassau even through surrender,

183
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:28,415
we are still going
to have to control it.

184
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:31,151
Without the resources
afforded by the cache

185
00:15:31,176 --> 00:15:33,065
or the force supplied
by Billy and his men,

186
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:35,130
how the fuck do you imagine
we're going to do that?

187
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:36,883
We will struggle through it,

188
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:40,102
train men, gain
strength through numbers,

189
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:42,059
hunt for that which we need.

190
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:44,973
It will be difficult.

191
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:48,879
But since when did we expect
this would be anything else?

192
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:54,748
What?

193
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:57,752
Jesus.

194
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:01,972
You sound exactly like him.

195
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,389
Why is this a problem?

196
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:15,234
Where are you going?

197
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:18,730
I have a siege to manage, for which
I'm going to need Billy's help.

198
00:16:18,755 --> 00:16:19,789
Wait!

199
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:26,129
Billy was your friend.

200
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:29,974
This is not easy for me,

201
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:32,121
but I know it is harder for you.

202
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:34,760
Please.

203
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,326
Don't forget that I know that.

204
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:45,378
I haven't.

205
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,895
If this goes away,

206
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:57,270
Flint's war,

207
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:01,301
if it all ended and we
had to walk away from it...

208
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:05,683
Walk away?

209
00:17:08,538 --> 00:17:10,673
... would I be enough for you?

210
00:17:16,198 --> 00:17:19,160
You know what? You don't
have to answer that.

211
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:22,604
We'll send Kofi to retrieve the cache.

212
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:24,639
Your mother will trust him.

213
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,693
No news from outside the walls?

214
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:24,107
A ketch was seen departing
the day before last.

215
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:26,235
We were told it was sent
to retrieve the cache,

216
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:27,826
but since then, nothing.

217
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:38,716
He's dead, isn't he?

218
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:41,609
Mr. Scott.

219
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:48,641
Were you with him?

220
00:18:49,277 --> 00:18:52,781
I've heard about his role
amongst your maroon allies.

221
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:57,266
Were you with him before he died?

222
00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:59,438
I was.

223
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:04,532
I've been told that he departed the
island before all of this started.

224
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:07,831
That he killed two
soldiers in the process.

225
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:11,183
Everyone assumed he'd turned,

226
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:13,382
that somehow one of you had turned him,

227
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:15,717
but that isn't what happened, is it?

228
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,656
No, it isn't.

229
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,530
For how long had he been
secretly aiding them?

230
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,836
He began, he said,
after the Spanish raid.

231
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,708
Did he say why he did it?

232
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:44,130
He told me that he feared for the
safety of his wife and his daughter,

233
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:48,333
so he had them transported
to a place they'd be safe.

234
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,386
They weren't killed in the raid?

235
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:56,585
Are they still alive?

236
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:59,835
Yes, they are.

237
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:18,747
For so long, I thought
I knew what I was.

238
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,550
A daughter who usurped her father.

239
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,324
A woman who had taken
control of a wild place.

240
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:36,365
Scott was proof of that.

241
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:38,867
The one who saw me that way, too,

242
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:40,627
who substantiated it.

243
00:20:42,957 --> 00:20:46,292
And all that time, all he
saw was a girl so ambitious...

244
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:50,011
she would never doubt his story.

245
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:57,344
So, she would continue to play the part.

246
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:02,391
Draw everyone's attention
away from himself.

247
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:07,496
You did do all those things.

248
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:09,423
I know I did.

249
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,399
But always with a man behind me

250
00:21:13,424 --> 00:21:16,059
doing his damnedest to
bend it all to his benefit.

251
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,944
My father, Scott, Charles, you.

252
00:21:25,814 --> 00:21:28,583
So many goddamn men here.

253
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:31,520
Too many goddamn men here.

254
00:21:31,545 --> 00:21:33,413
Woodes Rogers.

255
00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:38,113
He's really so different
from the rest of us?

256
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:17,435
There's very little I
wouldn't do to protect my wife.

257
00:22:21,196 --> 00:22:22,934
Of course, my Lord.

258
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:27,717
I had concerns when we
first arrived in Nassau,

259
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:29,978
and I told her as much...

260
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:36,408
that the instincts that had allowed
her to survive for so long there,

261
00:22:36,951 --> 00:22:38,567
to thrive there,

262
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,789
would eventually return.

263
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:45,789
And that when they did, it
would cause conflict between us.

264
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:51,666
I don't believe that's
what's happened, my Lord.

265
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:56,793
You don't?

266
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:01,102
She's done this out of devotion to you.

267
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:04,958
There's no doubt in my mind about that.

268
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:07,549
No, I don't doubt it either.

269
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,885
I know she has no love for Flint,

270
00:23:12,053 --> 00:23:14,537
nor any sympathy for his cause.

271
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:18,392
I fear the instincts
that have awoken in her...

272
00:23:18,624 --> 00:23:21,468
are more insidious than that.

273
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:25,166
She has begun to believe again

274
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:28,369
that disorder in Nassau is inevitable,

275
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:31,072
that civilization is powerless,

276
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:33,615
either through lack of will

277
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,343
or capacity to do anything about it.

278
00:23:42,843 --> 00:23:45,077
Civilization...

279
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:48,795
has a number of faces.

280
00:23:50,324 --> 00:23:52,659
To think them all powerless

281
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,795
to alter Nassau's future...

282
00:23:57,098 --> 00:23:59,100
is a terrible mistake.

283
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:04,308
Yes?

284
00:24:06,173 --> 00:24:07,908
Harbor patrol is deploying.

285
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,238
We've arrived.

286
00:24:13,614 --> 00:24:14,981
Harbor patrol?

287
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:16,817
My Lord, where are we?

288
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:25,590
There is very little...

289
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:27,980
I wouldn't do to protect my wife.

290
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:49,178
What the hell have you done?

291
00:24:52,486 --> 00:24:56,523
If the British Empire will not aid
us in fighting our present enemy,

292
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:58,967
perhaps a different empire will.

293
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:02,286
Strike our colors.

294
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:05,432
Raise the white flag and make
a course to enter the harbor.

295
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:07,168
Strike our colors!

296
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:09,170
Raise the white flag!

297
00:25:09,236 --> 00:25:10,978
Strike our colors!

298
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:12,463
Raise the white flag!

299
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:56,736
If they fire on us...

300
00:25:57,918 --> 00:26:00,554
we'll be sunk before we
get our gunports open.

301
00:26:01,888 --> 00:26:03,524
They won't fire on us.

302
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:06,393
I beg your pardon, sir,

303
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:08,295
but we're at war.

304
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,040
Why wouldn't they?

305
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,842
The most recognizable British
governor in the New World

306
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,597
is attempting to sail a man-of-war

307
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:18,784
requesting parley into
the port of Havana.

308
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,011
If you were them,

309
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:24,984
wouldn't you want to know why?

310
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:37,563
Your contact?

311
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:40,243
Juan Antonio Grandal.

312
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,329
Colonial Intelligence.

313
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:57,711
_

314
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:00,284
_

315
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:06,870
_

316
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,784
_

317
00:27:11,753 --> 00:27:14,182
_

318
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:35,557
_

319
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:40,737
_

320
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:46,710
_

321
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:49,951
_

322
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:54,124
_

323
00:27:54,678 --> 00:27:56,487
_

324
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,659
_

325
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:14,172
That's the Walrus.

326
00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:18,625
Everything we've put
that ship through...

327
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,570
and she just refuses to die.

328
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:28,090
It's fucking unnatural.

329
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:38,645
They'll all follow you.

330
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:42,174
You know that, don't you?

331
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:44,670
Flint thinks these people would run

332
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:46,763
when confronted by the governor's men.

333
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:50,824
He's so convinced they won't
stand behind you and fight,

334
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:53,519
he's ready to hand over the
cache to avoid the outcome.

335
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:56,323
And he's wrong.

336
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,791
You're exactly what I hoped you'd be.

337
00:29:03,464 --> 00:29:05,666
A rational man to lead Nassau.

338
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,405
That's the first in recent memory.

339
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:13,462
And one that they'd allow to lead
them into a rational future...

340
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:16,912
This doesn't have anything to
do with reason, and you know it.

341
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:20,122
You want them following me
only to the extent that I,

342
00:29:20,147 --> 00:29:22,497
in turn, will follow you.

343
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:24,598
I'm a convenience...

344
00:29:24,874 --> 00:29:27,387
designed to aid you
in ruling over Nassau

345
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:30,738
with the same uncompromising
grip you'd vilify from Flint.

346
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:34,378
If I choose to side with him,

347
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,732
trade the cache for
the fort and his life,

348
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:39,227
are you honestly suggesting
you'd let it happen?

349
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:40,836
That you wouldn't use your men

350
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:43,939
to force a scenario by
which he ends up dead?

351
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:48,344
I'm not gonna stand by and watch

352
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,037
while all our futures are destroyed.

353
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:51,530
No.

354
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:56,255
But perhaps it's worth
focusing on how hard I'm working

355
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,283
to persuade you not
to make that decision.

356
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:03,465
I would far, far rather do
this with you than against you.

357
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:07,377
And I have faith you can see
what is abundantly clear here.

358
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:10,737
We have Nassau.

359
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:14,104
We have a ship with which
to hunt and acquire more.

360
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:17,004
And when that cache arrives, we
will have the money to govern it all.

361
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,265
We made a deal, Billy.

362
00:30:19,545 --> 00:30:21,990
We gave our word to Madi,

363
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:23,373
her mother, their people

364
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:25,150
that we were all
committed to the same war.

365
00:30:25,175 --> 00:30:27,610
That's Flint's deal, not mine.

366
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,323
And not yours.

367
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:32,325
Their people need a place to call home?

368
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:33,592
Here it is.

369
00:30:33,692 --> 00:30:35,428
And we are contemplating
throwing it away

370
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:36,920
to continue a war that,

371
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:40,248
sooner or later, is
guaranteed to end in defeat.

372
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,506
You know I'm right.

373
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:47,151
You know I'm right.

374
00:30:56,682 --> 00:30:58,684
Slow them down.

375
00:30:59,117 --> 00:31:00,886
The sooner that ship's afloat,

376
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:02,388
the sooner they'll all want to hunt,

377
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:04,182
and we need them on the beach.

378
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:06,925
Consider it done.

379
00:31:58,687 --> 00:32:01,157
I would like to be alone.

380
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:06,394
All right.

381
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:10,756
You'd like to be a part of this?

382
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,992
What would you do?

383
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:29,662
Sooner or later, that
cache is going to arrive,

384
00:32:29,942 --> 00:32:32,044
and there'll be no more delaying.

385
00:32:34,595 --> 00:32:36,564
I'm committed to Flint.

386
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,499
I'm committed to Madi.

387
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,269
Yet the road they intend to travel

388
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:43,938
is one I'm losing the
ability to understand.

389
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:46,167
I know what Billy's done...

390
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:47,714
what should be unforgivable...

391
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:50,052
and yet till so very recently,

392
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:53,614
there's no one in the world
I called a closer friend.

393
00:32:57,252 --> 00:33:00,455
The more he talks, the
more I remember why.

394
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:09,089
To turn on him now,

395
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,269
to have him killed... which is what
it would take to side with Flint...

396
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:19,946
seems like something...

397
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,125
I don't know I have it in me to do.

398
00:33:24,945 --> 00:33:26,881
You don't know, hmm?

399
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,096
You don't know?

400
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,997
Why should I follow
you if you don't know?

401
00:33:34,022 --> 00:33:35,893
Why would anyone?

402
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:39,653
I don't give a shit
what goes on in there.

403
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:42,397
Fuck Flint. Don't fuck Flint.

404
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:44,475
Fuck Billy. Don't fuck Billy.

405
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,166
I don't give a shit what you choose,

406
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,202
but fucking choose!

407
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,538
And don't make me suffer the thinking.

408
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,585
Worry ain't a good look for a king,

409
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,380
not in a kingdom like this...

410
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,034
where loyalty is in short supply.

411
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:27,388
- Did you counsel him to come here?
- No.

412
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:30,805
But the urgency of his
situation demanded it.

413
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,002
It was a mistake.

414
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:10,307
Inglés?

415
00:36:18,204 --> 00:36:20,649
I think you know who I am.

416
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,177
I think you know what I am.

417
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:30,449
You and I are enemies as our
kings are at war with one another.

418
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,219
But their war...

419
00:36:35,464 --> 00:36:38,100
right now their war
is meaningless to me.

420
00:36:40,149 --> 00:36:43,919
I came to Nassau before it
began to foster commerce,

421
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:47,400
and toward that end, to
combat piracy, to defeat it.

422
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,685
That was my war.

423
00:36:50,403 --> 00:36:53,406
And I had that victory within my reach.

424
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:56,836
I had it.

425
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,514
But my enemy has remade
itself since then,

426
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:04,717
made allies with an army of maroons,

427
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:08,854
and has now dedicated itself to
disorder of the grandest scale.

428
00:37:08,954 --> 00:37:11,918
Inciting others... slaves, sailors,

429
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:13,777
wage laborers alike...

430
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:16,074
to join their fight and give their lives

431
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:19,135
to destroy the civilized world.

432
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:23,118
Labor fuels commerce

433
00:37:23,336 --> 00:37:25,871
and commerce fuels security.

434
00:37:25,971 --> 00:37:30,108
If these people are successful
in compromising the first,

435
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:33,812
there is no end to the damage
they can cause the rest.

436
00:37:35,614 --> 00:37:37,250
In this war...

437
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:41,086
you and I have far more
that unites our interests

438
00:37:41,254 --> 00:37:42,855
than separates them.

439
00:37:44,486 --> 00:37:47,092
For if Nassau falls,

440
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,227
if it becomes a dark symbol

441
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:52,331
of what mayhem these men can unleash,

442
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:56,754
a rallying cry that might be
heard throughout the New World...

443
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:01,760
how long before these same
men turn their eyes to Cuba?

444
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:04,620
To your plantations and your ships?

445
00:38:04,645 --> 00:38:08,426
How long before Spanish
slaves are emboldened by it

446
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:12,023
and set their eyes on you?

447
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:15,890
When you are forced to
write to King Philip,

448
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,825
begging his assistance

449
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:21,929
in staving off the army of slaves
and pirates on your doorstep...

450
00:38:23,363 --> 00:38:26,223
would you not wish in that moment...

451
00:38:26,546 --> 00:38:29,020
that you had this one back...

452
00:38:29,804 --> 00:38:33,811
when it was possible to kill
this monster in its cradle...

453
00:38:35,275 --> 00:38:39,614
cheap and quick and quiet?

454
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:51,514
I had a younger brother once.

455
00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:53,761
Simón.

456
00:38:54,895 --> 00:38:57,464
He was a midshipman

457
00:38:57,632 --> 00:39:00,554
aboard Nuestra Señora
de la Encarnación.

458
00:39:01,836 --> 00:39:04,242
Beneath a flag of surrender,

459
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:06,364
he was butchered.

460
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,223
And I'm told...

461
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:12,479
you likely wielded the sword...

462
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:14,412
personally.

463
00:39:15,391 --> 00:39:17,870
Am I misinformed?

464
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,721
No.

465
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:26,761
You are not my enemy,

466
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:29,539
because my king tells me so.

467
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:33,969
Don't insult me...

468
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:36,695
by suggesting otherwise.

469
00:39:42,743 --> 00:39:46,848
If the situation in
Nassau is as you say it is,

470
00:39:47,326 --> 00:39:49,433
why are you here?

471
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:53,637
Why are you not in
Williamsburg or Kingston,

472
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:56,031
seeking help from your own?

473
00:39:56,056 --> 00:39:57,587
I've tried.

474
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,614
They won't listen.

475
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:05,299
Maybe because they care more about
the war against Spain than I do.

476
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:09,136
Maybe because this just
isn't as personal to them

477
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:11,382
as it is for me or for you.

478
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,708
This is personal to me?

479
00:40:13,808 --> 00:40:15,209
Of course it is.

480
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:18,012
The pirates offered me
a cache of stolen gems

481
00:40:18,037 --> 00:40:20,632
to persuade me to surrender.

482
00:40:21,181 --> 00:40:24,051
The cache of gems representing
the last remaining share

483
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:26,353
of the Urca plunder.

484
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:32,659
They're paying for their
war with your money.

485
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,141
What is it you think
will come from this?

486
00:40:46,974 --> 00:40:50,023
You think I'll commit
men and sail with you?

487
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:54,051
To fight an insurgency
on your territory,

488
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:58,418
force my men to decipher
friend from enemy,

489
00:40:58,518 --> 00:41:01,155
amongst that sort of confusion?

490
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:06,894
My friends are all
besieged within Fort Nassau.

491
00:41:07,825 --> 00:41:09,867
My wife is there.

492
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:12,933
I'd beg you to spare them,

493
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:14,835
avoid the fort entirely.

494
00:41:14,935 --> 00:41:16,348
And in exchange,

495
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,043
the fort will offer no
resistance to your landing.

496
00:41:19,306 --> 00:41:21,241
Once you land,

497
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:24,211
once you are past the fort...

498
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:28,075
I envision no confusion.

499
00:41:29,516 --> 00:41:31,952
You needn't decipher anything.

500
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:37,594
I'd simply ask that you
burn it all to the ground.

501
00:41:54,234 --> 00:41:56,150
The ship was spotted on the horizon,

502
00:41:56,175 --> 00:41:58,275
approaching the rendezvous
beach from the south

503
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,803
and flying no colors.

504
00:41:59,828 --> 00:42:01,796
Kofi and his men are returning.

505
00:42:02,006 --> 00:42:04,008
The wind is dying out.

506
00:42:04,484 --> 00:42:06,854
The cache will be on the
sand in a few hours, at most.

507
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:13,127
Who knows they've arrived?

508
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:14,760
So far?

509
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:17,105
Him, you, and I.

510
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,857
That's it.

511
00:42:18,899 --> 00:42:21,869
Sooner or later, people
are going to know.

512
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:23,483
And we're gonna have to
give them instructions

513
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:26,633
about what happens to
that cache once it lands.

514
00:42:27,306 --> 00:42:29,574
There's no more putting off a decision.

515
00:42:31,938 --> 00:42:35,217
Giving up that money
is an impossibility.

516
00:42:36,725 --> 00:42:39,261
Flint will just keep
pushing for these things,

517
00:42:39,286 --> 00:42:43,014
costly things that we pay
for with our own suffering,

518
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:44,374
with our own lives.

519
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:46,235
You know this.

520
00:42:47,145 --> 00:42:49,114
You've always known this.

521
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:53,848
Sooner or later, it has to end.

522
00:42:56,588 --> 00:42:59,624
You send word to the fort
and tell them it's here.

523
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:03,275
Arrange for them to come out.
I'll have men waiting there.

524
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:05,563
I'll end it quickly.

525
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,683
All you have to do...

526
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:12,980
is look the other way.

527
00:43:18,902 --> 00:43:22,015
I don't want it happening
in full view of that beach.

528
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:32,023
Yeah.

529
00:43:49,495 --> 00:43:51,264
What was that?

530
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,655
It's arrived.

531
00:44:37,879 --> 00:44:39,648
The cache?

532
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:43,982
What else does it say?

533
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:49,414
It's across the island.

534
00:44:49,635 --> 00:44:52,705
Mr. Silver insists that we exit
through the northwest tunnel

535
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:56,334
where we'll be escorted over
land to the southern coast.

536
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:58,610
The transport will meet us there.

537
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:07,485
This wasn't part of the deal.

538
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:13,539
Sailing a fortune in
jewels into that harbor...

539
00:45:13,601 --> 00:45:16,911
in full view of a beach
filled with enraged pirates,

540
00:45:16,952 --> 00:45:19,403
you can understand his reluctance.

541
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:22,607
This way, there will be far less risk

542
00:45:22,632 --> 00:45:25,369
of anyone disturbing the exchange.

543
00:45:25,394 --> 00:45:27,591
I saw his face when
you accepted this deal,

544
00:45:27,616 --> 00:45:29,148
and I imagine you did, too.

545
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:30,653
If there is anyone on that beach

546
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:33,047
with a desire to disrupt this exchange,

547
00:45:33,154 --> 00:45:36,185
I'm concerned Mr. Silver
may be first among them.

548
00:45:37,158 --> 00:45:39,360
I'm not concerned.

549
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:46,973
Lieutenant Utley.

550
00:45:46,998 --> 00:45:49,401
Select six of your men to escort us.

551
00:45:49,426 --> 00:45:52,257
Mr. Soames is in charge until I return.

552
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,498
The men are all in position?

553
00:46:53,234 --> 00:46:54,601
They are.

554
00:46:56,036 --> 00:46:59,240
About a dozen of them
beyond that tree line.

555
00:47:01,442 --> 00:47:04,110
Once Silver gives the signal,

556
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:07,206
they'll... close in.

557
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,529
They'll have soldiers with them.

558
00:47:21,629 --> 00:47:24,252
Tell Silver it's important we wait
until they've all cleared the tunnel

559
00:47:24,277 --> 00:47:26,246
before we make any kind of move.

560
00:47:27,393 --> 00:47:30,396
When the time comes, I don't
want anyone else touching Flint.

561
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:33,031
I'll handle it.

562
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:52,943
This isn't right.

563
00:47:56,382 --> 00:47:59,791
All those men out there that
you and I have fought alongside.

564
00:48:01,675 --> 00:48:05,178
I can't believe I'm the only
one who knows this isn't right.

565
00:48:49,846 --> 00:48:52,199
You built all of this.

566
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,682
The resistance.

567
00:48:57,949 --> 00:48:59,951
It wouldn't have worked without you.

568
00:49:02,788 --> 00:49:06,348
But part of what you
built, it worked too well.

569
00:49:11,229 --> 00:49:13,582
Long John Silver.

570
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,135
All he had to do was open his mouth,

571
00:49:18,904 --> 00:49:21,006
say your name,

572
00:49:21,262 --> 00:49:23,364
and everyone listened.

573
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:29,549
What was it that he said about me?

574
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:33,185
He said the reason Flint's fleet

575
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:35,371
never got warning of the
barricade in the harbor

576
00:49:35,396 --> 00:49:38,166
wasn't because Mr.
Featherstone didn't relay it...

577
00:49:40,714 --> 00:49:43,382
wasn't because Max intercepted it.

578
00:49:45,781 --> 00:49:49,585
He said it was because you
never sent it in the first place.

579
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:53,109
And they all believed him.

580
00:49:55,624 --> 00:49:58,634
I don't think anyone
actually believed it.

581
00:49:59,517 --> 00:50:02,252
You weren't indicted based on the facts,

582
00:50:02,931 --> 00:50:05,783
or our suspicions of your motives.

583
00:50:06,275 --> 00:50:08,477
He just said it.

584
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,641
Only, no one had the balls to defy him.

585
00:50:14,456 --> 00:50:16,343
I told them...

586
00:50:16,545 --> 00:50:18,681
I should be the one to do it.

587
00:50:19,998 --> 00:50:21,850
If it was gonna happen,

588
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,019
I thought it should be a friend.

589
00:50:30,893 --> 00:50:32,628
But fuck it.

590
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,768
I won't do it.

591
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:47,610
You've all forgotten your oaths.

592
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:53,295
They were given to this man...

593
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,725
when that man was just a fiction.

594
00:50:57,479 --> 00:51:00,467
To hell with all of you who
can't tell the difference!

595
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:04,630
To hell with all of you!

596
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:38,171
Stop!

597
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:56,317
Take him to the Underhill estate.

598
00:52:00,265 --> 00:52:01,810
Do it.

599
00:52:27,593 --> 00:52:29,207
Captain?

600
00:52:33,454 --> 00:52:35,887
Is the cache on the sand yet?

601
00:52:36,325 --> 00:52:38,238
The cache isn't here.

602
00:52:38,442 --> 00:52:40,386
What the fuck is this?

603
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,261
I don't know.

604
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:50,815
Stand down. Just wait!

605
00:53:14,612 --> 00:53:15,847
What are you doing here?

606
00:53:17,012 --> 00:53:19,081
We escaped the governor's men.

607
00:53:19,562 --> 00:53:22,030
Came back to rejoin the fight,

608
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:25,318
but didn't know if the
harbor was safe to enter.

609
00:53:25,389 --> 00:53:27,570
What are you doing here?

610
00:53:45,902 --> 00:53:48,256
You want to trade it?

611
00:53:48,281 --> 00:53:52,035
You want to trade the cache, my cache?

612
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,372
It was the only way
we could avoid a fight

613
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,770
we were more than likely to lose.

614
00:53:56,795 --> 00:54:00,224
And it guarantees us control of
the island today and for certain.

615
00:54:00,249 --> 00:54:02,552
All it guarantees is we
no longer have the cache

616
00:54:02,577 --> 00:54:04,872
that we all agreed was critical.

617
00:54:05,098 --> 00:54:06,294
And who decided this?

618
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,855
You and Mr. Silver?

619
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:16,586
Ah.

620
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:19,547
- It won't work.
- It's done.

621
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:21,073
It's already agreed to.

622
00:54:21,766 --> 00:54:23,626
She agreed to it.

623
00:54:25,003 --> 00:54:26,237
Her people agreed.

624
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,854
You've agreed.

625
00:54:28,147 --> 00:54:31,502
But it's all meaningless
unless and until...

626
00:54:31,543 --> 00:54:33,745
he agrees.

627
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,923
Woodes Rogers.

628
00:54:34,948 --> 00:54:37,724
He left the island for Port Royal,

629
00:54:37,763 --> 00:54:40,313
as she asked, to await
her arrival with the money.

630
00:54:40,338 --> 00:54:42,001
He's already agreed to it.

631
00:54:42,592 --> 00:54:44,227
No, he hasn't.

632
00:54:47,689 --> 00:54:49,390
What is it?

633
00:54:49,415 --> 00:54:50,949
What do you see out there?

634
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:06,278
I watched him defeat
Edward Teach in battle...

635
00:55:07,365 --> 00:55:09,151
outnumbered...

636
00:55:09,185 --> 00:55:11,846
and through sheer force of will.

637
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:15,309
I saw his bloodlust with my own eyes.

638
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:20,112
That man will never
surrender his position here.

639
00:55:20,137 --> 00:55:23,440
He will never allow himself
to be defeated by you or I.

640
00:55:23,613 --> 00:55:24,750
Not because we bribed him,

641
00:55:24,775 --> 00:55:27,344
not because Eleanor Guthrie told him so.

642
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:31,680
He simply will not allow it to happen.

643
00:55:35,213 --> 00:55:37,249
I don't know where that man went

644
00:55:37,326 --> 00:55:40,071
or what designs drew him there,

645
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:42,063
but this I know...

646
00:55:42,933 --> 00:55:45,274
Woodes Rogers will be returning...

647
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:49,514
and this fight isn't nearly over.
