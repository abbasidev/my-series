1
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:14,483
You want to trade the cache, my cache?

2
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:16,935
It was the only way
we could avoid a fight

3
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:19,071
we were more than likely to lose.

4
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:21,790
- Mr. Scott?
- He told me that he feared

5
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,158
for the safety of his
wife and his daughter.

6
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:26,100
- Are they still alive?
- Yes, they are.

7
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:29,047
They revolted. A man
named Julius started it.

8
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:31,216
Now he's forming an army out there

9
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:33,352
with designs on taking Nassau.

10
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:36,054
The damage done to this
alliance was caused by Billy.

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,753
It may be that the only
way to repair this damage

12
00:00:38,778 --> 00:00:41,316
is to remove that which caused it.

13
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:44,763
Stop!

14
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:46,222
What the hell have you done?

15
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:49,167
If the British empire will not aid
us in fighting our present enemy,

16
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:51,370
perhaps a different empire will.

17
00:00:51,472 --> 00:00:55,040
Once you land, I envision no confusion.

18
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:58,644
I'd simply ask that you
burn it all to the ground.

20
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,868
When your people took this place,

21
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,504
it was they who suffered
the consequences.

22
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:09,153
Reprisals visited upon their mothers,

23
00:03:09,178 --> 00:03:11,419
brothers, children.

24
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:15,817
Tortured on the other farms
as a result of your actions.

25
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:18,505
I understand.

26
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,787
Which is why I've come
here to make that right.

27
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:25,357
If you had suffered such loss,

28
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,225
is there anything you can imagine

29
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:28,809
making it right?

30
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:33,331
No. I can't.

31
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:38,837
But I imagine getting my hands
on the man responsible for it...

32
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:40,748
would be a start.

33
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,359
He completed the raid when
my friends tried to stop it.

34
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:50,682
He chained those he felt
most likely to revolt

35
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:52,651
over the offense.

36
00:03:52,753 --> 00:03:55,335
Though, I imagine they know this.

37
00:03:57,552 --> 00:03:59,472
With what conditions?

38
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:01,159
Two of them.

39
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:04,020
They respect you, so
they'll listen to you.

40
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:07,065
I'd ask your help in
mending this alliance,

41
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,301
both with the men and women here

42
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:12,415
and those elsewhere on the island.

43
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:16,356
I understand there's now a
band of armed slaves out there.

44
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:20,259
I need to know you can
broker a peace with them, too.

45
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:23,882
And the other condition?

46
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:28,595
That he's alive at the
end of whatever happens.

47
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:32,951
You trust him?

48
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:37,689
Flint.

49
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,665
You've cast your lot with him.

50
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:45,664
What does it matter to you?

51
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:53,004
Before this war began, before
everyone's roles changed,

52
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:56,675
your father mistrusted Flint
as much as anyone in Nassau did.

53
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,823
I assume you were in some
contact with him all that time.

54
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:05,116
I'm surprised that his
feelings didn't influence you.

55
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:14,481
You were my sister.

56
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:17,529
There is very little that I remember

57
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:19,264
from when I was young,

58
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:21,466
but I remember this.

59
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:24,599
You were older.

60
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:26,791
You were beautiful.

61
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:29,307
I revered you.

62
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:37,416
When you were told that
my mother and I were dead,

63
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:40,318
I have to believe that it affected you.

64
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:44,155
You had just lost your mother.

65
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:47,880
But if things were as I remember,

66
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:51,162
my mother and I were your family, too.

67
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:56,668
And yet, through all
the years thereafter

68
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,436
that my father cared for you...

69
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:03,377
counseled you, labored for you...

70
00:07:05,078 --> 00:07:07,593
he never told you that we were alive.

71
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,687
It would have been so easy
to lessen your suffering

72
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:13,184
by divulging the secret.

73
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:15,460
And yet, he never did.

74
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:18,857
Have you yet asked yourself why that is?

75
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,800
My father didn't mistrust Flint.

76
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,389
My father mistrusted all of you.

77
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:42,920
Lieutenant.

78
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:04,803
The cache isn't here, so I am leaving.

79
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:07,405
And as my collateral to ensure
that this deal is consummated,

80
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,999
he'll be coming with me to the fort.

81
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:12,202
"This deal"?

82
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,813
As in the one in which you
walk away with all my money?

83
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:18,516
It seems the only means I have

84
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:20,477
of registering any
meaningful disapproval

85
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,021
of this deal at this point

86
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:24,477
is to kill one or the both of you.

87
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:06,531
- How many?
- 12 total.

88
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:07,950
Eight ships of force.

89
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:10,325
They'll be in range
in an hour, maybe less.

90
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:12,964
Grab the ledgers and
whatever coin is on hand.

91
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:14,305
Where are we going?

92
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,966
You're going to inform Mr.
Silver what's happening.

93
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,405
We're getting onto the Walrus

94
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,116
and we're getting it and us out of here.

95
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,541
If we're still here when
they make their landing,

96
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,095
none of us will survive the day.

97
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,153
You would surrender our
position to the Spanish Navy?

98
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,172
You were prepared to
surrender this position

99
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:49,284
to Long John Silver
just a few hours ago.

100
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:52,821
And in this case, our lives
may very well depend upon it.

101
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:55,246
Spanish forces, sir,
will offer no quarter.

102
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:56,938
We have no choice but
to defend ourselves!

103
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,653
Quiet, please.

104
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:03,575
What is it, Lieutenant?

105
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:06,925
The lead ship that approaches,

106
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:09,570
she's just posted a signal to us.

107
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,531
It was Governor Rogers' signal
ordering us to stand down.

108
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:17,734
His signal?

109
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:23,609
Could it have been stolen?

110
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:27,445
It's from our most recent signal book.

111
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:30,315
Then I think our response is obvious.

112
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:32,238
We will follow his orders.

113
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:35,253
Obviously, he has
enlisted Spanish assistance

114
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,535
in forcing the pirates out of Nassau.

115
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,891
If we stand down, the
invasion proceeds around us

116
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,215
and we will remain safe here.

117
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,028
And what about Eleanor?

118
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:44,352
What about her?

119
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:46,431
She is out there.

120
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:49,033
Someone must retrieve her
before those troops arrive.

121
00:10:49,135 --> 00:10:50,802
Before we could retrieve her and return,

122
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:52,860
that invasion would be fully unleashed.

123
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,573
It would be suicide for
anyone to attempt it.

124
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:00,712
Where are you going?

125
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:14,705
_

126
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:20,111
_

127
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,806
_

128
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:28,689
_

129
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,422
_

130
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:35,282
_

131
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:38,547
_

132
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:28,399
He's in the field with the sign.

133
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,783
I did not want this.

134
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,145
Flint is my friend,

135
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:59,614
but I know what he is.

136
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,867
I have no illusions about it.

137
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:07,616
But for all the dangers he presents,

138
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:10,507
for all his offenses...

139
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:16,147
the one thing he's never done is
force me to choose between him and you.

140
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:21,944
That, you did.

141
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:29,961
But it isn't too late to
find a way to remedy it.

142
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:48,568
You made a terrible mistake

143
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:50,715
and you paid a terrible price.

144
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:54,891
But we're at war...

145
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,360
and you're an asset.

146
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:01,282
Despite what's gone on,

147
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,452
you are my friend.

148
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:09,734
And the men out there have
had their pound of flesh.

149
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:11,758
And our men...

150
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:14,446
Billy, I could walk out there

151
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:17,475
and tell them the sky is red...

152
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:19,310
and they'd believe me.

153
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:23,381
That's the power you've given me.

154
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:27,856
But I have to know this is over...

155
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:31,953
your vendetta against Flint,

156
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:37,055
your need to see him dead
or departed from our story.

157
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:43,350
I have to know you'll never put
me to a choice between you again.

158
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:47,004
Swear it...

159
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:50,272
and this all ends.

160
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:03,521
You chose.

161
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:09,360
Live with it.

162
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:17,727
They're here.

163
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,037
He speaks for them?

164
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,883
They call him Julius.

165
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:57,975
- Help me out.
- Won't do it by itself.

166
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:04,282
Over there.

167
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:08,419
Pretty sight for you.

168
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:39,650
I came to find Eleanor.

169
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,327
"I betrayed you, Jack.

170
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:51,863
"Tried to trade your life
for my own personal gain.

171
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,361
"Lied to Anne to her face about it.

172
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:56,701
"Please, Jack. Beg of you.

173
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:57,825
"Is there any way you can forgive me?"

174
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,136
That was the general sense I had

175
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:00,571
of what I might hear
come from your mouth

176
00:17:00,596 --> 00:17:01,906
were I ever this close to you again.

177
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:03,274
Spain is here.

178
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:09,210
A fleet of a dozen ships has
already opened fire on Nassau town.

179
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:11,182
By now, well over a thousand soldiers

180
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:14,685
will have likely made their
landing and begun their invasion.

181
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:15,994
In a matter of hours,

182
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:19,481
there will be no safe place
to stand on this island,

183
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,146
made all the more dangerous by the fact

184
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:23,569
that the harbor has been
rendered defenseless.

185
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:26,663
There will be no resistance
to their landing since...

186
00:17:26,688 --> 00:17:29,890
Since Woodes Rogers was
the one who invited them in.

187
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:33,404
How did you know that?

188
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:36,307
Captain! Sails!

189
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:39,068
The Walrus.

190
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:42,713
They escaped the harbor
ahead of their landing.

191
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:53,052
Change of plan! Back to the ship.

192
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:55,902
Spanish invasion. You're
welcome to stay if you like.

193
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:03,550
You coming?

194
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:05,433
I won't ask again.

195
00:18:33,348 --> 00:18:35,090
Keeping an eye on us?

196
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,754
Making sure you don't slit my
throat out of spite, perhaps.

197
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,036
I suppose I chose the right hostage

198
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:45,622
if they're that concerned
about keeping you alive.

199
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,903
I suppose so.

200
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:53,346
You know, there was a time...

201
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:57,354
not so long ago, when
you shared their concern.

202
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:01,592
When you saw what I saw.

203
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,217
The benefits of being
free of British rule.

204
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:11,535
To make the new world something more
than just an extension of the old.

205
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:15,973
Is it so unthinkable
that that might be again?

206
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:19,477
You were a pirate once.

207
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,314
Stranger things have happened.

208
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:43,296
We need to get to cover.

209
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:44,968
Quickly.

210
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:47,343
Where?

211
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:57,019
The governor's forces have
been driven out of Nassau.

212
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,451
In a few hours, the last
remaining members of his regime

213
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:02,353
will be surrendering the fort,

214
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:05,689
leaving the island
completely under our control.

215
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,113
It is a new day.

216
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:13,474
But one that demands we all
unite behind a common cause.

217
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:17,216
What cause is that?

218
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,938
To free the new world.

219
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:25,983
And we will be your partners...

220
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,491
in the fight to free it?

221
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,538
Yes.

222
00:20:32,018 --> 00:20:33,882
For how long?

223
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:37,154
How long?

224
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:40,858
I'm told you removed

225
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,263
the one who governed
the pirates before you.

226
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:47,604
Sacrificed him in the hopes that
it would remake this alliance...

227
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:50,651
Know that man was a friend of mine...

228
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:53,714
before you question the sacrifice.

229
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,538
Amongst pirates,

230
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:02,286
loyalty changes quickly, it seems.

231
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:05,316
If a man can be replaced so easily,

232
00:21:05,418 --> 00:21:08,752
how can I know that his
promises won't be, too?

233
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:18,863
Spain? Here?

234
00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:21,465
12 ships, likely in
excess of a thousand men.

235
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,601
There won't be much time
before we're overrun.

236
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:25,941
Mr. Featherstone awaits on
the Walrus off the south coast

237
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,338
if we wish to retreat.

238
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:28,706
If?

239
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,635
A thousand Spanish fighters
are more than three times

240
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,491
our number could withstand.

241
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:35,746
What can we do but retreat?

242
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:38,749
We're not leaving.

243
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:40,484
If it's Madi that concerns you,

244
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:42,052
we could send someone out to find her.

245
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:43,687
We wouldn't be leaving her behind.

246
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:45,913
Madi and Flint will either
find their way back here

247
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,491
or they'll find a place to hide.

248
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:49,894
But even if they were
here, we cannot retreat.

249
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,595
Not with our numbers.

250
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,931
The Spanish would run us down.

251
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,799
We'd end up facing them
disorganized out there

252
00:21:55,824 --> 00:21:57,935
rather than entrenched here.

253
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,205
So, what do we do?

254
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:17,221
If we fight them together,
there's a good chance we live,

255
00:22:17,323 --> 00:22:20,054
hold our ground, maybe
even fight them off.

256
00:22:20,728 --> 00:22:23,210
Separate, and we all die.

257
00:22:23,835 --> 00:22:25,629
Retrieve your men,

258
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:27,631
bring them here,

259
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:31,712
and make this the last
battle to win the island.

260
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:18,995
_

261
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,292
_

262
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,955
_

263
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,543
_

264
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:32,206
_

265
00:23:40,975 --> 00:23:43,060
No, no, no, no, no.

266
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:47,353
Where is she?

267
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,538
She left with an escort hours ago

268
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,196
to make the exchange.

269
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:53,921
You let her leave?

270
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:04,862
Your men need to know my
wife is not to be harmed.

271
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,092
_

272
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:08,976
English, God damn it!

273
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:11,969
Even if that order could be given,

274
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:13,437
no one would heed it.

275
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,460
They've been let loose.

276
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:18,079
I opened the gates for you.

277
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:20,577
Handed you this victory.

278
00:24:21,814 --> 00:24:23,480
Yes, you did.

279
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:26,838
But what has begun here,

280
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:29,104
there is no altering it now.

281
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,731
Jesus Christ.

282
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,209
I sent a rider to the
Underhill estate to warn them.

283
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:54,689
Told them we'd be here to
get them off the island.

284
00:24:54,714 --> 00:24:56,713
But there's a credible
argument to be made

285
00:24:56,738 --> 00:24:58,782
that we ought to leave right away,

286
00:24:58,807 --> 00:25:00,584
while we still can.

287
00:25:06,992 --> 00:25:08,258
Hello, boys.

288
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:10,427
No. We wait here.

289
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:13,984
We wait here for whomever,

290
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,719
if anyone, survives the day.

291
00:25:19,805 --> 00:25:23,674
If you have men you can spare,
I can use them on the Walrus.

292
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:25,809
That's high enough!

293
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:38,305
If there is nothing left to be
done, I would like to see her.

294
00:26:36,443 --> 00:26:38,357
I loved you.

295
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:44,054
And I betrayed you.

296
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:55,567
But I cannot apologize for it.

297
00:26:58,504 --> 00:26:59,970
I did what anyone would have done

298
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:02,856
when confronted with the
same impossible choices.

299
00:27:06,462 --> 00:27:09,630
If I apologize, you
will know it is a lie.

300
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:15,241
And I do not wish to
lie to you ever again.

301
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:21,649
Leave.

302
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:26,601
No.

303
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:30,749
I am going to stay with you.

304
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,952
I want to take care of you.

305
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:41,886
Get the fuck out.

306
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:10,073
Doesn't make sense.

307
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:12,976
Spain has been quiet for months.
Why is this happening now?

308
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:19,349
The governor sailed from here days ago,

309
00:28:19,374 --> 00:28:22,400
frustrated in his attempts
to retake the island.

310
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:26,938
Apparently, he found
someone willing to aid him.

311
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:29,663
That's not what happened.

312
00:28:31,797 --> 00:28:34,366
The harbor is still obstructed.

313
00:28:34,566 --> 00:28:37,034
How else would they manage
to enter it so cleanly

314
00:28:37,136 --> 00:28:38,535
unless he was in league with them?

315
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,694
That is not what happened.

316
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:46,109
Well, whatever the cause, they're here.

317
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,775
We need to prepare a
defensive position here.

318
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,902
We need to send out scouts to
determine the size of their force.

319
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:58,488
And we need all the hands we can muster.

320
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:27,117
Already?

321
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:28,987
They must've tracked us here.

322
00:29:29,012 --> 00:29:31,613
Get inside the house, the both of you.

323
00:29:41,054 --> 00:29:42,787
You saw them?

324
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:47,137
I think so. Beyond the trees.

325
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,348
Wait.

326
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:29,169
Now.

327
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:39,399
Move! Move!

328
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:12,890
If they report our position,
we'll face 50 more of them.

329
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:17,781
Stay. Watch the house.

330
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:49,476
It did affect me.

331
00:31:53,365 --> 00:31:54,760
When Mr. Scott...

332
00:31:54,785 --> 00:31:58,626
when your father told me that
you and your mother had died...

333
00:31:59,872 --> 00:32:01,905
it affected me a great deal.

334
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:17,220
It must have been hard...

335
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,178
to live hidden away for so long.

336
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,184
It was hard to be away from him.

337
00:32:31,837 --> 00:32:33,736
The rest of it...

338
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:37,522
my mother did the best she
could with the rest of it.

339
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:40,010
She must have done well.

340
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:48,852
I've found myself thinking about it.

341
00:32:50,355 --> 00:32:51,955
Of walking away from Nassau,

342
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,558
from England, from civilization.

343
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:00,030
One can be happy that way, can't they?

344
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:03,998
A life of isolation and uncertainty

345
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,903
as long as it is lived
with someone you love...

346
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:11,192
And who loves you back.

347
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:17,545
It is possible, isn't it?

348
00:33:29,494 --> 00:33:31,294
It is.

349
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,859
- You've seen them?
- They're right around the bend.

350
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:50,046
80, maybe 100 headed this way.

351
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:54,678
If we're lucky and
it's on the lighter end,

352
00:34:54,703 --> 00:34:56,680
we might actually be
able to hold them off.

353
00:34:56,782 --> 00:35:00,650
"If we're lucky" is not a notion
that's worked well for us recently.

354
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:02,752
You have men positioned by
the south and west gates?

355
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:05,787
As many as we could
afford, which isn't many.

356
00:35:28,246 --> 00:35:29,813
What's happening out there?

357
00:35:29,915 --> 00:35:31,815
I don't know what chance you'll have.

358
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,007
Their soldiers are likely everywhere.

359
00:35:35,654 --> 00:35:37,053
If you're going to be found by them,

360
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:39,000
it shouldn't be tied up like an animal.

361
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,270
You cannot stay here.

362
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,555
Good luck.

363
00:36:10,932 --> 00:36:13,971
Need more men, Castro. Let's go!

364
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:16,510
Reload!

365
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:20,803
What is it?

366
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:23,353
Reload!

367
00:36:26,474 --> 00:36:28,130
Can you hear that?

368
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:39,883
- Come on, let's help them out.
- I'm out!

369
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:42,508
How many men are watching the
south end of the cane fields?

370
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,300
I think four.

371
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:08,079
They're coming!

372
00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:11,179
- Get off the wall!
- Get off the wall!

373
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:15,695
Horses behind us!

374
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,765
Take positions and go!

375
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:29,064
The back! Get the back!

376
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,673
Yah! Run for the...

377
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:38,836
Watch your flank!

378
00:37:49,342 --> 00:37:50,756
Retreat!

379
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,388
Retreat!

380
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:54,741
Run! Run!

381
00:41:29,674 --> 00:41:31,217
Madi!

382
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:33,100
Madi!

383
00:41:34,306 --> 00:41:35,686
Madi.

384
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:47,584
Don't waste the shot!

385
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:09,706
Watch out! Watch out!

386
00:42:09,731 --> 00:42:11,630
Keep it down. Move ahead.

387
00:42:16,991 --> 00:42:18,897
Aim at the horses!

388
00:42:24,764 --> 00:42:26,028
Torches!

389
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:31,611
Aim for the torches!

390
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:33,901
- Aim for the torches.
- Take him down!

391
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:47,882
Open the doors!

392
00:43:59,857 --> 00:44:01,390
Hey.

393
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:15,019
Was he...

394
00:44:19,709 --> 00:44:22,176
Is he with them, my husband?

395
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:27,533
No.

396
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:30,808
No, he isn't.

397
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,839
I tried to save her.

398
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,595
Madi.

399
00:44:41,032 --> 00:44:43,499
I tried to save her.

400
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:02,248
Let's move him before
he starts stinking.

401
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:07,727
How many?

402
00:46:08,274 --> 00:46:10,335
A hundred, give or take.

403
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,681
Roughly half withdrew,

404
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:14,477
but I imagine it was not
without intent to return,

405
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:17,093
and with greater numbers.

406
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:24,753
Where's Madi?

407
00:46:46,491 --> 00:46:50,059
We've got about 30 able-bodied
men left, plus Julius's men.

408
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:51,484
We should be able to
defend the main gate

409
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:54,029
and have men to spare to prevent
another move through the cane.

410
00:46:54,054 --> 00:46:56,565
- We can't.
- Can't? We just drove them off once.

411
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,742
And it cost you half your number.

412
00:47:00,271 --> 00:47:04,117
Spanish regulars will not allow
themselves to be defeated by us.

413
00:47:04,675 --> 00:47:06,442
And when they return...

414
00:47:06,544 --> 00:47:09,499
with three times as many reinforcements,

415
00:47:09,546 --> 00:47:11,914
what do you imagine will follow there?

416
00:47:12,016 --> 00:47:14,049
We know they're coming
now. We'll be ready.

417
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:15,907
It's over.

418
00:47:19,248 --> 00:47:20,806
It's over.

419
00:47:28,299 --> 00:47:30,833
Gather whatever supplies you can.

420
00:47:31,218 --> 00:47:34,492
Anyone who can't make it to
the beach, I want them carried.

421
00:47:34,633 --> 00:47:37,000
I'll not leave anyone behind.

422
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,536
We've done most of what we can

423
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:56,105
and still be able to depart quickly,

424
00:47:56,294 --> 00:47:58,270
which we may have to do sooner or later

425
00:47:58,295 --> 00:48:00,720
with or without survivors.

426
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:04,700
We have to assume the Spanish have
men all across the island by now.

427
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:08,938
Every hour we sit here is an hour
closer to being sighted by them...

428
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:11,632
if we haven't been sighted already.

429
00:48:17,445 --> 00:48:19,324
She saw Anne?

430
00:48:24,214 --> 00:48:27,626
We'll give them another
hour, then we'll set sail.

431
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:46,466
Seems a fair amount of
resentment towards you these days.

432
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:55,595
I just want you to know...

433
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,040
that I remember what you did for me.

434
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:01,430
Standing up to Captain Berringer.

435
00:49:03,494 --> 00:49:07,118
Jack can be angry. Anne can be angry.

436
00:49:07,398 --> 00:49:08,712
But...

437
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:14,603
but I remember the
good you've done, too.

438
00:49:20,278 --> 00:49:23,012
It wasn't supposed to end like this.

439
00:49:28,357 --> 00:49:30,291
How can we all have sacrificed so much

440
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:32,915
and none of us has
anything to show for it?

441
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:48,103
Captain! Movement on the shoreline!

442
00:49:56,147 --> 00:49:57,754
I can't see anything.

443
00:49:58,649 --> 00:50:00,883
- Get those launches away.
- Aye.

444
00:50:00,985 --> 00:50:02,751
- Is Flint among them?
- I think so.

445
00:50:02,776 --> 00:50:04,343
By the dunes.

446
00:50:09,895 --> 00:50:12,563
Jesus, it looks like
they've been through hell.

447
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:17,232
It will take some time
before we fully know

448
00:50:17,257 --> 00:50:19,557
all we have lost today.

449
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,660
So, we are leaving?

450
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:44,612
We, uh, follow Flint south...

451
00:51:44,637 --> 00:51:46,112
to the camp.

452
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,276
We'll regroup,

453
00:51:48,301 --> 00:51:50,750
we'll refit, we'll...

454
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:17,986
A war against civilization?

455
00:52:18,689 --> 00:52:20,255
What?

456
00:52:20,991 --> 00:52:25,227
Civilization has been winning
that war for 10,000 years

457
00:52:25,252 --> 00:52:30,143
against men richer, braver,
stronger, and smarter than you.

458
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,234
How can you be so blind not to see that?

459
00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:33,879
What the fuck are you talking about?

460
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:37,339
You mustered a force stronger
than you had any right to hope for.

461
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:39,475
You hit the governor when
he was at his weakest.

462
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,366
And at what result?

463
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:44,747
Eleanor is dead, Anne is nearly dead,

464
00:52:44,772 --> 00:52:49,233
and the governor is sitting in
Nassau in my fucking chair victorious!

465
00:52:50,554 --> 00:52:54,194
You cannot fight civilization
from the outside in.

466
00:52:54,358 --> 00:52:57,326
And your plan now is to follow
that man into more of the same?!

467
00:52:57,428 --> 00:52:58,627
"What result?"

468
00:52:58,729 --> 00:53:02,698
That result was because
of your goddamn betrayal!

469
00:53:02,943 --> 00:53:06,332
Just now, that man and
several others wondered aloud

470
00:53:06,357 --> 00:53:07,657
whether the smartest thing to do

471
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:10,316
wouldn't be killing you
and throwing you in the sea

472
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:13,023
rather than giving you
another opportunity to fuck us!

473
00:53:13,048 --> 00:53:15,521
For reasons I can't begin to
fathom, I argued against it.

474
00:53:15,546 --> 00:53:19,548
Bark at me again about braver,
stronger, and smarter men,

475
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:21,368
and I might decide to revisit the issue!

476
00:53:21,393 --> 00:53:23,275
If killing me seems like
the smartest thing to do,

477
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,658
then it is obvious to me
none of you have any idea

478
00:53:25,683 --> 00:53:27,433
how to defeat Woodes Rogers.

479
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:30,595
- And you do?!
- You're goddamn right, I do!

480
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:34,243
Eleanor is dead,

481
00:53:34,634 --> 00:53:35,816
Anne is nearly dead,

482
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:39,636
and I want him to pay
for all of it dearly.

483
00:53:41,338 --> 00:53:44,410
Do you want to help me or not?

484
00:53:51,015 --> 00:53:52,959
When Flint heads south,

485
00:53:52,984 --> 00:53:55,280
we head north.

486
00:53:58,073 --> 00:53:59,665
What's north?

487
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:03,180
Eleanor Guthrie's grandfather.

488
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,857
We'll be arriving soon.

489
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,330
Still no sign of Rackham?

490
00:54:41,463 --> 00:54:43,029
No.

491
00:54:48,075 --> 00:54:51,103
Do you really think they just...

492
00:54:51,386 --> 00:54:53,286
Abandoned us?

493
00:54:54,612 --> 00:54:56,178
Yes.

494
00:55:14,454 --> 00:55:16,554
I'm sorry.

495
00:55:37,236 --> 00:55:39,403
I need you to know...

496
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:42,518
that I did everything I could

497
00:55:42,543 --> 00:55:44,709
to keep her safe.

498
00:55:46,938 --> 00:55:48,405
I...

499
00:55:49,602 --> 00:55:52,163
I don't expect that to mean anything.

500
00:55:56,775 --> 00:55:58,692
It wasn't...

501
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:03,645
your fault.

502
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:12,404
It wasn't your fault.

503
00:58:00,847 --> 00:58:02,497
They had already begun to arrive

504
00:58:02,522 --> 00:58:05,777
when Kofi came with your
request for the cache.

505
00:58:06,104 --> 00:58:08,808
You can understand why
I didn't let him go.

506
00:58:10,074 --> 00:58:12,228
They came from other islands,

507
00:58:12,253 --> 00:58:13,975
the colonies,

508
00:58:14,038 --> 00:58:16,738
maroons from camps like this one,

509
00:58:16,763 --> 00:58:19,869
pirates from as far
away as Massachusetts.

510
00:58:20,217 --> 00:58:22,918
They heard that Nassau had fallen...

511
00:58:22,943 --> 00:58:24,938
and they came to join us.

512
00:58:27,642 --> 00:58:29,806
The revolution you promised...

513
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:31,821
has begun!
