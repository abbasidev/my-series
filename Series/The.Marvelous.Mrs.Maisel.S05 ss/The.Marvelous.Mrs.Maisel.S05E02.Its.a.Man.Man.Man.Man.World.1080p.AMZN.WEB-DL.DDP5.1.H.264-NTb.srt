1
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:14,223
{\an8}Amongst the many
overnight success stories

2
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:15,599
{\an8}in show business lore,

3
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,977
{\an8}Midge Maisel's stands out
from the rest.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,770
{\an8}Her journey
from the Gaslight Café

5
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,690
{\an8}in New York's Greenwich Village
to worldwide fame and notoriety

6
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,650
{\an8}is the stuff of legend.

7
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:26,318
{\an8}Often press-shy,

8
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:29,447
{\an8}she agreed to sit down with me
and talk about her life.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,866
Hey, you look a little nervous.
Are you?

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,617
Well, there's that body
in my trunk.

11
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,595
I've been meaning to dump it,
but the day got away from me.

12
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,954
It's been quite a ride.

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,456
Grammy winner, Emmy winner,

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,458
the French Order
of the Arts and Letters.

15
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,669
Does the phrase
"living legend" apply?

16
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:45,755
Geez, Mike, I'm not dead yet.

17
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,257
Wait, am I?
Call an ambulance.

18
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,384
Where'd this passion to perform
come from?

19
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,928
What drives Midge Maisel?

20
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,472
I just love what I do.

21
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,807
I love talking to people,
present company excepted,

22
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,225
I'm kidding.

23
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:01,145
I like money,
I'm not ashamed of that.

24
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:05,441
And boy, oh, boy,
do I love the sound of laughs.

25
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,943
<i>And what she does is
make people laugh.</i>

26
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,612
<i>At age 30,</i>

27
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:13,032
<i>18 consecutive sold-out nights
at the Copacabana.</i>

28
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,367
<i>Numerous tours in the U.S.,
Canada,</i>

29
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,245
<i>and parts of Europe
all sell out in minutes.</i>

30
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,581
<i>There's the requisite
celebrity friendships.</i>

31
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,166
<i>Her shows with Bob Hope</i>

32
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,477
<i>and their many trips to Vietnam</i>

33
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,461
<i>were a favorite of the troops.</i>

34
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,213
Midge, you look wonderful.

35
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,896
I love that gown.
Is that a Schiaparelli?

36
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,942
Oh, I'm sorry, Bob, but I've
forgotten where I bought it.

37
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,552
You mind if I look at the label?

38
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,262
What does it say?

39
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,097
"Off limits."

40
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,974
That's negotiable.

41
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,185
<i>As her audience grew older,</i>

42
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,729
<i>her inclination to shock
grew bolder,</i>

43
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:45,356
<i>culminating in the now infamous</i>

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,067
<i>1971 show at Carnegie Hall.</i>

45
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,027
<i>How does a lady
like that</i>

46
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,738
<i>have the to
show up looking like that?</i>

47
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:55,032
<i>Is anyone aware of
the First Amendment?</i>

48
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,784
<i>Still applies.</i>

49
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,887
<i>What could have been
a career-ending night of infamy</i>

50
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,246
<i>turned out to be...</i>

51
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,748
<i>as so many things do
in Midge Maisel's life...</i>

52
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:05,000
<i>the beginning of
a brand-new chapter,</i>

53
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,920
<i>with a brand-new audience
of young fans</i>

54
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,631
<i>through her audacious
college campus tours.</i>

55
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,759
<i>On top of all that,
she raised two children,</i>

56
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:17,847
<i>a son, Ethan, and a daughter,
Dr. Esther Maisel.</i>

57
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,850
What was it like having
Midge Maisel as your mother?

58
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,645
It was an incredible childhood,
filled with laughter and warmth.

59
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,939
She's a wonderful mother.

60
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,291
The other kids
must've been jealous.

61
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,276
Oddly, yes.

62
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,528
<i>And then
there were the men.</i>

63
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,155
Men. Men and Midge Maisel.

64
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,574
So many men.

65
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,909
You sound like my accountant.

66
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,912
<i>Four marriages, plus several,
or should I say multiple,</i>

67
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,539
<i>other relationships.</i>

68
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,708
<i>- What gives?
- I don't know.</i>

69
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,459
Lucky in life, unlucky in love.

70
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,753
I thought I'd marry once.
Joke's on me.

71
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,505
<i>And then there's
the relationship</i>

72
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,258
<i>that lasted longer
than all the others combined.</i>

73
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,011
<i>You were client number one
of the powerful</i>

74
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,264
entertainment manager
Susie Myerson, is that right?

75
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,891
That's right.

76
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,894
You know her current
client list: Liza Minnelli,

77
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,645
<i>George Carlin, Barbra Streisand.</i>

78
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,315
<i>Just about everybody
in Hollywood.</i>

79
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,650
Everybody except you.

80
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:14,695
A 25-year friendship gone bust.

81
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,906
- What happened?
- What happened, Mike,

82
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,341
is that two people
in show business

83
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,950
tried to have a friendship.

84
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,453
Shall I read what she recently
said about you in <i>Variety?</i>

85
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:26,040
Don't bother, I've already
had it tattooed on my.

86
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,084
<i>And then there were her clothes.</i>

87
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,462
And you're putting
all these up for auction?

88
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,672
Every last button and bow.

89
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,841
In a way,
these are my friends.

90
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:40,512
My first night at the Gaslight.
Yup, the story is true.

91
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:44,850
My B. Altman switchboard dress.
Those were fun times.

92
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,477
Oh, a classic.

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,689
What I wore the night of
the great tarmac dump of 1960.

94
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,691
Night five of my first Copa run.

95
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,276
What I wore to Woodstock...

96
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,987
I didn't perform,
but I sure got muddy.

97
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:01,075
Guest hosting <i>Johnny Carson,</i>
my cameo in <i>Mad, Mad World.</i>

98
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,243
Oh, and this.

99
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,747
The outfit I wore on my first
day as a writer for <i>Gordon Ford.</i>

100
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,832
My sitting outfit.

101
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,876
I put a lot of thought
into this one.

102
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,670
And where do the proceeds go?

103
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,047
The Weissman/Maisel
Children's Foundation,

104
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,425
for childhood education,
health, hunger, housing.

105
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,594
Children are my best teachers.

106
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:24,264
Through them, I've learned
to love, to laugh, to listen.

107
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,725
So everything I do,
I do for the children.

108
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,519
Hit the lights, ladies.

109
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,064
<i>And so comedy superstar
Midge Maisel soldiers on,</i>

110
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:35,901
<i>through success and adversity,
doing everything,</i>

111
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,237
<i>in her words,
"For the children."</i>

112
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,798
{\an8}<i>Eat, damn it,
you little bastard!</i>

113
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,198
{\an8}<i>Miriam!</i>

114
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,741
He has to eat to survive.

115
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,119
- Not hungry!
- Deaf ears!

116
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,662
- Your fault.
- What is?

117
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,081
- The kids.
- We didn't force you to have kids.

118
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,666
No, but you created
the environment:

119
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,668
the dolls, the books
about being a mommy,

120
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,604
the-the quarter-scale
toy kitchen you rigged up for me

121
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,547
with the gas broiler
and the little fridge

122
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,382
that plugged
into a working socket.

123
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,135
I was very proud of that
until you were electrocuted.

124
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,988
And now I'm gonna need
some extra babysitting help.

125
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,514
This new job is
five days a week.

126
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,200
Miriam, tell us again
how you're gonna be a writer

127
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,434
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

128
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,601
I don't understand.

129
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,829
There's nothing more to tell.

130
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:11,913
He offered me a job
writing on the show,

131
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,022
and I said yes.

132
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,648
So, he just walks
around the city

133
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,151
asking strangers if they want
to be writers on his show?

134
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,527
He sounds unstable.

135
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,422
No, I'm sure he has people
who normally do that,

136
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,906
but this time
it came directly from him.

137
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,283
But what's there to even write?

138
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,046
Doesn't he just make it all up
on the spot?

139
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,762
His whole opening monologue
is written for him.

140
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,496
Oh, I thought
he was just naturally funny.

141
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,415
This is shattering my illusions.

142
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,834
Sorry, I should have broken it
to you more gently.

143
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,669
- And you're sure it was him?
- Am I...

144
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:36,813
Because I read about this woman,

145
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,157
she was walking
down Sixth Avenue,

146
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,941
and who does she bump into
but Winston Churchill.

147
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,443
He tells her
he needs to get back to England

148
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,507
because his daughter's sick,
but he lost his wallet.

149
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,552
That's the worst.

150
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,222
So, she gives him
everything she had, $40.

151
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,932
Well, later on,
the same man is caught

152
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,618
walking around Union Square
with his pants at his ankles,

153
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,685
yelling at seagulls.

154
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,520
So it wasn't Winston Churchill?

155
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,855
That's my point.

156
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,690
Maybe it wasn't Gordon Ford
who hired you.

157
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,567
It was Gordon Ford, okay?

158
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,860
I got hired by Gordon Ford,

159
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,504
his pants were up,
and I accepted the job.

160
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,696
Now let's discuss the kids.

161
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,490
Oh, I'm happy to do all I can,
Miss Miriam.

162
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:05,991
I hope you know that.

163
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,619
It's become a great joy
in my life, watching the kids.

164
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,121
And when I can't watch them,
well...

165
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,790
I can.

166
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,084
I love picking Ethan up
after school,

167
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,394
and Esther loves to come along.

168
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,961
She rides on my shoulders

169
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,089
and tells me, "Giddyap, Janusz!"

170
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,299
And that's when I giddyap
and go like the wind.

171
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,801
I'm happy to stay
and play with them

172
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,886
whenever you need me,
even at night.

173
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,679
They're fantastic.

174
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:31,475
My life was hard:
the war, the bombings.

175
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,768
So much suffering.

176
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,938
But, uh, spending time
with your children...

177
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,899
They make me think about
having my own children.

178
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,569
For the first time in my life.

179
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,446
Well, thank you.

180
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,449
Both of you.
I really appreciate it.

181
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,995
- Who is that?
- Don't you know?

182
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,664
He always has
a screwdriver with him.

183
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,867
I thought he was a handyman.

184
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,291
I didn't hire a handyman.

185
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,627
He seems very familiar
with the children.

186
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,711
And Zelda.

187
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:00,980
He's been here off and on
for weeks,

188
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,204
and none of us know who he is?

189
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,134
Whoever he is,
sounds like he's free.

190
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,268
Do not leave
the salt out!

191
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,204
Since when
do we not leave the salt out?

192
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,729
The salt is always out!

193
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,858
I put it away always,
so the rats don't get in it.

194
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,527
It's not sugar,
it's salt...

195
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,678
You stopped her on the street!

196
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,662
She stopped me!
She's a yenta!

197
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,099
She walks up and down the street
waiting to stop and schmooze!

198
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,959
Moishe Maisel,
I have never said

199
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,421
an unkind word about you
to anyone!

200
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,464
Tell me when I did!

201
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,028
Just last year
at Disneyland!

202
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,676
That jab about my tuchus!

203
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,112
What I said
to Donald Duck that day

204
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,613
is between me and Donald...

205
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,431
<i>Buddy, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry.</i>

206
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,974
How'd you know it was me?

207
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,743
I've been dreading the call
ever since I left you there.

208
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,187
<i>- How do you feel?</i>
- Like a tank hit me.

209
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,773
You went on a bender last night,
epic in scale.

210
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,526
<i>- Give me the headlines.</i>
- You walked in smashed.

211
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,297
- You were hitting on girls right in front of their dates.
- And one of them beat me up?

212
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,615
No, then you went onstage
and insulted the band.

213
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:10,699
And the band beat me up?

214
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,409
No. Then you did
a little stand-up,

215
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,172
and when I turned my back,
you disappeared.

216
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,597
<i>How you got back up
those stairs, I don't know,</i>

217
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,039
<i>but you were bleeding buckets.</i>

218
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,308
I took you
to the emergency room.

219
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,601
They patched you up
and released you,

220
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,210
but you couldn't go home,
not alone.

221
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,562
Your ribs are cracked,
you've got stitches.

222
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,297
So... I brought you there.

223
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,900
<i>- Please forgive me.</i>
- You're forgiven.

224
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,443
I talked to Grumpy
and Sneezy that day, too!

225
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,361
Oh, so you turned
all the Disney characters

226
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,822
- against me, very nice!
- Actually, you may not be forgiven just yet.

227
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,223
Jury's out.

228
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,599
<i>Anything I can do?</i>

229
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,726
Nah. I got an idea.

230
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,811
I'll talk to you later.

231
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,064
In your dreams!

232
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,500
You think Cinderella
wasn't looking me up and down?

233
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,817
Oh, yes, she was!

234
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:49,154
Hello! We're here!

235
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,739
Who's here?
Who is here?

236
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,157
Somebody's here!

237
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,867
Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa.

238
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,078
- Were we expecting you?
- It's the kids.

239
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,097
When I asked how they wanted
to spend their Sunday,

240
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,165
they said with Grandma
and Grandpa Maisel.

241
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,667
How sweet.

242
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,794
Come give Grandpa a big hug
there, kids. Come on.

243
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,963
No, Grandma first.
Come to Grandma.

244
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,024
- I had dibs. No, come on, come on, <i>bubele.</i>
- Come on, come on.

245
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,234
Zaydee's waiting.
Grandpa has feelings, too.

246
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,568
No, you're gonna hurt
my feelings and break my heart.

247
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,028
And his knees are hurting
quite badly.

248
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,738
- My knees are hurting, too.
- You don't want to damage Grandpa's knees.

249
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,657
- Do you? I've got candy.
- My back's not so good either.

250
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,492
- Grandpa's knees are fine.
- And football injuries.

251
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,577
- And my heart can break, too...
- You don't want to break my heart.

252
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,361
- It's weak already.
- Oh, look, there he is.

253
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,355
Our little patient.

254
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,233
- Hi.
- Hi.

255
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,944
Don't be scared,
he's gonna be fine.

256
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,613
Your father was hit
by a very small car,

257
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,324
but already he's so much better.
Look, he's walking.

258
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,868
And did you grow?

259
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,496
- These aren't my pajamas.
- Okay.

260
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,456
I'm fine, guys. Really.

261
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,041
It looks worse than it is.

262
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,210
Hey, why don't you two go
into the living room

263
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,754
- and dig out your toys?
- I'll come with. Let's go, kids.

264
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,518
- Yeah, I'll be right in.
- I didn't want to come here today.

265
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,735
- Go get your toys...
- Ma, where are my clothes?

266
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,053
At the dry cleaner's.
They were all dirty and bloody.

267
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,264
They'll be back in six,
eight hours tops.

268
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,099
But what are these?
They're not Ethan's.

269
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,600
They're not my old ones.

270
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,602
I keep a supply
of little boy pajamas

271
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,105
on hand at all times,
like everyone else.

272
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,065
No one else does that.

273
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,626
Hey, Shirley,
better get into the living room

274
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,336
- before the kids run out of hugs.
- Oh, yeah.

275
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,571
Kids, Grandma's coming.
Save me some hugs.

276
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,574
It's a long story.

277
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,201
Love to hear it. Come on.

278
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,953
Don't pull so hard.

279
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,621
Midge,
you're pulling the stitches.

280
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,667
Well?

281
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,045
I got into a scuffle.

282
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,297
That's your long story?
That wasn't even a haiku.

283
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,715
It was at the club.

284
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,192
You got into a fight
at the club? Where was Archie?

285
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,178
- I talked to Mei.
- Mei? Mei did not do this.

286
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,017
Joel? What about Mei?

287
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,561
There is no Mei, okay?

288
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,063
No Mei?

289
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,025
You broke up?
But what about the baby?

290
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,735
There's no Mei
and there's no baby.

291
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,028
There. You happy?

292
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,072
No baby? I...

293
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,991
No baby.

294
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,701
She's moving. Moved.

295
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,578
She's already in Chicago.

296
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,704
- It's over.
- I'm sorry.

297
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,664
- No.
- Sorry.

298
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,958
I was afraid something like this
would happen.

299
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,086
- Like what?
- I...

300
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,796
- She wasn't ready.
- How do you know?

301
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,959
I just had a feeling
after we talked at the hospital.

302
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,443
- At the hospital?
- When we discussed the kids and how it would work...

303
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,945
- You mean with Pop?
- ...she just didn't seem to be on the same page as you.

304
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,888
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

305
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,657
And you didn't think to maybe
give me a heads-up

306
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,743
that my whole fucking life was
about to come crashing down?

307
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,228
It was just a feeling I had,
an intuition.

308
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,081
You never should have spoken
to her in the first place.

309
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,874
- Joel...
- This is what could've pushed her over the edge.

310
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,483
Made her do what she did.

311
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,528
- Hey, that's not fair. She chose.
- With your help!

312
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,963
I'm gonna wait
till you get better to smack you

313
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,322
because now won't be fun.

314
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,661
I did nothing to push Mei away.

315
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,830
I've got eight hours
till my clothes are back.

316
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,415
I'm gonna go lie down.

317
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:54,047
- I could swing by your place and...
- I'm good.

318
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:03,348
Are you fucking kidding me?

319
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,891
Okay, so,
I thought I'd picked out

320
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,893
the perfect first day outfit
for <i>Gordon Ford.</i>

321
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,728
I mean, I spent hours
thinking about it,

322
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,532
sorting through multiple
color combinations,

323
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,566
but around 5:00 this morning,
something struck me.

324
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,859
Was it a blunt object?

325
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,318
- What?
- Go on.

326
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,279
This isn't a standing job.

327
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,655
It's a sitting job.

328
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,408
Huh. Explain.

329
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,076
B. Altman,
I stood at the counter.

330
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,411
That was a standing job.

331
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,055
Doing stand-up comedy,
that's a standing job.

332
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,622
I know how to dress for that,
but this,

333
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,208
working at <i>Gordon Ford,</i>
this is a sitting job,

334
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,919
predominantly,
so the skirt can't be straight.

335
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,772
I mean, it can be straight
if there's a slit in it,

336
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,339
but not a side slit, no.

337
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,608
If I shift in my seat,
even a little,

338
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,009
they'll get an eyeful.

339
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,719
A back slit is okay, like a...

340
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,387
like a tasteful vent extension,

341
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,181
but again, that's more
for ease of walking.

342
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,766
So that brings us back to flare.
It needs to flare.

343
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,619
And it needs to flare
in a way that will accommodate

344
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,520
a variety of
different sitting positions.

345
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,022
Interesting.
Really interesting.

346
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,232
- And that's why you called?
- Yep.

347
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:58,236
So, to review, you called me at
four-fucking-fifty-fucking-six

348
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,988
in the morning,
after hours of thought

349
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,151
and excessive consideration
about color combinations,

350
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,783
because you suddenly realized

351
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,452
that this job
would involve sitting?

352
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,078
- Yeah.
- But before that,

353
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,389
you thought that
the job was to stand

354
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,141
in front of Gordon Ford
for eight straight hours

355
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,626
and pitch jokes?
That is just fucking dumb.

356
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,544
I don't know what the job is.

357
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,046
New rule, for you

358
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,423
and the entire demented moronic
fucking Weissman clan,

359
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:22,010
no one, and I mean no one, is
allowed to ring my goddamn phone

360
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,221
before 10:30 in the morning
for any reason.

361
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,097
Here's a fresh cup, Miss Susie.

362
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,516
Unless It's Zelda.

363
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,142
'Cause I know if Zelda calls me,

364
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,870
she will make up for it
with something delicious.

365
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,562
- Thank you, Miss Susie.
- Mm-hmm.

366
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,064
Psst.

367
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,441
I have some major
household dish for you.

368
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,235
Is it dumb? Because really,
if it's dumb,

369
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,921
I am throwing you
out that goddamn window.

370
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,321
Zelda has a boyfriend.

371
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,031
A new one?
What happened to Janusz?

372
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,158
No, it is Janusz.
How do you know about Janusz?

373
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,952
She's been with him
for, like, four months.

374
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,429
I run into them on the nights
they hit the Village.

375
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,621
He's an excellent dancer.

376
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,831
How are you just
finding out about this?

377
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,185
- He just changed the hardware in the bathroom.
- That was him?

378
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,770
You didn't notice
a guy who looks like Mr. Clean

379
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,939
who's got a boner for Zelda
hanging out in your apartment?

380
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,603
Guess I'm not as observant
as I should be.

381
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,091
And you're
an observational comic.

382
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,985
I mean, really, there's
something missing in you.

383
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,428
Oh, shoot.
Drinks after work.

384
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,432
Not only do I need
an outfit for sitting at work,

385
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,683
but it has to be appropriate
for drinks with the gang.

386
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,935
Okay. This is not
a cocktail party.

387
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,187
It's a job. Here.

388
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,772
This...

389
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,400
with this and this.

390
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,237
- And this.
- Wow. That's great.

391
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,714
And you can sit in it
and everything?

392
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,299
I want to be sure
that you can sit in it.

393
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,908
- It's got enough flare?
- It's perfect.

394
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,868
- Going back to bed.
- Thank you, Susie.

395
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,370
Fuck you, Midge.

396
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,915
- No!
- Who is she talking to?

397
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,792
Sorry, I'm-I'm talking to him.

398
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,086
Subway weirdo.

399
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,056
Midge!

400
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,725
I said no.
I don't want to talk to you.

401
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:37,604
Please wait. I...
I never got a chance to explain.

402
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,147
Tell it to
your espresso machine.

403
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,565
Oh, Midge, come on.

404
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,403
Excuse me, excuse me.
Bad man behind me.

405
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,490
I have no phone number for you,
no address.

406
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,700
- I had no way to contact you.
- Good.

407
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,243
I didn't want you to contact me.

408
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,870
Chanel? Really nice.

409
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,014
I went to the park
every morning for weeks.

410
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,247
You never showed.

411
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,500
That's because I never went
back to the park.

412
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,294
I brought flowers every day
to apologize.

413
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,730
I hope you brought 'em home
to the wife.

414
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,255
It's a shame to waste flowers.

415
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,634
- Ah, that is nice.
- Mm-hmm.

416
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,387
Hey. Excuse me. Excuse me.

417
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,515
Two minutes.
That's all I ask. Look.

418
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,477
Two minutes!

419
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,317
Okay, that was fun and all,
but I just need to tell you...

420
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,864
Unbelievable.

421
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,410
Excuse me. Coming through.

422
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,620
- Make a hole, damn it.
- Rude!

423
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:36,955
Me?

424
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,683
You're the ones lined up
like the offensive line

425
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,418
of the Princeton Tigers.

426
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,297
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

427
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,049
I'd never done that, I swear.

428
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,884
Done what? Stalked a woman
on the subway?

429
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,761
Brought a woman
back to my place.

430
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,325
- You mean you and your wife's place.
- It's not what you think.

431
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,932
I'm sorry,
but we talked and talked,

432
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,684
and you never said
you were married.

433
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,561
- I'm not!
- So who was that, your sister?

434
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,414
Was your sister unhappy you were
sleeping with another woman?

435
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,541
- 'Cause that's a problem, too.
- You know, I'd really rather

436
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,358
that all of New York
not hear about this.

437
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,860
You're the one who started it.

438
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,486
Why are you going uptown now?

439
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,779
You were going downtown.

440
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,156
This is downtown.

441
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,742
Damn it.

442
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,543
Damn it. Midge? You here?

443
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,587
- Midge?
- Excuse me. Is there a problem?

444
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,606
I'm sorry, I was just looking
for a friend of mine.

445
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,341
Officer, that's the man who
assaulted me on the staircase.

446
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,677
- Assaulted you? When?
- I didn't assault anyone.

447
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,763
He cursed at us
and called us offensive.

448
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,432
- What the heck?
- They were blocking the staircase.

449
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,568
- Two minutes.
- Jesus H. Christ.

450
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,154
Then you never have to see me
again, I promise.

451
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,824
Tell him it's okay.

452
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,826
It's okay.

453
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,371
I messed up really bad.

454
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,081
I put you in an awful situation.

455
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,709
Awful? It was more than awful.

456
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,587
It was every synonym for awful,
you choose.

457
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,922
I'll work on one tonight.

458
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,674
- So, that was my wife.
- And not your sister.

459
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,343
But we were separated
and living apart.

460
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,595
That was my place.
She got our old house.

461
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,597
So, why'd she waltz in
like that?

462
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,932
To drop off the dog,

463
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,643
which she's supposed to do
with prior notice.

464
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,562
- And now we're getting divorced.
- You and the dog?

465
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,564
The marriage was over
long before I met you.

466
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:30,652
Look, Midge, meeting you,
the talks we had,

467
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,529
it was a lifesaver for me.

468
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,948
But I'm not here
to get you to reconsider.

469
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,950
I just want to apologize.

470
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,081
- How is the dog?
- She took the dog.

471
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,415
- What?
- And changed his name.

472
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,292
That's rotten.

473
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,711
Did I ruin Riverside Park
for you? Tell me I didn't.

474
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,506
Just temporarily.
I'm back in it now.

475
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,716
Good, 'cause it's a great park.

476
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,510
It is.

477
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:59,013
Well, maybe we'll run into each
other there again, sometime.

478
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,640
Maybe.

479
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,475
Maybe's good.

480
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,143
I'll take maybe.

481
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,396
Bye, Midge.

482
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,398
Goodbye, Sylvio.

483
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,485
I'm rooting for you, son.

And you say Gordon hired you?

Gordon doesn't hire
people personally.

499
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,404
I know it's unusual,
but he came to my strip club,

500
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,780
uh, my club,

501
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,074
- where I perform.
- Oh, I get it.

502
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,577
No, you don't.
I'm a stand-up. A comedian.

503
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,245
So, you're here
to be on the show?

504
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,039
You have to be booked
to be on the show.

505
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,624
You can't just walk in
off the street

506
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,000
and ask to be booked
on the show.

507
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,669
I didn't just walk in
off the street. Oh, wait.

508
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,172
He knows me. Mike! Mike! Mike!

509
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,341
Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike!

510
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,384
Mike! Mike! Midge Maisel.

511
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,720
Let her in.

512
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,685
You and I haven't
officially met.

513
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,646
Look, Mike,

514
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,457
I know you and Susie
got off to a rocky start.

515
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,025
Rocky start.
You're... very funny.

516
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,045
But now I'm here, and don't you
think it would be best to...

517
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,189
Do you know it has no smell?

518
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,988
What? What doesn't?

519
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,156
My tree.

520
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,616
Because it's
a piece of shit tree

521
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,059
that I grabbed
in haste to get away

522
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,662
from your little troll
of a manager. My apartment has

523
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,455
no Christmassy smell

524
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,915
'cause the goddamn tree

525
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,125
is a piece of shit,
lifeless tree.

526
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,919
You are gonna learn to like me.

527
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,672
Boy, you two, peas in a pod.

528
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,632
It may take a month,
two months tops.

529
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,092
Hell, give me six months,

530
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,694
and you and I are bowling
and drinking beer.

531
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,905
Look, I got to go, but would you
deliver a message to Susie?

532
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:03,929
Sure.

533
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,684
I will pass it on.

534
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,061
You're late, by the way.

535
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,898
Those are the writers?
Is that...

536
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,167
Is that where
I'm supposed to go?

537
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,610
- That's the writers' room. Go.
- Thanks.

538
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,156
- Oop.
- You don't think he could direct

539
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,367
- a drama, Alvin?
- Mel was on Caesar with me.

540
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,661
I have no problem with
Mel Brooks. I like Mel Brooks.

541
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,162
Mel Brooks is funny.

542
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,622
- But?
- Here it comes.

543
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,249
- He likes air.
- Oh!

544
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,126
Oh, does he like air.

545
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,004
He comes in a room like a
Hoover, and he sucks it all up.

546
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,715
Ask Simon. Ask Gelbart.
Hell, ask Sid.

547
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,175
The green-eyed monster doth
mock the meat it feeds on.

548
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,094
Geez, Cess, Shakespeare
before noon?

549
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,595
My only request, dear Alvin,

550
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,806
please stop taking your hatred
for Mel Brooks

551
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,891
out on me just because
we share a name.

552
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,102
- I don't hate Mel Brooks.
- Me neither.

553
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,313
Hi.

554
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,398
Am I in the right place?

555
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,481
- No.
- Don't think so.

556
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,668
This is the writers' room,
right?

557
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,128
- Pretty much. - Who's asking?
- We're writers in a room.

558
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,820
Well, I'm your new writer.

559
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,196
Alvin?

560
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,049
George mentioned some girl
was starting with us.

561
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,073
He didn't say when.

562
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,326
Well, I'm some girl,

563
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,785
and today is the day.
Who's George?

564
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,954
- You'll know him when you see him.
- Mothballs.

565
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,831
- Boat shoes.
- I have boat shoes.

566
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,726
I wouldn't have minded being
consulted about a new hire,

567
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,544
but I'm just the head writer,
so what do I know? Milly?

568
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,087
- Midge.
- Midge?

569
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,149
Never trust people whose names
don't rhyme with anything.

570
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,467
Smidge. Bridge. Fridge.

571
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,508
Shit.

572
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,095
That's Ralph, Mel, Adam, Cecil,

573
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,721
- and I'm Alvin. Sit.
- Great.

574
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,473
Got my sitting outfit on.

575
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,516
- Your what?
- It's a flared skirt

576
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,869
for sitting instead of standing.

577
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,537
I mean, you can stand in it,
but it looks good

578
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,562
when you're sitting, too.

579
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,439
Got that versatility,
like pants.

580
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,107
So, Gordon's
in a foul mood.

581
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,526
- Again?
- What in that man's charmed life is so terrible?

582
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,712
- He's given up smoking.
- Oh, Jesus.

583
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:42,880
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, for God's sake.

584
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,256
And he doesn't want
anyone else

585
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,656
smoking in the office.

586
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,676
If he gets divorced, does
everyone else have to, too?

587
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,619
Can I finish
this one at least? No?

588
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,788
Guess cancer will have to wait.

589
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,432
First they came
for the cigarettes,

590
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,707
and I did not speak out.

591
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,125
So, let's get going here, boys.

592
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,252
- Give me a good mix, 20 in one.
- Uh...

593
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,105
What... Wait, where...

594
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,131
Um, Alvin, what's 20 in one?

595
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,966
Yeah?

596
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,319
Yeah, I know
Bernstein's tonight.

597
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,011
I read the memo.

598
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,597
No, I'm not gonna hand him
a bunch of dumb Maestro jokes.

599
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,350
Come on, Alex. Just give him
a goddamn cigarette.

600
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,689
Hi. Hey.

601
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,733
Any idea what 20 in one is?

602
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,194
Nope.

603
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,154
<i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

604
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,198
Yes, he's quit smoking.

605
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,699
Well, we're spreading
the word now,

606
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,910
we weren't keeping it from you.

607
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,038
Yes, we all have
to quit smoking.

608
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,998
Oh, hi, Midge.
Susie, it's Midge.

609
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,835
She sounds a little weird.

610
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,128
How's it going, champ?

611
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:43,005
Panic. I'm in a panic. Oh, boy.

612
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,924
- Take a deep breath.
- I'm hyperventilating.

613
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,652
<i>Stick
your head between your legs.</i>

614
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,010
Who is that? Dinah?

615
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,971
Or have a cigarette.

616
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,032
<i>- What is wrong with you?</i>
- Why didn't you tell me

617
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,056
<i>about 20 in one?</i>

618
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,685
I don't know. What is 20 in one?

619
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,687
The head writer just sent us
off to do 20 in one.

620
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,856
It's 20 jokes in one hour,
and that was eight minutes ago,

621
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:03,067
so I've got... I'm so freaked
out, I can't even do the math.

622
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,986
You've got 52 minutes
to write 20 jokes.

623
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,114
Quick math here, that's a joke
every 2.6 minutes. Ha.

624
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,866
<i>- Finally using math.</i>
- Not helping.

625
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,552
And I'm assuming they need to be
broadcast quality jokes.

626
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:12,576
Each one a winner.

627
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,329
Dinah, why are you on the phone?

628
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,692
I got her on
to listen and learn.

629
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,099
It's how all
the big agencies do it.

630
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,083
You're now down to a joke
every 2.5 minutes.

631
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,543
You're not supposed
to talk, Dinah.

632
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,253
I don't toss jokes off
like that.

633
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,589
They take time. I mold them,

634
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,191
massage them,
and now I'm just blanking,

635
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,466
and the clock is ticking.

636
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,736
Well, let's prime the pump here,
get the juices flowing.

637
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,972
How about this? Uh, Washington
Square Park isn't square,

638
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,057
it's a rectangle, so they
should change the name

639
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,726
to Washington Rectangle Park.

640
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,603
- Oh, that's cute.
- That's a terrible joke.

641
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,813
Yeah, well I'm not the
fucking joke writer. You are.

642
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,440
No, I'm not. I told you that.

643
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,984
Well, you've got the job,
so fake it till you make it.

644
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:48,154
I should check my notebook.
See if anything inspires me.

645
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,531
All that matters is that
Gordon Ford thinks you're funny.

646
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,742
How's it going with him?
You two bonding?

647
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,469
I haven't seen him.
I think he's in a different part

648
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,513
of the building. And was I
supposed to have an office?

649
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:57,890
<i>Because I don't seem
to have an office.</i>

650
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:58,914
I didn't think about that.

651
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,125
Barely even have a chair,

652
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,768
and I-I have no idea
where the ladies' room is,

653
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,270
and everyone seems
to be talking in code,

654
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,504
and Mike Carr wanted me
to pass this on to you.

655
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:06,940
<i>I assume
you're flipping me off.</i>

656
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,925
Both fingers. I got to go.

657
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,510
Got to start thinking...
writing. Goodbye.

658
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,473
<i>Gordon Ford Show.</i>

659
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,600
I really loved him.

660
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,893
He's the one I miss.

661
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,770
How did your second husband die?

662
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,772
Well, it was the darndest thing.

663
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,583
It was winter, and he was
walking down the street

664
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,525
- when he slipped on ice.
- Oh, my God.

665
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,320
It gets worse.
The street was on a hill,

666
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,123
and he slid all the way down
where these men

667
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,990
- were running a wood chipper.
- Oh, my God.

668
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,785
It gets worse.
Rose, where are you going?

669
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,873
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

670
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,708
- What happened?
- A fire happened, lady.

671
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:43,792
Now, please, back away.

672
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,711
- But how?
- Could be electrical,

673
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:46,897
could be arson,
we don't know yet.

674
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,047
Arson...

675
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,049
This is too much.

676
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,717
This is too damn much.

677
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,803
What is, Rose?
What's too damn much?

678
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,222
My tearoom.

679
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,604
Mr. Carr, Florence on 2.

680
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,530
I think that was
just 59 minutes.

681
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,949
Shut up. All right, Mel,
you look smug

682
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,326
and self-satisfied.
Start us off.

683
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,537
"Last week marked
the Broadway debut of <i>Camelot</i>

684
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,847
and the off-Broadway debut
of <i>Cam-A-Little."</i>

685
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,099
Put it in the maybes.

686
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,165
- Adam?
- Uh...

687
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,249
"It's that time of year,

688
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,652
kids are writing
letters to Santa."

689
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,770
He doesn't like Santa jokes.

690
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,170
Can I finish?

691
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,922
"Isn't the faith
of a child amazing?

692
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,025
To believe that Santa Claus
will come down your chimney

693
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,302
with presents, even after
seeing him hungover at Macy's."

694
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,304
- He doesn't like Santa jokes.
- Shit.

695
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,639
- Ralphy?
- Skipping over my Santa jokes.

696
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,975
Uh, "So, you may have heard
that NASA is planning

697
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,601
to send a chimp into space.

698
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,562
They wanted to send a chump,
but Jerry Lewis

699
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,023
and my producer George
refused to go."

700
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,625
Run it by George,
see if it bothers him.

701
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,249
They need to cut
to a shot of him. Cecil?

702
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,778
I miss Nixon.

703
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:55,072
- And?
- Oh, that's it, that's all I got.

704
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:57,825
Astounding professionalism,
Cess. I'll get back to you.

705
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,368
New girl?

706
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,245
Oh, uh... that's me.

707
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:02,514
Only one with girl parts
in the room.

708
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,664
Don't make assumptions.

Gesundheit.

748
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:38,175
Thank you. You should probably
be getting to your lunch.

749
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:40,177
Oh, dear,
I lost track of the time.

750
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,887
Gesundheit.

751
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,848
I'd go, but this damn cold.

752
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,100
Maury downstairs has
a really bad cold, too.

753
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,727
Anything specific you want me
to discuss with her, or...

754
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,271
It's just a
"get to know you" lunch.

755
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,165
She'll talk up some things
she wants to bring to New York,

756
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,276
bend your ear a little bit.
She liked your review, too.

757
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,777
Gesundheit.

758
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,070
- Thank you.
- Which one?

759
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,239
That comedy she transferred
from the West End.

760
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,532
<i>A Pudding for Nigel.</i>

761
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,033
Oh, that was wonderful.

762
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,410
I did pick at it a little bit.

763
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,620
And she made changes
based on your criticism.

764
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:08,789
Said they made it so much...

765
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,708
so much...

766
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,293
Let's go with "better."

767
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,836
Penelope is a true Brit.

768
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,939
Her father owns six newspapers,
her mother is a baroness,

769
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,756
they're very chummy
with the Royals.

770
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,133
- Wow.
- She'll tell you stories.

771
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,594
- Great stories. It'll be fun.
- I'll report back.

772
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,013
And the <i>Voice</i> pays for lunch.
We take no favors.

773
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,140
Got it.

774
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,142
I was going to say "better."

775
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,977
We figured.

776
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:46,869
Francie.

777
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,206
Double, triple,
quadruple-check this.

778
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,500
If they crap out again,
we find a new car service.

779
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,044
- How was your morning?
- Really?

780
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,880
Just trying to break the ice.
I gave Susie your message.

781
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,591
Well, there he is,
spectacularly late,

782
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,676
as always. Harassing the staff.

783
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,054
- Oh, he's in fine form.
- Who is that?

784
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,181
That is George Toledano,

785
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,558
venerated producer
of <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

786
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,311
Oh. I've been hearing about him.
Would you mind introducing us?

787
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,938
I want him to die.

788
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,482
- So, I should introduce myself?
- A long,

789
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,484
painful death.
I want him to fall off

790
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,778
that stupid tiny dinghy
he calls a yacht,

791
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,154
but I don't want him to drown.

792
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,989
I want him to float

793
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,950
on a splintery piece
of driftwood.

794
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,953
That asinine, condescending,
supercilious...

795
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,621
George. How are you today?

796
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,165
Mikey, my boy.
How's it going, old sport?

797
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,417
Oh, you know, George,
same old, same old.

798
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,628
I don't believe I've met
this sight for sore eyes.

799
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,547
I'm a new writer, sir.
Midge Maisel.

800
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,674
I heard we had a lady writer
coming aboard.

801
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,926
Nice to meet you.
And call me George.

802
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,427
You can call me George, too.

803
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,221
Funny. I like that.

804
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,681
You must know Madelyn Pugh.

805
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,391
I don't think so.

806
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,685
Wrote for <i>I Love Lucy?</i>
Funny lady.

807
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,080
How about, uh, Nancy Clark?
Writes for <i>The Ann Sothern Show.</i>

808
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,915
Oh, she doesn't know
every lady writer, George.

809
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,567
- Nice to have you here.
- Thank you.

810
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,151
- Nice boat shoes.
- Ooh.

811
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,195
You certainly
beautify the place.

812
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,531
I can cancel those
new plants I ordered.

813
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:10,202
He gets kissy at parties,
so watch yourself.

814
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:12,204
- Thanks for the warning.
- Goddamn it.

815
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,417
Goddamn writers
handing me this crap.

816
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,590
Can we just toss
cigarettes at him?

817
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,050
- Lit?
- That's a fire hazard.

818
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:26,677
Back to the
drawing board, fellas.

819
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,761
Let's assemble.

820
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,281
They'll
get us there, Gordy.

821
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,889
They always do.

822
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,309
- Unbelievable. - Wow.
- God.

823
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,103
So, what's the deal?

824
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,105
He wants them shorter
and not topical.

825
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,188
Now he tells us.

826
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,483
Wasted the whole morning.

827
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,318
Until the bell, guys.
20 in one.

828
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,488
- I need coffee.
- Trudy, coffee run.

829
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:49,825
Everything shut down during the
war. The arts were decimated.

830
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,201
Were you there the whole time?

831
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:53,037
I was in London
during the Blitz.

832
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,413
I saw the German Luftwaffe

833
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,873
flying through the air.

834
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,042
My grandmother's house
in Mayfair was bombed.

835
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,044
- My God.
- She lived,

836
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,229
but we thought
the world had ended.

837
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,049
Then, in '44, Larry did
<i>Richard the Third.</i>

838
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,425
- Larry?
- Olivier.

839
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,926
- Ah.
- I sat in the front row,

840
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,764
and, I don't know, my faith
in mankind was restored.

841
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,783
- I knew that we could beat Hitler.
- That's wonderful.

842
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:14,892
Then I slept with Larry.

843
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,727
That's better than
sleeping with Hitler.

844
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,313
I know it sounds silly, but that
helped restore my faith, too.

845
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,523
- Mm.
- Our <i>île flottante,</i>

846
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,692
- and it's on the house.
- Darling boy, thank you.

847
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,778
<i>- L'addition,</i> s'il vous plait?
- Right away.

848
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,780
Abraham, I'll leave you
with this,

849
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,156
Harold Pinter.

850
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,158
I'm bringing <i>The Birthday Party</i>
here in spring,

851
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,535
- and I want you to see it.
- I'd love to.

852
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,497
He's not for everybody,
but I think he's a mad genius,

853
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,583
and he's only 30,
such a young, virile age.

854
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,168
The Nobel is in his future.

855
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,045
- I'll be there.
- Music to my ears.

856
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,756
Oh, dear, it's so much later
than I thought.

857
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,550
Ah, this is on the <i>Voice.</i>

858
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,344
So kind.

859
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,222
I should bring my wife here.
She'd love this place.

860
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,682
She's such a Francophile.

861
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,433
- My husband is French.
- Ah.

862
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:59,478
They should meet. Now,
I'm so sorry, I have to dash.

863
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,438
More <i>île flottante pour moi.</i>

864
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:05,109
If I had known I'd be
dining with such a charming man,

865
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,777
I'd have scheduled time
to linger.

866
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,488
Next time I won't make
that mistake.

867
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,827
{\an8}This...

868
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,495
{\an8}this wallet

869
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,163
{\an8}is so old.

870
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,540
{\an8}I really need

871
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,041
{\an8}change it out.

872
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,127
I'm trying to

873
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,797
remember how old it is.
Maybe seven, eight years.

874
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,758
You don't think to change
your wallet till you get one

875
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:32,094
as a gift, but if you
don't get one as a gift,

876
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,012
you never change your wallet.

877
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,432
- How are you liking it?
- Liking what?

878
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,975
The, uh, dessert?

879
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,227
Ah, it's... it's...

880
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,396
ve-ve-very-very good, very
fine. Here.

881
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,398
- Ah. <i>Merci.</i>
- Here.

882
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,983
You are silly.

883
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,736
At times, yes,
but at other times

884
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,697
I'm more... dramatic,

885
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,950
like Olivier, or not Olivier,
I'm nothing like Olivier.

886
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,785
I'm more like...

887
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,996
Buster Keaton,

888
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,206
just a big, old,

889
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,293
sad, floppy clown boy.

890
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,587
Sweet.

891
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,173
Till next time.

892
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,241
They've been gone a long time.
That's a good sign, right?

893
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,767
Not necessarily. Last Tuesday?

894
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,351
We almost didn't make it to air.

895
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:23,246
- Should I get my typewriter?
- Do not get your typewriter.

896
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,248
- What are we waiting for?
- The verdict from rehearsal.

897
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,774
Here they come.
Duck and cover.

898
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,776
- Ah, hell.
- Goddamn it, Teddy.

899
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,903
- I love you guys, too.
- What happened?

900
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,186
He's the cue card guy. Means
the monologue's not locked.

901
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,133
- Should I get my typewriter?
- Do not get your typewriter.

902
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,492
- What's left?
- Zip.

903
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,303
- He threw the entire thing out.
- Holy shit.

904
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:39,578
It's one hour to show.

905
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:40,847
Should've gotten my typewriter.

906
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:41,997
Definitely.

907
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,373
I know it's disappointing, gang,

908
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:45,083
but ours is not to reason why,

909
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,294
ours is but to write
new jokes or die.

910
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:51,298
Now, I've got to go say hello
to Angie Dickinson.

911
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,884
Poor me.

912
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:57,095
Okay, guys, lightning round.
Old, new, whatever you got.

913
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,639
Oh, shit.

914
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,074
- Trudy, hustle.
- I'm already in.

915
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,558
Gordon wants 'em topical.

916
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:03,161
You said before
he wanted 'em not topical.

917
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,771
Gordon is large, he contains
multitudes. Ralphy?

918
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,898
Uh, topical, topical...

919
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,484
Uh, "Emily Post died,
so now no one knows

920
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,420
the proper etiquette
to send their condolences."

921
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,005
Not bad. Get it down. Cess?

922
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,349
Uh, "I went to the premiere
of a French film the other day.

923
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,700
It's called
<i>Le Hau-hau-hau-hau-hauuu."</i>

924
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,869
"Translates roughly into English as

925
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,454
<i>Le Hau-hau-hau-hau-hauuu."</i>

926
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,665
Not bad. We should follow
it up with something. Mel?

927
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,959
<i>"Ben-Hur,</i> if he's a him,
what's with the Hur?"

928
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,002
- Pass. Adam?
- Uh, "Some sad news,

929
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,380
Clark Gable passed away.
He's survived by his wife,

930
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,703
his children and his mustache."

931
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,716
He loved Gable.
Put it in. Who else?

932
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,303
Uh, well, I worked on some
new stuff during rehearsal.

933
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,097
- You what?
- Jesus.

934
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,033
- I worked on some new stuff.
- She jinxed it.

935
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,600
- You jinxed it.
- Jinxed what?

936
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:45,477
We never work on new stuff
during rehearsal,

937
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,437
- ever.
- What? Why?

938
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,773
It guarantees that Gordon's
gonna throw everything out.

939
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:52,150
I'm sorry, Gordon somehow knew
I was sitting in a bathroom

940
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,610
stall jotting down jokes?

941
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,588
That's why he threw out
the script? Is he omniscient?

942
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:56,822
If anyone is...

943
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,199
Let the girl pitch.
Go on, Midge.

944
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:00,659
Thank you, Alvin.

945
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,328
<i>"The Unsinkable Molly Brown</i>

946
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,538
is a new show on Broadway.

947
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,723
I heard that the ushers
are seating

948
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,499
women and children first."

949
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,543
She was on the <i>Titanic.</i>

950
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,128
He nixed a <i>Molly Brown</i> joke
last week.

951
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,371
- Mine.
- Got another?

952
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,214
Yeah, um...

953
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:17,426
"There's gonna be a baby in
the White House, little JFK Jr.

00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,677
It'll be a clean transition.

955
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,904
White House staff

956
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,680
how to change diapers
with Eisenhower."

957
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,307
"A" for effort. Cess?

958
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,475
- Oh, now wait a minute.
- Yeah?

959
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,394
I'm sorry,
but that last one was funny.

960
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,354
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

961
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,440
- No one laughed.
- I think the audience would,

962
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,750
and it's topical,
he wants topical.

963
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:33,942
A joke is not funny

964
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,295
just because you say it's funny.

965
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,237
No, it's not funny
because I say it's funny.

966
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,614
It's funny because it's funny.

967
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,532
- And you know funny?
- Yeah, I know funny.

968
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,242
Great. Alvin,
put my <i>Ben-Hur</i> joke in

969
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,053
because I know funny,
and I think it's funny.

970
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,717
- Mel...
- Your <i>Ben-Hur</i> joke was not funny.

971
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:48,123
- Oh, really?
- Or topical or fresh.

972
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,918
Wasn't even funny when I heard
Jack Paar do it two weeks ago.

973
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,294
- Oh!
- Alvin.

974
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,630
We have no time for this.
Sorry. Cess, go.

975
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,131
Okay, uh...

976
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,442
"There's a commercial
for dishwashing soap.

977
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,301
- Any of you see it?"
- I bet she did.

978
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:03,305
Hi, yes,
he's expecting your call.

979
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,599
Abe, how was your meeting?

980
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,476
Cover your goddamn
mouth, Terrence.

981
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,199
- That was harsh.
- Gabe, Gabe.

982
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,605
- Abe, you okay?
- I've got a question,

983
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,899
and be honest because

984
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,109
I don't know all the intricacies

985
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,819
of New York theater customs...

986
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,655
Okay.

987
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,991
{\an8}Is this sexual?

988
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,826
So many thoughts

989
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,346
running through my mind
right now, Abe.

990
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,455
- You're wondering why I'm asking.
- Very much.

991
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,540
At my lunch with Penelope,

992
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,417
it was all going so smoothly.

993
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,921
We talked about theater
and criticism and the war.

994
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:39,341
{\an8}Then she did this
with her hand,

995
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,134
{\an8}- and it felt...
- Sexual?

996
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:42,678
{\an8}- Yes.
- That's because it is.

997
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,972
{\an8}I knew it.

998
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,140
{\an8}So, it was a sexualized gesture.

999
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,684
{\an8}One of the oldest.

1000
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,812
{\an8}You can remove your hand now.

1001
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,397
I don't get it.

1002
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,107
I don't get it. It was lunch.

1003
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,483
So?

1004
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:59,361
Nothing sexual happens
before 7:00 in the evening,

1005
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,113
6:30 at the earliest.

1006
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,825
Never at 1:42 in the afternoon
on a Monday.

1007
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,077
I am learning a lot
about you today.

1008
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,663
I've been racking my brain,
trying to think if I said

1009
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,207
something that gave her
the wrong impression.

1010
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,960
Was I too kind
to <i>A Pudding for Nigel?</i>

1011
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,086
Is that all it takes?

1012
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,271
That, and a hearty Bordeaux.

1013
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,356
How did you know we had wine?

1014
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,756
Because you smell like wine.

1015
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,550
Oh, my God, we had wine.

1016
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,152
You know, she's never made
a pass at me. Terrence,

1017
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,445
has Penelope ever made
a pass at you?

1018
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,304
Uh-uh. She knows
I'm a homosexual.

1019
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,390
- What? Since when?
- Since birth, probably.

1020
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,493
- But you're married.
- Oh, I left my wife years ago.

1021
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,517
I live with Maury now.

1022
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,020
From accounting? With the cold.

1023
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,438
Terrence, we need to talk more.

1024
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,857
Gabe, what do I tell my wife?

1025
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,277
- Your wife?
- Yes, my wife.

1026
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,653
Nothing.

1027
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:43,739
- Abe, nothing happened.
- Nothing happened,

1028
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,282
but something happened.

1029
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,075
But nothing happened.

1030
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,077
She'll know. She'll sense it.

1031
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:52,164
Abe, do not tell her
about Penelope.

1032
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,332
About you and me just now,
yes, but not her,

1033
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,536
and I promise never to put you
in that position again.

1034
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:57,585
You are too tempting.

1035
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:58,838
Gabe.

1036
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,256
- It's all in the past.
- Maybe.

1037
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,799
It's in the past.
Say it with me.

1038
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:04,760
It's in the past.

1039
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,720
Good.

1040
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,347
- Wasn't Maury married?
- He lived with his sister.

1041
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:12,559
That was his sister?
I am so out of the loop.

1042
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,396
He's on the move!

1043
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,999
- He's on the move.
- He's on the move.

1044
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,667
- He's on the move.
- Where's Adam?

1045
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,693
- Yeah, where is Adam?
- It's showtime.

1046
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,236
I was saying hi to my parents.

1047
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,240
What are you, 14?

1048
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,674
Keep
the aisles clear.

1049
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,493
And if you do have to leave,
please do so quietly.

1050
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:32,079
Emergency exit doors are
on both sides in the back.

1051
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,997
Other than that,
make a lot of noise

1052
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,476
when it comes to showing Gordo
you are happy to be here.

1053
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,210
- Do we have a monologue?
- No idea.

1054
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,646
You sound like a
great audience, guys. Feel free

1055
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,172
to laugh at anything
you find funny,

1056
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,673
and applaud
when we light the sign.

1057
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:50,180
Whoa. Whoa.

1058
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,807
We didn't even light the sign.

1059
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,309
You're already disobeying orders.

1060
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,037
We got a great show tonight.
See you in a minute.

1061
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:02,150
Okay, so let's do Clark Gable,
Emily Post, the NASA joke,

1062
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:03,878
the automat joke
that we dropped on Friday...

1063
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,838
put that next to last... and did
the Dennis the Red Menace thing

1064
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,507
- make it past the censors?
- They didn't flag it.

1065
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:08,591
We're basically saying
the kid's a communist.

1066
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:09,615
They didn't flag it.

1067
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,034
Put it in.
And I'll throw in a riff

1068
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:13,054
about the hat on the lady in the
second row. She wore that thing

1069
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,579
- to be noticed.
- You got it, boss.

1070
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:15,914
- Teddy?
- I thrive on this.

1071
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:16,997
Good man.

1072
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,500
The cavalry comes through again.

1073
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,583
Wow.

1074
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,836
Right down to the wire.

1075
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,170
He keeps us on our toes.

1076
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:23,588
Places,
everyone.

1077
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:25,298
Places, everyone.

1078
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:26,800
Sorry about before.

1079
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:30,095
I checked with a friend,
Paar did do that joke. Fuck me.

1080
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,430
Hey, Teddy, you posing
for the <i>Kama Sutra?</i>

1081
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:33,825
Up yours, Mel.

1082
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,201
Ladies and gentlemen,

1083
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,936
it's <i>The Gordon Ford Show!</i>

1084
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,399
Tonight's guests:
Angie Dickinson,

1085
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,527
Steve Lawrence,
and novelist Ray Bradbury.

1086
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,112
Now here's your host,

1087
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,823
Gordon Ford!

1088
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,540
Thanks, everyone.
Thanks for coming out.

1089
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,503
It's getting festive here
in New York, isn't it?

1090
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,085
With all the twinkling lights

1091
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,670
and window displays
and chestnuts

1092
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,255
roasting over
an open trash can fire.

1093
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,066
He doesn't like us in his eyeline.

1094
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,675
It's a generous
time of year.

1095
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,695
- My mom looks so old.
- A guy picked the wallet

1096
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,780
right out of my pocket,
gave it back to me gift-wrapped.

1097
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,282
I mean it, it had a ribbon
on it and everything.

1098
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,308
George, you've had
your pocket picked.

1099
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,536
Did you ever get that original
copy of the Magna Carta back?

1100
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,455
I told you not to carry
that thing around like that.

1101
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,065
More fool me.

1102
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,359
Of course, you've all heard
the sad news,

1103
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:28,629
- the great Clark Gable has passed away.
- Aw...

1104
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,298
He's survived
by his wife, his children,

1105
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,532
and his mustache.

1106
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:35,452
Now, ma'am, is that a hat,
or is your hair on fire?

1107
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,708
'Cause we can help you.
We have firemen

1108
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,600
standing right outside.
They can rush right in here,

1109
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,375
hose you down real quick,
free of charge.

1110
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:47,964
How's Chaim? How's my baby boy?

1111
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,233
<i>Oh,
he's just the greatest</i>

1112
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,634
<i>little man on the planet.</i>

1113
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:51,736
You should have seen
the other day,

1114
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,040
he was playing
with a basketball,

1115
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,094
but he's so tiny,

1116
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,472
he rolled right over
the top of it

1117
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:56,973
<i>and did a complete somersault.</i>

1118
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,600
I wish I'd seen that.

1119
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,661
The ball landed on top of him.
He never let go of it.

1120
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:01,685
It was too cute.

1121
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:03,396
Noah, listen, I'm calling
with a question,

1122
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,731
then I'll let you go.

1123
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,858
- Sure.
- Could you order a quick raid on an enemy?

1124
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:09,444
- Pardon?
<i>- I know the CIA</i>

1125
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,030
is very busy. I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

1126
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:15,116
Mom, what? I'm an analyst.
I've told you a million times.

1127
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,600
<i>I wouldn't need to know
the details.</i>

1128
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,744
<i>I respect your privacy.</i>

1129
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,788
What enemy?
What are you talking about?

1130
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:23,500
It's this, uh, shall we say,
"coterie" I'm dealing with.

1131
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,628
I'm talking something fast,
unexpected, but severe.

1132
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,463
A very fast, hard attack.

1133
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,924
Well, short answer, Ma,
I cannot order a raid.

1134
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,069
Well, can I speak to someone
in the raid department, then?

1135
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:34,320
You could just
give me the number.

1136
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,679
We don't have a raid department.

1137
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,889
Ma, who the hell is this
"coterie" you want to raid?

1138
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:39,557
Just some women.

1139
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:41,184
They meet occasionally
in Coney Island,

1140
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:42,828
and I just thought,
if I knew they were there

1141
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:45,146
at a specific time, you could
firebomb it or something.

1142
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,648
Ma, I'm at work.

1143
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,191
Perfect, can you ask
a colleague?

1144
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,360
They sometimes monitor
these calls, Ma.

1145
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,945
We cannot talk about this.

1146
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,822
Oh. Well, should I
call back later?

1147
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,448
We could use a code word.

1148
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:57,701
- How about "flower girl"?
- No!

1149
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:00,120
Well, then should we meet
in the park at dusk?

1150
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:01,496
<i>I read about spies doing that.</i>

1151
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,873
I really can't continue
this conversation.

1152
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,333
Oh, your father's home.

1153
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,919
Abe, would you like
to say hi to Noah?

1154
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,212
Hi.

1155
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:10,773
<i>Pop, what the hell
is going on with...</i>

1156
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,424
- Abe?
- Hi.

1157
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,260
Are you all right?

1158
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,679
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.

1159
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,848
How was your day? Did you

1160
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,600
make some good matches
at the tearoom?

1161
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:25,228
Oh, yes. Yes, I, um,

1162
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:27,063
went to the tearoom.

1163
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:28,648
How was the tea?

1164
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:31,276
It was very nice.

1165
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,861
Corinne and I went there,

1166
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,864
and it was exactly
as it always is.

1167
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,866
- Very nice.
- That's nice.

1168
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,784
Mm. Did you have a nice day?

1169
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:43,455
Just a... typical, nice Monday.

1170
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:46,833
Yeah, ate dessert at my desk,

1171
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,252
typed some, the usual.

1172
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:50,879
What did you have for dessert?

1173
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,298
Did I say dessert? Lunch.

1174
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,175
I ate lunch.

1175
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:01,681
You want to go out to dinner?

1176
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:04,559
<i>Rose, that's awful.</i>

1177
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,437
I wasn't gonna tell you because
I didn't want to worry you.

1178
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,439
But it was just so upsetting,

1179
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,107
watching the place
burn like that.

1180
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:14,069
And the smell, oolong and ash.

1181
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,654
You know you can always
tell me anything.

1182
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:20,241
The tearoom was my office.
I met all my clients there.

1183
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,577
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without it.

1184
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,872
The whole place smelled
like a... wedding cake.

1185
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:34,798
{\an8}Abe. What is this?

1186
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,758
A fondly intentioned

1187
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:39,344
sexualized gesture.

1188
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,388
Oh.

1189
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,351
Well, it is past 7:00.

1190
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,145
Am I supposed to do
something in return?

1191
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:50,939
I think it's optional.

1192
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,857
Okay.

1193
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,537
- I told you there'd be drinks.
<i>- But it's okay</i>

1194
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,181
because your outfit
was made for sitting,

1195
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,957
and you sit in a bar, right?

1196
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,583
The flare can accommodate that?

1197
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,502
You know, I'm tired
of people mocking me

1198
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:15,171
for thinking about how a dress
works in different situations.

1199
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:17,340
So, Toots Shor's
is their hangout, huh?

1200
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:19,509
They come here
because Gordon doesn't.

1201
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,261
He got into some fight
with Toots

1202
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,846
and won't set foot in the place.

1203
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,615
- They call it their sanctuary.
<i>- I got to start working</i>

1204
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:25,839
that place. It's a good place.

1205
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,851
Susie...

1206
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:29,936
- the job is weird.
- How so?

1207
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:31,729
They don't think I'm funny.

1208
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:32,856
Well, they don't have to,

1209
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:34,041
so long as Gordon
thinks you're funny.

1210
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,608
The day felt like a week,

1211
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,253
and we have to do it
all over again tomorrow

1212
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:38,987
and then the next day
and the next.

1213
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,470
Well, you better not fucking
call me about tomorrow's outfit.

1214
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:42,615
I won't.

1215
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:44,868
Now go mingle.
Make some friends.

1216
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,203
Be confident.
You love an audience.

1217
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:48,872
Think of those guys
as your audience.

1218
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,040
<i>- Use 'em.</i>
- I'll try.

1219
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:53,084
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

1220
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,108
...rushes ahead of me
at the front of the line,

1221
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:01,801
buys the same can of tuna
every day,

1222
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:03,386
89 cents.

1223
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:04,846
She's counting out pennies.

1224
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,391
"One, two,
I lost my place, one, two..."

1225
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:11,436
I'm going nuts.

1226
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,854
Sure?

1227
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,689
Harvard did teach me
manners, after all.

1228
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,275
Along with very useful Greek
and how to hit a shuttlecock.

1229
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,236
There's not a bomb
underneath it, is there?

1230
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,697
Are you kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1231
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,073
He made peace
with Toots?

1232
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,157
Not to my knowledge.

1233
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:26,438
I personally
heard him call Toots

1234
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:28,077
a fat fuck not two weeks ago.

1235
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:29,180
They almost came to blows
that time.

1236
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,205
They had to be separated.

1237
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,640
- What changed?
- Hey, all.

1238
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,917
- Good show tonight.
- Hey.

1239
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,460
Tough journey,
but we got it there.

1240
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,229
That's what Alvin's wife said
on their wedding night.

1241
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,922
Actually, she did.

1242
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,590
- Wow.
- So, Gordon,

1243
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,860
- you like the automat joke?
- Mm, it wasn't my favorite.

1244
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,178
- Good, it was Adam's.
- There's the guy.

1245
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,180
It got a laugh.
Means it's funny.

1246
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:50,141
I'll tell you what's funny.
Mike got me an advanced copy

1247
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:51,952
of "The 2,000 Year Old Man,"
that Mel Brooks thing.

1248
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,728
- Oh.
- Hilarious.

1249
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,898
Really, really funny.

1250
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,066
One of the funniest...

1251
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,193
I never said Mel Brooks
wasn't funny.

1252
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:03,071
But that bit would be nothing
without Carl Reiner.

1253
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,216
Right, 'cause without Carl, it
would be Mel awkwardly waiting

1254
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,384
half a minute in silence and
then reciting the punch line.

1255
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:08,660
Yeah, that would stink.

1256
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,245
I give up.

1257
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,499
Hey.

1258
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:15,708
Hi.

1259
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,126
How are these guys treating you?

1260
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,378
Terrific.

1261
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,671
She lied.

1262
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,256
They're a very good group
of writers,

1263
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,259
and I am thrilled to be here.
Learning a lot.

1264
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,052
Pleasure's ours.

1265
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:29,472
They give you any problems,
you come to me.

1266
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:31,474
Okay.

1267
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:32,993
All right, fellas,
I'm gonna grab a drink.

1268
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,119
- Next round's on me.
- Thanks.

1269
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,543
- You're too kind. - Thanks, boss.
- That's nice of you, boss.

1270
00:47:38,273 --> 00:47:40,275
What changed? That changed.

1271
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,651
What?

1272
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,486
Everything was the same today,

1273
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,862
except for the X factor.

1274
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:46,239
We just solved for "X."

1275
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,408
"X"? I'm not "X."

1276
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:51,035
- Look at that.
- Good to see you back, Gordie.

1277
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,972
- Ah, you're looking good, Toots.
- I always look good.

1278
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:54,289
I'm gonna miss this place.

1279
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,707
We can go back
to that Irish pub.

1280
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,768
I can't sit through that
tin whistle leprechaun music

1281
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:58,960
anymore, I'll go crazy.

1282
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,461
You can come back here.

1283
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:01,605
There's that place on 59th.

1284
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:03,131
I swear you can come back here.

1285
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,214
What about PJ Clarke's?

1286
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:05,383
They measure their pours.

1287
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,676
I'm not "X."

1288
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,786
<i>So, I started
this new job,</i>

1289
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,914
and it's... not fun.

1290
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:39,208
Not that every job
is supposed to be fun. I mean,

1291
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:40,732
when a nurse
is inserting a catheter,

1292
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,104
she's not standing
there thinking,

1293
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,814
"This looked so much more fun
in the brochure."

1294
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:49,260
And it's all men. Mm-hmm.

1295
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,554
So, I'm sitting in this room
with a bunch of men,

1296
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,306
and none of them are being nice

1297
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,141
or showing me the ropes,

1298
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:57,477
and so far none of them
seem to want to sleep with me.

1299
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:00,855
It's the least they could do.

1300
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,733
Who raised these men,
not wolves?

1301
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,237
Hey, did you hear there's gonna
be a baby in the White House?

1302
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:10,448
Little JFK Jr.

1303
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,991
It'll be a clean transition.

1304
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:13,218
White House staff
already learned how

1305
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,994
to change diapers
with Eisenhower.

1306
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,624
