1
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,291
Please.

2
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,600
No.

3
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,088
Go, Charlie!
Hit him!

4
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,561
Kick his ass, man!

5
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,127
- Watch your back!
- I can't watch this.

6
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,286
- Yeah!
- Deva, I'm gonna go home.

7
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,131
Deva.

8
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,527
Beaty, do whatever the hell
you want. I'm staying.

9
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,206
Fine.
I'm out of here.

10
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,840
- Do it!
- Hey, that's my boy right there!

11
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,924
Fuck this shit!
Let's get real.

12
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,690
Round two!

13
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,482
Oh, Light him up!

14
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,323
Yeah!

15
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,929
Oh, ho! That's it!

16
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,810
Yeah! Again!

17
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,964
What the fuck
are you doing here?

18
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,168
I know a Cl that can
help find Chayton.

19
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,449
A former Redbone.
Price tag's gonna be steep.

20
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,170
Whatever it costs,
I'll get the money.

21
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,004
Call your informant.

22
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,406
Hood.

23
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,682
Should have pulled the trigger
when I had a chance.

24
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,320
It's hard to shake all that
history in one moment.

25
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,529
Trust me, I know.

26
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,880
Colonel Douglas Sto...

27
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,280
Fuck!

28
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,044
Wouldn't it be easier to just use
a recording of Stowe's voice?

29
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,404
No, it would not.

30
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,360
Stowe's voice recognition system can
identify most digital forgeries.

31
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,570
Colonel Douglas Stowe.

32
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,010
But not mine.

33
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,164
- All right. Then we good to go.
- We ain't even close.

34
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,564
That base looks
the same as it did

35
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,087
the last three
times you checked it.

36
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,769
No, something ain't right.

37
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,284
- That would be your nerves.
- Please! I do not do nerves.

38
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,610
Do you want to know
what I think?

39
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,571
You do know my answer to that
question never changes, right?

40
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,326
There's only one way to
lay those doubts to rest.

41
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,246
And it ain't sitting around
here driving yourself crazy.

42
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,966
That's all.

43
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,645
What?

44
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,042
Scream and I'll kill you.

45
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,565
Is there anyone else in the house?

46
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,129
Let's go.

47
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,609
Oh...

48
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,166
I will lift up mine eyes
unto the hills

49
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,531
from whence cometh my help.

50
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,003
My help cometh from the Lord,

51
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,528
which made heaven and Earth.

52
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,242
He will not suffer
thy foot to be moved.

53
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,051
He will keepeth thee
and will not slumber.

54
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,126
Behold, He that keepeth Israel

55
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,291
shall neither slumber nor sleep.

56
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,045
Brothers, if anyone is
caught in any transgression,

57
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,965
you who are spiritual
should restore him

58
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,640
in a spirit of gentleness.

59
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,610
Welcome, Kai.

60
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,407
Keep watch on yourself
lest you, too, be tempted.

61
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,088
If anyone thinks they are
something when they are not,

62
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,242
they deceive themselves.

63
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,411
Each one should test
their own actions.

64
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,770
Then they can take pride
in themselves alone

65
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,400
without comparing themselves
to someone else.

66
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,086
For each should carry
their own load.

67
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,286
Look, the man is 6'4"
and covered in tribal tats.

68
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,568
I can't believe
no one has seen him.

69
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,281
No, I...
I understand.

70
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,644
Okay. But, look, if you hear
anything, you know where to find me.

71
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,526
Thank you.

72
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,080
Any calls?

73
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,727
No, sir.
Slow day.

74
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,441
Hi, you've reached Emily Lotus.

75
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,567
Please leave a message.

76
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,571
Hi. It's me.

77
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,286
Again.

78
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,603
Haven't heard from you, so...

79
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,690
Look, I know I'm not your most
favorite person right now, but...

80
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,121
you know, I was just thinking
about us and I... Thanks.

81
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,411
Yeah. Please return my call
at your earliest convenience.

82
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,171
Our friend from Philadelphia
tells me you're a little confused

83
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,641
about the offer he
delivered from Mr. Frazier.

84
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,490
They were buying
from our competition

85
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,250
and you want to reward that
with a discount?

86
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,805
I already agreed
to Frazier's terms.

87
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,931
Stop all sales to the
Salvadorans immediately.

88
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,921
Is that understood?

89
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,171
Please be reasonable.

90
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,441
Is that understood, Rebecca?

91
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,810
Does your uncle
know you're here?

92
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,931
- That's not your concern.
- Everything is my concern.

93
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,367
So tell me,
why am I having a conversation

94
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,689
with the niece of the man
who cut me off?

95
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,527
I'm here to correct that
temporary error in judgment.

96
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,728
What makes you think
I'd ever buy from you?

97
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,848
Because you'd be a fool not to.

98
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,569
Word on the street is that Frazier
is trying to put you out of business.

99
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,201
You've lost control
of your street corners,

100
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,211
your raves.

101
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,201
In a couple of weeks,
you'll be shut down completely.

102
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,642
I can get you back in the game.

103
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,686
Can you?

104
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,890
We'll start slow.

105
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,961
- Two kilos per week at $7,000 per.
- Four thousand per key.

106
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,241
Six thousand.

107
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,604
Or maybe you can convince
Frazier to throw you a bone.

108
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,842
You guys go way back, don't you?

109
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,685
I like you, chica.

110
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,204
I really do.

111
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,284
But if you fuck me,

112
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,808
your uncle will be scooping
you up in tiny little pieces.

113
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,121
I look forward to a long and
fruitful relationship, Mr. Morales.

114
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,886
Hector.

115
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,804
Just so you know, I have been
monitoring the FBI's progress.

116
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,244
Chayton is still off the grid.

117
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,888
Sheriff Hood, however, is not.

118
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,041
Captain Ferillo has filed
a formal complaint.

119
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,369
Have you been
watching Camp Genoa?

120
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,322
- Did you hear what I just said?
- I did. Fuck Ferillo.

121
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,402
Is there anything
I should worry about?

122
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,370
With all clue respect,
we should all be a little worried.

123
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,370
I want to delay the job.

124
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,566
That base will be shut down
by the end of the week.

125
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,762
It's now or never, Job.

126
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,123
Well, then I guess it's never.

127
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,360
What?

128
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,608
Baby, I have seen
every side of you there is.

129
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,808
Reckless, dumb,
and especially stubborn.

130
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,604
But I ain't never seen this.

131
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,129
You in the deep end.

132
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,209
If you don't keep
your head above water,

133
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,568
you're going to drag the rest
of us down there with you.

134
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,370
We're doing the fucking job.

135
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,370
We're doing it tonight.

136
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,324
Well, good luck with that.

137
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,530
Job.

138
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,842
You asked me what I needed.

139
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,243
Right now, this is it.

140
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,166
Fine.

141
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,169
I'll go get cleaned up.

142
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,801
Might as well look pretty
for my mug shot.

143
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,089
Hold it.

144
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,365
Okay.

145
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,329
You're not afraid of me?

146
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,560
No.

147
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,849
You should be.

148
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,364
I buried a husband and a child.

149
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,771
There are days I don't think I have
anything left to live for anyway.

150
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,642
Whew! Well, she ain't gonna
win no beauty contests.

151
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,605
Thank you.

152
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,964
So how is he?

153
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,484
Same as ever. Well, don't worry,
we can count on him.

154
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,725
Has the waitress checked in?

155
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,290
Carrie hasn't checked in yet,
but she will.

156
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,245
She best be on her game.

157
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,122
You'd think we were knocking
over a motherfucking 7-Eleven

158
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,487
- the way these two are acting.
- You know what, Job?

159
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,725
You worry too much.

160
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,809
Well, somebody's got to.

161
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,684
Let's see what we got.

162
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,529
Ooh.

163
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,250
That's good.

164
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,570
Hey, Beaty.
What's up?

165
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,290
What?

166
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,726
Where is she?

167
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,524
- You sure this is the place?
- Yes.

168
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,448
Any chance I can convince
you to stay out here?

169
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,646
All right, then.

170
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,406
Deva!

171
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,331
- What the fuck?
- We're going home now.

172
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,931
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

173
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,606
- I'm not gonna tell you again.
- She's not going anywhere.

174
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,808
- Okay, you need to shut your mouth.
- I don't believe this.

175
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,450
You guys can't just decide
when to give a shit.

176
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,364
- Deva!
- No, I'm staying.

177
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,851
You heard her,
she's not going anywhere, man.

178
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,810
- Get out of my way.
- You're on my property, old man.

179
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,128
And you need to fuck off now.

180
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,131
Okay.

181
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,648
Let's just all take a deep
breath and think about this.

182
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,930
- Oh!
- You shouldn't have done that.

183
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,210
Come on, man. Come on!

184
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,043
- Gordon!
- Charlie, no! Please!

185
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,407
- Please, don't.
- Deva, shut the fuck up!

186
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,849
You man enough to pull
that trigger, son?

187
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,081
I'll kill you.

188
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,566
Dad.

189
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,524
Then stop talking and do it.

190
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,011
I swear,
I'll shoot you, motherfucker.

191
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,685
Pull it.

192
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,888
Put the gun down.

193
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,210
Deva, come here!

194
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,370
Holy fuck.
That's the mayor.

195
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,770
You okay?

196
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,770
I don't eat out much.

197
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,521
To be honest,
it's been a while for me, too.

198
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,210
Forgotten what medieval
torture high heels can be.

199
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,691
You look beautiful, Emily.

200
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,966
It's also been some time
since I've heard that.

201
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,049
Thank you.

202
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,090
Well, here is to getting
outside of our comfort zones.

203
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,690
You have a nice smile.

204
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,286
I bet not many people
get to see that.

205
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,003
No. No, I guess not.

206
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,927
Yeah, I know what
it's like to put up walls.

207
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,882
Your niece, Rebecca...

208
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,042
How long has she been
living with you?

209
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,130
Not long.

210
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,971
She was in trouble.
She needed guidance.

211
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,681
And the time is coming
for her to be on her own.

212
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,124
It's probably for the best.

213
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,765
So do you think that's what other
family interventions are like?

214
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,725
I hope so.

215
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,167
I mean, why should we be the
only ones having all the fun?

216
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,885
You want a small pour or big?

217
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,570
Neither.

218
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,004
We did good out there.

219
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,529
Yeah, we did.

220
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,244
Where were you?

221
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,844
I went for a little ride.
Hope you don't mind.

222
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,045
It would be unwise to test me.

223
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,162
I wouldn't dream of it.

224
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,849
You're out of gas.

225
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,926
So...

226
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,051
See you around?

227
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,125
Yeah.

228
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,205
Okay.

229
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,210
Good night, Gordon.

230
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,966
Good night.

231
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,123
You can take my husband's truck.

232
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,004
I haven't driven it
since he passed.

233
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,603
You can't hide from the dead.

234
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,771
Isn't that what you're doing?

235
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,645
Lisa, you in there?

236
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,370
- You lied to me.
- No, he is just a neighbor who...

237
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,285
He just comes to check
on me now and then.

238
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,851
Get rid of him.

239
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,169
- There you are, sunshine.
- Hey.

240
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,045
Margaret's fixing dinner.
She's got the table set for three.

241
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,244
Thanks, Vince.
No, thanks.

242
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,041
Come on, she's making her
world-famous chicken and biscuits.

243
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,651
I said no.

244
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,529
- Is everything all right?
- No, I'm fine. I just...

245
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,562
I just needed a little
time alone, that's all.

246
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,526
Sorry.

247
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,122
- Okay.
- Thanks.

248
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,888
No, no, no!

249
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,643
Oh, my...

250
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,569
Let's go to work.

251
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,291
Sugar.

252
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,084
Wake up.

253
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,401
Run through it again.

254
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,164
We've already done it six times.

255
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,005
And we are going
to do it a seventh time.

256
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,765
If you can count that high.

257
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,610
Hood.

258
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,805
You.

259
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,290
Carrie.
Satisfied?

260
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,205
No, show me the security
cam from Genoa.

261
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,930
Real time.

262
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,202
Real time.

263
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,569
Now, show me the loop.

264
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,044
Okay. Anything else?

265
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,406
- Yeah.
- What?

266
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,244
I'm going to be leaving
these cover cams

267
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,890
at our entry and exit routes.

268
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,644
Like I don't have
enough to watch.

269
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,643
I ain't taking no chances.

270
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,087
If you see anybody or anything
that don't belong there,

271
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,483
you open that big-ass mouth
of yours and make some noise.

272
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,451
Yeah.

273
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,970
Three, two, one.

274
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,045
Okay.

275
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,090
Everybody ready?

276
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,526
Yeah.

277
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,202
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

278
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,441
Time for some peace
and quiet.

279
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,321
Explosives up.

280
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,324
All right.

281
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,564
It's all yours, Sugar.

282
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,685
Bringing it UP-

283
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,762
It ain't gonna
fucking give.

284
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,649
God damn!

285
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,209
Motherfuck!

286
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,009
Okay, all quiet
on the western front.

287
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,845
That was the easy part.
We're in.

288
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,401
Okay.
I'm on my way down.

289
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,244
On me.

290
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,683
Let's do it.

291
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,687
Okay.

292
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,403
All right. All right.
Looking good.

293
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,644
Colonel Douglas Stowe.

294
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,322
Colonel Douglas Stowe.

295
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,565
Clear.

296
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,881
You got three minutes to set up.

297
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,008
- Don't keep me waiting.
- I got it.

298
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,561
Okay, the hallway to the
computer room is wide open.

299
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,370
Just keep moving.

300
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,848
Once I initiate the algorithm,
you're gonna have 12 minutes.

301
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,690
Ready when you are.

302
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,960
Get ready.

303
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,966
Three, two, one, move.

304
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,410
Please.

305
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,642
Please, don't.

306
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,323
Please.

307
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,689
What the...?

308
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,328
Please.

309
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,323
Shit! Job needs help
in the computer room now.

310
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,684
Anybody hearing me?

311
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,240
Anybody hear me?

312
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,084
I can't.
I'm running out of time.

313
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,004
What the fuck is he doing?

314
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,768
Where the fuck were you?

315
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,604
Echo-one-nine,
what's your 20?

316
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,605
Aw, Fuck.

317
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,764
You got two minutes.

318
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,924
Wake your ass up, old man.

319
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,170
We flying to you.

320
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,682
Oh, Shit.
Now, that can't be good.

321
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,810
All right, listen up, people.

322
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,440
The big boss man has
just arrived on base.

323
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,010
Colonel Douglas Stowe.

324
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,287
Colonel Douglas Stowe.

325
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,609
Fitzpatrick,
my ID isn't working.

326
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,410
I can't get into my office.

327
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,846
I have you swiped
into the armory.

328
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,728
Send a team to the armory now.

329
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,121
- How many?
- All of them.

330
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,044
Come on, baby.
Keep it moving, people.

331
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,043
It's about to get
real crowded down there.

332
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,890
Baby, we got to move!

333
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,326
Shit.

334
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,570
I don't fucking believe it.

335
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,369
Someone reset the codes.

336
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,641
Open the fucking door!

337
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,330
Got it.

338
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,641
Go!

339
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,405
Shit!

340
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,241
Colonel Douglas Stowe.

341
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,243
Oh, shit.

342
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,640
Try again.

343
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,764
Colonel Douglas Stowe.

344
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,126
What's wrong?

345
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,327
How the fuck should I know?

346
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,129
Colonel Douglas Stowe.

347
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,289
- Job, move!
- Find them.

348
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,642
No, no, don't, don't.
They're gonna hear us!

349
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,128
- Fuck!
- Move!

350
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,049
Come on, come on, come on.

351
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,405
Let's go, go, go!

352
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,605
Go, go, go, go!

353
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,170
Come on, come on, come on.

354
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,925
Go!

355
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,841
Fuck!

356
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,203
Come on, baby.
Come on, now.

357
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,691
What did you do here?

358
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,122
You sly little cunt.

359
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,364
Take the bags!

360
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,281
Go!

361
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,125
Job!

362
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,525
- Sugar!
- Got it. Ah!

363
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,367
All right, come on, bring it.

364
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,091
Got it.

365
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,404
Come on, baby.

366
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,965
Blow it now!

367
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,291
There's something wrong.

368
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,010
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.

369
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,650
Check the detonator.

370
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,761
- Blow it!
- Just do it.

371
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,808
- Blow it!
- Do it!

372
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,885
Damn.

373
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,763
- All right.
- Where is he?

374
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,285
If he was down there
when it blew,

375
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,851
he didn't have time
to clear the blast.

376
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,490
We got to move.

377
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,046
Wait!

378
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,403
Oh, my God.

379
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,564
Shit!

380
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,362
Come on, baby,
we going!

381
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,204
Everybody still
breathing back there?

382
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,641
Yeah.

383
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,969
- Hello, Brock.
- Oh, Emily.

384
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,725
I didn't think you'd pick up.

385
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,042
Neighbors told me the police
were at the house.

386
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,688
Well, yeah. I hadn't heard from you.
I was worried.

387
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,650
God, Emily, please.
Anybody but him.

388
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,370
- Brock.
- No.

389
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,885
Look, this isn't about
you and me anymore.

390
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,690
- This is about your safety.
- I'm fine.

391
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,001
Yeah, maybe now.

392
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,486
But, I mean,
you're tempting fate.

393
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,723
Listen to me. You have got to get as
far away from that man as possible.

394
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,603
You don't understand.
We have a connection.

395
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,967
Connection? No, no.
You know what it is?

396
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,691
You think you can fix him the
same way you tried to fix me.

397
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,206
- Good-bye, Brock.
- Hello? Em...?

398
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,250
Hello? Emily?

399
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,885
God!

400
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,691
Where's Hood?

401
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,569
You guys do know this
is a celebration, right?

402
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,569
I got to get home.

403
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,123
You did great, Sugar.

404
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,726
I know.

405
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,281
Look, I don't know what's
going on between you two,

406
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,930
- but whatever it is...
- I got distracted.

407
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,650
You put us all
at motherfucking risk.

408
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,404
- You left me hanging...
- Job!

409
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,846
Don't.

410
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,801
It...

411
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,284
L'chaim.

412
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,041
Keep it.

413
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,131
I convinced my Cl it was
time to grow a conscience.

414
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,080
Where's Chayton?

415
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,085
Headed to Louisiana.

416
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,085
There's a group of tribal outcasts
based in New Orleans.

417
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,004
They call themselves
the 18th Ward.

418
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,411
You're going
down there?

419
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,087
Yes.

420
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,930
What are you gonna do
when you find him?

421
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,650
What you couldn't.

422
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,082
- Look, I know this is hard for you.
- No. The boy I knew is dead.

423
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,923
That day in the woods,
I looked into his eyes

424
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,731
and he would have killed me
without a second thought.

425
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,487
Whoever he once was,
he's a stone-cold killer now

426
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,608
and he needs to be put down.

427
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,844
I just can't be there
to watch it happen.

428
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,525
Take care of yourself, Sheriff.

429
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,770
- Hey, Brock.
- Hmm?

430
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,566
Cover for me.

431
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,366
Sorry, can't do it.

432
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,451
What?

433
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,767
Because I'm going
with you to New Orleans.

434
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,445
I'll drive.

435
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,291
It's not my fault.
It's your fucking fault.

436
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,124
It's not my fault.

437
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,680
Precautions were taken.

438
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,801
Blame them.
It's your fucking fault.

439
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,282
This isn't possible.
I did not...
