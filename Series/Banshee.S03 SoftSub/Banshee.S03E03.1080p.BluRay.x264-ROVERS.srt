1
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,686
Shh!

2
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,767
You told me you stayed
in Banshee because of me.

3
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,922
I had to make sure
you were okay.

4
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,527
I'm not.

5
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,641
Hey, listen.

6
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,131
You don't seem surprised
to have a gun in your face.

7
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,925
That's a symptom of a life spent
looking over your shoulder.

8
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,481
Who are you?

9
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,128
I'm Special Agent
Robert Phillips,

10
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,081
FBI Internal Investigations.

11
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,882
I didn't realize the FBI
had internal affairs.

12
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,804
That's because you're
not really a cop.

13
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,848
But we'll have plenty of time
to talk about all that later,

14
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,605
once you get dressed.

15
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,920
There was a time...

16
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,884
when I was the one
who would watch you sleep.

17
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,129
You were such
a beautiful child...

18
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,286
...with so much promise.

19
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,201
It was never my intention
to disappoint you, Mother.

20
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,648
Oh, Kai.

21
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,371
You could never disappoint me.

22
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,250
I just wish I could believe...

23
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,844
you were content.

24
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,002
Who will love you, Kai?

25
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,288
Who will you love?

26
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,885
Mr. Proctor?

27
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,727
I... I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

28
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,289
Promise me after I am gone...

29
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,046
...that you will move Rebecca
out of this house.

30
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,602
It's not proper.
It's not healthy.

31
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,444
Promise me.

32
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,089
I should never have left her.

33
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,447
I should never have
left her on the farm...

34
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,246
...with my father.

35
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,527
It's okay.

36
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,005
She needed me.
All those years, she needed...

37
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,571
She still needs you.

38
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,125
And you're here for her.

39
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,161
Hi there.

40
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,925
You know,

41
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,367
they say a man's home is...

42
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,082
a window into his mind.

43
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,161
Yeah, I've heard that.

44
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,291
Glock 17.

45
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,161
9 mil.

46
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,521
Really?

47
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,561
Yeah.

48
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,130
Gets the job done.

49
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,164
You should know
some things about me.

50
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,087
My superiors demand results,

51
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,208
but they're not in the least
concerned how I achieve them.

52
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,285
So if I were you,
I would exercise some...

53
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,081
caution.

54
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,323
And if I were you,
I'd do the same.

55
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,921
Agreed.

56
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,205
Why don't you put those on?

57
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,488
So you're Proctor's
big bad watchdog.

58
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,642
You don't look so tough
from where I'm standing.

59
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,166
So here's the plan.

60
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,563
First, I'm gonna kill you.

61
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,728
Then I'm going inside and I'm
gonna slowly gut your boss

62
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,604
and his
Little House on the Prairie niece.

63
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,286
I don't think so.

64
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,365
Ah! Ah!

65
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,805
Nola.

66
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,563
Let me die.

67
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,131
You already did.

68
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,924
It's time to start living again.

69
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,083
What the hell
is a data skimmer?

70
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,924
Exactly what
it sounds like.

71
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,368
It scans and saves metadata
from encoded smart cards.

72
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,051
We stealing real IDs from them

73
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,289
so I can make fake IDs for us.

74
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,681
That's all you had to say.

75
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,966
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?

76
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,208
Lord knows it ain't never easy.

77
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,604
This one's yours.
Now, I want you to...

78
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,205
Testing!

79
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,371
It works.

80
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,285
Do your best
not to fuck this up.

81
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,929
That is the third
time this week.

82
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,525
You think they're trying
to tell me something?

83
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,847
I need six IDs.

84
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,843
Try not to move your lips
while you're counting.

85
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,290
Okay, I got to grab it.

86
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,241
Three more.

87
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,406
Running out of time.

88
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,121
One more.

89
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,891
Oh, I had some keys...

90
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,565
Oh, there they are.

91
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,449
- One more.
- Thank you.

92
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,841
I got it.
Get your ass out.

93
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,968
I got a big business meeting

94
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,248
and I can't get nowhere
without these keys, you know?

95
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,481
Thank you so much.

96
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,207
What?

97
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,726
If we were never
going past the lobby,

98
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,008
why you got me wearing
this damn suit?

99
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,404
'Cause there ain't no such
thing as sweatpants Monday.

100
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,120
You can drive.

101
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,885
Sh...

102
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,571
You know, I prefer classic rock,

103
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,564
but, you know, country music that
soothes the soul, don't you think?

104
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,960
How did you find me?

105
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,570
You know, I have a rather
specialized job at the Bureau.

106
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,280
I'm a fixer of sorts,

107
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,966
so I investigate dead
and missing agents.

108
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,401
Of course, the missing ones almost
always turn out to be dead, too.

109
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,041
Like Jim Racine?

110
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,291
Instead I found his body outside an
old farmhouse in upstate New York.

111
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,767
Really?

112
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,127
Well, what was left of him.

113
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,604
He was burned up pretty bad.

114
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,481
But not the slug
that killed him.

115
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,604
Glock 9 mil?

116
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,647
No.

117
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,564
.308 rifle round.

118
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,325
Isn't that interesting?

119
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,767
Not as interesting as the inch-thick
file that he was keeping on you.

120
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,443
You know, it turns out
that the NYPD's

121
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,728
John Doe Capital Diamond thief

122
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,524
turned out to be the new sheriff

123
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,645
of Banshee, Pennsylvania?

124
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,771
That's quite a leap.

125
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,163
Maybe, but the story
gets better.

126
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,322
Especially the part
about the church,

127
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,931
the gunfight.

128
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,725
I mean, it takes
some king-sized balls

129
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,121
to take on a guy like
Rabbit in a way like that.

130
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,602
And when I think about an
ex-con posing as a sheriff,

131
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,408
well, I think maybe
those are the same big balls.

132
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,405
Well, I'm flattered,

133
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,405
but you're wasting your time.

134
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,805
You know something about
wasted time, don't you?

135
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,767
I don't get it. I mean, you could
have gone anywhere when you got out.

136
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,571
You could have found a black sand
beach somewhere in paradise,

137
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,371
a new golden brown señorita
every night of the week.

138
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,324
My God, that's what
I would have done.

139
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,370
Oh, not you. No.
You came to Banshee.

140
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,050
You played dress-up
right down the road

141
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,204
from the woman who stole
15 years of your life.

142
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,166
She must be something.

143
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,284
Or else there's
something inside of you

144
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,727
that still wants to be punished.

145
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,125
What do you think?

146
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,289
I think you talk too much.

147
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,081
That's what my third
ex-wife told me.

148
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,766
Okay, get out.

149
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,447
You're letting me go?

150
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,086
No, I'm letting you take a piss.

151
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,321
It's a long way back
to the city.

152
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,931
We're not gonna
stop another time.

153
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,521
- I'm good.
- I'm not asking. Move.

154
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,082
- And if you try anything...
- Yeah, you'll shoot me.

155
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,605
- I get it.
- Yeah. Come on.

156
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,886
Hey, you know what?

157
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,248
- I think I changed my mind.
- How's that?

158
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,811
Well, I don't think I want
to go back to New York.

159
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,165
You make it sound
like you have a choice.

160
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,085
Well, there's always a choice.

161
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,010
I want to report
a robbery in progress

162
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,804
at the Capital Diamond
warehouse.

163
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,327
211 Saw Mill River Road.

164
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,164
I'm Detective Julias Bonner.

165
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,482
It was my team that
took you down tonight.

166
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,001
Congratulations.

167
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,605
You are smart enough to know

168
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,161
that whoever you're
working for set you up.

169
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,201
May I?

170
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,366
May I offer you something
to drink while you wait?

171
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,525
Coffee? Tea?

172
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,206
Something stronger?

173
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,926
The way I see it,
you know you got jail

174
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,969
on the other side
of this conversation.

175
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,323
You aren't going home
for many years.

176
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,889
Time to wake up, asshole.

177
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,687
Hey.

178
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,206
There he is.

179
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,925
Sorry to keep you waiting.

180
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,921
Hopefully my associates

181
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,003
have made you feel at home.

182
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,291
As you can see,
comfort is a priority

183
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,410
for a man of my dimensions.

184
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,887
Some travel is unavoidable,

185
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,247
but cars, vans, planes,

186
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,761
they all present
indignities for me.

187
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,447
Well, you could try eating
a salad now and then.

188
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,769
I think fat jokes
are beneath us both.

189
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,724
Well, that's hard to say

190
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,761
seeing as I have no idea
who the fuck you are.

191
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,883
My name is Raymond
Walton Brantley.

192
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,760
Brantley, that's the guy
you stole the money off, right?

193
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,604
Look, I saw some shit
I wasn't supposed to see.

194
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,762
Brantley...
Brantley is a paranoid fuck.

195
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,081
Yes?

196
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,321
No?

197
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,281
Maybe?

198
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,080
The only thing I know
for sure about you

199
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,011
is who you are not.

200
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,363
And you are not Lucas Hood.

201
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,640
Isn't that right?

202
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,761
It's okay.

203
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,247
Despite a particularly
nasty beating,

204
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,246
Agent Phillips here
of the FBI's rat squad

205
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,007
remained as quiet as a mouse.

206
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,121
Where is Jason Hood?

207
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,889
I have no idea who that is.

208
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,761
Really?

209
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,961
Yes.

210
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,887
No.

211
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,681
Maybe.

212
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,365
I... just... He's dead.

213
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,164
He's dead.

214
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,810
He's de...

215
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,085
Give me Jason Hood...

216
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,843
and Agent Phillips

217
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,083
will never cause you
discomfort again.

218
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,844
To tell you the truth,

219
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,288
I've never really been
worried about Agent Phillips.

220
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,366
So if you can find
your dick in there,

221
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,210
why don't you go fuck yourself?

222
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,969
If I were you, I'd take a moment

223
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,770
to consider how tenuous

224
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,129
your bargaining
position truly is.

225
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,600
Maybe you got a girl...

226
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,202
...alone in the dark waiting
and wondering what happened.

227
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,081
I told you I should have
handled Proctor's house.

228
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,124
You'll get your chance
soon enough.

229
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,170
That's what you keep saying.

230
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,563
Let me hit him where it hurts.

231
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,371
Show Proctor
that we're in control.

232
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,808
You're not ready.

233
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,244
Don't make me tell you again.

234
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,407
Chayton.

235
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,887
You guys take a walk.

236
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,761
Hey, Tommy.

237
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,042
I haven't been out
this way since high school.

238
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,324
You should not have come here.

239
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,804
Why'd you steal
those guns, Chayton?

240
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,963
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were training an army.

241
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,531
But that would be crazy, right?

242
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,126
Crazy.

243
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,126
Crazy is allowing
the reservation

244
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,282
to become as corrupt
as the outside world.

245
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,602
- How many...
- But that's just what Longshadow

246
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,603
and George Hunter have done.

247
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,650
They call us outlaws,
gangbangers.

248
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,643
Treat us like we're the problem.

249
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,007
Because you treat violence
like it's the solution.

250
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,811
I will do anything to protect
our land from men like Proctor.

251
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,769
All you're doing
is hurting more of our own.

252
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,809
This is bigger
than any one person.

253
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,324
Tell that to the dead Redbone

254
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,130
they pulled out
of Proctor's pool.

255
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,770
Or the other one in the ICU.

256
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,127
Casualties of a righteous war.

257
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,129
You know, when we were kids...

258
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,844
and you and Tommy
came to live with us...

259
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,363
you were so shy.

260
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,530
So gentle.

261
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,329
I told everybody
you were my real brother

262
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,167
because I wanted it to be true.

263
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,929
Now I barely recognize you.

264
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,209
You sure can take
a hell of a beating.

265
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,125
I'll give you that.

266
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,890
Why don't you
just tell him the truth?

267
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,527
- He knows you're lying.
- He doesn't know shit.

268
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,209
- He thinks I'm lying.
- What's the difference?

269
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,571
Come on, Agent Phillips,
that's basic psi-ops protocol.

270
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,487
The only way to overcome
a physical advantage

271
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,369
- is to establish a psychological one.
- A psychological one.

272
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,851
There you go.
You remember.

273
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,650
Yeah, I slept through
that class at Quantico.

274
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,086
No, you didn't.

275
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,163
You know, you can play
all the mind games you want,

276
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,163
but we're not
leaving here alive.

277
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,726
You know that, right?

278
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,684
Way I see it,
I'm better off in here

279
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,251
than I was in the back
of your car.

280
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,129
Well, if that's really true,
you have to ask yourself

281
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,442
just how fucked up
your universe really is.

282
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,802
The thought has crossed my mind.

283
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,449
You know, I have cracked

284
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,086
some pretty twisted minds
in my time, but you...

285
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,129
You're not gonna
give up on me, are you?

286
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,167
Uh-uh. Not a chance.

287
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,325
Where were we?

288
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,248
You just asked me
about Jason Hood.

289
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,886
And you told me
to go fuck myself.

290
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,530
We're all caught up.

291
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,850
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

292
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,523
Hey, Emily, it's me.
Just checking in.

293
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,331
Um...

294
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,608
Anyway, call me back, all right?

295
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,641
- Is everything okay?
- Couldn't be better.

296
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,007
I'm... I'm clocking out.

297
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,926
Any word from Hood?

298
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,246
Nope. Nothing.

299
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,168
I'm thinking we should turn
his office into a game room.

300
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,560
What do you think?

301
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,447
I'm pretty worried. I've
been trying to reach him all day.

302
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,161
Really?

303
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,083
Well, your paperwork's
not going anywhere.

304
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,163
Why don't you head over to his
place and see what's what?

305
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,446
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

306
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,161
Okay.

307
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,203
- Thanks, Brock.
- Sure.

308
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,966
Let me know when you find him.

309
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,201
- All right.
- All right.

310
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,564
- You heading out?
- Yep.

311
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,006
Anywhere good?

312
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,171
No, just having an afternoon
drink with an old friend.

313
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,766
Platinumm, what the hell
was I thinking?

314
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,127
Sorry.

315
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,051
You know, there is worse things

316
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,884
than getting some
from your hot ex-wife.

317
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,041
No, I know.

318
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,843
There's always a flip side with her.

319
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,729
- You don't know Emily.
- I know there's nobody

320
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,008
forcing you
to bump uglies with her.

321
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,128
That is true.
That is very true.

322
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,807
But, you know,
it's... complicated.

323
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,691
Ugh. How come every time a
guy goes sticking his dick

324
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,763
someplace he shouldn't,
it's complicated?

325
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,611
- Well, I just...
- No.

326
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,921
You know,
sometimes when I...

327
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,845
Your ex knows
exactly what she's doing.

328
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,361
She's got you exactly
where she wants you.

329
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,129
Losing your fucking mind
over some bomb-ass pussy.

330
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,362
I know. I know.
I know.

331
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,170
You already know what to do,

332
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,163
but you're not gonna do it.

333
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,401
You're a wise woman,
Platinumm...

334
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,841
Hey, shithead!

335
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,361
You kill him, you'll
never get what you want.

336
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,242
Agent Phillips is right.

337
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,965
Are you gonna tell me
where he is?

338
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,242
Give him some fresh air!

339
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,845
Afternoon, Deputy.

340
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,365
Can I get you something?

341
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,802
No, thanks. Have you
seen the sheriff?

342
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,291
He missed his shift today.

343
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,845
No. No, I haven't.

344
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,367
But he'll turn up.
He always does.

345
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,563
You know him pretty well, huh?

346
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,247
I could say the same about you.

347
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,731
- Could you?
- Mm.

348
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,211
I'm not so sure.

349
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,648
Some people,
you can know them

350
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,326
before you know about them.

351
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,681
Maybe. Or maybe that'd
sound a lot more profound

352
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,086
if I had had a few beers.

353
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,402
Yeah, I don't doubt that.

354
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,247
All right, well,
if you hear from him...

355
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,731
Will do.

356
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,601
Now or never, mystery man.

357
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,683
- Where is Jason Hood?
- He's dead!

358
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,808
He's fucking dead.
I told you.

359
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,450
And why should I believe you?

360
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,206
'Cause I killed him, all right?

361
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,644
Thirty seconds.

362
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,082
I doubt a word,
you become roadkill.

363
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,728
The kid offered me 50 grand

364
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,605
to take out your man in
the fancy suit, all right?

365
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,003
Twenty-up front,
twenty-five when it was done.

366
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,925
You killed Quentin?

367
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,366
Well, it took some doing...

368
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,881
...but, yeah.

369
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,961
Go on.

370
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,805
So after I killed Quentin,

371
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,440
Jason, he didn't
want to pay up...

372
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,969
and he threatened to expose me.

373
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,963
So you killed him
and took the money?

374
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,850
Fair is fair.

375
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,249
Where is my money now?

376
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,811
It's back in Banshee.

377
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,167
- All of it?
- Yes.

378
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,005
And exactly how much
is all of it?

379
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,607
Brantley, he likes to deal
with this sort of thing

380
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,211
up close and personal.

381
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,605
Sixty-two thousand.

382
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,610
I will take you back home.

383
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,888
You will show me
Jason Hood's body.

384
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,883
You will return my money.

385
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,042
Who is going to stop you from

386
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,123
shooting me the moment I do?

387
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,049
You're not on the list.

388
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,284
Mmm.

389
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,250
Seems I will be taking
a trip south of the border

390
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,562
after I retrieve my money.

391
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,804
Sadly, Agent Phillips,

392
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,810
your home is not
on the itinerary.

393
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,362
Wanda, tell Mr. Cole
up front to pull over.

394
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,440
My associates will escort you

395
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,085
to your next destination.

396
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,685
Where the hell is that?

397
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,241
Safe travels, Agent Phillips.

398
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,486
Let's go.

399
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,484
Wanda, tell Mr. Cole

400
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,091
to take us back to Banshee.

401
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,810
The boys will catch up later.

402
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,405
And mix me a drink.

403
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,650
Bulleit Old Fashioned,
extra sugar.

404
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,729
Right away,
Mr. Brantley.

405
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,924
You're going back into a cell.

406
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,491
You're facing
eight to ten years.

407
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,122
Life as you know it is over.

408
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,527
Hey!

409
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,886
Get out of the way!

410
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,286
Stay down.

411
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,481
- Get back!
- Down.

412
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,684
Check the back rooms.
Make sure everyone's out.

413
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,086
Raven, hey, it's Brock.

414
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,005
Look, I've got a 211
in progress at the Savoy.

415
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,571
Looks like five assailants

416
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,690
and possibly two dozen civilians
trapped inside. Hurry.

417
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,561
Get up.

418
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,324
Fuck.

419
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,808
True gundog, Quentin.

420
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,561
He could flush out
the best of them.

421
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,483
Tell me, how'd you beat him?

422
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,562
No, I'm not telling
you anything.

423
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,490
Not until you tell me
why you came so far

424
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,290
for an asshole like Jason Hood.

425
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,920
I mean, a guy like you
doesn't come all the way

426
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,287
across the country for 60 grand.

427
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,967
A guy like me would come across
the country for 50 cents.

428
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,126
Start digging.

429
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,322
My body has failed me.

430
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,285
I failed it.
Either way.

431
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,404
Things that you take for
granted, I can't do.

432
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,284
Simple trip to buy groceries

433
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,767
or have a meal at a restaurant.

434
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,446
I can't even fuck anymore.

435
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,123
But one thing I do have

436
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,409
is my ledger.

437
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,849
I keep my own books

438
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,288
and I keep everything balanced.

439
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,404
Not a decimal point
out of place.

440
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,490
The devil is in the details.

441
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,890
And the details

442
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,487
are all that a guy like me has.

443
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,203
In that case,
I bet you'd love to know

444
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,249
what Jason Hood's
last words were.

445
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,642
Tell me what he said.

446
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,685
He said to tell you...

447
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,491
he'll see your fat ass
real fucking soon.

448
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,128
Up here now. You, outta here!
Get outta here!

449
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,367
Move!

450
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,521
Down now!

451
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,567
Stay here.

452
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,286
What are you doing?

453
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,727
No!

454
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,447
You have it.

455
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,001
Mr. Cole.

456
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,491
- Wanda, where are the shotgun shells?
- Cabinet, bottom right.

457
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,689
- Look away. Don't look at me.
- No.

458
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,403
Everyone listen up.
Listen up.

459
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,885
We're not here to kill you.

460
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,970
But when I'm done here...

461
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,362
you're all gonna
have to find new jobs.

462
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,330
Drop your weapons!
Hands in the air!

463
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,801
Don't! Don't you
fucking do it.

464
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,127
Nobody move.

465
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,404
I said to drop
your weapons, fellas.

466
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,924
Son, that knife gets
any closer to her neck,

467
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,809
I'm gonna blow
your fuckin' head off.

468
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,808
Ah!

469
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,007
Ah!

470
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,687
Wanda.

471
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,009
Sheriff's Department!

472
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,525
Put down your guns right now.

473
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,445
Tommy!
Tommy, it's Billy Raven.

474
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,007
You and your boys
need to surrender now

475
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,446
and no one else gets hurt.

476
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,364
No one except for you, cop.

477
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,005
Damn it, Tommy!
You need to listen to me.

478
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,001
No!

479
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,001
Alma, we need EMTs
at the Savoy now.

480
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,170
I'll clear the back rooms.

481
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,249
- Stay still.
- Fuck you!

482
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,845
No, thanks.

483
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,331
Don't fucking move.

484
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,767
- Raven, you okay over there?
- Yeah.

485
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,605
Knife!

486
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,530
Where the fuck is Hood?

487
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,405
That's deep enough.

488
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,601
Turn around.

489
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,971
You don't want to do this.

490
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,525
Killing a federal agent
will get you the needle.

491
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,401
Good-bye.

492
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,645
I didn't kill Racine.

493
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,921
I know.

494
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,728
So what the fuck
are you doing here?

495
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,165
I was curious.

496
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,442
I was tasked to find
a missing agent.

497
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,130
You're not part of that story.

498
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,962
The Bureau doesn't know
anything about you.

499
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,531
So what's stopping me from
leaving you in this hole?

500
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,721
You're doing a pretty shitty
job of saving yourself.

501
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,727
Seems we both need
to work on that.

502
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,481
Agreed.

503
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,091
So we're good?

504
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,526
Yeah.

505
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,611
We're good.

506
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,724
But you should know...

507
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,769
...I had to do something
to cover my ass

508
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,962
when I thought you
would turn out to be...

509
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,646
who you weren't.

510
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,246
What did you do?

511
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,640
Sorry.

512
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,367
We don't even know
what to call you.

513
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,525
What is it?

514
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,521
What?

515
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,011
Gottverdammt!

516
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,249
Your life, that life, is over.

517
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,283
- I work alone.
- No, you don't.

518
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,966
You had someone
in that building with you.

519
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,964
And you two weren't
performing some remote hack

520
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,567
on some of the most advanced
security systems on the market

521
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,131
while rappelling from the roof,

522
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,931
so by my count,
that adds up to three guys

523
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,889
not counting Mr. Rabbit.

524
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,964
What, do you think I work
for some criminal mastermind

525
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,650
that goes around
calling himself Mr. Rabbit?

526
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,968
Yes, I do. Yes, I do!

527
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,491
Give me Rabbit.

528
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,802
Give him to me
and I'll cut you a deal.

529
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,163
Maybe you get 18 months.
You'll be out after a year.

530
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,124
I would offer you
witness protection,

531
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,123
but you don't have an identity,

532
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,602
so my guess is that
you won't need a new one.

533
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,802
Who the hell are you?

534
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,250
The way I see it,

535
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,683
you know you got jail on the
other side of this conversation.

536
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,490
I used your prints
to pull your file.

537
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,483
There isn't one. We don't
even know what to call you.

538
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,281
You're a ghost. Life as
you know it is over.

539
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,842
You aren't going home
for many years.

540
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,322
You're going back into a cell
and tomorrow at this time,

541
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,245
you'll be in Rikers
awaiting trial.

542
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,165
Come on, this case has Rabbit
written all over it.

543
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,244
What, do you think I work
for some criminal mastermind

544
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,885
that goes around calling
himself Mr. Rabbit?

545
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,280
Give me Rabbit.

546
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,125
Give him to me
and I'll cut you a deal.

547
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,408
Okay.

548
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,841
This is for the record.
State your name.

549
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,411
John Smith.

550
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,841
What are you doing?
Are you fucking with me?

551
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,331
No, you're fucking
with me.

552
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,364
The deal is real.
You said you wanted

553
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,807
to take the deal,
you stupid motherfucker.

554
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,485
Maybe,
but I'm not gonna sit here

555
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,642
and do your fuckin' job for you.

556
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,689
It's your funeral, asshole.
