1
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,281
Please, stop.

2
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,650
What the hell did you say?

3
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,402
Fuck!

4
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,443
I said come closer.

5
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,491
What happened?

6
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,722
Cocksucker bit my nose off.

7
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,486
Go.

8
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,081
Hello, Kai.

9
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,891
It's been a while.

10
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,891
- Hey.
- Hi.

11
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,486
Have a seat. Let me
get you some coffee.

12
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,847
I... I can't stay.
I just...

13
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,690
I just came to drop this off.

14
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,490
Divorce papers.

15
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,566
Yeah, they came from the
mediator's office this morning.

16
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,083
Just figured that you'd want
to take a look at them.

17
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,961
Did you?

18
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,086
Not yet, no.

19
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,730
Maybe we should wait.

20
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,727
- What do you mean, Carrie?
- I don't know, I just...

21
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,441
I know this is what we decided.

22
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,125
I'm not sure.
Are you?

23
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,126
No. No, I'm not.
I'm not sure.

24
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,050
I made a mess of things.

25
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,120
Yeah, you did.

26
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,920
But listen, I've...

27
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,689
I've had time to think
about the pressure

28
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,285
that you've been under
all these years,

29
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,044
the fear that you've
been living with,

30
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,402
and I know that must
have been so hard.

31
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,011
I just wish you
could have told me.

32
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,690
I know.
I'm so sorry.

33
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,285
I don't want you to be sorry.

34
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,046
I don't want to spend
any more time looking back.

35
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,443
We've got to look forward.

36
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,042
Is it crazy to think
that we could start over?

37
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,680
Well...

38
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,290
...when it comes to crazy, I think
we've set a pretty high bar.

39
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,925
You know what?

40
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,928
Why don't I hold on
to these for a bit?

41
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,411
And then...

42
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,925
...we'll see how things go.

43
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,525
Carrie, your order's up.

44
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,365
Okay.
I've got to go.

45
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,326
Okay.

46
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,122
You know the only way
to clean this rat trap

47
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,129
is with a fucking grenade, right?

48
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,410
Welcome home.

49
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,326
Thanks.

50
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,242
Everything get resolved
down south?

51
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,646
Yeah.

52
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,480
You sure?

53
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,962
Well, then, good riddance.

54
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,600
Hey, Job.

55
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,361
Hey, yourself.

56
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,201
We okay?

57
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,248
DOD lists Camp Genoa
as officially decommissioned.

58
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,647
There's no mention
of our little soiree.

59
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,961
Well, that's great.

60
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,451
So we okay?

61
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,090
You almost got me killed.

62
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,285
- I know.
- I said you weren't ready.

63
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,249
- I begged you to pull the plug.
- I'm sorry.

64
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,602
Well, right now, I don't
give a fuck what you are.

65
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,282
We got a lot of history,
you and me.

66
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,530
Maybe that's all it should be.

67
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,841
History.

68
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,721
Who the fuck sent you?
Fuck it, I already know.

69
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,211
What did Dalton
tell you about me?

70
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,691
That you're past
your expiration date.

71
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,365
- You didn't ask why?
- I don't care.

72
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,046
You will when that motherfucker
orders a bullet put in your brain.

73
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,603
Think, asshole. I ain't just
public enemy number one.

74
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,929
I've done some shit for your boss
that makes me a dangerous loose end.

75
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,723
As soon as you kill me,
you become one, too.

76
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,689
- You're full of shit.
- Am I?

77
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,121
You sure?

78
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,291
Look, man.
See for yourself.

79
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,289
Look. Look.
They're coming for you.

80
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,923
You came for me,
but they coming for you.

81
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,201
All right?

82
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,168
I don't know how many jobs
you've done for your boss,

83
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,089
but this right here,
this one's the last one.

84
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,726
Okay? Your boss has written
you off, all right?

85
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,890
He's written you off. Stop, stop.
Listen to me. Wait, wait, wait.

86
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,651
This is what he is. You
know what he is, all right?

87
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,803
Listen to me, I'm telling you
the truth and you know it.

88
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,764
Think.
Think, man.

89
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,568
Dalton's cleaning house.
We both dead.

90
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,131
Speak for yourself.

91
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,406
Hold up, hold up.
You can't leave me here.

92
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,891
- Watch me.
- Fuck that. Listen to me.

93
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,451
You thinking about
long-term survival,

94
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,166
you need to know the things
only I can tell you.

95
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,648
Come on, you know what
I'm saying is true.

96
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,806
I can help you.

97
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,809
- What's your name?
- Job.

98
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,480
All right, Job, you stay close.

99
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,085
You fall behind,
you're on your own.

100
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,090
Frazier, what the hell
is this?

101
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,530
We don't talk much.

102
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,003
I figured it was time
to check in.

103
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,650
You could have picked up
the fucking phone.

104
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,161
Yeah, well,
you could have, too,

105
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,360
before you decided to
renege on our agreement

106
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,524
and let your niece sell
to the Salvadorans.

107
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,604
What the fuck
are you talking about?

108
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,250
I'm sorry, what was that?

109
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,084
- Nothing.
- Good.

110
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,641
Flimsy denials
don't suit you, Kai.

111
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,324
You've always been
a straight talker.

112
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,371
Why don't you call off your dogs and
let us discuss what needs discussing?

113
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,841
It would be nice if things
worked that way, wouldn't it?

114
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,170
But unfortunately, that is the
sad irony of our business.

115
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,483
By the time we get
to talk like this,

116
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,483
there's nothing left to discuss.

117
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,686
You must have known
how I'd react

118
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,320
to a betrayal of this magnitude.

119
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,002
Exactly like you would, yes?

120
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,842
Just name your price,
Frazier, you got it.

121
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,681
This isn't about money.

122
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,126
Everything is about money.

123
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,850
Not this time.

124
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,886
Hector Morales has always been
dirt on the bottom of my shoe.

125
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,844
But with you by his side,

126
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,367
that greasy,
cock sucking motherfucker

127
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,364
could become
a considerable threat.

128
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,681
And I can't allow that.

129
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,763
Frazier, you're making a mistake.

130
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,727
I expected more from you, Kai.

131
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,050
Shame on me.

132
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,967
There's only two things
left for you to do, Kai.

133
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,246
And that's apologize and die.

134
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,609
I'm gonna slit your throat...

135
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,406
...like a fucking cow.

136
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,164
I want to hear him scream.

137
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,811
Again.

138
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,722
Get your ass, get up.

139
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,171
Get down!

140
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,040
Hood!

141
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,402
- Miss, you can't just come in here.
- Don't touch me.

142
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,530
- It's okay, Bunker.
- Sorry, sir.

143
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,963
- They took my uncle.
- They?

144
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,162
- The Black Beards.
- Who?

145
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,444
They're a crime syndicate
from Philadelphia.

146
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,250
And this is my problem
because...?

147
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,885
They're going to kill him.

148
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,491
I can't help you.

149
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,211
Thanks for stopping by.

150
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,451
Deputy Lotus.

151
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,723
Fucking Proctor, huh?
What are we gonna do about it?

152
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,609
- We're not gonna do anything.
- What are you talking about?

153
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,364
- I don't give a shit about Proctor.
- Neither do I.

154
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,881
But the crazy niece, she told me
they also took my ex-wife Emily.

155
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,008
What? What does she have
to do with Proctor?

156
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,771
She took care of his mother.

157
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,321
- His mother's dead, Brock.
- I know. They, uh...

158
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,241
Oh, you've got to be
fucking kidding me.

159
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,483
Tell me about it. I'm gonna have
Bunker and Raven set up checkpoints.

160
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,449
We'll call the state police.
We're gonna go...

161
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,523
No, no, they're probably
long gone by now.

162
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,205
Yeah, maybe they're not.
We've gotta do something.

163
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,646
Brock, I'm not gonna
get involved.

164
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,211
No, listen to me, Hood!

165
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,606
I have put my ass on the line for you
more than once, all right?

166
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,325
Now I'm asking you.

167
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,326
Please.

168
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,963
I'm not here.

169
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,885
Listen, I wouldn't ask
if I had another choice,

170
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,443
but I need some help.

171
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,561
Hold up. Hold up.
Hang on. Hold up.

172
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,484
God.

173
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,649
It's okay, you killed them all.

174
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,126
I think you killed
some of them twice,

175
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,566
you trigger-happy
son of a bitch.

176
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,569
There's gonna be more of them.
We need to keep moving.

177
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,250
I need a little oxygen.

178
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,326
Fuck.

179
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,729
How the fuck are you
not even winded?

180
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,006
We just ran, like, three miles.

181
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,321
My feet are fucking killing me.

182
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,170
Talk less, you can breathe more.

183
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,646
I'll tell you what, Clint Eastwood,

184
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,450
I'll shut the fuck up
when you answer me this...

185
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,325
Where the fuck are we going?

186
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,364
We need to get off the street.

187
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,687
Move.

188
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,762
You didn't answer my question.

189
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,844
I got a place.

190
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,365
I reviewed the digital
security logs

191
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,289
from Sterling Safe's
headquarters in Virginia.

192
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,925
No obvious mainframe breaches,

193
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,890
no embedded viruses or brute
force attacks from the outside.

194
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,766
That's why I looked for something
a little bit more inside.

195
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,927
Sterling meticulously vets
all private contractors.

196
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,844
The process takes a month,
so the sudden addition

197
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,650
of two new maintenance
workers didn't make sense,

198
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,531
especially since they were
deleted less than 24 hours later.

199
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,685
- They made a mistake?
- No, I just got lucky.

200
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,605
The files were scrubbed
and overwritten.

201
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,649
I would never have found them
if not for a power surge

202
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,564
that triggered
an off-site data backup.

203
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,730
That's Sugar Bates.

204
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,402
Ex-prizefighter, local bartender
and an ex-con.

205
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,001
- Robbery?
- Aggravated assault.

206
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,209
Mr. Bates solves his problems
with brute force, not skill.

207
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,840
He was the van driver.
Who's that?

208
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,004
Well, that's the question,
isn't it?

209
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,131
I cross-referenced every facial
recognition database there is.

210
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,641
NSA, MSS, Mossad.

211
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,604
Either this guy
is completely invisible

212
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,445
to all surveillance cameras
and spy satellites,

213
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,443
or he's managed to exploit

214
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,443
the most secure computer
systems ever designed.

215
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,965
He's a hacker.

216
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,929
If I'm right, he's the hacker.

217
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,727
CIA's been chasing their tails for
years trying to find this guy.

218
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,121
The online fanboys,
they call him Job.

219
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,489
But nobody knows for sure
who he really is.

220
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,886
You find him?

221
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,169
Over the last 12 hours, there's
been a flurry of cellular activity,

222
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,130
all originating from phones
registered to the 215 area code.

223
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,486
Philadelphia.

224
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,802
Transmissions are localized
to the towers to the south.

225
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,964
There's a lot of buildings there,
but only one abandoned high school.

226
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,881
- Address?
- 57 Broad Creek Road.

227
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,406
Okay.

228
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,761
Listen, Job...

229
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,485
This was the last time.

230
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,968
Well, look who's finally winded.

231
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,050
Jesus Christ, you're hit.

232
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,850
Get the fuck off my Baughman chair.

233
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,367
Do you know how hard it is to get
blood out of chenille upholstery?

234
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,284
Hey, do me a favor.
Shut the fuck up, would you?

235
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,205
Stay here.

236
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,162
This place is completely
off the grid.

237
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,965
If Dalton knew about it,
don't you think

238
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,970
he would have told you when he
gave you your marching orders?

239
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,529
How long you been
under Dalton's thumb?

240
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,921
Too long.
How do you know him?

241
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,402
I have a unique skill set.
A rare lapse in judgment,

242
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,569
I rendered services
to your former boss,

243
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,563
thinking he was the real deal.

244
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,121
He wasn't?

245
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,370
Well, they never are.

246
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,570
I stick to criminals now.

247
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,768
At least you know where
you stand with a criminal.

248
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,890
So what's your story?

249
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,247
Mmm, Let me guess.

250
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,481
Dalton got to you when
you were at rock bottom.

251
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,921
Told you he could
make you something more.

252
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,880
Man does have a way of
getting inside your head.

253
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,161
Happens to the best of us.

254
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,004
You said you could help
me get away from him.

255
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,086
How?

256
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,167
He can't kill us
if he can't find us.

257
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,802
- He can find me.
- He can try.

258
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,446
He got access
to satellites, databases,

259
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,763
and custom software that can
locate almost anybody, anywhere.

260
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,880
But who the fuck do you think
designed that software?

261
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,770
By the time I'm done
doing my thing,

262
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,770
you are going to be
a fucking ghost.

263
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,645
Now, let's start with your name.

264
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,443
Sheriff's Department!
Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!

265
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,330
- Put 'em down!
- Drop your gun.

266
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,606
- Fuck you.
- Brock!

267
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,290
- Emily, you all right?
- She's fine.

268
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,164
- For now.
- You touched her, you're a dead man.

269
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,004
Those are tough words
coming from a man

270
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,525
who's about to get
shot full of holes.

271
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,165
- Yeah, right back at you.
- Nobody's getting shot.

272
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,368
- Hood.
- Now, there's a voice of reason.

273
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,410
- And you are?
- Sheriff Lucas Hood.

274
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,171
Sheriff.

275
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,205
Well, then, Sheriff Hood,

276
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,209
do you have a solution in mind?

277
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,210
We're only here for the woman.

278
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,604
And Mr. Proctor?

279
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,607
Whatever's going on
between you and him,

280
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,810
that's your business.

281
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,611
Oh, now, that sounds
too good to be true.

282
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,445
Do we have a deal?

283
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,606
Let the girl go.

284
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,725
Wait, what the hell
are you talking about?

285
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,450
- You can't do that.
- Emily, let's go.

286
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,329
- No, I'm not leaving.
- Emily!

287
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,968
- They're gonna kill him.
- Get the fuck out!

288
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,447
- Let's go.
- Emily, come on.

289
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,405
Come on.
Let's go, come on.

290
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,688
It's all right.
Come on, let's go.

291
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,921
Oh, shit.

292
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,482
- What, did you follow us?
- Where's my uncle?

293
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,481
Come on.

294
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,051
Wait, did you
just leave him in there?

295
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,083
- Let's go.
- What the fuck?!

296
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,171
Come on.

297
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,285
Lennox tells me you're
grooming your niece Rebecca

298
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,771
to be your successor.

299
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,242
We'll have to see
if she's up for the task.

300
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,401
I will pray for your soul, Kai.

301
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,524
But I think at this point,

302
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,646
even God doesn't know
what to make of you.

303
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,364
Rest in peace, old friend.

304
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,685
Lock the door.

305
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,964
I'm gonna enjoy this.

306
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,891
Me, too.

307
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,083
Burton!

308
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,880
Uncle!

309
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,970
They were going to burn me.

310
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,964
After my mother died...

311
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,403
...I thought that I felt
the grace of God.

312
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,082
I thought he was calling me back.

313
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,921
That wasn't God.

314
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,280
That was just grief.

315
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,680
An emptiness.

316
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,123
To me belong vengeance
and recompense.

317
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,571
Their foot shall slide
in due time.

318
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,003
The day of their calamity
is at hand.

319
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,488
And the things that shall
come upon them

320
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,644
make haste.

321
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,211
I'm sorry, Mother.

322
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,966
Hey.

323
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,050
Hey, stay where you are.

324
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,602
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Stop.

325
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,406
I need to talk to the sheriff.

326
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,005
- Yeah, you can talk to him.
- You don't understand.

327
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,362
- He knows me.
- What's your name?

328
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,680
Deva Hopewell.

329
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,080
- You the mayor's kid?
- Yes.

330
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,766
Hey, hey, hey.
Miss Hopewell. Hey, hey, stop.

331
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,202
Miss Hopewell,
you are under arrest.

332
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,125
You have the right
to remain silent.

333
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,601
Anything you say or do will be held
against you in a court of law.

334
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,566
- These things take time.
- Yeah.

335
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,371
I can handle it.

336
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,929
- Can you?
- Most of the time.

337
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,689
What the fuck is this?

338
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,048
Jasper, Bryce.

339
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,851
Jesus Christ, Bunker.
You're a fucking pig?

340
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,970
I'm a Banshee deputy sheriff.

341
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,771
You're a motherfucking traitor.
I should stab you through the heart.

342
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,809
Expressing your opinion
isn't a crime,

343
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,684
but threatening
a peace officer is.

344
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,803
So was torching that kike
temple in Harrisburg,

345
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,564
but I don't remember
that stopping you.

346
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,328
- Calvin still running things?
- Damn straight he is.

347
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,045
But if you think he's gonna
protect you from us,

348
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,645
you got another think coming.

349
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,087
Calvin should have killed you
when he had the chance.

350
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,765
You tell my brother
I'll be seeing him real soon.

351
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,800
Thank you, boys.

352
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,249
Why, Colonel, right?

353
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,931
Were you a military man?

354
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,684
No, just watch a lot of movies.

355
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,001
What's your poison?

356
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,128
Maker's Mark, neat.

357
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,129
All this time in Banshee

358
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,410
and I've never been
in here before.

359
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,566
Well, it's not much to look at,

360
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,361
but at least the roof
doesn't leak.

361
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,409
Hmm.

362
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,161
You know, the craziest thing
happened the other day.

363
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,965
Did it?

364
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,644
Four idiots decided to steal

365
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,002
a considerable
amount of my money.

366
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,365
Is that so?

367
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,286
But that's not the crazy part.

368
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,650
These guys actually thought they
were gonna get away with it.

369
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,204
See, what you have here
is a lose-lose situation.

370
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,921
I never lose.

371
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,040
Damn it!

372
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,320
Thanks for the drink.

373
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,045
Fuck you.

374
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,561
Job.

375
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,931
Who the fuck are you?

376
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,603
My name is Leo.
Maybe you've heard of me.

377
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,966
Don't flatter yourself.

378
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,242
Well, I've definitely
heard of you, Job.

379
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,042
That's why I doubled
the sedative.

380
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,000
This is actually
a very big moment for me.

381
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,603
- You have to go back for him.
- No, Em, I don't.

382
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,921
- Now come on.
- Well, then I will.

383
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,401
The hell you are.
Em, listen to me. Listen.

384
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,523
Do you have any idea how close
you came to dying tonight?

385
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,284
They were going to kill
you because of him.

386
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,249
- Let go of me!
- Jesus Christ!

387
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,290
Open your eyes!

388
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,121
Do you understand? You are shacking
up with a fucking psychopath.

389
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,884
What, you're gonna let him
die because you're jealous?

390
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,247
Fuck you, Brock!
You coward.

391
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,320
Oh, yeah?

392
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,130
Oh, fuck!

393
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,482
And you're welcome
for saving your goddamn life.

394
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,806
Sir.

395
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,001
Where is she?

396
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,209
I just need your
signature on this report

397
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,725
and you can take
your daughter home.

398
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,527
- She's not going home.
- What?

399
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,051
At least not tonight.

400
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,166
Yes, sir.

401
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,841
I'm sorry, Deva.
I don't know what else to do.

402
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,006
Dad.

403
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,361
Dad!

404
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,571
Thank God.

405
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,561
I thought you were dead.
Come on.

406
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,604
Okay, we're gonna have
to get you to the hospital.

407
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,250
We're not going to any hospital.

408
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,244
- Why?
- I made a mistake.

409
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,729
I should never have allowed
things to go this far.

410
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,401
What are you talking about?

411
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,244
You and I will never
see each other again.

412
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,447
- I don't understand.
- Thank you

413
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,125
for your services to my mother.

414
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,206
You'll be compensated
for your time and trouble.

415
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,764
Wait, don't do this, Kai.

416
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,770
I know you're trying to protect me,

417
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,127
but I'm not afraid of those
men when I'm with you.

418
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,771
Good bye.

419
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,848
It's not those men
you need to be afraid of.

420
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,366
Hey.

421
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,009
I know this might
be hard to believe,

422
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,969
but your father thinks he's
doing what's best for you.

423
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,326
He's not really my father.

424
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,040
Bunker.

425
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,482
Sir, Miss Hopewell is
being held for possession.

426
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,766
Give me the keys.

427
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,366
Let's go.

428
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,001
With all clue respect, sir,
Mayor Hopewell wanted her...

429
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,242
I don't give a shit what
he wants. Let's go.

430
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,242
You got any stuff?
I'll take you home.

431
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,244
Sorry to wake you.
I just couldn't help myself.

432
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,131
I must admit, I am
probably your biggest fan.

433
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,449
If you wanted my autograph,
motherfucker,

434
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,523
all you had to do was ask.

435
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,091
Maybe later.

436
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,289
Save your strength.
You're going to need it.

437
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,204
It's funny how things work out.

438
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,010
Don't you think?

439
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,405
I am curious, though.

440
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,044
Was the decision to steal
my money made before or...

441
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,724
...or after you spread
your legs for me?

442
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,046
Do you really think I'd fuck
you if I didn't have to?

443
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,081
Give me the name of your fourth,

444
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,049
and I'll keep your
suffering to a minimum.

445
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,326
No.

446
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,011
Give me a fucking name now.

447
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,680
Fuck you.

448
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,484
One way or another, I will find
the person you're protecting.

449
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,885
Only question is, how much of you is
going to be left by the time I do?

450
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,244
What the fuck, Hood?
You had no right taking Deva home.

451
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,563
Now you listen to me. You stay
the hell away from my daughter.

452
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,808
5.56 NATO Green Tip.

453
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,810
Where's Ana?

454
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,567
- What?
- Where is your wife?

455
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,291
Jesus Christ, what the
fuck did you do now?
