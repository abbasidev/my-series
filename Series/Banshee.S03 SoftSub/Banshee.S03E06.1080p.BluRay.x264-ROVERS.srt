1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,120
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,084
hallowed be Thy name.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,643
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,650
on Earth as it is in heaven.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,605
Give us this day our daily bread

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,922
and forgive us our trespasses,

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,209
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,968
and lead us not into temptation,

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,963
but deliver us from evil.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,691
Amen.

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,326
I'm gonna go with shitty day
and whiskey neat.

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,766
You coming or going?

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,690
I'm still working that out.

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,249
Is it always this quiet
around here?

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,164
Let's stimulate
the local economy.

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,243
- Next round's on me.
- All right.

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,767
All you tourists
buying me drinks today.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,082
Oh, I'm not a tourist.
My name's Lucas Hood.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,244
Come Monday, I'm being sworn
in as the new sheriff.

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,651
Congratulations.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,729
Your boss know you're here?

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,566
Don't you worry about him.

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,930
You know the drill.

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,761
Look at this guy.

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,287
Excuse me.
Are we disturbing you?

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,761
No, not at all.
This is just a very good steak.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,002
And I know once I stand up
to deal with you fellas,

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,243
well, maybe you'll come quietly
or maybe I'll have to kill you.

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,164
But either way,
this steak is gonna get cold.

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,891
And you can always reheat a steak,
but it's never quite the same.

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,681
You have some balls on you,
motherfucker.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,082
Sheriff's Department.
I'll take that gun now.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,204
You drop your fucking gun.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,681
Why don't you all put
your fucking guns down?

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,891
See, what we have here
is a lose-lose situation.

36
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,683
There's still options
on the table.

37
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,606
You boys could be smart,
take a wad of cash,

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,091
a bottle of bourbon,

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,883
go home, sit on the porch,
get drunk.

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,130
Call it a good day.

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,251
Or you can be stupid.

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,562
Try and shoot it out
with the sheriff here.

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,764
Best-case scenario,
one of you boys is dead.

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,845
Think about that.

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,487
Seems like
a no-brainer to me.

46
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,082
But then, what the fuck do I know?

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,288
Take the money, assholes.

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,167
We'll take the cash
and the bourbon.

49
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,526
Hmm.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,011
Sheriff?

51
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,451
Thanks.

52
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,928
That deserves
another round on me.

53
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,645
Sorry about your cash.

54
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,605
Don't mention it.

55
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,881
Hey, thanks for saving my ass.

56
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,366
No problem.

57
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,362
He seemed to be
in an awful hurry.

58
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,531
Maybe I can get my nose
pierced somewhere.

59
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,051
Don't even think about it.

60
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,885
Beaty's mom said she could
get her nose pierced.

61
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,123
Couldn't get out of the car, huh?

62
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,766
I don't blame you.

63
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,446
I know everything
is so messed up, but...

64
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,448
...this town needs a sheriff, Hood.

65
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,321
You hear me?

66
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,606
Hood?

67
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,845
And what I need...

68
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,403
...is for the two of us
to go find that fucker

69
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,928
and make him pay
for what he did to her.

70
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,201
There is a season
for everything.

71
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,407
A time for every event
under heaven.

72
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,483
A time to be born,

73
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,485
a time to die.

74
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,369
A time to plant

75
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,804
and a time to uproot
what was planted.

76
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,326
A time to kill...

77
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,845
...and a time to heal.

78
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,970
There is a time to tear down

79
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,043
and a time to build up.

80
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,044
Today is the time

81
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,682
we mourn our dear sister
Leah's passing

82
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,208
and weep for the end
of her earthly journey.

83
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,926
And tomorrow will be
the time to move on,

84
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,722
to celebrate her righteous life

85
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,402
and revel in Leah's
heavenly salvation.

86
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,365
How are you?

87
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,446
Kai and Leah didn't
speak for 20 years.

88
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,246
We don't want that.

89
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,602
Please, come home.

90
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,731
We forgive you.

91
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,046
I don't forgive you.

92
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,364
And I never will.

93
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,722
- Please, Rebecca.
- Good-bye, Mother.

94
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,930
What we had, was any of it real?

95
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,971
All of it.

96
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,766
I don't want to die tonight.

97
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,204
Please. Please.

98
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,284
Would you really
just have walked away?

99
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,931
If that's what you want.

100
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,851
What if it isn't?

101
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,410
Then we leave together.

102
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,206
You want me
to get that?

103
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,484
I just wanted
to say good-bye.

104
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,408
Thank you for showing such
compassion for my mother...

105
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,400
...Emily.

106
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,408
I should have been there
to say good-bye.

107
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,851
The morphine was
affecting her speech,

108
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,924
but I do know that
in her final moments

109
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,645
she was thinking of you.

110
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,369
How much she loved you.

111
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,965
How proud she was.

112
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,051
Your mother was a tough
and honest woman.

113
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,970
She saw the good in you.

114
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,526
So do I.

115
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,640
You okay?

116
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,050
Yeah, I'm fine.
What can I do for you?

117
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,283
I just went a few rounds
with Proctor's new lawyer.

118
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,647
This situation with Hood
is gonna be messy.

119
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,007
Proctor resisted arrest
and assaulted the sheriff.

120
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,531
Seems pretty cut and dry to me.

121
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,920
If that's what really happened.

122
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,810
- Yeah, that's what really happened.
- Good.

123
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,123
Glad you believe that since you'll
be the one testifying at the trial.

124
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,169
- Why me?
- You're the arresting officer.

125
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,367
Hood was a victim.

126
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,044
I've got witnesses that
say otherwise, Brock.

127
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,690
That's not cut and dry,
it's complicated.

128
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,120
You know what, Gordon?

129
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,920
I will do anything you need
to convict Kai Proctor.

130
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,691
Sounds personal.

131
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,921
It is.

132
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,801
You mind?

133
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,130
Yeah, be my guest.

134
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,646
Make sure you get a good, firm
grip on that handle 'cause it...

135
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,211
Shoot much?

136
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,960
Yeah, now and then.

137
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,685
He's gonna be okay, you know?

138
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,411
Oh, I know.

139
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,046
Ain't like he's never had
his heart broke before.

140
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,885
But not all jobs
are created equal.

141
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,122
Any fuckups on this one
could get us all dead.

142
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,611
So, what?
You want to call it off?

143
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,444
Don't matter what I want.

144
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,524
I'll let you know when it's done.

145
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,326
What do you need?

146
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,326
Nothing.

147
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,088
Baby, I ain't talked you
out of doing something

148
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,049
since
nineteen-ninety-never,

149
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,929
so I'm going to ask you again.

150
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,081
What do you need?

151
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,767
Sir, we have a situation.

152
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,881
Who the hell is tall,
dark, and Nazi?

153
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,087
What is it, Bunker?

154
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,926
The FBI has got a TAC team
setting up shop inside the Cadi.

155
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,320
They found Chayton.

156
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,889
Brock figured
you'd want to know.

157
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,603
I'm sure you're as happy
about this as I am.

158
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,925
Who's in charge?

159
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,842
Anybody not wearing
a badge clear out now.

160
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,126
One guess.

161
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,480
Hood. Can you guys
give us a minute?

162
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,520
You want me to play nice?

163
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,966
It's not what I want
that matters.

164
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,964
Chayton Littlestone
is the DOJ's problem now.

165
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,969
The feds have
operational command.

166
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,362
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

167
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,731
Commander Ferillo.

168
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,850
This is Sheriff Hood.

169
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,401
He and his team are here to support
you in any way you see fit.

170
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,483
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
You're just in time.

171
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,130
I was about to brief my men.

172
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,211
Our primary target
is a threat level one.

173
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,569
Director has authorized the use of
necessary force in his apprehension.

174
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,762
Eye in the sky has detected
a remote Redbone encampment

175
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,365
deep in Kinaho territory.

176
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,404
The area is heavily wooded
with limited vehicle access

177
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,925
and limited
nighttime visibility.

178
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,321
CIRG will stage on
this adjacent access road.

179
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,766
We'll approach on foot.

180
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,730
We'll execute the arrest
warrant at first light.

181
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,962
- Any questions?
- Yeah, what about us?

182
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,123
Local law enforcement and members of
Kinaho PD will observe the operation.

183
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,001
Observe?

184
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,489
Sheriff, I know this guy
killed one of your own

185
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,369
and I am sympathetic to that.

186
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,010
That's why you're being
invited along.

187
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,726
But make no mistake; this matter
falls under federal jurisdiction.

188
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,804
So, please, do us all a favor
and stay out of the way.

189
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,721
Sure thing.

190
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,645
Can you get this table set up?

191
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,324
Can somebody get
this shit out of here?

192
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,528
We open up in two hours.
Come on.

193
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,241
Put some polish on those poles.
I want them to shine.

194
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,890
She can polish my pole.

195
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,205
Is there a problem over here?

196
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,611
No, ma'am.

197
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,762
There are two cases
of vodka out back.

198
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,446
- Bring them to the bar.
- You know, I would, but...

199
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,091
I don't work for you.

200
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,770
I work for Mr. Proctor.

201
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,364
Now you don't work for anybody.

202
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,130
- Pack your shit and go.
- Suck my dick.

203
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,282
Please escort this man
off the property.

204
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,090
He's trespassing.

205
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,925
You're gonna escort me now.

206
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,726
Yes, ma'am.

207
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,080
Let's go.

208
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,846
Okay.

209
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,088
You're out of your league, cunt.

210
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,291
Get him out of here.

211
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,010
What is it?

212
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,321
There are three men here
from Philadelphia

213
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,441
asking to see Mr. Proctor.

214
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,521
Frazier's men?
Show them in.

215
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,481
Gentlemen.

216
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,966
You must be Lennox.

217
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,963
I've heard good things
from my Uncle Kai.

218
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,525
Please, have a seat.

219
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,602
- Where is Mr. Proctor?
- Tending to other business.

220
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,364
I'll be speaking on his behalf.

221
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,363
We're accustomed to dealing
direct with your boss.

222
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,887
And we're accustomed to dealing
directly with your boss,

223
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,485
Mr. Frazier.

224
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,206
But seeing as you drove all
the way from Philadelphia,

225
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,691
I'm willing to make
an exception.

226
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,446
How about you?

227
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,887
In light of recent events,
Mr. Frazier would like

228
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,202
to reestablish his business
dealings with Mr. Proctor.

229
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,930
Is the Cage family
no longer making deliveries?

230
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,809
We're prepared to double
our previous order

231
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,247
in exchange for a modest
price reduction.

232
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,201
You want a discount?

233
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,124
As well as Mr. Proctor's
personal assurance

234
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,521
that he will stop selling
to the Salvadorans,

235
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,125
effective immediately.

236
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,451
Mr. Proctor will start
selling to Frazier again,

237
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,410
but our prices
have gone up, not down,

238
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,965
in light of recent events.

239
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,844
A ten percent increase.

240
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,128
And as for the Salvadorans,

241
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,248
tell your boss

242
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,768
that Kai Proctor sells
to whoever he wants.

243
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,051
Thank you for your time.
We'll be in touch.

244
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,287
My father believed in
an angry and vengeful God,

245
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,729
one who punished transgression
with pain and suffering.

246
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,931
As a child, he taught me
to cower in fear.

247
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,884
But the older I got,

248
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,202
the more his dogma
angered me, so...

249
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,729
...I put that cross on my back
as a challenge to his God.

250
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,726
To finally see if I'd be dealt
with the way he said I would.

251
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,369
- And were you?
- No.

252
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,169
At least I didn't think so.

253
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,249
But lately I've begun to
wonder if the punishment

254
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,129
was something more subtle,

255
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,485
less obvious.

256
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,285
You're alone.

257
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,245
Yeah.

258
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,490
You don't have to be.
Neither of us does.

259
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,845
You'll learn things about me
that you won't like.

260
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,162
I've lived in this town
my whole life, Kai.

261
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,840
I know who you are.

262
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,441
We were all someone
else yesterday.

263
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,125
We'll be someone else tomorrow.

264
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,646
Hi. This is a nice surprise.

265
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,731
Hold that thought.

266
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,405
Miss Miller wants
that signed by a parent.

267
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,285
I was in the neighborhood and
figured you might still qualify.

268
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,644
You didn't hand in your
last three assignments.

269
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,161
Or some might say I'm only
three assignments behind.

270
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,129
Which, given
my home circumstances,

271
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,170
is a pretty significant
accomplishment, don't you think?

272
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,805
Deva, you know what
you and I have in common?

273
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,883
We were both lied to
for 16 years?

274
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,570
Yeah, that's one way
to look at it.

275
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,200
But there's also this.

276
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,482
We're the people that
we always said we were.

277
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,005
I'm still your father.

278
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,760
That'll never change.

279
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,120
Okay?

280
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,325
Come on, I'll drive you home.

281
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,688
No, it's okay.
I'll walk.

282
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,085
Thanks, Dad.

283
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,406
Right on time.

284
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,289
You know me.
I'm a creature of habit.

285
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,285
Sit with me.

286
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,125
- I can't.
- Come on, the place is empty.

287
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,165
Five minutes.

288
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,965
I miss what we had.

289
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,604
And I know you miss it, too.

290
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,681
Am I wrong?

291
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,851
No.

292
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,003
Then meet me
at the motel tonight.

293
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,170
I'm flattered.

294
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,962
But when I said we were through,
I meant it.

295
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,405
Okay.

296
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,003
I guess I just had
to take another run at it.

297
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,731
Believe me, I get it.

298
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,688
- The usual?
- Not today.

299
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,087
No, I just lost my appetite.

300
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,851
Thanks for the coffee.

301
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,527
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

302
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,569
Yeah, just a little embarrassed.

303
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,480
That was totally my fault.
I should be more careful.

304
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,331
Oh, my God.
I'm a total spaz.

305
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,811
No, no, you're okay.

306
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,969
- Have a great day.
- Yeah, you, too.

307
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,522
- Nice lift.
- Excuse me?

308
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,529
That guy, he never
knew what hit him.

309
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,490
How much you score?

310
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,762
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

311
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,206
What, you worried I'm a cop?

312
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,885
No, I know all the cops
in this town.

313
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,246
I'm worried you're a creep.

314
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,646
So you're from around here?

315
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,450
Is there a reason
you're still talking to me?

316
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,410
Well, it's not every clay
that I meet a beautiful girl

317
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,688
with mad pickpocket skills.

318
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,890
So just kind of wondering
what else you're good at.

319
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,085
I bet you are.

320
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,571
You want to get out of here?

321
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,726
I'm throwing a little party
with some friends.

322
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,649
Guaranteed good times.

323
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,764
You actually think I'd go to a
party with a total stranger?

324
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,765
I'm Charlie.

325
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,251
Charlie Knowles.

326
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,050
You say that like
I should know who you are.

327
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,725
No, but I'd like you to.

328
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,285
You're crazy.

329
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,566
Yeah.

330
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,086
Does that mean you're coming?

331
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,565
Can I bring a friend?

332
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,405
The more the merrier.

333
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,611
And the voice?

334
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,930
Whatever you hear,
I don't want to talk about it.

335
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,363
I miss what we had.

336
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,329
And I know you miss it, too.

337
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,767
- Am I wrong?
- No.

338
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,850
Un-fucking-believable.

339
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,200
Bring it in.

340
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,527
Redbone camp is a
three-mile hike due north.

341
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,409
Current intel shows that
Littlestone is in the camp,

342
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,721
so we are gonna take him down.

343
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,086
Sunrise is at 06:30.

344
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,284
I want the suspect
in custody by 06:33.

345
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,523
Three-mile hike due north.

346
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,444
Breach the perimeter,
three fire teams,

347
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,126
standard formation,
from here, here, and here.

348
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,760
Go in fast, we go in hard
while they're sleeping.

349
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,200
We should still
anticipate resistance,

350
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,725
especially
from Littlestone himself.

351
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,241
Now our objective
is zero casualties.

352
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,244
But if somebody has to get hit, damn
straight it's gonna be one of them.

353
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,811
All right, you know the drill.

354
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,924
Stay alert, stay alive.

355
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,850
Move out in 30 minutes.

356
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,045
Yes, sir.

357
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,362
You okay watching this
from the cheap seats?

358
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,166
- You heard the man. It's his show.
- Commander Ferillo.

359
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,646
I know that you have
a job to do.

360
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,165
I just want to be sure
that this is an arrest

361
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,890
and not an execution.

362
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,011
I'm sorry, who are you?

363
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,804
Aimee King,
Kinaho Police Department.

364
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,526
Well, Officer King,

365
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,047
that cop killer
is coming home with me.

366
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,328
Dead or alive,
the choice is his.

367
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,204
You might want to consider
whose side you're on.

368
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,210
- Commander...
- King, that's enough.

369
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,282
Sounded like you were sticking
up for that piece of shit.

370
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,971
You and I both know that Chayton
isn't leaving this mountain alive.

371
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,088
Yeah, but I don't have
a problem with that.

372
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,006
So why do you?

373
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,446
Look, I knew Siobhan, too.

374
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,046
He snapped her neck like a twig.

375
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,011
And he enjoyed it.

376
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,848
What is this place?

377
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,525
It was my parents' house.

378
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,724
And then after they died,
it became mine.

379
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,927
- Cool.
- Now it's anything I want it to be.

380
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,044
Sounds awesome.

381
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,725
Come on.
I'll show you around.

382
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,770
You guys all live here together?

383
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,445
Well, we're just like
any other family

384
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,967
except we actually
take care of each other.

385
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,160
You want to meet 'em?

386
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,405
- Sure.
- Come on.

387
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,647
Deva, this place freaks me out.

388
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,928
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- We don't belong here.

389
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,287
If you want to go, go.
I'm staying.

390
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,802
All right, everybody,
this is Deva.

391
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,041
Hey.

392
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,487
And that's...
What's your name?

393
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,284
- Beaty.
- Beaty.

394
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,246
- All right, here you go.
- Thank you.

395
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,565
He's waiting for you.

396
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,722
- You wanted to see me, Uncle?
- Yeah.

397
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,845
Our friend from Philadelphia tells me
you were a little confused

398
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,089
about the offer he delivered
from Mr. Frazier earlier today.

399
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,049
It wasn't an offer.
It was an insult.

400
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,487
It was a first step
in repairing a long-standing

401
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,608
and very important
business relationship.

402
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,370
They were buying from our competition

403
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,010
and you want to reward that
with a discount?

404
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,811
They're the customer.
I want to earn their business back.

405
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,323
A small concession
towards a bigger future.

406
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,010
But that's not
what we agreed upon.

407
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,764
I already agreed
to Frazier's terms.

408
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,524
We will reduce the unit price,

409
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,160
stop all sales to the
Salvadorans immediately.

410
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,566
Is that understood?

411
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,766
Uncle.

412
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,521
Please be reasonable.

413
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,250
Is that understood, Rebecca?

414
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,002
- Yes.
- Good.

415
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,966
Now, I called you in because
I'm sure you'd like to apologize

416
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,010
to Mr. Lennox and his associates
for the misunderstanding.

417
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,522
I apologize
for the misunderstanding.

418
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,240
- It won't happen again.
- Good.

419
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,765
Thank you,
Rebecca. You can go now.

420
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,685
Thank you, Mr. Proctor.

421
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,721
Get out.

422
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,206
Get the fuck out!

423
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,600
If you shoot me,
motherfucker,

424
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,569
you ain't getting shit
for your birthday.

425
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,561
You're late.

426
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,960
Now let me be clear.

427
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,441
I'm trusting that taking out
this Chayton motherfucker

428
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,564
will get you focused
on the real work at hand.

429
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,444
- Where's Chayton?
- Fuck you.

430
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,206
Where is he?

431
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,809
Shh.

432
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,370
Shh.

433
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,809
Shh.

434
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,326
Move in.

435
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,203
- Go, go.
- Move!

436
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,371
Where's the sheriff?

437
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,885
- Move in! Now!
- FBI!

438
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,280
Get the fuck out of here!

439
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,729
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

440
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,764
Down!

441
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,570
Go!
Down now!

442
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,571
Get on the ground!

443
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,449
FBI, get on the ground!

444
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,682
- Get on the ground!
- FBI!

445
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,881
Get down!

446
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,086
Sit still, I said!

447
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,685
Don't move, Chayton!

448
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,765
I'm not gonna let them
put me in another cage, Aimee.

449
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,247
- You murdered a cop.
- It's not murder.

450
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,966
It's war.

451
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,088
I knew her, Chayton.
She didn't deserve to die.

452
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,045
She chose her fate when
she put on that uniform.

453
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,846
Stop!

454
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,961
You're not gonna shoot me.

455
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,651
I Will if I have to.

456
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,490
No, you won't.

457
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,289
Shh.

458
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,726
Shh.

459
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,405
Why the fuck didn't
you shoot him, huh?

460
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,600
Where is he?

461
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,171
I said where the fuck is he?

462
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,490
You don't want to do that, sir.

463
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,725
I'll have your badge
for this, fucker.

464
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,246
Get in fucking line.

465
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,407
Oh, man. Oh, my God,
that was strong.

466
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,449
That was amazing.
That was your first one.

467
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,682
It was good.
It was a good pull.

468
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,811
Is it too early for a drink?

469
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,923
That depends
on who you ask.

470
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,845
Just leave the bottle.

471
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,489
Thank you for coming
to the funeral.

472
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,206
Someone shows you
respect in life,

473
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,167
the least you can do is return
the favor when they're gone.

474
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,724
I'm sorry for your loss.

475
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,330
You know, men like me...

476
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,762
...we're no strangers
to death.

477
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,650
Maybe because of that,
when it hits close to home,

478
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,490
we feel responsible.

479
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,124
Well, maybe you are
responsible.

480
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,842
Yeah, I suppose so.

481
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,726
You okay?

482
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,526
Tired.

483
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,486
Come to bed.

484
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,571
You heading out?

485
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,241
Yeah.

486
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,725
So tell me,

487
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,641
are you chasing something
or are you being chased?

488
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,368
- Can usually tell...
- A little bit of both.

489
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,490
Well, either way,
I hope it works out for you.

490
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,166
Thanks.

491
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,446
Thank you.

492
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,602
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.
