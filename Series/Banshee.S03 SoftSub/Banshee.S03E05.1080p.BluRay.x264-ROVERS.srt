1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,525
What are you thinking about?

2
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,122
I was thinking about something

3
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,442
someone said to me the other day.

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,441
I mean, you get used to
a certain way of being.

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,961
And...

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,242
...you think we are who we are

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,644
or you think we can change?

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,644
What, you mean people like you?

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,282
Well, me, you, people in general.

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,809
I don't know if anyone
ever changes really...

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,162
...but we can evolve, right?

12
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,645
I mean, that's what
we're trying to do, isn't it?

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,764
Just become...
better versions of ourselves.

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,287
Get down!

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,681
Get down!

16
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,721
Hood!

17
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,803
Shh.

18
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,763
Medicine will help with the pain.

19
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,246
Kai.

20
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,322
Forgive me, Kai.

21
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,086
If I had only been stronger...

22
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,401
...I could have saved you.

23
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,126
Could have saved us both.

24
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,125
Kai, where are you?
It's Emily.

25
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,361
You need to come home now.

26
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,880
Stay down.

27
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,203
- Where are you going?
- Can't let them get inside.

28
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,371
- Alma, you good?
- I think so.

29
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,851
All right, stay down.

30
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,323
Alma, get on the radio.

31
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,727
- Radio's fried.
- Try the landline.

32
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,521
The phones are dead.

33
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,603
And they're jamming cells, too.
Keep trying.

34
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,127
Hood! Hood!

35
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,762
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

36
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,405
- Raven?
- All good.

37
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,760
- Good.
- Everyone else okay?

38
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,967
- Yeah.
- Okay?

39
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,168
- Siobhan, you okay?
- I'm okay.

40
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,723
No blood. No blood.

41
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,726
You okay?

42
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,321
I... understand that my physical
appearance may be unsettling, but...

43
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,086
...never mind.

44
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,050
Who the hell was that?

45
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,645
I thought he was with you.

46
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,207
- Sheriff, get me out.
- Shut the fuck up.

47
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,004
Lock and load. Regroup.

48
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,208
Next one, move!

49
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,169
Gather the weapons.

50
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,686
- Brock.
- See if we can get you some water.

51
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,927
Yeah?

52
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,686
Get me out
of this goddamn cage right now!

53
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,966
Shut up, Proctor.

54
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,889
If you haven't noticed,
we got a bit of a situation.

55
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,326
I have no cover in here!

56
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,170
You've got
the same cover we all have.

57
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,766
If I wanted to get in here,
those gates wouldn't stop me.

58
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,809
Well, it's a good thing
you're already in here.

59
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,003
Hey, it's the Redbones.

60
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,522
They're spread out in the parking lot
and across the street.

61
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,842
We just need to hold them off
till the state police get here.

62
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,843
No, they're not coming.
Phones are down.

63
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,202
- Cells, too?
- Yeah.

64
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,771
Oh, shit.

65
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,927
All right...

66
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,606
so we're basically on our own
against a homicidal maniac

67
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,364
and a dozen thugs armed
like a platoon.

68
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,966
- That about sums it up.
- What the fuck do they want?

69
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,521
I don't know, but whatever it is,
we're not gonna like it.

70
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,043
They want me.
I killed Tommy.

71
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,881
I don't give a fuck what
Chayton wants. He's not getting it.

72
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,530
Raven, Siobhan, get these civilians
down to the basement.

73
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,085
Okay, folks. Come with us.

74
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,765
We're gonna take you
someplace safe.

75
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,921
You all right?

76
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,160
Yeah, I'm fine.

77
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,245
What the hell's
going on out there?

78
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,722
I'm guessing
these gates threw 'em

79
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,004
and they're regrouping,
figuring out their next move.

80
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,886
What's our next move?

81
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,251
I don't know how long
those gates are gonna last.

82
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,487
We need more firepower.

83
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,369
Go down to the armory,
get everything you can.

84
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,601
Is this enough?

85
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,161
I hope you don't mind, Sheriff,
I took some initiative.

86
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,763
Figured there was
no time to waste.

87
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,442
You're the guy who gave me
your resume, right?

88
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,761
Dade County
Sheriff's Department.

89
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,371
Yes, sir. Kurt Bunker.

90
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,000
How the hell did you get
into our gun locker, Bunker?

91
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,205
I smashed the lock.

92
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,285
- You're hired.
- What?

93
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,124
- Thank you, sir.
- Get those guns handed out.

94
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,441
- Serious... Hood.
- What?

95
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,602
- What about Mr. Proctor?
- What about him?

96
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,802
Keeping him in that cell is
a violation of his civil liberties.

97
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,291
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

98
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,526
Sheriff, are you gonna
let him out or not?

99
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,648
- Not.
- Okay, so the sheriff is willfully

100
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,290
endangering the life of my client.

101
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,044
You're an officer of the court.
Do something.

102
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,691
This is a war zone, Counselor.

103
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,649
Due process just got blown up.

104
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,723
Hey, Sperling, I got an idea.

105
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,484
Why don't you go down
to the basement?

106
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,802
I'm not fucking going anywhere
without Mr. Proctor.

107
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,962
Okay, Bunker, give him a gun.

108
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,724
What? Why?

109
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,571
Time to make yourself useful.

110
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,811
I don't know how to shoot that thing.

111
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,485
Well, neither do I,
but it's not gonna stop me.

112
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,087
Ma'am, that gun
packs a powerful kick.

113
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,005
Are you gonna stand there like
a total misogynist and patronize me,

114
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,003
or are you gonna show me
how to shoot the damn thing?

115
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,646
Thank you. I just felt married again.
All right, here we go.

116
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,365
Magazine goes
right in here, all right?

117
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,681
Make sure the safety is off.

118
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,729
One in the chamber.
And just point, squeeze.

119
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,087
Repeat as necessary.
Hood, the basement.

120
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,321
What about it?

121
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,688
The exterior doors
don't have gates on them.

122
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,286
Bunker, through the range
down the stairs.

123
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,091
I'm on it. Sir.

124
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,685
Alison, you go with him.

125
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,763
I'm not going anywhere
with that guy.

126
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,365
With all due respect, ma'am,

127
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,602
I understand my physical appearance
may be alarming...

128
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,888
Save it. I've known men like you.

129
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,762
- I know everything about you.
- Hey, you wanted to help people.

130
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,445
There's people down there
who need your help.

131
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,045
Then let the Nazi calm them down.

132
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,207
I'm asking you.

133
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,521
Fine.

134
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,370
But keep your distance.

135
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,364
And I am new with this thing,
so it might just accidently go off.

136
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,288
- Fair enough?
- Yes, sir.

137
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,883
Citizens are secured
in the basement.

138
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,206
What do we do now?

139
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,641
All right, spread out, settle in.

140
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,401
You shoot anything
that comes through those gates.

141
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,251
Hood!

142
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,521
Hood!

143
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,601
I'm listening.

144
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,366
You've got Billy Raven
and Proctor in there.

145
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,931
Send them both out
with Nas and Tate,

146
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,129
and we'll spare the rest of you.

147
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,280
- Let me think about it.
- You got two minutes.

148
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,722
Sheriff, you are not
seriously considering

149
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,962
handing Mr. Proctor over
to that psychopath?

150
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,565
Relax, Jackson.

151
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,488
I'm sure the sheriff hasn't forgotten
a night much like this one

152
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,887
where he would have died
if not for my intervention.

153
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,964
Huh, Sheriff?

154
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,406
Hey, Chayton.

155
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,285
- Can't do it.
- You won't get another chance.

156
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,726
Is that right?

157
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,365
Tell you what.

158
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,603
You leave now, I let you live.

159
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,371
We are coming in there, cop.

160
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,931
Maybe, but if you do,

161
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,690
more Redbones are gonna die.

162
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,771
Wasn't your little brother enough?

163
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,530
Shut your mouth, white boy.

164
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,242
You know, you really
should have protected him more.

165
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,202
I'm gonna make you suffer.

166
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,085
Hey, Chayton.

167
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,281
Fuck off.

168
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,809
If those gates come down,
we won't last long.

169
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,490
How much ammo we got left?

170
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,885
Not enough.

171
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,122
Sheriff, let me talk to Chayton.

172
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,290
He doesn't want
to talk to you, Billy.

173
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,210
- He wants to kill you.
- I could end this.

174
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,283
What, by sacrificing yourself?

175
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,044
- It's tribal justice.
- No, bullshit is what it is.

176
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,365
We go down, we go down together.

177
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,443
Well, this sucks.

178
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,762
- Who needs a light? Siobhan?
- I got one in my drawer.

179
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,450
- Billy? You got it?
- Got it.

180
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,410
- Hey, Brock!
- Here, take it. Go.

181
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,801
Where's the emergency lights?

182
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,922
- We don't have emergency lights.
- Perfect.

183
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,648
- Fuck. Stay down.
- Shit.

184
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,005
You're wasting your time.

185
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,768
At some point
Chayton is gonna wise up

186
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,161
and he's gonna pull
those gates off the hinges.

187
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,811
And then he's gonna
eat you alive.

188
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,321
I could always send you
out there as an appetizer.

189
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,606
Yeah.

190
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,241
Well, I'd rather fight
for my life out there

191
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,449
than wait in the dark
to die like the rest of you.

192
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,121
He's got a point.

193
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,005
- Hood, listen.
- Yeah?

194
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,322
There's a backup
generator in the basement.

195
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,005
Won't power everything,
but it'll buy us some light.

196
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,805
- I'll go.
- Okay.

197
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,324
- Who's there?
- Siobhan.

198
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,161
They took out the lights.

199
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,486
They're trying to mess
with our heads.

200
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,011
Well, it's working.

201
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,482
All right, listen.
Someone heard that gunfire.

202
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,961
Okay? So the state police,
they're on the way.

203
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,521
Till they get here, I need you
to hang tight. Can you do that?

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,161
Good.

205
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,569
Siobhan, take care
of that generator.

206
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,320
- All quiet?
- So far, sir.

207
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,081
You always so polite?

208
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,044
Only when I'm nervous.

209
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,370
- Hang in there, Bunker.
- Yes, sir.

210
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,249
- Oh, shit.
- Out of gas?

211
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,087
Almost. Here, hold this.

212
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,605
God damn it.

213
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,290
- Here, let me try.
- No, I got it.

214
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,445
- Come on.
- I said I got it!

215
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,081
This fucking day
just keeps getting worse.

216
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,609
How do you think I feel?
I was about to retire.

217
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,921
You're an asshole.

218
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,121
Yeah.

219
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,651
You don't even know
what you're doing here.

220
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,801
You're not even a cop.

221
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,441
No, I'm not.

222
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,288
Then why the fuck
are we all listening to you?

223
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,200
You know what?

224
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,771
You're right.

225
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,009
But I've been
in tighter spots than this...

226
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,245
...and I'm still here.

227
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,644
So I need you to trust me.

228
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,486
Ha! Do you have any idea
how ridiculous that sounds?

229
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,120
Yes.

230
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,810
I don't want to die tonight.

231
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,926
You're not going to.

232
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,843
We're all walking
out of this together.

233
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,331
Let's try it again.

234
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,850
Oh, thank God.

235
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,361
This isn't the first time
this has happened, you know?

236
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,531
I mean, one army of guys with
machine guns would be bad enough.

237
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,047
But two?
I mean, that's just...

238
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,166
Bad luck?

239
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,405
No, it's something else.

240
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,562
- Jesus. Hey.
- Hey.

241
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,365
- Here.
- Thank you.

242
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,081
Thanks.

243
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,730
It's so quiet in here.

244
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,401
You think they left?

245
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,370
Chayton's not going anywhere.

246
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,121
- Not till he gets what he wants.
- No, they'll make a move soon.

247
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,127
Wish I had...

248
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,086
Sperling!

249
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,731
What the hell are you doing?

250
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,649
I'm getting my client
out of harm's way.

251
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,961
Give me the keys, Jackson.

252
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,964
- Blow me.
- Get down!

253
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,442
- Shit!
- Give me the fucking keys, Jackson.

254
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,246
- Fuck off, Alison.
- Give me the fucking keys!

255
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,007
Al! Al!

256
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,487
Hey, hey.
Come on. Come on.

257
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,161
Where's Raven?

258
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,970
- Brock, where's Raven?
- In there.

259
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,649
- Raven!
- Yeah?

260
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,646
Cover me!

261
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,690
- Down! Down!
- Come on, move! Take cover!

262
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,530
Let's get this hole covered up.

263
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,687
Where's Proctor?

264
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,723
Apparently his lawyer
got him an early release.

265
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,530
- What?
- Help me. Help me.

266
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,926
Come on.

267
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,285
Those aren't gonna
hold them off for long.

268
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,089
No, but it's better than nothing.

269
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,325
- What is that?
- I don't know. Stay here.

270
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,761
Hook it up.

271
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,645
Let's do it.

272
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,810
We gonna have a problem?

273
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,121
No, not tonight.

274
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,330
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

275
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,568
And lead us not into temptation.

276
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,248
But deliver us from evil.

277
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,841
Thine is the kingdom.

278
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,571
The power and the glory.

279
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,006
Forever and ever.

280
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,081
Amen.

281
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,051
Go! Go!

282
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,125
- Stand clear!
- Move! Move!

283
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,445
Put it out!

284
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,084
I can feel you looking at me.

285
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,807
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

286
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,442
I'm not who you think I am.

287
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,244
Oh, really? Right.

288
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,970
- I guess you've changed.
- Yes.

289
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,690
People don't change.

290
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,810
When I was 16, I watched
my father beaten into a coma

291
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,962
by two men who looked
just like you.

292
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,607
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

293
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,486
To watch your father
helpless and bleeding,

294
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,203
begging two thugs to spare
his only daughter.

295
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,526
They didn't.

296
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,325
You know, spare me.

297
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,010
So tell me, Bunker,

298
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,887
what fills a man
with so much hate

299
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,124
that he has to permanently
paint it all over his body?

300
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,164
Announce to the world
that he hates something that much?

301
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,326
My father was
the biggest man I ever knew.

302
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,567
He beat me a lot
when I was a kid,

303
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,405
so I stayed away from home
as much as possible.

304
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,490
I had a stutter,
a really bad one,

305
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,001
so I didn't talk much either.

306
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,211
There was this guy
in our neighborhood, Tank.

307
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,204
Big and badass
and covered in tattoos.

308
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,042
And every time he saw me,
he would sit me down

309
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,725
and buy me a soda.

310
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,167
Tell me that I had the power
to change things.

311
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,884
Introduced me to his buddies.

312
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,045
They were the only people that...

313
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,763
made me feel like I mattered.

314
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,729
One day, my father
gave me a black eye.

315
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,770
I don't remember why,
but Tank saw it.

316
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,411
He marched me home,

317
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,924
he grabbed my father
by the throat,

318
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,044
made him apologize.

319
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,561
Made him promise
he would never do it again.

320
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,281
He said, "Your boy...

321
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,205
...is one of us now."

322
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,807
My father never laid
a hand on me again.

323
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,602
For the first time in my life,

324
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,285
I had power.

325
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,327
And before I knew it...

326
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,489
...I had become one of them.

327
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,962
That is no goddamn excuse.

328
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,001
I know that.

329
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,925
I know that.

330
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,926
Drop it, Proctor!

331
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,810
- No, Brock, it's okay.
- The hell it is.

332
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,041
Now drop your weapon.
Drop it!

333
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,328
- Get that fucking gun outta my face.
- I said drop it!

334
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,610
- I'm on your side!
- Hey, hey! The fight's out there.

335
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,649
An hour ago, I stopped you from
braining this asshole

336
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,841
with a fucking hammer.

337
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,405
Now you're letting him do
whatever the hell he wants?

338
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,170
- No. No, not in my house.
- It's not your house.

339
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,681
- It is my fucking house!
- Don't you fucking touch me.

340
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,561
Hey.

341
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,847
You gave Proctor a goddamn gun.
Are you kidding me?

342
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,126
He had the gun.

343
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,685
- I gave him some ammo.
- Why?

344
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,370
Because we need
all the help we can get.

345
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,010
No, no, no.
I don't want his help.

346
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,362
I don't need his help. I want
that murderer locked up in a cell.

347
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,682
- That's what I need.
- It was my call and I made it.

348
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,841
Yeah, of course
it was your call.

349
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,929
You know,
forget the law, forget the rules.

350
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,366
Just make it up as you go, huh?

351
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,204
- Hey, just calm down.
- No, fuck that!

352
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,887
People are dying
and any one of us could be next.

353
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,530
- Listen to me.
- No, you know what?

354
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,370
The fact is you go off
half-cocked whenever it suits you

355
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,204
and the rest of us
just have to fight your battles.

356
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,562
Well, I'm done. I've had it.
I'm not listening to you anymore.

357
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,085
All right, fine.
Give me your fuckin' badge.

358
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,686
My badge?

359
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,211
You know, before you got here,
I did this job by the book.

360
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,165
I put in my time,
I sacrificed my marriage for this job

361
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,727
because I'm good at it.
I'm good at being a cop.

362
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,566
Being good at killing people
doesn't make you right for this job.

363
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,085
Is that right?

364
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,722
'Cause you're pretty
fucking good at doing that, too.

365
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,570
Yeah. Yeah.
I did. I tried.

366
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,131
I tried, Hood.
I tried doing things your way.

367
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,243
I convinced myself
it was for the best,

368
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,366
but everything you touch
turns to blood.

369
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,644
Get everyone
in the other room now!

370
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,564
Go, go! Get out!
Other room, go!

371
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,125
Go, go, go!

372
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,121
Fuck.

373
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,926
Hey.

374
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,530
Hey, you all right?

375
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,284
Yeah, don't worry about me.
Just cover the door.

376
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,801
People are dying.

377
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,162
Everything you touch
turns to blood.

378
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,810
You don't even know
what you're doing here.

379
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,007
You're not even a cop.

380
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,689
- I'm going out there.
- What are you talking about?

381
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,126
Someone's gotta make
sure help is on the way.

382
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,810
- Hood, it's suicide.
- He's right, you'll die out there.

383
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,007
You can barely even stand.

384
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,321
We can't hold them off forever.

385
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,691
Find another way.

386
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,881
I'll go.

387
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,845
Once we're clear,
I'll call for help.

388
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,520
You won't get clear.
You'll be dead inside of 30 seconds.

389
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,409
Well, either way you win, Deputy.

390
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,204
You know what?
You're under arrest, Proctor.

391
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,765
You don't get to just
walk out this door.

392
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,485
Desperate times.

393
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,291
Right, Sheriff?

394
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,841
Godspeed.

395
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,411
If I don't make it outta here,

396
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,004
you stay the fuck
away from Rebecca.

397
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,361
Okay.

398
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,606
If I do make it,

399
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,089
you and I have
unfinished business.

400
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,447
Yeah, I know.

401
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,368
Don't forget to make that call.

402
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,650
Come on. Let's go.

403
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,211
Let's block up this door.

404
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,327
It's not too late, Rebecca.

405
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,005
Leave this house.

406
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,604
Find your own way.

407
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,330
Find your own way.

408
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,769
Raven's covering the bullpen.

409
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,209
Brock's downstairs
watching the door with Bunker.

410
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,760
Okay.

411
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,011
You think Proctor made it?

412
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,411
I do.

413
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,725
What we had...

414
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,285
...was any of it real?

415
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,571
All of it.

416
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,045
Are you sure?

417
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,924
How long were you locked up?

418
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,881
Fifteen years.

419
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,721
Oh, my God.

420
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,561
And then you come here
and Carrie's got Gordon and the kids.

421
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,961
That's right.

422
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,281
And now?

423
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,605
Would you really
just have walked away?

424
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,805
If that's what you want.

425
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,646
What if it isn't?

426
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,685
Then we leave together.

427
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,604
Do I know everything about you?

428
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,205
Not yet.

429
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,130
But if you want to...

430
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,321
...you will.

431
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,286
Okay.

432
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,809
Start by telling me
your real name.

433
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,081
Billy.

434
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,366
What the hell are you doing?

435
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,770
- I'm ending this.
- Get away from there!

436
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,805
I have to do this.

437
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,321
It's the only way.

438
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,807
- Chayton.
- Raven.

439
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,570
- This has to end.
- You know what it'll take.

440
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,288
- Blood for blood.
- I'll give myself up.

441
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,930
You call off your men.

442
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,326
You leave these people alone.

443
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,921
The time for negotiating has passed.

444
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,485
They'll all pay now.

445
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,970
For Christ's sakes.

446
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,122
Haven't you killed
enough people already?

447
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,651
Come on.

448
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,290
Come on, Billy,
we gotta get you outta here.

449
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,641
Come on.

450
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,290
Here, hold on.

451
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,282
- How bad?
- Just have to stop the bleeding.

452
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,005
Can he stand?

453
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,730
Yeah. Yeah.

454
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,370
Get him up.
Gotta go to the basement.

455
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,728
Fuck.
Come on, come on, come on.

456
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,884
No, just go.
Just go, we'll be right behind you.

457
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,565
- No, come on.
- Just go.

458
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,208
Go. We'll be okay.

459
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,447
Okay.

460
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,887
- I can't control my legs.
- You're going into shock.

461
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,568
- You need to get downstairs.
- I'm not leaving you here.

462
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,721
Siobhan.

463
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,361
Come here.

464
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,200
I killed Tommy.

465
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,126
- It's blood for blood.
- Billy, look at me. Listen.

466
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,649
You saved my life at the Savoy.

467
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,169
You're not gonna die for that.

468
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,046
I have no ammo.

469
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,927
Here.

470
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,090
In case I don't get a chance,

471
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,605
- I just want to say...
- Don't do that.

472
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,321
- Do what?
- What you're about to do.

473
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,641
I was just gonna say,

474
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,090
I still think I would have been
a better sheriff than you.

475
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,601
Yeah, you're probably right.

476
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,125
Should we go after them?

477
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,411
Help yourself.

478
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,840
Let her go, Chayton.

479
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,010
I said, let her go.

480
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,282
God damn it, you let her go
or I'll blow your fucking head off!

481
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,811
No. No.

482
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,127
No, no, no, Chayton. Chayton.

483
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,447
Just stop, okay?

484
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,443
This has got
nothing to do with her.

485
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,485
All right?

486
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,205
Please.

487
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,811
Please.

488
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,766
It's between you and me.

489
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,171
Just let her go.

490
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,241
Shh.

491
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,370
- No.
- Please.

492
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,045
- No.
- Please.

493
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,686
Shh.

494
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,329
Please. Please.

495
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,561
Mutter.

496
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,761
Mutter.

497
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,968
God, our Father...

498
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,323
Your power brings us to birth.

499
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,967
Your providence guides our lives.

500
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,005
And by Your command,
we return to dust.

501
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,170
Lord, those who die

502
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,322
still live in Your presence.

503
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,803
Their lives change,
but do not end.

504
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,321
I pray and hope for my family,

505
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,684
relatives, and friends,

506
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,525
and for all the dead
known to You alone.

507
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,004
In company with Christ,

508
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,244
who died and now lives...

509
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,401
Siobhan?

510
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,642
...may they all rejoice
in His kingdom,

511
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,763
where all our tears
are wiped away.

512
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,845
Siobhan?

513
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,050
Unite us together again
in one family...

514
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,521
Hey!

515
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,729
...to sing His praise
forever and ever.

516
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,041
Amen.

517
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,285
Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my.
