1
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,724
- Brock.
- Yeah?

2
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,371
Stop!

3
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,250
Better have a damn good reason
for trespassing on my land.

4
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,281
If this is your land,
you must be Sani Crow.

5
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,245
We're looking for
Chayton Littlestone.

6
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,244
He killed our friend.
She was a cop.

7
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,721
Then you came
a long way for nothing.

8
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,571
Oh, fuck.
I blame you for this.

9
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,764
This woman you say
Chayton killed,

10
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,331
what did she do to him?

11
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,051
Nothing.

12
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,369
Then why would he take her life?

13
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,409
'Cause he's
a fucking psychopath.

14
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,170
There was a time when you people

15
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,442
would have called him
a "wild savage" instead.

16
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,405
Yeah, that sounds about right.

17
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,404
Listen, he came to you for help

18
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,289
and you gave him sanctuary.

19
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,004
I understand that.
He's your people.

20
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,528
But right now every cop within a
thousand miles is looking for him.

21
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,281
Not even you can avoid
that kind of heat.

22
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,966
That's why I didn't
allow him to stay.

23
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,722
- When did he leave?
- Hood.

24
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,731
A few days before you showed up.

25
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,246
And where did he go?

26
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,847
My best guess
would be the Quarter.

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,604
It's not a big place.

28
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,651
Let's go.

29
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,764
Hundred bucks says he's lying.

30
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,002
- Doesn't matter.
- Why not?

31
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,128
He sent us
to the French Quarter.

32
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,404
Whether he's selling
us out or Chayton,

33
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,403
we all end up in the same place.

34
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,766
Yeah!

35
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,530
Brock, do you see him?

36
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,924
I can't see anything.
The crowd's too damn thick.

37
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,004
Hit that motherfucker.

38
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,401
- Hit that motherfucker.
- Boys, let's up the ante.

39
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,324
Let's get some real
shit up in here.

40
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,881
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

41
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,041
Yeah!

42
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,091
How the hell
did you get down there?

43
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,483
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is time for our main event.

44
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,687
In this corner,
from God knows where,

45
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,447
weighing in at...
who gives a fuck?

46
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,207
Our undefeated champion:

47
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,091
the Slayer!

48
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,289
Is it me, or does this
entire place smell like ass?

49
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,887
And now,
joining us in a surprise appearance,

50
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,610
a favorite here
at the Underground.

51
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,450
Born again.

52
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,922
Oh, yeah.

53
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,127
Chayton!

54
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,766
Hood.

55
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,604
Sorry.
Excuse me.

56
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,967
I can't see you.
Where are you?

57
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,085
Hood, where are you?

58
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,767
Yeah! Yeah, kill him!

59
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,531
Finish him.

60
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,251
Fuck.

61
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,130
Hood, what the hell
are you doing? Hood!

62
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,451
Hood!

63
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,166
The lady cop,

64
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,206
she was your woman?

65
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,325
Good.

66
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,046
Don't move, Chayton.

67
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,406
Fuck you, cop.

68
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,324
The next shot will blow
your fucking face off.

69
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,891
There are no guns
allowed in here.

70
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,361
We're cops, asshole.
This man is wanted for murder.

71
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,888
Not here, he's not. Here, that
man is under my protection.

72
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,368
Fine.
I'll shoot you, too.

73
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,888
Now that'd be a neat trick.

74
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,561
This didn't go as planned.

75
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,404
- Chayton.
- Fuck.

76
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,484
Is that man you're
fighting also a pig?

77
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,210
Yes.

78
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,244
Now, as much as I'd love

79
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,324
to give these fans
the death they deserve,

80
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,882
I think that killing
a police officer

81
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,443
might complicate my arrangement
with local law enforcement.

82
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,121
You're done.

83
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,250
You're done, Chayton!

84
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,767
I'll see you again, cop.

85
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,001
Yeah, you fucking know you will.

86
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,401
Now, what you gentlemen
need to understand

87
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,406
is that Chayton is a beloved
figure here at the Underground.

88
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,608
And it is only my goodwill

89
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,168
that is keeping
these dedicated fans

90
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,642
from tearing you
apart limb from limb.

91
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,408
And I'll wager you got
roughly 60 seconds

92
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,285
before that goodwill fails me.

93
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,850
Starting... now.

94
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,130
Come on, let's go.
Let's get the hell out.

95
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,647
Come on.

96
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,802
Goddamn it, I thought the
plan was to watch Chayton.

97
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,166
I didn't want to lose him again.

98
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,924
I'm pretty sure that's
what just happened.

99
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,804
- Now he knows we're here.
- That's an understatement.

100
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,445
What if he leaves New Orleans?

101
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,686
He's not going anywhere.

102
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,641
What is it, Burton?

103
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,883
There's a small discrepancy
in inventory at the factory.

104
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,171
- What, missing product?
- The opposite.

105
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,448
It seems we're showing
more profit than sales.

106
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,409
Well, that's a good
problem to have.

107
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,806
What would you like me to do?

108
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,321
Look into it.

109
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,085
Tell me what you find out.

110
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,841
Anything else?

111
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,530
No.
Nothing else.

112
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,846
Burton looked worried.

113
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,723
Oh, Burton always looks worried.

114
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,961
It's just business.

115
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,730
Hey, I thought you went out.

116
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,247
You thought wrong, again.

117
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,251
Did you lose something?

118
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,530
Not something.
$125,000.

119
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,571
Apparently some motherfucker

120
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,291
forgot I'm the one
who can count.

121
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,405
What the fuck were you
thinking taking that money?

122
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,925
Now hold on.

123
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,890
It's just a small taste
of what I got coming to me.

124
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,771
Nothing coming to no one until
we all decide how to handle it.

125
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,207
It's not like I'm running
off to Atlantic City.

126
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,407
I'm not an idiot.

127
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,250
Oh, you doing a damn good
impression of one.

128
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,886
Something came up.

129
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,048
- What?
- Something personal.

130
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,450
That's all you need to know.

131
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,929
Hey. Hey!

132
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,805
Let it go, Job.

133
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,281
I ain't sitting on this just
to cover for your fat ass.

134
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,771
You hear me?

135
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,484
You do what you got to do.

136
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,771
So Will I.

137
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,609
Take the bag directly
to the drop point.

138
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,726
You deliver to Morales
himself or no one at all.

139
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,242
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

140
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,690
Is there a problem?

141
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,728
If your uncle finds out...

142
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,289
Some chances are worth taking.

143
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,046
Don't you think?

144
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,765
Yes, ma'am.

145
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,849
Call me when you're finished.

146
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,922
You're violating our
agreement with Frazier

147
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,162
and selling to the Salvadorans.

148
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,681
Yes.

149
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,285
Your uncle won't like that.

150
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,164
Then don't tell him.

151
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,930
It can be our secret.

152
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,125
And in the end...

153
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,570
...he'll thank us
for it.

154
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,044
I'm not going to tell him.

155
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,808
It should come from you.

156
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,528
I'm trying to help him.

157
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,249
Can't you see that?

158
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,722
This woman is making him weak.

159
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,850
He's making bad decisions.

160
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,371
He's risking everything
he's built.

161
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,045
That's not going to happen.

162
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,208
It's already happening.

163
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,840
Fine.

164
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,805
Do what you have to do.

165
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,571
But just know you'll be
making him pick between us.

166
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,562
And do you really think

167
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,449
he'll choose you

168
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,080
over his very special niece?

169
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,928
Again. Good, good.

170
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,082
That's it.
One, two, three, slip.

171
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,685
There you go, baby.

172
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,846
Uppercuts, uppercuts...
one, two, three, four, five,

173
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,490
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

174
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,847
That's it.
One, two, three, slip.

175
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,729
Stay... keep your head up.
Keep your head up.

176
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,486
One, two, three, slip.
One, two, three, slip.

177
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,961
- Oscar.
- Come on... Shug.

178
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,964
What are you doing here?

179
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,926
How's he doing?

180
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,927
He was doing good,
all things considered.

181
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,883
But a few months back,
things got bad, you know?

182
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,926
Between the doctors, the nurses,

183
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,162
all the new prescriptions,

184
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,964
we're drowning, Shug.

185
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,046
Open it.

186
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,487
Jesus.

187
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,568
No, this is way too much.

188
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,610
It's not even close
to what I owe your old man.

189
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,450
Look, Pop took his chances
just like every other boxer

190
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,204
that climbed into that ring.

191
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,885
Could have
just as easily been you.

192
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,530
It wasn't.

193
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,646
Why don't you
stick around, you know?

194
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,370
You could give
some of those young punks

195
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,800
the benefit of your wisdom.

196
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,051
That bag is about
all the wisdom I got left.

197
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,204
You trying to give me
a heart attack?

198
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,450
A girl can dream.

199
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,326
Start talking.

200
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,608
No.

201
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,329
That's real mature, Job.

202
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,124
Now you tell me

203
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,326
who did you give that
motherfucking money to?

204
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,689
His name is Oscar Cruz Jr.

205
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,845
His father was a fighter.

206
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,611
So, what, you forgot his
son's bar mitzvah present?

207
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,566
Senior wasn't ready
for that fight.

208
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,961
The promoters didn't care.

209
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,485
I didn't care either.

210
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,449
I mean, the title
was on the line.

211
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,242
The ref should have stopped the
fight after I landed a few big ones.

212
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,210
Lord knows I couldn't.

213
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,371
By the time his head
hit that canvas,

214
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,801
I had scrambled
his brains so badly

215
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,043
that he would never speak again.

216
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,810
So where is he now?

217
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,369
He's in some overpriced
nursing home out West.

218
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,729
Drooling and wearing a diaper.

219
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,644
Now, could you please

220
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,009
give me my distributor cap back?

221
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,090
Is anyone there?

222
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,801
Oh, looks like you've been
down here quite some time.

223
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,404
They worked you over real good.

224
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,610
Always be prepared.

225
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,370
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

226
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,402
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'll cut you loose.

227
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,849
Just take your time.

228
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,650
I'll be right back.

229
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,605
Let's go.

230
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,804
I saved one for you.

231
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,571
Come on, let's go.

232
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,765
Can I help you?

233
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,924
I am going to help you
become a better man.

234
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,208
What the fuck
are you talking about?

235
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,011
What did he tell you?

236
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,846
You are going to graciously
return all the money he gave you.

237
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,729
That money was a gift
to my father.

238
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,530
Oscar Cruz Sr., died
in November of 2007.

239
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,729
I saw your handiwork
with the forged

240
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,962
hospital forms
and insurance records.

241
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,528
Junior's been collecting
his benefits for years.

242
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,603
Almost as long
as he's been playing you.

243
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,450
Sugar thinks I have no clue
what really happened

244
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,681
in the fight that night.

245
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,446
But I know what he did to my father
had nothing to do with boxing.

246
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,931
He took everything...

247
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,321
Bitch, I ain't come
to hear your sob story.

248
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,164
I come for the money.

249
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,530
Then come and take it.

250
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,530
What you did or did not do in
the past don't mean shit to me.

251
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,927
What concerns me is a colleague

252
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,243
that can't keep to the motherfucking
plan in the here and now.

253
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,801
I just want you to remember

254
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,486
I gave your punk ass a chance.

255
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,488
Float like a butterfly,
motherfucker.

256
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,127
You think you know
what happened, Job,

257
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,850
but you don't.

258
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,290
Who was she?

259
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,804
Well, if it ain't for money
and it ain't for glory,

260
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,121
there's only one thing left.

261
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,845
Who was she?

262
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,524
Her name was Vanessa.

263
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,524
I loved her, but she loved him.

264
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,449
I could hear her in the
stands cheering for her man.

265
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,240
A man who wasn't me.

266
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,446
I never felt that kind of pain.

267
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,880
I didn't know what to do with it.

268
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,408
So I gave it to Oscar
to deal with instead.

269
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,365
For 25 years...

270
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,960
...I sent his family
anything I could spare.

271
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,521
Wasn't much,
but it was something.

272
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,283
Listen to me. Let it go.

273
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,602
I have had more
than my fair share

274
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,285
of Podunk Tragedy Theater.

275
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,484
I do not have the energy.

276
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,331
Hey.

277
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,842
You could have kept
that money, you know?

278
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,569
Didn't have to say
a damn word to me.

279
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,044
So Why'd you give it back?

280
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,243
I didn't give it all back.

281
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,408
Ain't nobody in here
gonna talk to us.

282
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,046
No.

283
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,929
But they'll talk to Chayton.

284
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,929
And he'll find us?

285
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,924
That's the idea.

286
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,404
You know, Hood,

287
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,483
we've been working
together for a while now,

288
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,090
and I realized...

289
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,643
...I don't know the first
thing about you.

290
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,962
You know,
like where you're from.

291
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,090
Originally.

292
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,447
Town full of day drinkers.
That's a concept I can get...

293
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,120
You got something
on your mind, Brock?

294
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,085
Yeah.

295
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,844
Yeah, I guess I do.

296
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,805
You know...

297
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,250
...when we...

298
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,283
...when we killed Hondo,

299
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,129
I swore to myself never again.

300
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,285
And yet... here I am,
a short while later,

301
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,929
on another assassination junket.

302
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,165
Sometimes the law
can't give justice.

303
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,005
Oh, don't kid yourself, Hood.

304
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,969
This isn't justice.

305
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,282
Hondo wasn't justice, okay?

306
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,484
This is cold, hard,
self-serving revenge.

307
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,688
We're killers, okay?
Don't make us idiots.

308
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,171
Keep your fucking voice down.

309
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,691
Who gives a shit?
They're all drunk.

310
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,410
- You need to calm down.
- Fuck that, man.

311
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,325
We drove through five states
to come here to kill a man.

312
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,482
You don't have to kill anyone.

313
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,844
Then what the hell
am I doing here?

314
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,961
Huh?
What am I doing here?

315
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,611
Hood!

316
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,647
Oh, my God.

317
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,086
Oh, fuck.

318
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,044
You can't kill me, cop.

319
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,009
You're just a man.

320
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,326
No man can kill me.

321
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,051
Hood!

322
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,048
Damn it, give me that.

323
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,609
I underestimated you.

324
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,570
You're not a cop.

325
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,531
No.

326
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,330
Your people deal in lies.

327
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,764
You will never understand
the purity of true purpose.

328
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,368
Of a spiritual calling.

329
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,887
You're nothing.

330
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,921
I am a warrior.

331
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,885
I held her neck in these hands.

332
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,889
So delicate.

333
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,251
Felt her pulse
tapping against my fingertips.

334
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,961
The life running through her.

335
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,121
Hey.

336
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,081
We should probably
get the hell out of Dodge

337
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,044
before the locals show up, huh?

338
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,769
Hood, let's go.

339
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,925
I can't go back.

340
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,201
What?

341
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,686
I'm done.

342
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,441
I got nothing left.

343
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,886
So that's it?

344
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,765
You're just gonna walk away?

345
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,645
You know, I've been
driving myself crazy

346
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,088
trying to figure you out,
but I'm done.

347
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,247
Who you are, who you were,

348
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,721
where you're from, I don't care.

349
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,645
I don't care anymore.

350
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,808
The only thing I care
about is my town.

351
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,405
Kai Proctor has been
having his way with us,

352
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,881
all of us, for way too long.

353
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,921
But you, you're the first guy
that bastard couldn't own.

354
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,443
And together, you and me,
we could take him down for good.

355
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,127
No.

356
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,611
Goddamn it.

357
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,962
What do you think she
would have wanted, huh?

358
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,605
I'm not going back
to Banshee without you.

359
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,365
Gotta finish what you started.

360
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,286
Even if I've got to kick your ass
all the way back there myself.

361
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,211
I'm not leaving without you.

362
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,965
Are you done?

363
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,041
I think so.

364
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,001
Come on.

365
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,644
In the name of the Lord
and the Church,

366
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,964
we extend to you
the hand of fellowship.

367
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,483
"I am He who blots out
your transgressions

368
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,005
for my own sake

369
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,130
and remembers
your sins no more."

370
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,809
Rise up and be ye a faithful
member of the Church.

371
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,767
In youth we learn.
In age we understand.

372
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,884
This belonged to your mother.

373
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,840
Thank you, Father.

374
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,361
Thank you.

375
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,120
Kai.

376
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,329
Let's go.

377
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,090
Bacon burger.
Cheeseburger.

378
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,804
I thought you and
soldier boy were done.

379
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,561
We are.

380
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,251
Does he know that?

381
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,808
- Hey.
- Hello, Carrie.

382
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,402
Jesus.
What happened to you?

383
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,445
I got robbed.

384
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,251
Doug, are you okay?

385
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,881
I Will be.

386
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,001
Did you call the cops?

387
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,162
No, I'll be handling
this myself.

388
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,489
Maybe you can help.

389
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,371
I understand your father
was no stranger

390
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,284
to illegal behavior.

391
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,448
Maybe you could shed some light on
the nuances of the criminal mind.

392
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,320
My father and I had a
complicated relationship.

393
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,010
I doubt I'd be much help.

394
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,881
Okay.

395
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,850
I'd like some more water, please.

396
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,727
Of course.

397
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,008
They came in through
the old service tunnel.

398
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,641
A winch was used to breach
the steel door.

399
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,287
They took control of the security
cameras and motion sensors.

400
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,250
These guys used our own
defenses to their advantage.

401
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,210
The biometric lock was bypassed
using a dimensional latent clone

402
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,328
and high-end vocal
replication generator.

403
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,041
Somebody got close enough to steal
your voice and fingerprints.

404
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,282
Once they were inside,
the rolling vault codes

405
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,403
were exploited
by an elite hacker.

406
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,564
After that, all they needed was
an experienced safecracker.

407
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,929
And just like that,
our money was theirs.

408
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,601
Captain Murphy,
we have three unknowns.

409
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,364
Van driver makes four.

410
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,691
Start with the hacker.

411
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,729
He defeated every
encryption I set up,

412
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,644
avoided every malware trap.

413
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,691
And beyond that, he hacked into an
ironclad mainframe to shut us down.

414
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,530
You're saying
he's as good as you?

415
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,364
I'm saying he's better.

416
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,205
Tell me about the safecracker.

417
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,567
The lock was drilled
dead center,

418
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,087
the tumblers manipulated
with a gentle touch.

419
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,561
The approach was simple, elegant.

420
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,131
The work of a professional.

421
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,604
Are you sure I can't
get you anything else?

422
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,281
Not today.

423
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,326
The one I haven't figured out is
the one you fought in the tunnel.

424
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,645
He was well trained.

425
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,882
Lethal, but a little rusty.

426
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,443
He allowed his enemy to live

427
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,329
instead of cutting his throat.

428
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,084
It shows he's gone soft.

429
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,004
Maybe grown a conscience.

430
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,811
Why have his partners blow the
tunnel before he was clear?

431
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,289
Loyalty and a commitment
to the objective.

432
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,650
Number three is
gonna be a challenge.

433
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,290
Dismiss all enlisted personnel.

434
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,811
I want them off the base
within the hour.

435
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,207
Yes, sir.

436
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,845
Notify HQ that as of today
Camp Genoa is officially shut down.

437
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,524
We're gonna hunt them down and
take back what they stole from us.

438
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,887
And then we will make them pay.
