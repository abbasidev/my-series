1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,011
Hello?

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,885
Hello?

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,445
Hello!

4
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,727
Let me the fuck out!

5
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,449
Who the fuck are you?

6
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,128
You're smaller than
I thought you'd be,

7
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,601
which is strange because
you did a hell of a number

8
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,010
on your drill instructor
and he's not a pussy.

9
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,605
Probably not the first time your
temper got you into trouble, is it?

10
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,242
That's probably why you joined the
Army in the first place, right?

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,165
Or are you just a patriot?

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,685
Where am I?

13
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,571
Where aren't you?

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,885
You aren't in the brig
at Fort Benning

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,646
facing a court-martial that
could have landed you two years

16
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,485
in military prison and turned
you into an even meaner asshole

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,005
than you are now.

18
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,764
I had you moved.

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,530
You're welcome.

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,525
So what is this?

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,490
Well, I guess it's math class,

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,563
because I'm not wearing
a rank or an insignia

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,603
and this isn't a cell, so...

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,491
Special Ops?

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,360
Hey, fuck you!

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,366
Fuck me?

27
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,405
We'll see you
in a couple clays, kid.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,562
What?
Where are you going?

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,327
Hey!

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,089
Hey, asshole, come back!

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,445
Hey!

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,090
Let me the fuck outta here!

33
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,164
It's an honor to meet you.

34
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,163
Like I said, I'm a huge fan.

35
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,368
Bitch, I don't know
who you think I am...

36
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,490
You're Job. The Job.

37
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,687
In '91, you hacked
Banco Nacional of Caracas

38
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,168
and transferred $7 million
to humanitarian nonprofits

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,970
across South America.

40
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,090
Six months later, you infected the
mainframe of Wing-Lijun Shipping

41
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,084
with a botnet virus that cost
them almost $100 million...

42
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,527
I know the words coming out your
face are technically English,

43
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,843
but I still don't know what
the fuck you talking about.

44
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,771
I spent seven years at
cybercrimes tracking you,

45
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,490
studying your work.

46
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,123
The hack into the armory,

47
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,971
that was simple compared
with your other efforts.

48
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,484
But the way you pulled off the
timed reverse on our power grid?

49
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,529
I mean, there are maybe
two or three other hackers

50
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,001
who could have pulled that
off and they live in China.

51
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,889
Then why don't you
fuck off over there

52
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,565
and bore them to death?

53
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,886
Hmm?

54
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,206
In '94, you infiltrated
the NSA database...

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,890
and deleted the personnel records
of 40 covert military operatives.

56
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,004
My theory,

57
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,288
you just needed
to disappear one guy.

58
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,562
But you were
just being thorough,

59
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,280
as always.

60
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,089
Well, that one put you on
the CIA's radar for good.

61
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,768
I would tell you again

62
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,200
you have mistaken me
for someone else...

63
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,481
...but you seem
so goddamn excited,

64
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,810
I hate to ruin your fun, Leo.

65
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,969
You're the golden ticket, Job.

66
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,410
And I am going to cash you in.

67
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,921
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,287
You're impetuous, reckless.

69
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,683
- You defied me.
- I thought I was helping you.

70
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,325
Thank you, Burton.

71
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,810
Bring the car around.

72
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,766
I've been dealing with men
like Frazier and Morales

73
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,929
since before you were born.

74
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,764
You'll learn, Rebecca.

75
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,962
But in order to learn,
you have to accept the fact

76
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,009
that you don't know anything.

77
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,484
- Not yet.
- I understand.

78
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,007
Having said that,
we've both made mistakes,

79
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,320
mistakes that can
never happen again.

80
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,524
Are you going to Philadelphia?

81
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,371
We all are.

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,604
Man, get the fuck off of me.

83
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,010
Hey, that's enough!

84
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,121
Don't even think about it,
asshole.

85
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,564
Shit, are you okay, Job?

86
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,770
What the fuck kind of
stupid-ass question is that?

87
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,806
He's okay.

88
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,404
You got any idea
how Stowe landed on us?

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,570
We got sloppy.

90
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,364
Well, he doesn't know everything,
and that's the only thing

91
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,602
keeping us alive
until help arrives.

92
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,644
Yeah?
And who's gonna help him?

93
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,328
That man has exactly three
friends and they all right here.

94
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,450
Have some faith, huh?

95
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,045
Have you met me?

96
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,690
He's gonna come.

97
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,444
Oh, I know he'll come.

98
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,568
He'll take on the whole
motherfucking platoon.

99
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,284
Might even make it
past the front gate.

100
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,761
But there's still
a shitload of mercs

101
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,082
with a shitload of guns
between him and us.

102
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,562
I need to see Colonel Stowe.
We're old friends.

103
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,926
I'm not leaving till
you open that fucking gate.

104
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,365
- He'll find a way.
- Fuck you, he'll find a way.

105
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,647
He ain't your fairy godmother come
to make all your dreams come true.

106
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,650
How many more times does he have
to put his ass on the line for you

107
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,290
until he gets his
motherfucking head blown off?

108
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,801
- You're blaming me for this?
- I ain't the one who fucked the mark!

109
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,930
- Fuck you, Job.
- No, fuck you, Carrie.

110
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,483
Or Ana. Or whatever the fuck
you calling yourself today.

111
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,483
- If you were so worried...
- How'd your boyfriend know exactly...

112
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,483
...you could've shut this job down.
- ...how to take us all down?

113
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,847
- I'm a professional.
- What the fuck did you let slip?

114
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,809
- What you told that motherfucker?!
- I didn't tell him anything.

115
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,810
- How dare you?
- Both of you shut the fuck up!

116
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,210
If we're gonna die,
then we're gonna die.

117
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,326
Have some motherfucking
dignity for fuck's sake.

118
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,326
Job...

119
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,527
if she slipped up, the four
of us would be dead already.

120
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,929
We gonna make it
out of here alive,

121
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,844
we got to stick together.

122
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,651
Hmm?

123
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,885
Yeah?

124
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,361
Come.

125
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,726
- What are you doing here?
- I was in the neighborhood.

126
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,526
I don't have time for games. If you
have business with me, get to it.

127
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,611
What's going on, Colonel?
Everything okay?

128
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,451
Look, Sheriff,
I can only imagine

129
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,722
how boring and insignificant
your life must be,

130
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,370
but honestly,
I don't give two shits.

131
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,723
If you don't have a reason to be
here, then get the fuck off my base.

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,729
I got six million reasons.

133
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,081
The sheriff is a thief.

134
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,443
I'm not really a sheriff.

135
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,449
You've come here to negotiate?

136
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,047
I came here to tell you that if
you don't let my friends go,

137
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,089
you'll never see
your money again.

138
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,641
I can keep you here,
remove your fingers one by one

139
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,370
until you tell me
where the cash is.

140
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,091
We both know I wouldn't have
come here without insurance.

141
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,967
Right now, I have no clue
where your money is.

142
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,124
And if I'm not back
in half an hour,

143
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,767
my insurance is gonna call CID.

144
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,486
You've been a soldier.

145
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,285
My guess is you wasted every
opportunity you ever had,

146
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,285
disappointed everyone who
ever took a chance on you.

147
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,761
It's what insubordinate
assholes like you do best.

148
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,566
- You betray your own potential.
- You're really good at this.

149
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,281
- I want my fucking money!
- I want proof of life.

150
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,405
Thirsty?

151
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,044
You're dehydrated.

152
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,885
Your organs are starting
to shut down.

153
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,850
Sure you can feel it.
The headaches, the chills.

154
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,560
Soon the hallucinations
will become so intense,

155
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,768
you'll lose all sense
of reality.

156
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,804
Tell me the truth.
I will reward you.

157
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,329
What was your mother's name?

158
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,563
Catherine.

159
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,041
Catherine. Was she a good mother?

160
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,685
I guess so.

161
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,681
I'm gonna need you to be
more definitive with me.

162
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,523
Was she a good mother?

163
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,565
- Yes.
- Yes.

164
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,290
- Did you love her?
- Yes.

165
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,886
Yes.

166
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,883
Your father's name was Dennis.

167
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,201
Dennis.

168
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,967
- Did you love him, too?
- Yes.

169
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,002
Your father regularly beat
the shit out of your mother.

170
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,602
Put her in the hospital six times.
He beat you, too, didn't he?

171
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,924
- No.
- Of course he did.

172
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,844
That's why you had to kill him.

173
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,320
I didn't kill him.

174
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,844
Of course you killed him.

175
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,164
He was a horrible man
who made you suffer.

176
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,004
He made you
and your mother suffer.

177
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,242
And you killed him.
Just tell me that you killed him.

178
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,489
Tell me the truth.
Now, I want you to tell me the truth.

179
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,290
- I didn't kill him.
- Just tell me the truth.

180
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,925
- No.
- I want you to say to me,

181
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,606
"I killed my father."
I want you to admit it.

182
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,411
Tell me that you killed him.
You're safe.

183
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,967
You're here with me.
You had to make him suffer.

184
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,521
- I didn't kill him.
- Just admit you killed your father.

185
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,650
Tell me the truth.
Tell me that you killed him.

186
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,689
- I killed him.
- What?

187
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,763
- What?
- I killed him.

188
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,206
What?

189
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,450
I killed him.

190
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,845
Here you go.
Here you go.

191
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,724
Drink, drink, drink.

192
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,810
As you can see,
your friends are all alive...

193
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,531
for the moment.

194
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,842
Go get my fucking money.

195
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,170
I'm gonna pay a little visit.

196
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,250
We haven't really gotten
acquainted, bartender.

197
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,286
Hello, Kurt.

198
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,285
- Calvin.
- It's been a long time.

199
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,365
Welcome home.

200
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,321
Not bad, huh?

201
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,007
Yeah.

202
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,491
You know, when you
disappeared that night,

203
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,606
I thought you just needed to
clear your head for a minute.

204
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,930
But this is a lot to take in.

205
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,286
I'm sure.

206
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,726
Now, you're back just as
suddenly as you left, huh?

207
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,885
It was time to come home.

208
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,447
Right.

209
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,368
You left us in the lurch
that night, Kurt.

210
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,681
There were some who wanted to
hunt you down, make you pay.

211
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,285
But I defended you.

212
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,324
I lied to the Brotherhood for you.

213
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,410
And now you come
back here unannounced

214
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,568
and you do what you did
to Jasper and Bryce.

215
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,521
You're making it very hard
for me to keep you safe.

216
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,330
Am I?

217
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,721
Still...

218
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,250
you're my blood.

219
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,450
And like you always said, brothers
before Brotherhood, right?

220
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,964
So, big brother, I'm gonna give you
a chance to do the right thing.

221
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,049
You take off this uniform

222
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,641
and you come back
to your real family.

223
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,289
I'll smooth things over.

224
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,646
I'll get you in the way you
got me in back in the day.

225
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,923
I am going to do the right thing.

226
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,123
I'm gonna shut down the Brotherhood.

227
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,891
All of it.
You be smart, Calvin.

228
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,890
You have a wife
and a little boy to raise.

229
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,765
Walk away.

230
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,565
Walk away?

231
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,805
I'm not the dumb
little shit I was

232
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,407
when you saved me from Dad,
took me to my first rally.

233
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,882
There is no walking
away from it.

234
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,243
I am the Brotherhood.

235
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,489
Take care of your family.

236
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,281
Don't you come in here
and tell me

237
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,283
to take care of my family,
you fucking traitor.

238
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,768
We will fucking bury you.
You hear me?

239
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,609
Better watch your back,
big brother.

240
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,845
Tough day, Kai?

241
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,084
So, I see there's been
a family reunion.

242
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,603
Now, tell me, Kai, who the
fuck am I in business with,

243
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,923
- you or her?
- You're in business with us.

244
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,161
So you say.

245
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,961
But one says yes,
the other says no.

246
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,567
And now I have
no product at all.

247
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,370
We're here to change
all of that.

248
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,962
You didn't pull up in a truck.

249
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,206
Accept this gift
and our proposal.

250
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,883
There'll be a truck tomorrow,
free of charge.

251
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,651
Ming made a great fucking sword.

252
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,890
But you can never tell
the real quality of a blade

253
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,004
until it's used in battle.

254
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,489
What's the proposal?

255
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,889
Slowly, slowly, slowly.
Take your time.

256
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,281
It's okay. Take your time.
Take your time.

257
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,730
You've been angry
for such a long time.

258
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,610
That anger is there
to protect you from fear.

259
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,571
Now, we could argue
that the fear

260
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,246
comes from an abusive
and drunk father,

261
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,765
but it doesn't really matter
where it comes from.

262
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,806
What matters is that
it can be beaten.

263
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,049
I'm gonna rid you
of that burden...

264
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,169
so you can reach your potential.

265
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,570
And then you're gonna be ready.

266
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,450
Ready for what?

267
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,210
The Army again?

268
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,766
No.

269
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,850
Not the Army.

270
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,684
Something different.

271
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,571
Hey, Bunk.

272
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,081
Otto.

273
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,882
Jasper and Bryce
send their best.

274
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,601
Thanks.

275
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,770
So you gonna stand there
all clay like a pussy?

276
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,041
Or you gonna come over here

277
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,964
- and play?
- Hey, clear out.

278
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,281
Now.

279
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,290
I'm not gonna tell you again.

280
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,960
Let's go.

281
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,846
- We'll be seeing you, Bunk.
- Get off him!

282
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,480
I know you're gonna be seeing me
'cause I'm gonna be coming for you.

283
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,883
And we both know what a fucking
pussy you are without your backup.

284
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,281
- Get off him!
- Fucker!

285
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,609
- Bunker, let him go.
- Come on!

286
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,850
Oh!

287
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,162
Shit.
It's not working.

288
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,800
Now look, keep going.

289
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,648
- Don't give up.
- But please do shut up.

290
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,490
You're breaking my
motherfucking concentration.

291
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,726
Go!

292
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,921
Murphy!
Get out there!

293
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,050
You get the girl,
bring her to me.

294
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,281
Go!

295
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,409
Shut up!

296
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,689
We got to hurry the fuck up,
old man.

297
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,844
Look, just break the thumb.

298
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,085
- Sugar, are you sure?
- Yes.

299
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,971
That's the only way
we can get...

300
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,970
Whoo!

301
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,122
This is a good fucking sword!

302
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,725
We need to get you in the car.

303
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,882
No one's chasing me out
of my place of business.

304
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,281
- We'll be trapped inside.
- Then we'll fight our way out.

305
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,523
Sir, I respectfully
urge you to recons...

306
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,523
This is my office.

307
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,486
Everybody out. Come on. Move!

308
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,246
You hear that, man?

309
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,925
Coming from over here.

310
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,565
Come on, man.

311
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,362
Okay, bitch. Let's go.

312
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,329
Well, hello there.

313
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,969
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know.

314
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,721
What?
Let's get the fuck out of here.

315
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,041
Come on.

316
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,606
Hold it!

317
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,286
God!

318
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,401
I'm gonna circle around
and draw his fire.

319
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,050
- Ready?
- Go!

320
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,844
- Sugar!
- I'm clear.

321
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,525
Grenade!

322
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,964
Hey!

323
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,324
Remember me?

324
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,721
Who could forget a face
that fucking ugly?

325
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,131
Not bad.

326
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,403
You've been holding out on me.

327
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,483
Ah!

328
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,928
You fight better than you fuck.

329
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,320
I got you, you motherfucker.

330
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,889
Fucking messy.

331
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,204
You don't like the way I kill,

332
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,323
you kill the next one.

333
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,731
Done.

334
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,163
No one likes a wiseass.

335
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,406
Fuck.

336
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,765
Lennox!

337
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,285
Lennox!

338
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,131
Lennox.

339
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,566
I...

340
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,725
Hello, Frazier.

341
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,002
Oh.

342
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,003
- Proctor.
- That's right.

343
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,087
I told you you were making a mistake.

344
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,843
Is there a new deal
you have in mind?

345
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,603
Yeah, but not with you.

346
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,044
Now, I know you can't
see the room right now,

347
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,726
so I'll do my best
to describe it for you.

348
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,684
You got three men on the floor.
They're all dead.

349
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,525
Your buddy Lennox,
he's at your feet

350
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,045
slowly bleeding to death.

351
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,884
He appears distraught.

352
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,080
I'm here with my niece
Rebecca and Burton.

353
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,571
You know Burton.

354
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,882
And our mutual associate
Hector Morales.

355
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,489
Now, Hector, he has a
beautiful new sword.

356
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,002
It was a gift I got him
for this very occasion.

357
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,523
And, as you can smell,

358
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,764
I'm smoking one of your
most excellent cigars.

359
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,161
You made a deal with the devil,

360
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,927
you stupid Dutchie.

361
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,847
Don't call me that.
I don't like that.

362
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,927
- You're gonna pay for this, Kai.
- We all pay eventually.

363
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,887
But in my case,
you won't be around to see it.

364
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,845
Or rather hear about it.

365
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,486
Hey... there.

366
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,448
You stupid cerote.

367
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,561
Don't you know he's gonna
fuck you like he fucked me?

368
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,967
No, you fucked yourself, blind man.

369
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,087
You know,
I never did get to thank you

370
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,321
in person for the...

371
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,081
little gift you gave me.

372
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,491
I think of you every time I feel it.

373
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,449
Just do it.

374
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,082
Oh, that's just embarrassing.

375
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,326
I never miss.

376
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,609
Sorry I took so long.

377
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,809
I never doubted you
for a minute.

378
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,011
I thought you said he'd get
killed trying to save us.

379
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,762
Yeah,
but I never doubted he'd come.

380
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,280
Where's Carrie?

381
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,086
Hood!

382
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,487
Put the gun down
or I'll blow her head off.

383
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,320
- No.
- Do it. I will kill her.

384
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,608
- You let her go now.
- I'm not fucking with you!

385
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,922
- Let her go.
- Put the fucking gun down, Hood!

386
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,561
- Let her go, now.
- Don't play me! I will kill her!

387
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,206
- No, you're not.
- Put the fucking gun down!

388
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,365
Gordon!

389
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,009
Sugar, help me get this.

390
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,362
Come on, get the vest off.
Come on.

391
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,602
Fuck! Put pressure on it.

392
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,564
I got it.
I got it.

393
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,530
I'm right here, Gordon.
Everything's gonna be just fine.

394
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,050
You're gonna be fine.

395
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,204
Fuck me.

396
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,161
Start it up.
I'm on my way.

397
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,450
- Hold on.
- I'm not gonna make it.

398
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,364
Don't talk like that.
You're gonna be fine.

399
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,126
- We're gonna get you out of here.
- Baby, I'm not gonna make it.

400
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,046
You're not the only
gunslinger in the family.

401
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,489
Why did you do this?

402
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,843
I came to take you home, Carrie.

403
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,011
I never stopped loving you.
You know that, right?

404
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,163
I love you.
Stay with me.

405
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,606
Job.

406
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,090
It's okay.

407
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,329
It's okay.

408
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,202
You be good, okay?

409
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,526
You want to tell me what the
hell happened out there today?

410
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,802
A lot of those guys
are angry that I'm back.

411
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,731
They feel betrayed.

412
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,844
Yeah.
Yeah, I got that.

413
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,002
No, I meant the part where
you grabbed a civilian

414
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,970
and started strangling him in front
of a diner full of witnesses.

415
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,245
- Sorry about that.
- You're sorry? Fuck sorry, okay?

416
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,891
I don't like those guys
any more than you do,

417
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,850
- but if you're gonna wear a badge...
...am guys like that!

418
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,726
Every evil, twisted thought
that he has had,

419
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,803
I have had.

420
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,124
Every fucked-up thing
that he's done,

421
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,970
I have done.

422
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,089
I've done things
that would make you sick.

423
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,403
They make me sick.

424
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,122
You think you're the only one
around here that's got dirt on him?

425
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,570
I've done some... things.

426
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,365
Look, Bunker, I...

427
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,128
I don't know you, okay?

428
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,410
But from what I've seen,

429
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,610
you're not the man
you used to be.

430
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,968
I will always be that man.

431
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,883
Putting on this uniform
does not wipe my slate clean.

432
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,927
I'm doing everything
I can to change.

433
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,288
And every once in a while...

434
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,529
...I manage to convince myself...

435
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,444
that I'm a better person.

436
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,765
But the minute
that I come into contact...

437
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,928
with one of those fucking guys

438
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,761
and see the way
that they look at me...

439
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,809
all I feel is hate...

440
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,891
and anger and I can't shake it.

441
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,691
Okay, all right. Listen to me.
Hold it. Look at me.

442
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,086
Okay. That isn't anger
that you're feeling.

443
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,131
That's the shame and the guilt.

444
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,123
And trust me, we all feel that.

445
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,211
All of us.

446
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,371
And that is what makes
you better than them.

447
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,644
If you didn't feel that,

448
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,131
that's when I'd start to worry,
all right?

449
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,210
You hear me?

450
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,800
Okay.

451
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,250
Now, look, can you promise me

452
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,528
that what happened out there today
is never gonna happen again?

453
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,806
I don't know.

454
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,125
Good answer.

455
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,449
'Cause if you had said yes,
I knew you were full of shit.

456
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,286
Go home, all right?
Get some sleep.

457
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,041
- Thank you, sir.
- Yep.

458
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,529
I just hung up
with the state police.

459
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,205
Jesus Christ, Hood.

460
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,410
Gordon Hopewell is dead?

461
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,244
What the hell
happened out there?

462
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,609
He said Camp Genoa
looks like a war zone.

463
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,527
Yeah, I'll have to tell
you about it someday.

464
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,648
No, no, not someday.

465
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,121
He said that CID is gonna be
here in less than an hour.

466
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,566
We need to get your story straight.

467
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,245
They're coming
to talk to you, Brock.

468
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,005
What are you talking about?

469
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,365
Hood?

470
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,167
Badge and letter of resignation
on my desk.

471
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,331
Are you kidding?
Hey! Hood!

472
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,009
Where you going?

473
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,720
You can't...

474
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,564
You can't just leave!

475
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,367
Well, I'm not giving
it back this time.

476
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,729
I'm disappointed in you, Kurt.

477
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,726
But the choice is yours to make.

478
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,127
If you're gonna wear that cop
uniform, you can't wear mine.

479
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,048
Who in the hell took him?

480
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,760
I don't know.

481
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,207
- How do we find him?
- No idea.

482
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,440
Usually that's where
Job comes in.

483
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,650
Isn't there anyone
you can reach out...

484
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,007
God damn it, Sugar.
I don't fucking know.

485
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,561
I don't know who took him.
I don't know where he is.

486
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,609
And I don't know
how to fucking get him back.

487
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,485
Fuck!

488
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,043
Till we hear from him,
he's on his own.

489
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,002
Hey, you look like a new man.

490
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,408
Which means your time
in this room...

491
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,200
is done.

492
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,926
Who are you?

493
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,810
My name is Dalton.

494
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,361
- Are you military?
- I was.

495
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,722
But now I recruit men like you.

496
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,882
I develop them for an elite unit.

497
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,961
What unit?

498
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,725
What branch?

499
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,000
Exactly.

500
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,049
My methods are very unorthodox.

501
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,806
I have a very small window of time
in which to assess your ability.

502
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,769
My ability to do what?

503
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,450
To do what needs to be done.

504
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,967
I think we could do
some very good work together.

505
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,570
And if I'm not interested?

506
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,007
That's fine.
You're free to go.

507
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,449
But if you do, you'll always
be your father's son.

508
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,365
I'm nothing like him.

509
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,450
What happened to your
friends with the beards?

510
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,241
They're all dead.

511
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,324
You sure do have
a knack for survival.

512
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,640
You left me there to die,
Sheriff.

513
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,445
I'm not the sheriff.

514
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,365
What do you want, an apology?

515
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,166
No.

516
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,282
I would have done
the same thing.

517
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,691
You know, being the sheriff
never really suited you.

518
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,325
No, it didn't.

519
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,125
Fuck me.
