1
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,601
Ah!

2
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,046
What's up, Hondo?

3
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,805
You guys got nothing on me.

4
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,288
- You killed a cop.
- Allegedly.

5
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,930
And then you bragged about it.

6
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,850
So arrest me, sweetheart.

7
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,931
All right? You got nothing tying me
to that nigger friend of yours.

8
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,528
Okay, why don't you see
if you can make it stick?

9
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,447
No. You killed our friend.

10
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,966
We're not gonna arrest you.

11
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,246
What are you talkin' about?

12
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,489
You're right,
we couldn't make it stick.

13
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,931
You're fucking cops, okay?
Arrest me.

14
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,241
See any badges?

15
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,365
You're the fuckin' sheriff!

16
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,080
- Allegedly.
- Oh, fu...

17
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,161
Where do you go?

18
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,126
What do you mean?

19
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,766
It's like...

20
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,205
You can't even look at me.

21
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,445
It's nothing like that.

22
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,004
You know, maybe you
should really think about

23
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,366
getting a new place.

24
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,723
It has a certain
old-school charm, no?

25
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,925
No.

26
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,529
Well, you can't beat the rent.

27
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,685
I mean, I get that this
isn't a relationship,

28
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,405
and I'm fine with that.

29
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,480
I have to go to work.

30
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,367
You could at least hire a
cleaning service or something.

31
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,284
I don't like people
touching my things.

32
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,010
- Your things?
- Yeah.

33
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,527
- These aren't your things.
- Okay, time to get up.

34
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,563
This is where Sugar's
old crap goes to die.

35
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,530
Yeah, this coming from the girl
who lives in an Airstream.

36
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,201
You just seem like somebody who could
use a friend is all I'm saying.

37
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,160
We're just two adults
having sex in a motel room.

38
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,603
You know what?
Fuck it.

39
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,967
Come here.

40
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,481
Great sex.

41
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,965
Always room for improvement.

42
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,086
- Hey, Carrie, you're early.
- I couldn't sleep.

43
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,081
Order up.

44
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,730
Eggs Benedict, hold the sauce.

45
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,121
Man, you guys.

46
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,761
- Take the back five, okay?
- You got it.

47
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,090
Who had the eggs Florentine?

48
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,247
You want some eggs?

49
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,320
No, thanks.

50
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,121
You hear that?

51
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,167
What?

52
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,321
Quiet.

53
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,728
- You missing Job?
- No.

54
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,405
I'm just sayin' how
nice and quiet it's been

55
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,609
since you got back from your little
trip to New York last month.

56
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,924
You got a problem with quiet?

57
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,001
On the contrary.

58
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,850
I'm gonna miss it when it's gone.

59
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,647
Yes?

60
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,402
In regards to the
matter we discussed,

61
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,090
you should come down
to the basement.

62
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,051
- Now?
- Yes.

63
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,046
Is he ready to talk?

64
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,202
Looks like you two
made quite a night of it.

65
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,404
I know, I know.
Burton's interview style

66
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,925
can be a little rigid at times,

67
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,451
but he's very precise.

68
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,731
These cuts will all heal.

69
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,526
You just make sure you live
long enough to let that happen.

70
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,526
Do you understand?
Good.

71
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,242
Now, has Jim Cage been supplying
Philadelphia with molly?

72
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,807
Yeah.

73
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,002
And he's been selling
to Frazier exclusively?

74
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,010
They cut your prices.

75
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,210
He's got the whole
territory locked up.

76
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,845
Thank you for your cooperation.

77
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,527
Wait!

78
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,805
Please.
Please help me.

79
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,207
Please.

80
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,370
That's not really my thing.

81
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,489
Stay the fuck away from me!

82
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,808
Fruit platter and
oatmeal with soy milk.

83
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,007
Egg white omelet.

84
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,411
Hi, Carrie.

85
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,810
How are you?
How are the kids?

86
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,365
Everything's great.
Thanks.

87
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,091
Eggs over easy.

88
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,724
Side of bacon, crisp.

89
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,567
Thank you.

90
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,125
I give her a lot of credit.

91
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,925
It can't be easy, huh?

92
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,047
You okay?

93
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,727
Yeah.

94
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,921
- Mr. Proctor.
- Sheriff, Deputy.

95
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,607
Charging me with
unlicensed firearms.

96
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,125
That was the best you could do?

97
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,089
Just getting the ball
rolling till I can charge you

98
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,890
- with the Longshadow murder.
- I'm sure you are,

99
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,128
but thanks to you I have
an airtight alibi, don't I?

100
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,725
You had me locked up, remember?

101
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,571
The way I see it, a guy like
you, I'll get another shot.

102
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,609
Yeah, but your track record
isn't exactly giving me

103
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,881
much cause for concern.

104
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,371
See you around, Kai.

105
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,921
I still come in every day
expecting to see Emmett there.

106
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,810
Yeah, me, too.

107
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,201
Hey, morning.

108
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,447
- Hey.
- Raven.

109
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,487
Uh...

110
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,045
Listen, I know that I...

111
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,769
have some pretty big
shoes to fill here.

112
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,008
- Huge.
- Yeah, yeah, I get that.

113
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,451
But all I did was answer an ad.

114
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,845
I'm sorry.
This can't be easy for you.

115
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,169
It's not, but it gets my
family off the reservation.

116
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,446
And I gotta tell you after
working six years for KPD,

117
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,610
it's great to be working in an
actual functioning police station.

118
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,524
Functional. That's us.

119
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,170
Hey, Hood, you got a minute?

120
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,248
Uh, yeah. What's up?

121
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
Hondo file.

122
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,124
Medical examiner said
they're not gonna send out

123
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,526
for ballistics on the bullets.

124
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,728
They're prioritizing, I guess.

125
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,402
And I...
And I canvassed the area.

126
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,369
No one seems
to have seen anything.

127
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,208
So, basically,
the official consensus is

128
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,927
three anonymous shooters
did the world a favor

129
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,969
and nobody's gonna
lose any sleep over

130
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,487
a dead neo-Nazi
with multiple priors.

131
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,361
- So...
- Sounds good to me.

132
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,847
Okay.

133
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,840
Something else?

134
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,249
Are you even fazed by this?

135
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,808
- We executed a man, Hood.
- He killed one of us.

136
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,007
I know that.

137
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,687
I understand.

138
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,564
You've done this sort
of thing before?

139
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,761
What?

140
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,761
Killed a man?

141
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,931
No, executed him.

142
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,726
Brock...

143
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,681
You'll be okay.

144
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,527
Now let's go.

145
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,051
Let's just not
make a habit of it, okay? I...

146
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,406
Does Father know that we've
been meeting like this?

147
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,006
To what end?

148
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,443
You don't think
he'll join us, do you?

149
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,524
But you would think at one
point he'd want to know

150
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,284
what became of his son.

151
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,520
Let's be honest, Kai.

152
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,127
Who you've become is exactly
what he is afraid of.

153
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,009
How is my granddaughter doing?

154
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,641
She's fine.

155
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,171
Hit him!

156
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,651
The fire trials

157
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,366
are a sacred Redbone tradition

158
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,041
to prove yourself a worthy leader.

159
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,131
Times have changed

160
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,291
and the Redbones
must change with them.

161
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,241
Wrong.

162
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,211
Sheriff's Department.

163
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,491
Billy. Billy.

164
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,928
You have to press
that interface button first

165
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,923
in order to pull the call
off Alma's switchboard.

166
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,081
- Thanks.
- Got it?

167
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,571
- Yeah.
- Time and experience, son.

168
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,606
Interface.

169
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,889
- There you go.
- Sheriff's Department.

170
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,160
Deputy Lotus stepped away for
a moment. Can I help you?

171
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,126
Do you see him now?

172
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,931
Are all your doors locked?

173
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,121
Can you check them for me, please?

174
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,526
And tell me your address.

175
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,921
Got it.

176
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,766
Okay, we're on our way, ma'am.

177
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,611
Okay, we got a prowler call.

178
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,084
Lady said there's a guy
hiding in her shrubbery

179
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,651
- in her backyard.
- Whoa.

180
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,809
Is it 63 Oakwood Lane?

181
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,725
Yeah. How'd you know?

182
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,045
Time and experience, son.

183
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,967
I'll get it.

184
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,489
- We should both go...
- No, no, I need you to stay here

185
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,921
and hold down the fort, all right?

186
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,807
Times have not changed.

187
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,327
We are still being
raped and plundered

188
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,970
by the white man
like we have been

189
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,361
for 500 years.

190
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,728
What exactly is it you think
we're going to celebrate?

191
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,121
You left, Chayton.
I'm in charge.

192
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,362
- I understand.
- Do you?

193
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,124
I don't want to fight you.

194
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,850
I don't want to fight you, either,

195
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,611
but that's how we do it unless
you see another way, Chayton.

196
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,444
You could just step down.

197
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,127
Would you?

198
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,801
Ah!

199
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,161
- Had enough?
- Yeah. Yeah.

200
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,285
- We done?
- Yeah.

201
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,041
We are here, all of us,

202
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,323
to fight in a war
that we will never win

203
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,960
because it was lost
by our people centuries ago.

204
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,449
We will never
reclaim our country.

205
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,241
But I've come back because
I'd rather die fighting

206
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,811
than to live like a slave
in my own land.

207
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,211
It's time we took
something back.

208
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,121
Hello?

209
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,765
Another prowler, huh?

210
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,410
Gotta stop it with
these prowler calls, Emily.

211
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,124
All right?
Look, what if I was out

212
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,486
when Billy Raven took that call?

213
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,130
Who the hell's Billy Raven?

214
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,201
- New deputy.
- Oh.

215
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,327
- Poor Emmett.
- I gotta get back.

216
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,040
Just have a drink with me.

217
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,681
- Em, I'm on duty.
- You're always on duty.

218
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,446
That's why we got divorced.

219
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,210
No, we got divorced because you
were fucking Elliot Granger.

220
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,125
I was fucking Elliot Granger
because you were never home.

221
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,324
Classic chicken
and the egg debate.

222
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,240
Just sit with me.

223
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,921
Please?

224
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,641
I just get lonely sometimes.

225
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,689
Well, maybe you shouldn't
drink alone at night.

226
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,966
Done.

227
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,521
To us.

228
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,801
Yeah.

229
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,523
How's everything?
How's... How's work and...

230
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,045
You don't have to make
small talk with me.

231
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,326
Come on.
Stop it.

232
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,641
Stop, Stop.

233
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,562
Damn it, Em. I just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

234
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,331
Then make me okay.

235
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,845
Damn it.

236
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,370
Fuck me.

237
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,601
Harder.

238
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,769
Oh!

239
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,120
Did it hurt?

240
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,009
I mean, at first when they jab you
with the needle it hurt a lot,

241
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,403
but, I don't know, after a while
you just kind of get used to it.

242
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,650
Kind of like my life.

243
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,011
Did your dad
find a new place yet?

244
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,690
Yeah, he's renting
this shitty little apartment.

245
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,644
It's pretty depressing, actually.

246
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,810
Are he and your mom,
like, talking?

247
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,845
Sometimes, yeah.

248
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,323
The whole thing
is just so fucked up.

249
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,164
I bet they freaked
when they saw your tat.

250
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,243
They're way too caught up
in their own bullshit

251
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,845
to pay any attention to me.

252
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,400
I know where we can get some
premium bud for, like, 50 bucks.

253
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,449
- You have 50 bucks?
- Tapped out.

254
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,005
No shit.
You're always tapped out.

255
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,727
Bite me.

256
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,605
I have an idea.

257
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,366
Holy shit.

258
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,882
It's like a stoner's Toys "R" Us.

259
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,767
All right, guys.
Guys, come on.

260
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,001
Come on!

261
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,284
Doing a little late-night shopping?

262
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,526
You two, head home now.

263
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,165
Consider this your last warning.

264
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,881
Is he joking?

265
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,486
You guys, just...
Just get out of here.

266
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,842
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just go!

267
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,122
Hey!
Leave the stuff.

268
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,767
So, you wanna be a thief now?

269
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,045
A little piece of advice.

270
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,565
It's harder than you think.

271
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,362
Your first mistake was your numbers.

272
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,171
Every extra person increases
your chances of getting caught

273
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,402
and you had three people
on a one-man job.

274
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,806
It's not a great start.

275
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,521
Come with me.

276
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,127
You see an alarm
on the door, window?

277
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,641
Nope.

278
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,964
So how did I get here so fast?

279
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,402
See that little white box up there?

280
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,170
It's a sound sensor.

281
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,369
You break the glass,
that triggers a silent alarm.

282
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,722
Ten seconds later,
my office is on the radio,

283
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,526
here I am.

284
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,363
Your only option with glass
is a cutter.

285
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,447
So this is it?
Jackpot

286
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,881
- How much you got?
- Thirty-seven dollars.

287
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,801
Wow.

288
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,803
See, the register is also
connected to the alarm.

289
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,525
So you would've been better
to take the whole thing

290
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,330
and open it when you got clear.

291
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,965
Although, if there is
any real cash left overnight...

292
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,885
it's gonna be in the safe,

293
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,248
which is also
bolted to the floor.

294
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,442
So unless you know
how to crack a safe...

295
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,601
No?

296
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,885
Well, then there's
really nothing in here

297
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,684
worth getting arrested for.

298
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,330
Unless, of course,
that was the point.

299
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,050
You think I wanted to get caught?

300
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,569
Self-destruction
runs in the family.

301
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,165
A little soon
to be making daddy jokes,

302
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,481
don't you think?

303
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,570
You never know until you try.

304
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,245
To your health.

305
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,611
I don't know what you've
been up to, but...

306
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,248
I just had sex with my ex-wife.

307
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,930
Again.

308
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,128
I know, I know, I know.

309
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,051
But you know what?
I know what you're gonna say

310
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,441
and you've never
been divorced, so...

311
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,567
Hey, look,
I wanted to tell you...

312
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,084
we took care of Hondo.

313
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,926
Oh, man, we made him pay
for what he did to you.

314
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,648
I doubt you'll be running in
the same circles up there

315
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,122
or wherever, but...

316
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,329
if you happen to run
into him, that was us.

317
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,642
I know, I know, you probably
have some Bible verse

318
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,325
about leaving revenge to God,

319
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,121
but, you see, Emmett,
sometimes you cannot wait

320
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,965
for God to put the world to right
because while you're waiting,

321
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,248
the world just keeps
going to shit.

322
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,888
And when you have a guy
like Hood leading the charge,

323
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,850
well, God's just gonna
have to move a lot faster

324
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,162
if He wants to keep up and
you can tell Him I said that.

325
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,564
I miss you.

326
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,404
Cheers.

327
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,686
What are you doing here?

328
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,650
I stopped by to see the kids,
found them here alone,

329
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,723
so I decided to stay
and have dinner with them.

330
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,247
- Where's Deva?
- She went to bed hours ago, Carrie.

331
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,244
- It's past midnight.
- I had to work late.

332
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,482
You know, somehow I don't
think you were at the diner.

333
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,449
Well, you know, a lot of single
mothers have to work two jobs.

334
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,045
This has to stop.

335
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,850
Let's not do this.

336
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,920
Isn't the whole point of getting a
divorce so we don't have to fight?

337
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,764
How can you not realize
that you are risking

338
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,524
the well-being
of your children?

339
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,641
What is it with you? Some sort
of addiction or something?

340
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,560
You would know.

341
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,886
I'm sorry.

342
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,408
So you and Mom way back when.

343
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,561
- Yeah.
- But not anymore?

344
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,080
- No.
- How come you left her?

345
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,810
I mean, she was pregnant.

346
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,129
She should have found you.

347
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,328
- She should have told you.
- No, no.

348
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,611
It wasn't her fault.

349
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,286
There was no way she
could have got to me

350
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,371
without putting herself, and you,
in a lot of danger.

351
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,282
Then after she met your father,

352
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,730
she did what was best for you.

353
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,083
The point is

354
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,605
why don't you take
it easy on your mom?

355
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,285
She lied to me my whole life.

356
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,885
No, she tried to keep you safe.

357
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,648
She left everything.
Her whole life.

358
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,485
Gave it all up.
Everything.

359
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,124
She did that for you.

360
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,690
When did you know about me?

361
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,524
The first time I saw you.

362
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,610
You came here for her?

363
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,005
But I stayed for you.

364
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,207
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, I saw you go to bed.

365
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,601
- Woke up.
- Deva?

366
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,562
- This is not okay.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

367
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,521
Where'd you find her?

368
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,047
She was just out
with some other kids.

369
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,885
Yeah, well, thanks
for bringing her back.

370
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,485
Yeah.
Have a good night.

371
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,926
Hood.

372
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,808
You know, Carrie promised
to tell me everything,

373
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,770
but when it came to you...

374
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,130
...nothin'.

375
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,085
Whatever your secrets are,

376
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,527
they were worth breaking
a promise to her husband.

377
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,201
You ended my marriage.
Please...

378
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,249
...leave me my daughter.

379
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,320
I don't care who made her.

380
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,925
I'm her...

381
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,565
I'm her father.

382
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,363
I'm asking you, please.

383
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,043
This is what we took in
last night.

384
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,602
And if you click here, you can
see the same day last week,

385
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,001
last month, and last year.

386
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,650
You click here,

387
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,484
you can see what each girl
is bringing in.

388
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,841
Okay.

389
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,525
Anyway, I think this is enough
for tonight.

390
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,761
Why don't you check on the club?

391
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,206
I'll finish up
a few things here.

392
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,286
Proctor had his hands
in Longshadow's pockets.

393
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,642
One thing leads to another.

394
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,649
Now Longshadow is dead.

395
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,126
We'll be coming
for you, white girl.

396
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,606
You...

397
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,205
...and Proctor.

398
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,771
Soon.

399
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,691
Come on, come on. Let's go!

400
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,371
Who the hell is that?

401
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,842
This is a United States
Marine Corps vehicle.

402
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,644
Step aside...

403
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,605
TOC, kilo-one-niner. Taking hostile
contact on Pondfield 15. Requesting...

404
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,808
We don't have time to wait
for backup. Get us out of here.

405
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,281
Motherfuckers.

406
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,809
Just got
a report of shots being fired

407
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,961
on Pondfield Road.

408
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,527
Pondfield Road,
that's near Camp Genoa.

409
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,121
- Could be running exercises.
- Not without notifying us.

410
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,805
Siobhan, we're close by.
We're on it.

411
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,726
Jackson, you okay?

412
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,881
Jackson, answer...

413
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,851
Got him.

414
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,605
Come on, let's go!

415
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,045
Move it, move it!

416
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,927
Alma, we need backup!
EMS, we got multiple casualties!

417
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,804
Repeat, multiple casualties!

418
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,321
Are you worried
about the Indian?

419
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,964
He knew.

420
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,451
How could he know?

421
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,449
They would naturally
suspect my involvement.

422
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,608
Who pulled the trigger
is not important to them.

423
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,206
It seemed pretty
important to him.

424
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,050
You know, I'm gonna
put a guard in the house.

425
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,800
Anywhere you go,
Burton will go with you.

426
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,928
That Indian won't
get near you again.

427
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,810
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning.

428
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,082
- How can I help you, sir?
- Who's the CO here?

429
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,446
Colonel Stowe, sir.

430
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,528
Okay, well, I need to see him.

431
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,411
You have an appointment
to see the colonel?

432
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,921
You just told me his name. How
could I have an appointment?

433
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,764
No one gets on base
without authorization.

434
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,321
There were four Marines killed
on the road earlier today,

435
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,760
about eight miles from here.

436
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,445
- I'm sure you heard about it.
- Yes, sir.

437
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,682
Well, this is
a homicide investigation.

438
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,090
That's my authorization.

439
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,246
- Sheriff Hood.
- Colonel Stowe.

440
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,845
I've been expecting you.

441
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,331
Not according to
your men at the gate.

442
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,244
They were just
following protocol.

443
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,561
This way.

444
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,125
Hey, Colonel.

445
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,482
Let me just start
by saying how sorry I am.

446
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,886
It's a tragedy.

447
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,769
Nine tours in
Iraq and Afghanistan between 'em,

448
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,446
and they get killed demilling an
antiquated base

449
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,125
in Banshee, Pennsylvania.

450
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,681
I have no idea how I'm gonna talk
their families through that one.

451
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,280
Colonel Douglas Stowe.

452
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,642
So you're shutting the place down?

453
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,484
We're basically clearing
house for all the contraband

454
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,165
that gets shipped
out of the war zones.

455
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,005
Guns, valuables,
drugs, you name it.

456
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,251
And cash.

457
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,485
Your tax dollars at work.

458
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,684
Whether we're buying guns off the
streets to keep them from the Taliban

459
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,729
or sending out soldiers with
briefcases full of money

460
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,285
to pay off informants.

461
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,041
We've got half of Afghanistan
on the damn payroll.

462
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,809
The money we don't use
has to be inventoried

463
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,042
and sent back to the Fed to
be wasted in the next war.

464
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,084
Right.
You don't agree?

465
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,081
I don't like war.

466
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,402
But when you ask me to fight,

467
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,800
let me fight.

468
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,721
So the four Marines
who were killed,

469
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,325
they were transporting cash?

470
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,528
No, we don't move
cash in trucks.

471
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,882
We contract armored
vehicles for that.

472
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,169
Those were mostly confiscated
automatic weapons.

473
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,483
AKs and M4s headed to a Fed
facility to be destroyed.

474
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,166
Great, so now the Redbones
are armed like the Taliban.

475
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,691
I'm sorry, the Redbones?

476
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,365
The guys who jacked your truck.

477
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,966
They're a tribal gang
from the reservation.

478
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,401
Do you have a list of everything
that was in those crates?

479
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,240
- I do.
- Great, well, if you could

480
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,402
just have one of your people
print that out for me, then...

481
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,403
Sheriff Hood,
I appreciate the visit

482
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,130
and the fact that
you and your deputies

483
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,123
tried your best
to stop these people.

484
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,090
But the moment they killed my Marines
and stole government property,

485
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,083
this became a matter
for the military.

486
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,368
NCIS will lead the investigation

487
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,931
with the FBI and the BIA.

488
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,525
Now, that's a lot
of fuckin' letters,

489
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,245
and the last thing you want
is be getting caught up

490
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,407
in the middle of it.

491
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,606
That's true, but those guns may
end up on the streets of my town.

492
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,967
And if they do,
you feel free to shoot back.

493
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,884
We got four dead Marines here.

494
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,805
No one's gonna have the patience
for a small-town sheriff

495
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,724
who thinks he knows better.

496
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,165
Okay.

497
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,881
Thanks for your time.

498
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,610
Captain Murphy here
will show you out.

499
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,251
Thanks again for coming by.

500
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,131
You don't look like a Marine,
Captain Murphy.

501
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,487
Sugar here.

502
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,881
You know that one big job
we've been looking for?

503
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,605
Well, I think I found it.

504
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,682
- Do tell.
- The Marine base, Camp Genoa.

505
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,882
They're moving cash
by the truckload.

506
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,042
- Millions of dollars.
- If they're moving

507
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,009
that kind of money,
they're still gonna have

508
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,845
- military-grade security systems.
- Yeah.

509
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,370
If only we knew someone
who could hack

510
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,124
into the military network.

511
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,722
It's been 25 minutes.

512
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,404
You should be in by now.

513
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,129
You try working with a motherfuckin'
hand cannon in your face.

514
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,683
This here is the New
York Stock Exchange.

515
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,205
There's a lot of moving parts.

516
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,522
Well, then, make them
move a little bit faster.

517
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,603
The trick ain't gettin' in.

518
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,525
The trick is gettin' out without
anyone knowing you've been there.

519
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,250
That's of no concern to me.

520
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,688
- There.
- That's it? You're in?

521
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,484
Oh, no, that's just the signal.

522
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,005
Signal? What signal?

523
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,725
Damn it, he got
the fuckin' money!

524
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,166
Go get him.

525
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,200
- Have you seen me run?
- Bullshit!

526
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,371
Shit!

527
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,965
Bollocks.

528
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,805
Fuck me!

529
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,162
Now is not really a good time.

530
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,164
Everything okay?
How'd the Fat Al thing go?

531
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,084
Up in fuckin' smoke.

532
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,644
You know, I'm actually
starting to believe in God?

533
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,485
And I'm thinkin'
that motherfucker hates me.

534
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,966
Yeah, well,
I got something might cheer you up.

535
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,849
I highly doubt that.

536
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,002
What the fuck, Job?

537
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,650
Hold on.

538
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,528
- Is this all the money?
- Motherfucker sat on his own grenade!

539
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,926
Damn.

540
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,283
I ain't coming back
to Pennsylvania.

541
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,731
I just had eyes on eight to ten
million in unwashed U.S. dollars.

542
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,811
I hate you.

543
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,970
You know that?
I fuckin' hate you.

544
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,247
I see you met
the Duck Dynasty guys.

545
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,765
Yeah.

546
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,241
Don't worry, I'll sanitize
the booth when they leave.

547
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,691
Here you go.

548
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,043
What can I get you guys to eat?

549
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,282
How about a deluxe burger
and your phone number?

550
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,371
- I don't have a phone.
- That's all right.

551
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,045
We don't have to talk.

552
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,407
You're gonna want
to move that hand.

553
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,760
- How's that?
- Yeah.

554
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,082
- Does that feel good?
- Sure does.

555
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,241
Yeah?

556
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,687
- Hope it was worth it.
- Worth what?

557
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,124
How do you want
that burger cooked?

558
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,405
Hi.

559
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,770
So what happened?

560
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,241
- He grabbed my ass.
- So you broke his nose?

561
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,283
Do you really think you're the
right person to be lecturing me?

562
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,482
Yeah, 'cause right now I'm
the only friend you've got.

563
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,762
So I'll ask you one more time.

564
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,490
What's going on with you?

565
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,170
I'm a fucking waitress.

566
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,448
I'm getting divorced
and my kids look at me

567
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,364
like they don't know me anymore.

568
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,968
And I'm getting groped
by inbred freaks.

569
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,610
Fucking look at me.

570
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,325
Go home.

571
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,811
I'll clean this up.

572
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,803
So this is the one, huh?

573
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,841
Yeah.

574
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,091
I don't know.

575
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,884
A military base?

576
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,685
Sounds risky.

577
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,564
Anything worthwhile usually is.

578
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,329
And it's being decommissioned.

579
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,970
What about Job?

580
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,565
He said he'd think about it.

581
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,528
I don't think he's coming back here.

582
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,485
Look at you, Sugar,

583
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,608
already trying to cut me out.

584
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,488
Is that your driving outfit?

585
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,321
Yes, it is.

586
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,166
And fortunately it's also my
"don't take any shit" outfit.

587
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,209
So whatever it is
you thinking about sayin',

588
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,323
swallow it and pour me
a fuckin' whiskey.

589
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,249
If I start drinkin' now,

590
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,645
maybe I'll be drunk enough to
handle this town in daylight.

591
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,526
Gentlemen...

592
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,765
Camp Genoa.

593
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,845
Camp Genoa.

594
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,722
You know,
my whole way over here,

595
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,684
I just kept thinking,

596
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,884
"I can't believe I'm coming
back to this shithole

597
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,883
to mix it up with
the fuckin' Marines."

598
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,204
Well, it's not the Marines
I'm worried about.

599
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,089
- It's the mercs.
- The mercs?

600
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,083
You didn't say nothing
about no motherfuck-

601
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,730
What kind of mercs?

602
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,605
Well, the bad kind.

603
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,165
I'd say ex-Navy SEALs
if I had to guess.

604
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,840
I don't believe this shit.

605
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,000
What is it with you?

606
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,725
Is it a death wish?
Is that what it is?

607
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,689
Because if it is,

608
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,367
why don't you go out
and get yourself killed?

609
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,409
Why do you always want
to get me killed with you?

610
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,245
- It's a lot of money.
- It's fucking soldiers with guns.

611
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,561
Big fucking guns.

612
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,960
We ain't talking
about rent-a-cops.

613
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,566
We ain't even talkin'
about real cops.

614
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,603
We talkin' about
fuckin' commandos.

615
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,928
- They'll never see us com...
- Uh-uh, nope!

616
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,370
Tell me about the money.
