1
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,771
Who the hell are you?

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,287
- Siobhan.
- Stay the fuck away from me.

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,362
You played us.
Me, Brock, Emmett.

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,170
Everything about you is a lie.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,250
Siobhan, listen to me.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,326
Don't.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,807
Okay. Okay.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,441
Okay.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,727
Put the gun down.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,281
It's me, Siobhan.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,487
No.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,887
You hear me?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,331
Hey, it's me.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,447
Come on.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,247
It's just me.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,566
There is no you.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,481
There is no you.

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,685
There is no you.

19
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,926
I need time to think.
Just get out.

20
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,366
We should talk about this.

21
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,760
Get the fuck out!

22
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,286
Now!

23
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,726
- Hey, good evening.
- Where's Mario and Frank?

24
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,168
Oh, they had to do
a double at Raymor Plaza.

25
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,163
Some kind of plumbing leak.

26
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,687
They're up to their eyeballs
in shit, literally.

27
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,002
- Yeah.
- Give me your badges.

28
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,411
We already scanned them.

29
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,050
And I'm gonna scan them again.

30
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,924
Excuse my friend.

31
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,650
He's a little slow
since the accident.

32
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,210
What?
Something wrong?

33
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,771
Why'd you cut your hair, man?

34
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,001
What?

35
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,686
The 'fro.

36
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,683
You know, just hanging
around guys like this,

37
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,128
it just felt too much
like showing off.

38
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,681
Thanks.

39
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,886
Have a good night.

40
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,809
Yeah, thank you.
You, too.

41
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,521
Okay.

42
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,005
Big Brother's in the house.

43
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,685
You seeing what I'm seeing?

44
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,407
Shit, they're watching
them monitors like hawks.

45
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,562
Then let's change the view.

46
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,040
All right.

47
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,161
Okay, you're clear.
Go get that formula.

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,164
- It's an algorithm.
- Yeah, you say tomato.

49
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,365
Hey, one of the
guards is on the move.

50
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,807
- You better step on it.
- You need to step off it.

51
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,247
I ain't watching fucking
YouTube videos up in here.

52
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,849
Damn, he's getting
on the elevator.

53
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,766
Sh...

54
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,206
- Hey.
- Hey.

55
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,641
- Where's your partner?
- Oh, he went to take a leak.

56
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,725
You know?

57
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,921
Look, you better
step on it, man.

58
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,963
Gonna get real crowded
in there real soon.

59
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,810
Got you.

60
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,011
Job.

61
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,161
Job.

62
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,170
Job.

63
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,204
- Sorry I'm late.
- 45 minutes, Carrie.

64
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,205
Her teacher couldn't wait.

65
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,567
What did she say?

66
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,405
Well, Deva's missing assignments,
she's disruptive in class,

67
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,562
and basically
her attitude sucks.

68
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,089
And apparently the school
feels that our daughter

69
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,210
is lacking any kind of
discipline or structure at home.

70
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,203
- And that's my fault?
- I'm not pointing fingers.

71
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,089
Well, you just did and this
from a mayor who bangs hookers.

72
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,601
Yeah, and like abandoning your
family to go off to hunt down

73
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,445
your gangster father
is a lesson in family values?

74
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,446
Fuck you, Gordon.

75
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,002
Carrie, can you stop, please?

76
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,762
Look, we need to do better.

77
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,329
I realize that I have been
blaming everybody else

78
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,324
for my inability to handle
everything that's happened.

79
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,208
I just...
It's our family.

80
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,004
But you know that I have never
been a victim in my life

81
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,924
and I'm done with that.

82
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,485
I want to figure this out
for all of us.

83
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,164
Where I come from,
it's customary

84
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,411
- to drink to a job well...
- Done.

85
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,161
Ha!

86
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,806
Done?

87
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,646
That algorithm was just the
tip of this cluster fuck.

88
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,449
No, it's the small victories
that keep you in the fight.

89
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,524
I know you are the Dalai Lama
of Mayberry and all that shit,

90
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,564
but that don't mean everything
coming out your mouth is wisdom.

91
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,204
It is far from party time.

92
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,641
Fine.

93
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,921
Cheers.

94
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,245
Who'd you piss off this time?

95
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,565
We may have to bail.

96
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,289
What, on the job?

97
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,451
On everything.

98
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,531
Everything everything?

99
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,525
How bad is it?

100
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,044
- Siobhan has the police file on me.
- Oh, fuck.

101
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,601
So why aren't we already doing
95 out of this shithole?

102
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,808
Could be she won't turn me in.

103
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,531
Let me explain something to you.

104
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,609
There are fake cops, that's you,

105
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,646
and there are real cops,
that's her.

106
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,122
Difference being real cops
will turn your ass in.

107
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,605
Maybe not.

108
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,202
Would you please tell this man

109
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,324
it is way past time
to cut and fuckin' run?

110
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,323
You two both do
what you gotta do.

111
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,400
But I'm going to work, Job.

112
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,967
Baby, I want you
to try real hard

113
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,448
to remember what happened the last
time you rolled the dice on a woman.

114
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,649
Fuck this.
I'm packing.

115
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,808
- When were you gonna tell me?
- Brock.

116
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,365
You're working
for Proctor now, Emily?

117
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,487
Have you lost it?

118
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,931
How could you
possibly know that?

119
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,809
- I called your agency.
- You did what?

120
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,331
- I didn't hear from you.
- Jesus Christ, Brock.

121
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,845
- I was worried about you.
- You're spying on me.

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,764
- I'm not spying on you.
- You're unbelievable.

123
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,445
Do you have any idea
how dangerous Proctor is?

124
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,926
The kind of people
that he deals with?

125
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,451
And now you're living
in the goddamn house?

126
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,801
His mother is dying.

127
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,644
Yeah, well, apparently
she's not the only one.

128
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,282
I was there the other day fishing
a dead gangbanger out of his pool.

129
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,205
Em, bad things happen there.

130
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,480
I care for the dying.

131
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,205
That's what I do.

132
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,970
That's what I'm gonna
keep on doing.

133
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,203
Listen.
Em, I'm begging you.

134
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,283
Get as far away from
that man as possible.

135
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,130
The only one I need
to get away from is you.

136
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,611
Emily.

137
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,044
That's very interesting.

138
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,843
Just call me
if anything changes.

139
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,611
Tommy Littlestone's body
has been cleared for release.

140
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,809
I'm pretty sure his brother's eager
to get him back to the reservation.

141
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,885
I want to go, too.

142
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,881
All right.

143
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,490
Thank you, Uncle.

144
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,090
My mother is driving me crazy.

145
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,884
She's got a problem
with everything I do.

146
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,084
Any time you want to trade moms,
just say the word.

147
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,406
Sorry.

148
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,524
Yeah, didn't think so.

149
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,405
How is Max doing?

150
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,205
Fine, I guess.

151
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,966
Max has been wanting
that game for months.

152
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,930
$75 for a video game?
What the hell?

153
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,280
It's crazy.

154
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,681
How's she doing?

155
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,525
Resting comfortably.

156
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,449
The new meds are doing
a better job with the pain.

157
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,840
That's good.

158
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,404
Thank you for taking
such good care of her.

159
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,324
Well, it's what she deserves.

160
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,451
It's what we all deserve.

161
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,491
Yeah.

162
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,445
How are you holding up, Mr. Proctor?

163
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,481
Me?

164
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,242
Well, I'm not the one who's dying.

165
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,243
But you are suffering
and you don't get any meds.

166
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,801
The downside to being
strong for everyone else

167
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,440
is that you never get
a moment for yourself.

168
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,847
If you ever want to talk or...

169
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,370
I've got nowhere else to be.

170
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,764
Do you want to sit down?

171
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,691
Apple on three.

172
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,891
Table six is ready to order.

173
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,769
Table nine needs silverware.

174
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,009
And the campers on 12 are asking
for a third refill on coffee.

175
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,006
A little help here.

176
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,889
12 is still asking
for that refill.

177
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,731
Carrie.

178
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,526
- What now?
- We wait.

179
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,486
Stay here.

180
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,650
Get in.

181
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,249
I've been practicing
with my uncle.

182
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,522
You're not
an experienced driver.

183
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,001
Well, then let's go
get me some experience.

184
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,166
What the hell?

185
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,123
You called.
What's going on?

186
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,327
I'm withdrawing
Proctor's plea bargain.

187
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,280
I don't understand.

188
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,289
We'll file the motion
first thing in the morning.

189
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,482
Sperling is gonna
go apeshit on us.

190
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,611
Well, that's just the gravy.

191
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,683
By the way, I'm sorry I was a jerk.

192
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,610
You weren't a jerk.

193
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,284
You were an asshole.

194
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,247
I should probably go.
Let you get settled.

195
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,165
You've got secrets, boss.

196
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,805
Don't we all?

197
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,401
If they ever get to be too
much or if you want to talk...

198
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,651
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

199
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,085
Hi, you've reached Siobhan Kelly.

200
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,726
Please leave a message.

201
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,481
- Hood.
- Yeah?

202
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,085
I just got a call
from fire and rescue.

203
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,691
There's a wreck
out on Highway 6.

204
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,286
- You handle it.
- Two DOAs, both Redbones.

205
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,842
They were transporting
Tommy Littlestone's body.

206
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,884
Great, let's go.

207
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,325
Tequila.
Whatever you got.

208
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,051
She'll have the Anejo, chilled.

209
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,722
A real woman like you, I think
that she deserves the best.

210
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,366
You buying?

211
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,965
Yes, ma'am.

212
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,081
Make it a double.

213
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,531
And keep 'em coming.

214
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,289
I thought I was
having a bad day.

215
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,366
What do we got?

216
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,847
Driver is Hakan Evans.

217
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,084
He signed for the body
at the morgue.

218
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,002
We'll need dental records
to identify the other.

219
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,569
- Any witnesses?
- Not out here.

220
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,767
A second set of skid marks confirms
another vehicle was involved.

221
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,400
- Could have been an accident.
- Yeah.

222
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,849
You know this wasn't
an accident.

223
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,407
No?

224
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,688
Chayton is gonna see this
as a declaration of war.

225
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,771
Yeah, well, that's
Proctor's problem.

226
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,405
Well, what are we
gonna do about it?

227
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,210
- Nothing.
- What?

228
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,124
We stay the fuck out of it.

229
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,131
Ah, it burns so good.

230
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,371
You have a real pretty smile.

231
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,881
- Yeah, I still got it.
- Yes, ma'am.

232
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,371
That's good.

233
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,804
Is that your bike
parked outside?

234
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,447
- Sexy beast, isn't she?
- Mmm.

235
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,406
I used to dream about
owning a machine like that.

236
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,366
What do you mean used to?

237
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,446
Another life.

238
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,922
Well, that is
a terribly sad story.

239
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,130
But don't you worry 'cause
your new buddy Scuyver,

240
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,441
well, he's all about
the happy endings.

241
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,920
Is that right?

242
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,920
That is right.

243
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,845
I think that...

244
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,123
...maybe you and me should go
somewhere more private.

245
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,284
That sounds great, but, no.

246
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,685
I gotta go.

247
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,170
- Maybe next time.
- What?

248
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,687
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey. Hey.

249
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,842
I got six drinks

250
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,843
invested in this little party.

251
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,963
So you ain't going nowhere...

252
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,206
...till you show me...

253
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,246
...a little gratitude.

254
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,327
When I say no, I mean it.

255
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,091
Hi, you've reached
Siobhan Kelly.

256
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,408
Please leave a message.

257
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,561
Where are you?

258
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,722
You should be asking
where I'm not.

259
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,882
Because in 20 minutes,
the answer's gonna be

260
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,883
Banshee,
Pennsyl-fucking-vania.

261
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,202
Give me until the end of the day
and I'll come with you.

262
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,727
Just gotta tie up
a few loose ends.

263
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,769
Well, then you tie
them up quick, baby,

264
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,644
and let's get
the fuck out of here.

265
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,040
Hey.

266
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,324
- Hey, Deva.
- What?

267
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,287
- You aren't in school.
- I'm just running a little late.

268
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,930
Maybe that's 'cause
you're going the wrong way.

269
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,606
- Like you never ditched.
- I never got caught.

270
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,285
Hey, Deva,

271
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,447
I'm sorry about the other day.

272
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,931
I'm over it, seriously.

273
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,326
Look, I didn't mean
to blow you off.

274
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,727
Okay? I...
You caught me off guard

275
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,002
and everything came out wrong
and I'm sorry.

276
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,810
Well, it won't
happen again, okay?

277
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,162
From now on, you're just the
asshole who knocked up my mom.

278
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,004
Okay, fine, I'm the asshole.

279
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,241
I mean, I've caused you nothing
but problems since I got here,

280
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,561
so I get it.

281
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,327
Pretty much.

282
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,925
Fuck.

283
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,809
- Why do you even care?
- I just do.

284
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,126
Why?

285
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,246
Look, my old man never
gave a shit about me.

286
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,050
All right?
I mean...

287
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,964
I guess you could
call him honest.

288
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,209
But I fucking hated him for it.

289
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,804
I still do. I wish I didn't,
but I do.

290
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,408
I don't want you
to hate me, Deva.

291
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,681
But I can't make you do
anything; no one can.

292
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,002
That's a choice you
gotta make on your own.

293
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,051
You're leaving, aren't you?

294
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,126
I have to.

295
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,724
Does it matter
that I want you to stay?

296
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,606
Yes.

297
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,606
It matters.

298
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,086
Okay?

299
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,165
But I made a huge
fucking mess, kid.

300
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,885
I have to go.

301
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,241
Yeah.

302
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,085
I don't hate you.

303
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,411
Well, maybe a little bit.

304
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,445
I can live with that.

305
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,725
What the fuck are you doing?

306
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,291
Hi, Jackson.
We have an appointment?

307
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,368
We had a goddamn deal.

308
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,931
Yeah, well, our position
has changed.

309
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,565
You can't do this.

310
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,125
It's already done.

311
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,884
Proctor will have
his day in court.

312
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,610
You're making
a big mistake, Gordon.

313
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,808
Careful, Jackson, that almost
sounded like a threat.

314
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,769
It's a warning.

315
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,763
I'm gonna come at you
with everything I've got.

316
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,446
Yeah, and what you've got
is a guilty client.

317
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,324
You should talk some sense
into your boss.

318
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,885
Your ass is on
the line here, too.

319
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,963
I appreciate your concern.

320
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,446
Shit.

321
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,291
So you want to talk about it?

322
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,361
I was stupid.
I just got carried away is all.

323
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,846
I feel trapped.

324
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,605
I keep waking up from a dream

325
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,240
to realize that it's real life
that's become the nightmare.

326
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,723
Then I do these stupid,
dangerous things.

327
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,081
I know that.

328
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,927
It's just...
I need to breathe.

329
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,322
Well, I know how that feels.

330
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,810
It's good to have you around.

331
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,331
Yeah.

332
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,002
- About that.
- What?

333
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,767
What?

334
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,006
I know I'm being selfish,
but I don't want you to go.

335
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,686
Not now.

336
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,971
Well, there's really no
choice anymore, is there?

337
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,686
Do you really think
she'd arrest you?

338
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,484
It doesn't really matter, does it?

339
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,321
She knows.

340
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,761
Where are you gonna go?

341
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,601
I don't know.

342
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,246
Anywhere.

343
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,201
Right.

344
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,880
Deva.

345
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,490
She'll be okay.

346
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,285
She's strong.

347
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,401
Like her mom.

348
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,125
And what about you?

349
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,971
Are you gonna be okay?

350
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,401
Of course.

351
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,326
Yeah?

352
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,290
- Hey.
- Hey.

353
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,570
You look upset.
Everything okay?

354
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,365
It'll be all right.

355
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,362
You know we have
to talk about school.

356
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,121
Yeah.

357
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,364
Not tonight, though.

358
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,365
Get some sleep.

359
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,888
Okay.
Good night.

360
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,326
Good night.

361
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,050
You can get undressed now.

362
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,606
Are you leaving?

363
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,211
You wanna take on the Redbones,

364
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,401
go right ahead.

365
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,931
I'm too old and too tired

366
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,889
to be sticking my nose
where it don't belong.

367
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,883
We're the goddamn police, Karl.

368
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,486
I'm going home.

369
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,802
Don't call me unless
the building's on fire.

370
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,722
I still don't think
you're much of a cop,

371
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,962
but I think you're serious
about getting Proctor.

372
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,283
This town's been waiting for somebody
to do that for a long, long time.

373
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,531
Sheriff, do you know
why they're afraid of me?

374
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,369
Why is that?

375
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,488
Because they should be.

376
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,529
And maybe you should be, too.

377
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,530
You have no evidence, no body,

378
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,370
not even a name you say.

379
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,851
Would you put him away?

380
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,923
Could you even put him away?

381
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,529
A guilty verdict could mean
five years in prison.

382
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,170
Not acceptable.

383
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,324
I will file every motion I can
to slow the process down,

384
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,842
but barring a miracle, your case
is gonna be decided by a jury.

385
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,365
Then a miracle is exactly

386
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,601
what you're gonna get me.

387
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,841
You get it?

388
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,242
- Yeah?
- Kai, it's Emily.

389
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,765
Your mother's taken a turn.

390
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,410
You should come home now.

391
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,765
She doesn't have much time.

392
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,121
Thank you, Emily.

393
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,365
I'm on my way.

394
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,530
You fucking fix this.

395
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,446
We're closed.

396
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,201
Leave.

397
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,602
- Get out.
- What the hell are you doing?

398
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,211
You need to leave now.

399
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,204
Whatever it is, Sheriff,
it has to wait.

400
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,487
No!

401
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,601
Jesus.

402
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,366
Call the police.

403
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,244
Uh, he is the police.

404
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,443
God damn it.

405
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,081
Hood!

406
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,685
Come on.
Get up.

407
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,161
Get up.

408
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,480
You okay?

409
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,086
Kai Proctor, you're under arrest
for assaulting an officer.

410
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,011
Whoa, whoa. It was self-defense.
Hood attacked him first.

411
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,362
Back up or I'll cuff
your ass, too.

412
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,925
Go to your grandmother.
She needs you.

413
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,201
Yeah, let's go.

414
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,289
Sorry for the wait.

415
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,680
You can all head back now.

416
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,842
The sheriff will need
just a few minutes.

417
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,288
Go.

418
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,045
May I help you?

419
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,322
I would like to speak
to the sheriff, please.

420
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,491
Is he expecting you?

421
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,927
- No, ma'am.
- Take a seat.

422
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,483
On second thought,
go wait back there.

423
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,091
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,321
This is beyond harassment.
I've got a dozen witnesses

425
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,084
who will testify
that you started the fight.

426
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,402
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?
- What the hell happened?

427
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,244
- He tried to murder my client.
- I wasn't asking you.

428
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,885
Do you have any idea
how bad this looks?

429
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,241
Ask me if I care.

430
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,805
- Hood.
- Stay!

431
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,724
What's up, farm boy?

432
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,565
You three play nice.

433
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,160
Hey, Hood.

434
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,924
Yeah, don't worry.
I got this.

435
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,640
I'm not gonna turn you in.

436
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,444
Not because I don't want to,

437
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,844
but because the truth would
annihilate this department.

438
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,401
It would wipe away all the good work
real cops have done around here.

439
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,162
You know I tried to do good
with that badge.

440
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,171
That badge was never
yours to wear.

441
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,970
Rabbit was your boss?

442
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,525
You stole for him?

443
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,006
Yes.

444
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,966
And Carrie Hopewell,
the two of you were...

445
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,767
- Yes.
- Jesus.

446
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,681
Why me?

447
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,087
Siobhan, no matter
what you think,

448
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,204
you and me was not a lie.

449
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,048
Siobhan, I swear to God.

450
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,845
The only time I ever felt safe
was with you.

451
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,962
I trusted you.
I let you in.

452
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,201
- I know.
- You endangered

453
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,811
my life, my career,
and I let you.

454
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,206
- Siobhan.
- No.

455
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,683
Don't fuckin' touch me.

456
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,565
This is what you're gonna do.

457
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,082
You're gonna go
out there right now,

458
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,322
you're gonna finish
booking Proctor,

459
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,962
and then you're gonna
quietly resign.

460
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,406
Then what?

461
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,564
And then you're gonna walk away.

462
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,206
Get down!
