1
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,965
Where were you?
I'm drowning out here.

2
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,884
Sorry.
Two short stacks.

3
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,804
Let me get you guys
some more syrup.

4
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,206
- Enjoying the show?
- Best seat in the house.

5
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,845
What are you doing?

6
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,805
I'll catch you later.

7
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,721
Hey.

8
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,648
So when are we gonna stop
driving separate cars to work?

9
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,451
As soon as we stop living
at separate addresses.

10
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,601
- I mean...
- Right.

11
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,881
I'm not pushing for that.

12
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,726
No.

13
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,201
It's okay.
You can push a little.

14
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,444
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, just a little.

15
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,646
Can I help you?

16
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,370
My name is Kurt Bunker, sir.

17
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,289
I'm here to apply for
the open deputy position.

18
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,126
Seriously?

19
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,561
I understand that my physical
appearance may be unsettling,

20
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,803
but I can assure you my ties to the
movement were severed long ago.

21
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,201
Unfortunately,
the removal of my tattoos

22
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,442
has taken longer
than anticipated.

23
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,888
Dade County
Sheriff's Department.

24
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,602
- You're a long way from Florida.
- I was born in Banshee.

25
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,331
Just became prudent for me

26
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,289
to distance myself
from former associates.

27
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,521
Then why are you back?

28
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,364
It was time to come home, ma'am.

29
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,008
What do your former
associates think about that?

30
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,722
What they think
is none of my concern.

31
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,607
Sorry, Bunker.
Position's filled.

32
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,684
You can hold onto that.
I appreciate your time.

33
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,646
Was that for real?

34
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,646
I kind of liked him.

35
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,046
- Mr. Cage.
- Mr. Proctor.

36
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,567
- How are you, Kai?
- Good. Thanks for coming.

37
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,286
I couldn't turn down an
invitation from an old friend.

38
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,885
Who is this pretty young thing?

39
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,042
Oh, that's Rebecca
Bowman, my niece.

40
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,044
I'm introducing her
to the family business.

41
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,727
Proctor pulled the kid out of high
school for a little show-and-tell.

42
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,487
Martin, watch your mouth.
Show a little respect.

43
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,846
Sorry, Kai.

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,571
So what was it you wanted
to see me about?

45
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,883
Well, old friend, we need
to clarify our arrangement.

46
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,041
What arrangement is that?

47
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,368
While my factory
was down for three weeks,

48
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,727
you began supplying
my Philadelphia customers.

49
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,087
I understand the impulse.
You saw an opportunity.

50
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,482
But I'm up
and running again now,

51
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,086
so we got to go back to
things as they were before.

52
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,006
I stay out of Ohio and you
stay out of Pennsylvania.

53
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,084
You couldn't supply them,
they came to me.

54
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,563
Plain and simple.
Just business.

55
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,762
You fucked up, Proctor. You
don't get to take that back.

56
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,046
What did you just say?

57
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,691
Your uncle may be
a big deal here in Banshee,

58
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,887
but in the rest of the world,

59
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,804
he's just a country inbreed
with an inflated ego.

60
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,566
- Martin, shut your mouth.
- I got it, Dad.

61
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,281
Yeah, I heard you were
a scary dude back in the day,

62
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,766
but he doesn't look
so scary now, does he?

63
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,967
Martin, shut...

64
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,640
Rebecca, no!

65
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,606
Ah!

66
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,444
Finish what you started.

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,480
No. No.

68
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,765
Just got off the phone
with Sperling.

69
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,888
Proctor will plead to a single
misdemeanor weapons charge

70
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,844
in exchange for time served.

71
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,008
- I told him to go to hell.
- Yeah, we'll make the deal.

72
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,921
What?

73
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,763
Call Sperling back
and tell him that we'll...

74
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,961
I heard what you said.

75
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,088
Then why are
we still talking about it?

76
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,765
We've got a shot at putting
Proctor away

77
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,160
and you just want to roll over
and play dead.

78
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,847
No, I'm done fighting
battles I won't win.

79
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,921
Are you still on the pills?

80
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,366
No, I'm clean.

81
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,605
So, I...

82
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,084
I get to experience every single
moment with total clarity.

83
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,085
Look, if you'll excuse
me, I need to...

84
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,601
I need to get back
to being the mayor.

85
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,291
What does that entail, exactly?

86
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,282
I'll let you know
when I figure it out.

87
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,086
Thanks.

88
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,248
Bad enough you got us
robbing a military base,

89
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,562
now we got to worry about all these
motherfucking Rambos

90
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,921
killing our asses.

91
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,128
You know, the colonel's got the
Marines guarding the money.

92
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,760
What the hell does
he need the mercs for?

93
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,641
'Cause it ain't Uncle Sam's
cash they're protecting.

94
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,765
Turns out not everything is
kosher at Boy Scout camp.

95
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,843
The official log accounts for
nine million in that safe.

96
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,570
What about the unofficial log?

97
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,004
That's saying closer to 15.

98
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,970
Someone's cooking the books.

99
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,567
Not just someone.
Colonel Douglas Stowe.

100
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,802
Naval Academy grad,
first in his class.

101
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,167
Tours in Beirut,
Panama, and then Haiti.

102
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,766
After that, he took a little
walk on the wild side.

103
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,001
We're talking about a
string of nasty black ops

104
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,889
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

105
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,888
This ain't just another
bad motherfucker,

106
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,561
this the guy they send in to clean
out all the other bad motherfuckers.

107
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,843
On the other hand,
you steal from a thief...

108
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,365
no one calls the cops.

109
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,367
The cops won't come after us with
hit teams and Apache helicopters.

110
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,691
You are not welcome here.

111
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,881
Kai.

112
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,164
I have to speak with my mother.

113
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,328
You did not have to come.

114
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,410
You have a fever.

115
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,326
It's just a touch of the flu.

116
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,322
Here, drink some water.

117
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,886
How can you allow this to go on?

118
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,963
The doctor was here.
He gave her medicine.

119
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,122
She doesn't need a house call.
She needs a hospital.

120
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,930
He will be here again tomorrow.

121
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,809
We will ask him.

122
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,491
But that's not good enough.

123
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,290
- Leave her!
- Oh, Kai.

124
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,451
Get out of my way.

125
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,924
We can take care of her here.

126
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,809
Your mother is suffering from
advanced pancreatic cancer.

127
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,450
How much time, Doctor?

128
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,971
A month, maybe less.

129
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,570
I'm going to put
you down, Mother.

130
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,728
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.

131
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,121
Your mother is dying,
Mr. Proctor.

132
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,931
You should start thinking about how
you can make her most comfortable.

133
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,886
- Hey.
- Hey. You okay?

134
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,849
Before you answer that...

135
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,566
Don't.

136
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,080
Stop.

137
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,211
Stop!

138
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,450
I can't do this anymore.

139
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,881
Do I get an explanation?

140
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,445
Does it really matter?

141
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,164
- Your husband?
- No.

142
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,085
- Somebody else?
- There's no time for anyone else.

143
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,565
There isn't even time for this.

144
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,251
Then what's the problem?

145
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,811
My kids.

146
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,800
They need their mother at home,

147
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,327
not sneaking out at night
for booty calls.

148
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,169
This isn't about your kids.
It's about you.

149
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,651
Don't do that.

150
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,244
This is a bubble.
This isn't anything.

151
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,606
What we had was great,

152
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,530
but I've got to get back
to the real world.

153
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,885
Take care of yourself, okay?

154
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,366
All right.

155
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,321
You really like...

156
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,681
...your military men.

157
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,086
What are you doing here?

158
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,680
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

159
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,240
Who I fuck is none
of your business.

160
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,640
It is when it affects the job.

161
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,486
And how about you getting involved
with your deputy sheriff?

162
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,005
How does that affect the job?

163
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,288
We can't do the heist if you're
involved with the target.

164
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,329
I already broke it off.
Are we done?

165
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,361
Should I be worried?

166
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,090
I told you I'd be ready.

167
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,284
I'm not talking about the job.

168
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,931
I gotta get home.

169
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,965
Hold your fire!

170
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,201
Adolf Hitler's favorite game
was cowboys and Indians.

171
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,402
He called the Russians redskins

172
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,166
and found inspiration
in the white man's

173
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,721
ethnic cleansing
of our Navajo kin.

174
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,047
Now, Proctor has
slaughtered our chief

175
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,289
and continues to take
what is rightfully ours.

176
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,010
Viho, Songaa.

177
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,530
Go get Proctor and the girl.
Bring them back here.

178
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,886
Hey.

179
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,210
I should be the one
getting Proctor.

180
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,170
Not now.

181
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,129
I've got other plans for you.

182
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,846
Chayton.

183
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,130
Everyone here thinks I get a free
ride 'cause I'm your brother.

184
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,009
I need to show them.

185
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,242
You need to be patient.

186
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,686
Alison.

187
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,371
I need your signature
on the plea deal

188
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,806
before I can file.

189
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,525
Come in.

190
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,610
I included
a future crime clause.

191
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,768
If Proctor gets so much
as a speeding ticket,

192
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,809
we can revoke the plea deal
and reopen the case.

193
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,244
Can I pour you a drink?

194
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,209
- I'm fine.
- All right.

195
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,725
Suit yourself.

196
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,370
I like the new apartment.

197
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,166
Yeah, you know, for a lawyer,
you're a pretty shitty liar.

198
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,482
Well, you have to at least
put in some effort.

199
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,290
Set up the kids' rooms.

200
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,971
Hang pictures.

201
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,567
Start cooking in the kitchen
so it smells like home.

202
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,565
Yeah. You cook?

203
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,643
I dabble.

204
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,291
Why don't you stick
around and teach me?

205
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,330
Gordon, I know you've
been through the wringer,

206
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,720
but you've got
to get it together.

207
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,367
- That was out of line.
- You think?

208
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,241
Alison, look,
you don't have to go.

209
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,768
I respect you too much to watch
you embarrass yourself like this.

210
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,131
Nola?

211
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,605
You know, I thought
you'd gone native, but this...

212
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,691
this is a whole new level.

213
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,043
- I'm glad you like it.
- I'm glad you think I like it.

214
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,851
I wondered if you'd come back.

215
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,130
I wondered the same thing.

216
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,248
Every time I think I'm rid
of this goddamn place...

217
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,289
- This place is your home.
- It's your home!

218
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,011
It's not mine.

219
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,482
You are a Kinaho woman.

220
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,762
Fat lot of good that did me
growing up here.

221
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,920
I know you suffered
greatly back then.

222
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,691
You think you know.

223
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,246
- Nola.
- What?

224
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,645
Let me die.

225
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,330
We already had this
conversation in New Orleans.

226
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,891
Can we not do it again?

227
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,571
You're already dead.

228
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,405
I'm very sorry
about your brother.

229
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,722
- You despised Alex.
- I pitied him.

230
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,961
He forgot who he was,
but his murder

231
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,964
was a tragedy
and we will avenge it.

232
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,328
By sending a couple of
gangbangers to Proctor's house?

233
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,606
They can handle it.

234
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,808
Alex is dead because
he underestimated Proctor.

235
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,849
With all clue respect,
I am not Alex.

236
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,291
No.
No, you're not.

237
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,529
Alex never liked you. He thought
you were bad for the tribe.

238
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,883
I am the tribe.

239
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,244
Yeah, I really don't care.

240
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,206
Nola.

241
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,526
Don't get in my way.

242
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,808
He was my brother, Chayton.

243
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,803
And you will have your blood.

244
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,484
- When you say?
- Yes.

245
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,920
No.

246
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,245
There's an old steam tunnel

247
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,566
buried underneath the base.

248
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,882
It's like our own
personal VIP entrance.

249
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,680
We're in.

250
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,488
Okay, now y'all
be careful down there.

251
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,248
You know, snakes and whatnot.

252
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,686
After you.

253
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,569
Just like old times.

254
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,966
So how we doing
with the vault?

255
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,250
Based on your description,
it has to be a JT-3000

256
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,606
custom-built in Virginia.

257
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,285
- How many locks?
- Two.

258
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,761
One mechanical,
the other digital.

259
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,404
If we get past the
rolling encryption code,

260
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,887
I'll have to drill through six
inches of reinforced steel

261
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,008
to disable the tumbler system.

262
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,490
Job can handle
the encryption code.

263
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,450
- It changes every 12 minutes.
- We'll have to work fast, then.

264
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,682
- And by we, you mean me.
- Yep.

265
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,647
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Sit.

266
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,322
My unit was point for
black ops in Afghanistan.

267
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,801
Asset recovery, bag grabs,
the dirty stuff.

268
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,930
One night we came under fire.

269
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,841
Not just a couple of
insurgents with small arms,

270
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,765
dozens of them
all armed to the teeth.

271
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,925
Someone had tipped them off.

272
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,571
I called for air support,
but it never came.

273
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,961
President's troop reductions
meant less support

274
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,970
for soldiers
still on the ground.

275
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,406
Murphy and I were the
only ones to make it out.

276
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,361
The powers that be
let seven good men,

277
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,524
patriots, die for politics.

278
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,446
That's why I only trust
my people.

279
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,527
This was found beneath a
floorboard under your bunk.

280
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,091
It's not mine.

281
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,726
You're an idiot, Haddock.

282
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,969
I could have made you rich,

283
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,768
and you blew it, for what?

284
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,883
- Thirty grand?
- Sir, I swear...

285
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,122
Did I tell you to stand?

286
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,931
Lock him in the brig.

287
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,530
Seems too easy.

288
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,603
Maybe Stowe doesn't
know about the tunnel.

289
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,170
He knows.

290
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,922
We got a solid steel
door blocking us.

291
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,127
How thick?

292
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,605
About 12 inches.

293
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,962
- Shape charges?
- Now you're talking my language.

294
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,488
Now, hold on. If those walls
are not properly reinforced,

295
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,524
your language will bring down
the whole damn tunnel.

296
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,961
What do you suggest?

297
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,726
Look, I'll pull the door
off the hinges

298
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,723
the old-fashioned way.

299
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,287
Like you got any other
motherfucking way.

300
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,726
Checking in.
All rooms secure.

301
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,366
Go find Proctor.

302
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,490
I'm starving.

303
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,204
There's some shepherd's pie
in the fridge.

304
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,249
Ooh, beef or turkey?

305
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,803
I stopped eating red meat.

306
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,440
You should, too.

307
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,081
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

308
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,771
You know what?

309
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,331
I'll make us something to eat.

310
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,364
I'll make us some sandwiches.

311
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,000
You got some lunch meat?
Some cold cuts?

312
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,923
Brock, what's
your current location? Over.

313
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,525
Don't. She'll find somebody else.

314
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,205
I'm still on duty.
Give it to me.

315
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,765
- Just let it...
- Come on, give it to me.

316
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,207
- I'm not messing around, Em.
- Come on.

317
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,001
Damn it!

318
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,601
Uh...

319
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,964
Yeah, this is Brock.
Go ahead, Alma.

320
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,288
We got a call of a disturbance
at the Proctor place.

321
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,851
Casualties reported.

322
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,849
Copy that.
I'm on my way.

323
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,565
Job still comes first, huh?

324
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,011
- Come on.
- Just like the old days.

325
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,366
Em.

326
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,204
What do you want from me?

327
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,010
I want you to leave.

328
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,321
You know what?

329
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,201
You're in luck.

330
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,891
I need pictures of everything.

331
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,883
Tell her to keep it
in focus this time.

332
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,565
I can hear you, Job.

333
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,120
Oh, I know.

334
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,925
Hold on one second.

335
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,322
- Hood.
- Hey, it's Brock.

336
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,803
Look, we got a DOA
in Proctor's pool.

337
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,169
Redbone. Looks like he and his buddy
roughed up the niece pretty bad.

338
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,329
I'm on my way.
I gotta go.

339
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,800
Fuck, you mean
you gotta go?

340
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,001
I'm still on duty.

341
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,161
Ana will finish up down here.

342
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,084
Baby, this whole
fake sheriff bullshit

343
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,163
is getting in the way
of your real job.

344
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,129
- You hear me?
- Hard not to.

345
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,126
You all right?

346
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,482
Hey, Brock.
Give us a minute.

347
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,571
Sheriff.

348
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,561
You started this war when
you took out Longshadow.

349
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,445
Yeah, well, you would know
about starting wars, Sheriff.

350
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,489
Chayton's not gonna
stop coming for you.

351
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,045
That's unfortunate for Chayton
and anyone else

352
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,362
- who comes after what's mine.
- Okay, let me be clear.

353
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,969
You and the Redbones
can tear each other apart.

354
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,885
I don't give a shit.
Just hurry the fuck up.

355
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,929
My house was violated
by these lowlifes.

356
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,082
You do your job, Sheriff.

357
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,367
Hey, Raven.
Come here.

358
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,327
You know the reservation.
Where do we start?

359
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,160
We can't just go
to the reservation.

360
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,606
Yeah, we can.
I do it all the time.

361
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,685
This is it?

362
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,080
Yep, Dog Iron.

363
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,651
A lot of Redbones hang out here.

364
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,248
Drinks are cheap
and nobody bothers them.

365
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,529
Hmm. Well, let's see
what we can do about that.

366
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,720
Can we get a couple of drinks?

367
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,451
Sure, three miles down the road.

368
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,321
Hey, Sue.

369
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,482
Billy, you know better than to
show up here in that uniform.

370
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,165
Then just tell me
if you've seen Chayton.

371
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,766
- Get the hell out of here.
- People are getting hurt.

372
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,726
Our people.

373
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,282
All I know is that they're
deep in the woods.

374
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,646
Whereabouts in the woods?

375
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,130
- You gotta go.
- Yo, Raven.

376
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,926
Thanks for your time.

377
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,204
What do you think
your old man would say

378
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,767
if he knew you were taking
orders from the white man?

379
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,528
- Move, Spatch.
- Or what?

380
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,526
You sure that's how
you want to play this?

381
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,687
Your, uh, badge...

382
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,685
...don't mean shit
around here.

383
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,251
Well, the badge is the last
thing you should worry about.

384
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,566
How's that?

385
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,244
Sit the fuck down.

386
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,409
How about we all
put our dicks away?

387
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,089
It's good to see
you, too, Aimee.

388
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,404
What the hell, Billy?

389
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,888
The hospice nurse is here.

390
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,129
- Mr. Proctor.
- Ms. Lotus.

391
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,691
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

392
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,169
You came highly
recommended, you know.

393
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,731
Please, call me Emily.

394
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,245
All right, Emily.

395
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,084
Why don't you make
yourself at home here?

396
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,844
And anything you need, just ask.

397
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,730
Why don't you start by
introducing me to your mother?

398
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,765
This is Leah, my mother,
and Rebecca, my niece.

399
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,765
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

400
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,445
Emily will be staying
with us, Mother,

401
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,125
to help care for you.

402
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,845
What happened to you?

403
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,769
I had an accident.

404
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,289
Well, have you put
anything on those cuts?

405
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,726
No.

406
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,607
Here. It'll help keep you
from scarring.

407
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,371
- You've got great skin.
- Thank you.

408
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,564
Let me show you to your room.

409
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,290
Notie and Spatch
were looking for a fight.

410
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,891
You were looking for a fight.

411
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,441
What are you thinking going to
the Dog Iron in a BSD uniform?

412
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,843
- He was following me.
- I wasn't talking to you.

413
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,446
We're looking for
Chayton Littlestone.

414
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,329
- You know him?
- Is he serious?

415
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,482
- We're on the same side here.
- Get off the res, Billy.

416
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,880
If Yaz finds out
that you're out here...

417
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,242
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who's Yaz?

418
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,890
Karl Yazzie.
Chief of the Kinaho PD.

419
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,406
Sounds like someone
I should meet.

420
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,721
Let's go. I'll take you.

421
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,888
No, you should probably
get in your car

422
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,362
and drive away if you know
what's good for you.

423
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,282
Do I look like someone who
knows what's good for him?

424
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,760
Chief.

425
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,684
You must have made
a wrong turn, boy.

426
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,649
This is the Kinaho
Police Department.

427
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,921
- And who do we have here?
- Sheriff Lucas Hood.

428
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,487
You busted that fat bastard
that killed the Cleary girl.

429
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,324
I'm surprised
you know about that,

430
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,369
seeing as you didn't
lift a finger to help.

431
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,410
Happened on your beat, not mine.

432
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,369
I stay on my side of the line.

433
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,527
Okay, well, Chayton
and the Redbones,

434
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,081
they hijacked a truck
from Camp Genoa.

435
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,204
Stole about a dozen crates
of AKs and M4s.

436
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,727
- What? When?
- Sounds like a military issue.

437
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,444
Not if the guns end up in Banshee.

438
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,928
Sorry, I can't tell you where
the man is if I don't know.

439
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,563
But we'll keep an eye out for him.

440
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,604
You'll keep an eye out?

441
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,250
None of your business, huh?

442
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,406
- Let's go.
- Oh, one other thing, Sheriff.

443
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,245
- Yeah?
- I call you sheriff as a courtesy,

444
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,449
even though out here
you've got no standing.

445
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,561
The next time you pull
some shit like you did today,

446
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,564
I'm gonna have BIA
crawling all over your ass.

447
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,006
You mind your own backyard
and we'll mind ours.

448
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,846
Billy.

449
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,046
That goes for you, too.

450
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,445
So Yaz is dirty?

451
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,806
No.

452
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,042
That would actually
require ambition.

453
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,450
Yazzie gave up on that
a long time ago.

454
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,922
Between the tribal council
and the Redbones,

455
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,165
he's everyone's bitch.

456
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,611
- What about the girl?
- Aimee? She's the real deal.

457
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,730
She just wants to make a difference.

458
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,005
She doesn't like you much.

459
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,644
Yeah, she feels I abandoned her.

460
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,886
She's not wrong.

461
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,289
But I had to get my family out.

462
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,325
You got kids?

463
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,562
Yeah, two little girls.

464
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,725
Rachel and Kim.

465
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,006
You?

466
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,924
No. No kids.

467
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,131
Jenny.

468
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,686
Mr. Mayor.

469
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,968
Living room or bedroom?

470
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,090
I think I'm gonna...

471
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,568
I'm really tired. I...

472
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,931
I bet I can wake you up.

473
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,445
No, Jenny.

474
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,804
Look, I shouldn't have called you.

475
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,205
For your trouble.

476
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,085
Try again tomorrow?

477
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,526
No, I think this is the
end of the road for us.

478
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,925
Well, if you change your mind,

479
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,849
you know where you can find me.

480
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,603
Kitchen's closed, men.

481
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,808
That's all right.
We already ate.

482
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,801
I would think after a guy like you
got his ass kicked by a woman,

483
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,928
the last thing he'd want to do
is bring his friends over

484
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,491
to watch it happen again.

485
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,085
You got a smart mouth
on you, bitch.

486
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,601
So I hear.

487
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,603
I'm gonna shut it for you
tonight permanently.

488
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,131
Listen,

489
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,566
it's been a long day
and I'm all out of repartee.

490
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,051
So if you came here
to fight, quit whining

491
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,248
like a little girl
and get right down to it.

492
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,688
- What's going on here?
- Get lost, Pocahontas.

493
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,803
- Ain't none of your business.
- Normally, I'd agree.

494
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,450
But if you're messing
with the only person

495
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,125
who can serve me
some of that apple pie,

496
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,965
then I'm afraid it is my concern.

497
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,009
I'll give you three seconds to
walk your pretty little ass

498
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,004
out that door before I...

499
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,962
Don't talk about my ass.

500
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,687
So, how about that pie?

501
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,804
You got it.

502
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,047
- You're Alex Longshadow's sister.
- Nola.

503
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,884
And you're the New York
mobster's daughter.

504
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,247
Carrie.
Sorry about your brother.

505
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,290
Sorry about your life.

506
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,687
Those are nice.
What are they, Glocks?

507
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,729
Modified 17Cs.

508
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,281
Cycle at 1,200 rounds
per minute.

509
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,960
Mm.

510
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,683
More of a Springfield girl myself.

511
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,570
Different strokes.

512
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,770
That's a great pie.
They bake it here?

513
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,163
I should know
the answer to that.

514
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,685
I don't.

515
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,168
I do know where
they keep the Scotch.

516
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,886
Sins of the fathers.

517
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,761
Amen.

518
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,691
Hey.

519
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,840
Hi.

520
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,762
I, um, thought we could hang out.

521
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,330
You shouldn't really be here.

522
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,725
Don't you have school?

523
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,645
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

524
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,924
Okay, so then after school?

525
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,320
- I can come by the Cadi.
- No, Deva...

526
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,766
- Don't you want to get to know me?
- Yes.

527
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,921
Then why won't you?

528
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,360
Look, I know this
is confusing for you,

529
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,842
but Gordon raised you,
he loves you,

530
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,326
he's your father.

531
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,451
And what about you?

532
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,202
You told me you stayed
in Banshee because of me.

533
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,124
I had to make sure
you were okay.

534
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,285
I'm not.

535
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,804
Fuck!

536
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,410
Get down!
