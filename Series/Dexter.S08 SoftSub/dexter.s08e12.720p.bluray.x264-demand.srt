00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,759
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,036
You can't kill me.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,435
Why?

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,557
Because I don't fit Harry's code.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,157
<i>Trust me when I say that there's
a place in this world for your son.</i>

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,470
You're perfect.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,633
How can you still say that
when you know what I've done
to Deb?

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,553
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,470
Why did you save me?
Why didn't you let me drown?

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,871
I couldn't imagine my life
without you in it.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,192
I'm glad that you have
managed to find your way
back to each other.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,874
The family that kills together...

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,633
Zach's killer is related to you.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,520
The Brain Surgeon is related to you.
Daniel.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,478
He's going by the name Oliver Saxon.

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,676
What are you going to do?

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,911
What do you think?
He's my son.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,197
I still have feelings for you.
No, I just--

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,916
Remember me?
Where do you think you'll go?

20
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,515
I haven't decided.
Argentina.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,799
Me, you and Harrison
are gonna move to Argentina.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,796
I've got a line on Hannah McKay,
but I'm gonna need help reeling her in.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,559
He's onto you. Move fast.

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,679
I tried to get an earlier flight,
but it's booked solid.

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,951
I have a proposal.
We walk away.

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,830
You kill your mother in front of me,
and you just expect me to forget?

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,480
Evelyn?

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,475
This is usually
my favourite moment, the kill.

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,273
Now I don't even wanna be here.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,199
Hey, Deb, change of plans.

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,430
Go get on a plane.

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,749
Last site someone visited
on this computer
was Aero Sudamerica.

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,151
I'm gonna tail the Morgans,
see if they'll lead me to her.

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,432
What the fuck is going on here?
Help me, please.

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,111
Unh!
Don't move.

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,154
<i>I used to live my life at night,
in the shadow of my dark passenger.</i>

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,234
<i>But over the years, my eyes adjusted,
and I could see.</i>

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,279
<i>And now what's in focus is my future.</i>

39
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,990
<i>Bright. Brighter than it's ever been.</i>

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,914
This is Detective Debra Morgan.
I've been shot.

41
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,955
Are we almost there?

42
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,191
It's, uh, Gate 209. Just a couple more.

43
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,920
I want some Oreos.
There'll be food on the plane.

44
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,878
Come on, you promised
to help me count.

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,599
Two hundred ten.
There you go.

46
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,197
<i>I always thought if I ever left Miami,
I'd be running for my life,</i>

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,559
<i>not running towards a new one.</i>

48
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,076
Two hundred and eleven.
Heh.

49
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,673
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

50
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,516
we'll begin boarding Flight 691
to Rio de Janeiro in a few moments.

51
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,596
<i>We ask that you have your tickets
and passports ready for the attendant.</i>

52
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,438
Where's Hannah?

53
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,436
Hannah?
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

54
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,274
I'm at the gate. Where are you?
I'm in the ladies' room.

55
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,999
Elway is in the boarding area.

56
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,114
Come here, buddy.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,559
<i>Attention, passengers:</i>

58
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,958
<i>We will begin pre-boarding
for Aero Sudamerica Flight 691
to Rio de Janeiro.</i>

59
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,999
He didn't see me. Did he see you?
I don't think so.

60
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,631
He's got a clear view of the Jetway.
He must have bought a ticket.

61
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,156
We won't be able to board
without being spotted.

62
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,431
And he's right between you
and the exit.

63
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,638
Dex, I just heard them.
Our plane is boarding right now.

64
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,311
Stay where you are. I'll call you back.
Okay.

65
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,915
Hey. You want some Oreos?

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,116
Yay!

67
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,277
Come on.

68
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,112
Why don't you grab something
for the flight?

69
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,795
Nothing too big.
Okay.

70
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,518
The storm is coming fast.

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,793
<i>We'll now be boarding</i>

72
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,394
<i>all passengers in business class.</i>

73
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,076
<i>All passengers in business class,
please make your way toward the gate.</i>

74
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,876
Hey, excuse me.
Hi. I have, uh, tickets on this flight.

75
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,959
I'm a forensic analyst, Miami Metro.
Yes?

76
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't wanna tell you how
to do your job, but I just saw a guy

77
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,517
drop that bag under that chair
and then just walk away.

78
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,316
I thought he forgot it, but it really
looked like he left it there on purpose.

79
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,834
Did you see where he went?

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,469
Yeah, he's right over there,
on the phone.

81
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,150
I know it's probably nothing,
but like they say:

82
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,391
"If you see something,
say something."

83
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,153
Thanks.

84
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,317
Security, this is Casey
at Gate 21 1.

85
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,439
There's a Caucasian male
who just came in with a backpack...

86
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,320
Deputy marshal, it's Elway again.
I'm still at the airport.

87
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,120
I still think Hannah McKay's trying
to leave the country.

88
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,158
Call me as soon as you can.
Thank you.

89
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,514
Sir. Airport security.
Need you to come with us, please.

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,354
What? What happened?
Just gotta ask you a few questions.

91
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,275
What is this about? I'll miss my flight.
Sir, I need you to do what I ask.

92
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,874
This way.

93
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,600
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

94
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,031
Hey.
Hey, the coast is clear.

95
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,190
<i>Elway's gone.</i>
Okay.

96
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,033
<i>Due to a security concern...</i>

97
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,032
Let's go see Hannah.

98
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,112
<i>it is necessary at this time</i>

99
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,636
<i>for all passengers
to exit the boarding area...</i>

100
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,678
Clear this area right now.

101
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,232
What did you do?
Put Elway on the no-fly list.

102
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,395
Unfortunately,
now we're not flying either.

103
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,880
Come on, bud.

104
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,751
All right, let's move her.

105
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,194
Stabbed in the heart. Pretty quick.
Unh.

106
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,274
His gun is missing too.
We can assume Saxon still has it.

107
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,310
I'm calling your brother.

108
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,592
No, he's leaving with Harrison.
If you tell him, he'll stay.

109
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,194
Deb--
I swear to God,

110
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,631
I'm not getting on that ambulance
if you call.

111
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,154
Okay.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,310
Can I ride with you to the hospital?
No problem.

113
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,676
Do not argue with me.
I'm in the ambulance.

114
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,435
You're such a fucking asshole.
Yeah, he signed it.

115
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,718
I'll meet you at the hospital.
I'm right behind you.

116
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,115
Miami Central,
this is Rescue 6 for transport...

117
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,997
You're all right.
Hurts like a motherfucker.

118
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,674
Ohh...

119
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,790
You know, I really hate getting shot.
You need to stop that.

120
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,440
Unh.

121
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,514
I really thought that was it.
I thought I was gonna die, heh.

122
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,399
No. You're gonna live forever.

123
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,631
I thought maybe I was
getting what I deserved.

124
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,792
What you deserve?

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,231
Why would you think that?

126
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,480
I've done shit I'm not proud of.

127
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,472
Stuff I can't take back.

128
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,876
Think I haven't done shit
I'm not proud of?

129
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,838
No.

130
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,399
It's not the same.

131
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,075
I know.
You went through a bad time.

132
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,439
But I fucked up too, Deb. A lot.

133
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,673
But I think we get
to make up for it, you know?

134
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,120
How?

135
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,036
You do enough good in the world,
it sort of cancels out the bad.

136
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,680
I think I would need to save
a busload of nuns or something.

137
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,758
You're a good person.

138
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,832
A lot better than most.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,673
Now that you're back on the force,

140
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,400
you're gonna have a million chances
to do good.

141
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,877
Maybe even save
that busload of nuns.

142
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,752
If they're like the ones
I had in school, let them go.

143
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,879
Come here.

144
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,440
Hey.

145
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,912
I'm gonna be right here, okay?

146
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,715
We both are.
Her vitals are stable.

147
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,349
Let's get her into surgery.
I love you, Joey.

148
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,073
What's that?

149
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,320
So?

150
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,120
She's on her way to surgery now.
She took one in the gut.

151
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,397
We don't know how bad it is yet.

152
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,115
Where's Dexter?
Deb asked us not to call him.

153
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,112
She what?
He's on a trip with Harrison.

154
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,590
She didn't wanna worry him.
But he's gotta know.

155
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,240
Damn right he's gotta know.

156
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,549
<i>Due to a possible security concern,</i>

157
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,995
<i>we are evacuating the terminal.</i>

158
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,797
It's Matthews.

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,036
Hello?

160
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,398
<i>Dexter, Saxon escaped
after shooting Debra.</i>

161
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,036
No. Well, thank you for telling me.
I'll be right there.

162
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,758
What's wrong?

163
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,798
It's Debra.

164
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,440
What?

165
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,679
Come on, bud.

166
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,231
Saxon shot her and got away.

167
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,032
Is she okay?

168
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,310
She's in the hospital
getting ready to go into surgery.

169
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,870
Is Aunt Deb sick?
Just a little.

170
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,157
But the doctors are
fixing her up right now.

171
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,551
You need to go to her.

172
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,551
I'll take you back to the hotel.

173
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,837
We should fly
into a different country.

174
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,713
They're only gonna
hold Elway so long.

175
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,231
He's gonna hit all the flights to Rio.
There may not be more flights.

176
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,199
I heard they were gonna close
the airport to wait out the storm.

177
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,875
Leave from another city.
See what you can find online.

178
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,032
What about you?
I'll join you when I can.

179
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,034
But--
Don't worry. We'll make this work.

180
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,680
One bag of ice
and one gallon of water.

181
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,435
- Can I get one more?
- Only one bag.

182
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,795
Hi, Jamie.
Hey, Harrison.

183
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,156
So tell me
all about your adventures...

184
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,960
How is she?
Still in surgery.

185
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,680
Yeah, we weren't able to speak
to the doctor before she went in.

186
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,910
Your sister's tough.
Just like your old man was.

187
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,470
Yeah, Dex.
She's gonna pull through.

188
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,155
<i>Due to severe weather...</i>

189
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,551
<i>This is Deputy U.S. Marshal Clayton.</i>

190
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,074
<i>Please leave
your name and number.</i>

191
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,357
Clayton, it's Elway. Again.

192
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,957
I don't know where you are,
but I'll tell you this:
McKay's still in town.

193
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,397
With the flights cancelled, I'm sure
she's looking for another way out.

194
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,792
I put the word out to my contacts,
and with what I pay these people,

195
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,839
if she walks through a hotel,
a car-rental agency, a bus,

196
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,117
I'm gonna hear about that shit.

197
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,157
All right. I'll try you at your field office,
see if I can get you there.

198
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,549
<i>U.S. Marshals Service.
How may I direct your call?</i>

199
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,234
Yeah, this is Jacob Elway.

200
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,551
I've been working
with Deputy Marshal Clayton.

201
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,758
I've been trying like hell--
<i>I guess you haven't heard the news.</i>

202
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,640
What?
<i>Clayton was involved in a shooting.</i>

203
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,031
<i>I'm afraid he was killed
in the line of duty.</i>

204
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,479
Why aren't you in Argentina?

205
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,032
Why do you think?

206
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,912
I told them not to call you.
Well, I'm glad they did.

207
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,710
How come we never went hiking
when we were kids?

208
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,758
Hiking?

209
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,877
Climbing...

210
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,517
mountains.

211
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,753
Hiking.
I don't know.

212
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,640
Because it's hard to find
a mountain in Florida?

213
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,751
There are mountains
in South America.

214
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,837
All over the place.

215
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,879
Why are you looking at me
like that?

216
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,631
Or is that just your face?

217
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,552
I should never have
left Saxon alive.

218
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,958
It's not your fault.

219
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,757
Clayton fucked everything up.

220
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,752
Bad luck.

221
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,196
No, it's more than that.

222
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,639
Ever since you found out
who I am...

223
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,760
I've screwed up your life, Deb.

224
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,709
It's not yours to screw up, Dexter.

225
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,670
I am responsible for my life.
Do you hear me?

226
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,994
I don't want you to feel guilty
about this.

227
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,720
I don't want you to feel guilty
about anything. You hear me?

228
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,153
You were meant to be happy,
so you need to go fucking be happy.

229
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,553
Okay.

230
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,991
Hello there.

231
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,880
Dr. Kruper.
Dexter. I'm Debra's brother.

232
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,440
Oh, nice to meet you.

233
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,635
Okay, I'm just gonna
check your stomach.

234
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,478
So how are you feeling
otherwise?

235
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,677
I wanna go hiking.

236
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,160
I wouldn't recommend that

237
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,312
for at least a few hours.

238
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,115
How is she?

239
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,715
That bullet bounced around
quite a bit.

240
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,151
But it missed
hitting anything important.

241
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,595
You are very lucky.

242
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,639
So she's gonna be all right?

243
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,231
There is a lot of recovery time ahead.

244
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,351
But I'd say we're looking pretty good.
I'm optimistic.

245
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,399
Thank you.
Mm-hm.

246
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,239
I bet Hannah loves Argentina.

247
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,475
Pretty blond, lots of attention.

248
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,393
Just her thing.

249
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,669
Hannah didn't make the flight.

250
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,350
Elway was there,
and we had to lose him.

251
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,720
That's my fault, Dex.
I put him on her.

252
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,152
That rat-face fuck.

253
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,038
I'm sorry.
No, don't start blaming yourself.

254
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,671
Coming from
Mr. "I screwed up your life, Deb."

255
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,760
I need to find another way
for Hannah to get out of the country.

256
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,351
I'm thinking of sending Harrison
with her now

257
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,716
and meeting up with them
after you get out

258
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,315
and Saxon is taken care of.

259
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,238
You heard the doctor. I'm fine.
You should go. We'll get Saxon.

260
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,392
No.
Dex, we'll get him.

261
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,120
Your life is waiting on you.
You should leave.

262
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,756
Deb...

263
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,520
The next word
I wanna hear you say is "goodbye."

264
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,991
Say it already, or I'll crawl out
of this bed and kick your fucking ass.

265
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,358
Goodbye.

266
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,832
I'll see you soon.

267
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,196
How's Aunt Deb? Can I see her?
Oh, she needs to rest.

268
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,398
But she's gonna come visit us
real soon.

269
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,835
Hey, did you know that this
is the hospital where you were born?

270
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,997
Really?
Yeah. Right down there.

271
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,629
It was the first time I saw you.

272
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,837
I was with Aunt Deb.

273
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,909
Holy fucking shit.
There's another Morgan now.

274
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,152
Yeah.
Congratulations.

275
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,510
You're a father.

276
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,720
Yeah, and you're an aunt.
Jesus.

277
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,473
Did you and Rita land
on a name yet?

278
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,756
Harrison.

279
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,554
Dad would love that. Harrison.

280
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,030
I wanna hold him.

281
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,235
Which one is yours?
I, um...

282
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,312
That's your son.

283
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,476
Do you wanna hold him?
Yeah, I wanna hold him.

284
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,869
He's sleeping.
Let him sleep.

285
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,509
He has his whole fucking life
to sleep.

286
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,960
He's so small.
Don't worry. He'll grow.

287
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,236
How does it feel to be a father?

288
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,357
I have no idea.
Heh.

289
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,955
Everything's gonna be different now.

290
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,438
I know.

291
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,759
Hey, thanks for your call.

292
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,673
No problem.

293
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,597
How's Debra?
The doctor's optimistic.

294
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,797
That's good to hear.

295
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,838
Dexter, if there's anything
I can do...

296
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,153
Well, I'm probably being paranoid,
but Saxon is still out there.

297
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,477
Think you could put a couple unis
on her room?

298
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,756
I'm already on it.

299
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,070
Thanks.
No problem.

300
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,390
Hey. Hey, I just heard about Deb.
What happened?

301
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,394
Uh, it's a long story.
I don't really have time to go into it.

302
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,029
In a hurry to get back
to Hannah McKay?

303
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,473
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's why Clayton was following Deb.

304
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,280
Figured she was helping you
and Hannah leave the country.

305
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,557
You're partially responsible
for his death.

306
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,356
Just stay away from me.
Storm's coming, buddy.

307
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,349
And it's gonna be real hard
to find a way out.

308
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,231
Don't go down with her,
Dexter.

309
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,680
Son of a bitch.

310
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,675
<i>The National Hurricane Centre
is reporting</i>

311
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,832
<i>that Laura is now just east
of Cuba</i>

312
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,356
<i>with sustained winds
topping 100 miles per hour.</i>

313
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,673
<i>If it keeps on this current course,
it could hit the Keys by sundown.</i>

314
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,075
Shh. It's okay.

315
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,800
<i>Hurricane Laura shows
no signs of slowing down.</i>

316
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,390
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.

317
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,596
Hey, we're closed.

318
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,520
Only reason I'm here
is to keep the animals calm to--

319
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,677
Stitch me up.

320
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,593
Okay.

321
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,400
Okay, I'll do whatever you need.

322
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,551
Miami's entire coast
is being evacuated,

323
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,270
so we can use the craziness to get
out of here without being spotted.

324
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,638
They're lining up evacuation buses.
The bus?

325
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,950
The highways are parking lots.

326
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,480
Buses have their own lanes.

327
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,236
We can take one all the way up
to Jacksonville and fly out from there.

328
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,194
We'd better leave for the bus station
soon if we're gonna make it on time.

329
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,234
What is it?

330
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,234
Nothing. It's a good plan.

331
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,840
You're still worried
about Deb, aren't you?

332
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,994
The doctor said
she's out of danger.

333
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,997
Hey, we can, uh...

334
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,232
We can stick around, you know,
ride out the storm here.

335
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,113
It's not safe with Elway on the hunt.

336
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,870
You need to get out of here,
the faster the better.

337
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,875
Well, I could leave now
and you could meet me there.

338
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,555
I could even take
Harrison with me.

339
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,872
Or I could, um, go alone.

340
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,037
I have no problem
with you taking Harrison.

341
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,760
I'd be happy to know
that he's with you.

342
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,114
It's that I don't wanna
lose you again.

343
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,878
Even if it's just
for a couple of days.

344
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,310
<i>--as well as Cuba
and Grand Cayman Island.</i>

345
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,160
<i>We're staying with you through
the morning and into the night...</i>

346
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,959
Hurry up.

347
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,112
<i>Tropical Storm Laura
is picking up speed...</i>

348
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,118
Almost finished.

349
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,390
One more stitch.

350
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,758
<i>The storm is threatening the coast
sometime in the next few days,</i>

351
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,991
<i>according to
the National Hurricane Centre.</i>

352
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,874
<i>Many local residents are
already preparing for the storm.</i>

353
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,196
<i>As the storm comes in,</i>

354
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,956
<i>it's important that people stay
in their homes and off the highways.</i>

355
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,271
<i>There's going to be a lot of wind
and rain.</i>

356
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,194
<i>It's going to be over the next few...</i>
Please.

357
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,398
Just go.
I won't say anything to anyone.

358
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,873
<i>--for this special report about
one of Miami's finest, Debra Morgan.</i>

359
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,350
That's her.
<i>I'm here at Miami Central Hospital,</i>

360
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,358
<i>where a detective
with Miami Metro</i>

361
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,120
<i>is recovering from surgery
after having been shot.</i>

362
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,875
<i>We have learned that
a deputy marshal died on the scene.</i>

363
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,396
<i>The suspect, Oliver Saxon,
is still at large,</i>

364
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,234
<i>and may have carjacked
a blue pickup truck.</i>

365
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,198
<i>If you have any information about...</i>

366
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,955
Get your car keys.
We're taking a drive.

367
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,674
Can't you just let me go?

368
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,911
Do what I said,

369
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,191
and you won't get hurt.

370
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,795
<i>Mockingbird Bus 24
from Miami to Tallahassee...</i>

371
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,151
All right, keep it moving.
No pushing.

372
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,437
WOMAN
Oh, no, it's okay.

373
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,160
Wait.

374
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,313
Come here.

375
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,756
All right, everyone,
please keep moving the line.

376
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,311
It's Saxon. He's still out there.
I can't leave until he's caught,

377
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,751
until Debra is safe.

378
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,832
I'm sorry.
You need to get back in line.

379
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,719
It's okay. I understand.

380
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,194
Here. Take Harrison.
I'll meet you down there.

381
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,874
You sure?
Yeah. He'll be safer with you.

382
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,912
Take this. It's just water,
snacks. A few essentials.

383
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,470
Call me from the airport
as soon as you know
that you made your flight.

384
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,155
I will.

385
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,915
<i>No one will be allowed
to board without a ticket.</i>

386
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,436
Harrison, you're gonna leave
with Hannah.

387
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,792
You're not coming with us?
No, of course I am.

388
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,714
I just forgot a few things
I need to take care of.

389
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,998
As soon as I do,
I'll meet you there, I promise.

390
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,350
I'm gonna miss you.

391
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,076
It's just for a little while.
It'll be fun.

392
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,433
We're all going to this cool place,
and you're gonna get there first, okay?

393
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,071
Now, I want you to mind Hannah.
You do what she says.

394
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,157
You know what, Daddy?
What?

395
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,117
I love Hannah.

396
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,438
So do I.

397
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,112
I'll see you in Buenos Aires.

398
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,035
We'll be waiting.

399
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,597
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>

400
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,117
<i>for Mockingbird Bus 24 to Tallahassee.</i>

401
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,910
Come on, Harrison.

402
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,712
<i>I'll check on Deb,
and then I'll deal with Saxon.</i>

403
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,953
This is the hospital.

404
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,390
I've done everything
you've asked.

405
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,233
I just wanna go home.

406
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,672
So this is it.

407
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,990
I promise,
I won't say a word to anyone.

408
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,038
No, I know.

409
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,516
We need a doctor over here!

410
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,520
Let me get that.

411
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,233
He's choking.
I need a suction canister.

412
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,675
Right away.

413
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,840
- Doctor?
- Jesus.

414
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,600
His tongue, it's been cut out.
Let's get him to the OR.

415
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,959
My God, why would anyone
cut his tongue out?

416
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,954
<i>All eyes on the victim.
The perfect distraction.</i>

417
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,873
<i>Saxon.</i>

418
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,038
<i>In order to conserve power,</i>

419
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,600
<i>the south wing has been closed.</i>

420
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,638
<i>At this time, we ask all visitors</i>

421
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,679
<i>to make their way towards the exit
in the north wing.</i>

422
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,151
<i>All surgical staff are to report
to their current assignments.</i>

423
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,553
Drop it.

424
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,080
Drop it.

425
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,639
We got this, Dex.

426
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,953
Quinn?

427
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,192
Dex, I...

428
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,831
Where's Deb?
I don't know. Something went wrong.

429
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,279
There was a problem,
and they rushed her to the ICU.

430
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,836
What happened?

431
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,637
They're working on her now. Um...

432
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,029
She stopped breathing.

433
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,349
Mr. Morgan, I'm afraid
I don't have good news.

434
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,160
There were complications.

435
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,156
What kind of complications?

436
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,916
We think a clot formed during surgery
that triggered a major stroke.

437
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,754
Debra's brain was deprived
of oxygen for a period of time.

438
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,151
What do you mean?
You said she was gonna be fine.

439
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,596
I had hoped so.

440
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,877
I'm very sorry.

441
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,954
Is she going to recover?

442
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,680
It's possible that
she could breathe on her own,

443
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,480
but she won't be able to eat
without a feeding tube,

444
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,556
and according to the brain scans,
she won't be able to think, reason,

445
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,394
or even know that you're there.

446
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,873
Now, we've intubated her,
and I've lowered
her body temperature

447
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,756
so that we can preserve
as much brain function
as possible.

448
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,071
You don't know Deb. She'll--
She'll pull through this.

449
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,438
You hear about
miracles all the time.

450
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,595
Well, that's just it, I'm afraid.
It would be a miracle.

451
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,234
I've never seen a miracle.

452
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,797
Hello, Harrison.

453
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,400
Wow.

454
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,197
He's so fucking small.

455
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,752
I'll have to watch what I say
around you, little man. Heh.

456
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,716
Don't you wanna
hold your son?

457
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,034
You won't break him.
Heh.

458
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,839
Okay.

459
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,277
Talk to him.

460
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,871
Hello, Harrison.

461
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,671
See? He knows you.

462
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,713
I don't know how to do this.
Just keep his head up.

463
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,837
No, I mean everything.

464
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,475
How to be a father,
how to take care of him.

465
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,314
You'll be great.
How do you know?

466
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,711
Because you've always
taken care of me.

467
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,195
I have?

468
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,636
Ever since we were little.

469
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,877
Don't you remember
the monsters?

470
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,356
Uh, no.

471
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,991
Every time Mom turned off the lights,
they'd be running all over the walls.

472
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,640
I couldn't fucking go to sleep.

473
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,996
I thought they were gonna
eat me or something.

474
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,437
I don't remember.
They were the shadows.

475
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,160
You came in and explained it
in your dorky little voice.

476
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,512
"Oh, it's just the absence
of light, Deb." Heh.

477
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,517
I don't even know
why I remember that, but I do.

478
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:24,114
And even then,
you stayed in my room
and slept on the floor by my bed.

479
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,391
You made me feel so fucking safe.

480
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,558
You were always taking care of me.
You're gonna be a great father,

481
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,594
because you've always been
a great big brother.

482
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,717
You really believe that?

483
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,076
With all my heart.

484
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,480
<i>You were so wrong, Deb.</i>

485
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,277
Tell me about Argentina.

486
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,152
Well, uh, they have their own
special kind of cowboys.

487
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,791
They're called gauchos.
Maybe you'll get to meet one.

488
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,077
You know what else they have?

489
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,630
Penguins.
I like penguins.

490
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,995
They're not just in a zoo.

491
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,675
They're wild ones,
kind of roaming around

492
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,710
because Argentina is close
to the South Pole,

493
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,715
which is where Santa Claus
has his summer home, and...

494
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,030
And because he's on vacation,
he's always in a good mood,

495
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,994
so he says yes to everything.

496
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,954
Who knew you'd be
so good with kids, huh?

497
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,359
How did you find me?

498
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,035
One of my contacts
finally came through.

499
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,316
Look, let's be civil about this, all right?
No need to upset Harrison.

500
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,240
All right, please take your seats.
We're pulling out now.

501
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,073
Next stop, Daytona.

502
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,591
So this is what's gonna happen.

503
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,800
We're gonna sit here quietly
until we get to Daytona.

504
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,714
Then we're gonna
very calmly get off the bus.

505
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,156
I'm gonna drive us
to the marshals field office,

506
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,400
turn you in and hand Harrison over
to Child Protective Services.

507
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,631
And I'm gonna collect
what's turning out to be
a very hard-earned reward.

508
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,870
Dex, we're gonna nail
this asshole to the wall,

509
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,077
I promise you.

510
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,556
For Deb.

511
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,275
Oliver Saxon.

512
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,000
Or would you prefer to be called
by your given name, Daniel Vogel?

513
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,510
You know, there are
several ways we can do this.

514
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,320
Given that we have footage
of you killing other people,

515
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,234
it would be in your best interest
to cooperate.

516
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,312
It's up to my lawyer
how cooperative I am.

517
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,517
Are you sure?
Because if you have any hope

518
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,319
of staying out of the electric chair,

519
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,199
you should
probably start talking.

520
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,589
Just fucking admit it.

521
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,434
You killed Cassie,
you killed Clayton,

522
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,515
and you shot Deb.

523
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,309
How did you hurt your arm?

524
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,716
This? It's just a scratch.

525
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,310
No.

526
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,354
Deb's a good shot.

527
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,636
Who's Deb?

528
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,870
Fuck you!

529
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,033
You fucking shot her!
And you left her there to die!

530
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,715
Just like you killed your mother
and left her to die,

531
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,280
you fucking piece of shit!

532
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,794
Quinn. Out.

533
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,036
I'd like to, uh, speak
to my attorney, please.

534
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,997
You know,
he was right about one thing.

535
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,070
You are a fucking piece of shit.

536
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,676
<i>Batista and Quinn will be able
to make a case against Saxon.</i>

537
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,711
<i>I could leave now for Argentina
and let the state of Florida kill him.</i>

538
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,592
Folks, we will be arriving
at the Daytona station momentarily.

539
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,912
After a short stop,
we will proceed on to Tallahassee.

540
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,595
Anyone making a connection
to Jacksonville

541
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,356
should disembark
and proceed to Boarding Bay 3.

542
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,556
Hey, hey.

543
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,916
I'm just getting some tea.

544
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,714
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you want some?

545
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,833
How stupid do you think I am?

546
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,520
Here's what's gonna happen.

547
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,390
The horse tranquilliser
I just gave you is gonna
kick in in eight seconds.

548
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,029
You're gonna fall asleep
and wake up in Tallahassee

549
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,358
with a slight headache,
feeling humiliated and cranky.

550
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,200
Come on, sweetie.

551
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,398
It's time to go. Let's go.

552
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,233
Come on.

553
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,000
Hi. I'm here to do a GSR test
on Oliver Saxon?

554
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,038
Sign in, please.

555
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,514
Would you like an officer with you?
No, I'm good.

556
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,276
Okay. Hit this button if you need us.
Got it.

557
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,313
I wish I could blame you
for everything.

558
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,640
For what you did to my sister.

559
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,080
But I know it's all my fault.

560
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,400
Should have walked away.

561
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,555
You know, what you've actually done
is opened my eyes.

562
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,875
Forced me to look at myself.

563
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,196
And what do you see?

564
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,672
A trail of blood and body parts.

565
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,233
What a pretty picture.

566
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,034
In one sharp moment,
you took away

567
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,113
this foolish dream
that I could have a happy life.

568
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,111
Is that why you're here?

569
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,870
To tell me all this?

570
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,714
No, I'm here to kill you with that pen.

571
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,036
In here.
You all right?

572
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,117
He tried to kill me.

573
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,678
Dexter...

574
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,756
help me out here.

575
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,914
What were you doing with Saxon?
I went in to do a GSR test.

576
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,551
But you don't even work here anymore.
How are we gonna explain this?

577
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,918
I'm officially here
till the end of the week.

578
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,232
Okay, but why would you
personally do this test?

579
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,200
After what he did to Deb--

580
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,956
It's exactly because of what he did
to Deb that I went in there.

581
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,358
I wanted to make sure everything
was handled perfectly, by the book,

582
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,193
no mistakes.

583
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,154
And I wanted to look him in the eye.

584
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,673
Okay.

585
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,194
I get that.

586
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,870
It's obviously self-defence.

587
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,913
Yeah.

588
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,193
We got everything we need.

589
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,313
I'm glad he's dead.

590
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,790
I wish I could have done it myself.

591
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,030
You should go, Dex.

592
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,635
I know that you have
a lot to deal with.

593
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,193
Yes.

594
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,440
Hey.

595
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,992
I'm praying for her.

596
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,160
<i>As much as I may have
pretended otherwise,</i>

597
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,950
<i>for so long, all I wanted
was to be like other people,</i>

598
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,675
<i>to feel what they felt.</i>

599
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,192
<i>But now that I do,
I just want it to stop.</i>

600
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,110
<i>Attention, all staff
and hospital personnel:</i>

601
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,000
<i>The National Hurricane Centre
estimates the current...</i>

602
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,994
Just so you know, patients
in the south wing are being moved.

603
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,958
We have to consolidate
space and power.

604
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,112
<i>--at 150 miles per hour.</i>

605
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,432
<i>It has been elevated to Category 3.</i>

606
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,270
<i>At this time, all staff must report
to their preassigned stations.</i>

607
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,554
I would change everything
if I could.

608
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,152
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

609
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,795
But I can't leave you like this.

610
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,399
I'm your big brother.

611
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,031
I love you, Deb.

612
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,714
<i>Dexter.</i>
Hey, where are you?

613
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,520
At the airport, about to board.
We're gonna make it.

614
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,433
That's great.

615
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,353
<i>Where are you?</i>

616
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,591
I'm still in Miami.

617
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,433
But I'm gonna be leaving soon.

618
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,671
<i>I can't believe
this is actually gonna happen.</i>

619
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,435
<i>Once we get there,
we should start making our way south.</i>

620
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,193
<i>They have 3000 miles of coastline.</i>

621
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,592
We can just keep going
until we find the perfect spot,

622
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,400
or maybe some penguins.

623
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,880
That sounds great.

624
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,159
I am so happy right now, Dex.

625
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,231
Me too.
<i>Do you wanna talk to Harrison?</i>

626
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,074
Please.

627
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,640
<i>Okay, here.</i>

628
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,799
Hi, Daddy.
<i>Hi, Harrison.</i>

629
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,997
I just wanna tell you one last time
that I love you.

630
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,319
I love you too.

631
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,238
I want you to remember that
every single day until I see you again.

632
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,880
Daddy loves you.

633
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,316
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

634
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,553
<i>I destroy everyone I love.</i>

635
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,752
<i>And I can't let that happen to Hannah,
to Harrison.</i>

636
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,912
<i>I have to protect them from me.</i>

637
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,554
<i>Good morning, Miami.</i>

638
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,195
<i>Hurricane Laura has passed.
Everything is going back to normal.</i>

639
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,716
<i>There is no longer any threat.</i>

640
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,874
<i>Hurricane Laura is slowly dissipating
over the Atlantic.</i>

641
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,794
<i>The majority of destruction
is along the harbour.</i>

642
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,680
<i>There have been some reports...
The cleanup has begun</i>

643
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,479
<i>as the city returns to normal,</i>

644
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,633
<i>with Coast Guard teams going
as far north as Daytona Beach...</i>

645
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,395
<i>Cutter 6, go ahead
and turn to your 1 o'clock.</i>

646
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,597
<i>There's something there.
I can't make it out.</i>

647
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,197
<i>We're stopping in five seconds.</i>

648
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,920
<i>- Okay, I think we got a visual.
- Copy that.</i>

649
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,992
<i>Turning northwest.</i>

650
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,080
<i>We've surveyed the wreckage.</i>

651
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,709
<i>There doesn't appear
to be any survivors.</i>

652
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,678
<i>We're heading back.</i>

653
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,469
Batista.
<i>This is the U.S. Coast Guard.</i>

654
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,951
<i>We just wanted to call and report
the wreckage of Dexter Morgan's boat.</i>

655
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,873
Dexter?

656
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,680
Hey, how about we go
get some ice cream, yeah?

657
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,240
Okay.
Yeah. Come on.
