1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,475
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,630
Dex.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,110
Shoot him.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,516
Do what you gotta do.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,440
Oh, my God!

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,593
Whoever Deb was before
killing LaGuerta, that person is dead.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,750
Oh, my God!

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,998
What we think is the shooter
approached the vehicle from behind.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,873
El Sapo drew his gun.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,153
I know you killed El Sapo.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,392
What if I weren't here
to cover your ass?

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,040
You really wanna play
that game?

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,914
What's going on with Debra?

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,590
- It's between me and her.
- It's affecting you.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,911
We're not going to talk about Deb.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,035
I thought we'd make it to one minute
before you mentioned your fiancée.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,557
I got your brother on my ass
about taking the sergeant's test.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,439
You're on my ass about Deb.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,832
Interior insular cortex is missing,
just like the last one.

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,310
So we have a serial.

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,630
Vogel was right.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,515
"Lyle Sussman."

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,310
- I don't know anybody by that name.
- It doesn't mean he doesn't know you.

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,920
He was coerced.

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,999
Sussman was never a real killer.
He's just another victim.

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,120
You were wrong about me.

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,832
I destroyed Deb.

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,156
I'm a mistake.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,070
You're exactly what you need to be.

30
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,349
Daddy?

31
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,350
Harrison?

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,034
Daddy?

33
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,478
Harrison?

34
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,155
Daddy?

35
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,470
Harrison?

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,756
My tummy hurts.

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,271
Harrison, did you eat
a whole box of popsicles?

38
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,759
Harrison.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,072
- Why?
- Because I love them.

40
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,999
All right. Come on.

41
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,438
Drink this. It'll make you feel better.
I promise.

42
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,640
Good boy.

43
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,674
<i>A tiny shot of pink
is all it takes to fix my son's pain.</i>

44
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,239
<i>I just wish it were that easy
to help Deb.</i>

45
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,271
- What?
- Lieutenant Morgan?

46
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,073
Formerly known as.

47
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,273
Have you been drinking?

48
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,399
There a problem, officer?

49
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,234
Well, yes. You're in a car,
drunk, with an open container.

50
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,278
Several, actually.

51
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,833
Well, at least I pulled over.

52
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,911
I've had a really bad couple of days.

53
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,112
Maybe you could just
cut me some slack?

54
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,076
- I wish I could, but--
- But what?

55
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,993
There's been damage to city property.

56
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,550
Property damage?
Are you fucking kidding me?

57
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,991
I'm gonna need you
to get out of the car, please.

58
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,680
Oh, mother shit.

59
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,632
Is there someone I can call?
Your brother?

60
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,110
No, fucking don't call Dexter.

61
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,559
Quinn.

62
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,035
Yeah. I'll be right there.

63
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,395
Is everything okay?

64
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,474
Yeah. Just cop stuff.

65
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,520
- Okay.
- I'll call you later.

66
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,670
Okay.

67
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,520
- Deb.
- I'm up.

68
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,196
You okay?

69
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,559
I feel like I got hit by a truck.

70
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,670
Jesus, Deb.

71
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,156
Oh, God, please,
just save me the lecture, okay?

72
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,637
My head hurts like a motherfucker.

73
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,800
I'm not gonna lecture you.

74
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,750
They book you yet?

75
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,400
No, not yet.

76
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,276
They kept me out
of the drunk tank, though.

77
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,917
Thank God for professional courtesy.

78
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,749
All right.

79
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,480
Let me see if I can get you out of this.

80
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,352
Hey. How you doing?

81
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,560
Can I get a little help?

82
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,995
What can I do for you?

83
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,995
<i>Deb's had me
on such a roller coaster...</i>

84
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,710
<i>...I actually appreciate
walking into familiar territory.</i>

85
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,914
<i>Lyle Sussman's cabin.</i>

86
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,233
<i>But where's the body?</i>

87
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,040
Dex? This is our guy, Sussman.

88
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,714
The Brain Surgeon.

89
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,354
<i>Not exactly.</i>

90
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,515
<i>Did the real Brain Surgeon
restage the crime scene...</i>

91
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,071
<i>...obscuring any evidence
that Sussman's body...</i>

92
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,880
<i>...was ever hanging
from a hook in the back of his skull?</i>

93
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,633
Give me a hand?

94
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,515
His front teeth are broken.

95
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,677
Looks like Sussman put this shotgun
in his mouth, and blam...

96
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,240
...blew his head off.

97
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,039
<i>Or someone put the gun in his mouth
and pulled the trigger post-mortem.</i>

98
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,272
GSR on Sussman's hands.

99
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,840
Maybe he finally found his conscience,
couldn't live with what he did.

100
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,400
No note, though.

101
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,354
Ah, suicide.

102
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,712
- Makes our lives so much easier.
- You should put that on a T-shirt.

103
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,238
<i>Whoever's after Vogel
wants the cops off the case.</i>

104
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,315
- Is Vogel here yet?
- I just called her.

105
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,393
Where the fuck is Quinn?

106
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,432
You can thank me later.

107
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,950
You still keep a stash of gum in here?

108
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,793
I can smell my own breath.

109
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,913
You sure you want to go to work...

110
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,072
...after spending the night
in the station?

111
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,800
I mean, I could take you home.
You could shower.

112
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,318
I keep deodorant in my desk.

113
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,679
Thanks for the ride.

114
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,633
Deb, wait.

115
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,560
What?

116
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,392
- Should I be worried?
- About what?

117
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,154
About you.

118
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,557
Think you might have a problem?

119
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,917
You mean like a drinking problem?

120
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,679
I'm just saying.

121
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,118
Are you serious? You, of all people...

122
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,432
- ...accusing me of a drinking problem?
- Not accusing you of anything.

123
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,838
How many times have you shown up
at a crime scene smelling like booze?

124
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,070
A lot, okay?

125
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,550
Which means I've been down this road,
so I get it.

126
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,712
I'm not down any fucking road.

127
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,555
But at least when I was spinning out,
I had a reason.

128
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,832
- What do you mean, you had a reason?
- You, dumb-ass.

129
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,076
You turned down my proposal.
That was my reason.

130
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,959
So, what's yours?

131
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,193
Maybe I just don't know my own limits,
or something.

132
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,032
- I didn't--
- That's my boss. I gotta go.

133
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,714
Deb--

134
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,920
You might want to straighten up.

135
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,640
We have a new client coming in at 9.

136
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,152
I'm frightened. He's escalating,
and we're left to play catch-up.

137
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,956
I'll run tests at the lab, but I'm guessing
this tissue belongs to Sussman.

138
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,192
Explains why the killer
blew his head off with a shotgun...

139
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,316
...so nobody'd notice the pieces were
missing. What part of the brain is it?

140
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,392
It's the occipital lobe.

141
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,279
It's responsible for vision.

142
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,232
He's sending us a message.

143
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,920
He's watching us.

144
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,998
That, and the "His" and "Hers" boxes?

145
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,117
He's aware of me now, not just you.

146
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,950
I'm sorry, Dexter,
to have dragged you into this.

147
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,392
He sent both packages to you.

148
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,672
Maybe doesn't know how to find me.
Probably doesn't even know my name.

149
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,600
- Yet.
- Yeah, I know.

150
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,150
I need to get to him
before he gets to me.

151
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,993
I've been going through your book...

152
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,393
...and cross-referencing it with the
source files and list of suspects.

153
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,110
Any progress?

154
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,073
I managed to clear
the first two names.

155
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,509
So who's next?

156
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,558
Ron Galuzzo.

157
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,600
According to your files, he strangled
his best friend in high school...

158
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,717
...but convinced you
that it was a bully?

159
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,394
Yeah.

160
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,632
It's rare
that someone can fool me like that.

161
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,832
At his hearing,
I argued for leniency...

162
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,154
...but when I eventually got him
to admit he'd been lying...

163
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,118
...I reversed my recommendation.

164
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,954
So if Galuzzo read your book
and recognised his story--

165
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,715
He would've realised
that he'd been institutionalised...

166
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,837
...until he was 21 because of me.

167
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,750
That's a pretty good reason
to hold a grudge.

168
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,989
Dex.

169
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,150
Excuse me.

170
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,200
It's about your sister.

171
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,710
What about her?

172
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,111
She got brought in
for a DUI last night.

173
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,156
Shit.

174
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,030
I managed to get her out of it,
but still, it was pretty bad.

175
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,796
She asked me not to say anything
so I feel like a shit friend for telling...

176
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,474
...but I'm worried about her.

177
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,599
What the fuck's going on?

178
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,475
- She's been having a hard time.
- Yeah, I know.

179
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,718
But, man, this is, like,
a whole new level.

180
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,275
What are we gonna do?

181
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,193
I'll figure something out.
Thanks for the heads-up.

182
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,839
I'm putting you up for sergeant,
and you show up late?

183
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,469
Are you trying
to make me look like an asshole?

184
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,791
Sorry. I had a situation.

185
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,475
You want a situation?
Come to the cabin.

186
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,639
What is it?

187
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,155
It's Deb. She was brought in
for a DUI I need to check on her.

188
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,113
Is alcohol an issue for her?

189
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,232
I'm an issue for her.
She's acting this way because of me.

190
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,116
But you can't keep taking on your
sister's problems, especially right now.

191
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,590
It's my fault, okay?

192
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,435
Deb found out what I am.

193
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,080
She knows everything.

194
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,559
Everything?

195
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,076
How?

196
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,439
It's a long story. Just suffice to say,
she's not handling it well.

197
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,720
You do really feel badly, don't you?

198
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,273
Are you analysing me now?

199
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,875
- It's just so unusual.
- It's really not a good time.

200
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,197
Most of the time, when people think
their partner's having an affair...

201
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,113
...their partner's having an affair.

202
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,869
- But not always, right?
- No, certainly not always.

203
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,234
This is for you.

204
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,750
My assistant will explain
the retainer and payment schedule...

205
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,560
...and we'll get back to you
when we've found something.

206
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,077
So nervous.

207
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,870
Is that normal, to be nervous?

208
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,515
Well, people go through
a wide range of emotions.

209
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,639
I think the important thing
is finding out the truth.

210
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,360
Don't look at me.
I think the truth is overrated.

211
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,118
Call us if you have any questions,
and we'll be in touch.

212
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,396
Yeah.

213
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,034
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

214
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,600
Well, it looks like we have to work on
our client-relation skills.

215
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,439
Are we done? I need a fucking nap.

216
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,718
No, we're not done.
I've got something for you.

217
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,193
What is that? A fucking shit shake?

218
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,597
Special custom-made
supplement formula.

219
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,992
It's got vitamins, some electrolytes,
a couple Chinese herbs.

220
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,597
- It'll knock the hangover right out.
- How do you know I'm hung over?

221
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,352
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

222
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,193
It's your brother.

223
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,639
Awesome. Fucking awesome.

224
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,913
What do you want?

225
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,470
I heard about
what happened last night.

226
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,119
Fucking Quinn.

227
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,954
He's worried about you.

228
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,634
We both are.

229
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,434
You almost got a DUI?

230
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,791
I think the operative word
is "almost."

231
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,996
It's not a big deal.

232
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,560
It's a very big deal.

233
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,916
This is why I didn't tell you.
Knew you'd freak out.

234
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,549
I'm not freaking out.
I'm just trying to help.

235
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,310
Fuck, Dexter.
I don't have time for this, you know?

236
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,560
I have to find out if some asshole
is banging some chick...

237
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,757
...which he probably is,
so I can tell her...

238
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,276
...and she can get
a killer divorce settlement...

239
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,478
...and they can move on with
their stupid, fucking boring lives...

240
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,836
...and I can move on with mine.

241
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,478
- Because this is my life now.
- Well, it wasn't always.

242
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,355
How about dinner tonight?

243
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,190
- We can talk.
- I don't want to talk to you.

244
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,670
Well, I'm gonna keep showing up here
until you do.

245
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,277
If I agree to dinner, will you leave?

246
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,920
Yes.

247
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,030
Fine.

248
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,355
Great. I'll pick you up at 8.

249
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,350
ME's report is back from the cabin.

250
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,514
They've officially ruled
Lyle Sussman's death as a suicide.

251
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,518
So with that, the Brain Surgeon case
is officially closed.

252
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,357
Okay. I'll call Evelyn,
thank her for her help.

253
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,713
Evelyn? Someone's got
a high hard one for the good doctor.

254
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,758
What did I say
about standing so close?

255
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,912
Any progress
on that El Sapo shooting?

256
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,671
Still no leads. I've been going back
and forth with Fort Lauderdale P.D.

257
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,719
Apparently, El Sapo was a suspect
in the stabbing...

258
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,237
...of a smash-and-grab lowlife
by the name of Andrew Briggs.

259
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,831
<i>The cops will never find out
that Deb killed El Sapo.</i>

260
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,398
<i>So right now,
I can focus on protecting Vogel...</i>

261
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,710
<i>...and myself.</i>

262
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,235
<i>Ron Galuzzo.</i>

263
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,592
<i>He could be hunting me right now.</i>

264
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,671
<i>Or he could be selling
fitness equipment at the mall.</i>

265
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,194
Good work today, everyone.

266
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,230
Deputy chief, got a sec?

267
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,430
Wanted to let you know...

268
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,638
...I've been thinking about
what you said, finding a new sergeant.

269
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,553
And I've got my eye on Joey Quinn.

270
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,513
Quinn? No way.

271
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,876
- He's not sergeant material.
- He's a good cop.

272
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,475
He's irresponsible, unpredictable...

273
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,475
...not to mention unintelligible.

274
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,513
No way he can pass
that sergeant exam.

275
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,870
He'll pass.

276
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,476
If you say so.

277
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,477
- Are you getting all this?
- Yeah.

278
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,674
This guy's making this
way too easy for us.

279
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,036
Yeah, it's really fucking classy.

280
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,560
So tell me, who's the guy
that dropped you off this morning?

281
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,356
Who? Quinn?

282
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,830
He's a friend.

283
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,674
Kind of friend that drops you off
in last night's clothes?

284
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,878
God, we're not sleeping together,
if that's what you're implying.

285
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,878
Not that it's any of your business.

286
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,713
No judgement, no judgement.

287
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,918
You are certainly allowed
to be a player...

288
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,790
- ...if you so choose.
- What makes you think I'm a player?

289
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,480
First there's Briggs,
then there's your new friend.

290
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,598
Well, he's not a new friend.

291
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,395
We used to date, just not anymore.

292
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,360
Really?

293
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,994
So what happened?

294
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,713
He proposed. I said no.

295
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,239
Jesus Christ.

296
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,069
He's certainly a better man than I am.

297
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,675
Woman turns down my proposal,
I'm not gonna stay friends with her.

298
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,753
Yeah, but that's just because
you're a giant pussy.

299
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,798
Yes. Could be.

300
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,470
<i>Ron Galuzzo.</i>

301
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,633
<i>If he is a killer, then a mall
is the perfect watering hole...</i>

302
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,598
<i>...for him to choose his prey.</i>

303
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,079
So any of our products is gonna make
you stay in the shape that you are.

304
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,838
And I need to do some more work,
so I'll see you a little bit later, okay?

305
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,753
<i>It was dark at Sussman's cabin.</i>

306
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,593
<i>Does he recognise me?</i>

307
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,630
You've got a keen eye, my friend.

308
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,677
The Chiseller 300.

309
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,120
- Top of the line.
<i>- Or is he just trying to make a sale?</i>

310
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,512
Just looking for an all-over workout,
maximise my time.

311
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,479
- Mind if I take a body measurement?
- Sure.

312
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,036
Looks like
you're already in pretty good shape.

313
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,833
Oh, you have
a very low fat-to-muscle ratio.

314
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,317
Well, thanks.
I do what I can, you know.

315
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,669
Yeah, this equipment
is more for beginners...

316
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,197
...people who don't already have
an established routine.

317
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,829
<i>Does he know who I am?
Is he trying to get rid of me?</i>

318
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,957
I'm just looking
to change up my workout.

319
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,315
I'd love any suggestions.

320
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,400
That baby...

321
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,190
...cut you up faster
than a chef at Benihaha.

322
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,397
- Come on, give it a try.
- Okay.

323
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,951
<i>He doesn't seem to recognise me.</i>

324
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,230
Careful.

325
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,392
<i>Maybe a grudge against Vogel
will be harder to hide.</i>

326
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,591
I like to read when I work out. Keeps
me from getting motion sickness.

327
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,678
This one, I can't put down.
Heard of it?

328
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,519
I'm not much of a reader.

329
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,189
You probably heard of the author.
She's pretty famous.

330
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,315
They call her
the Psychopath Whisperer.

331
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,397
Dr. Evelyn Vogel?

332
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,956
- Never heard of her.
<i>- Of course he's heard of Vogel.</i>

333
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,918
<i>She treated him. He's lying.</i>

334
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,600
You know, a fit guy like you...

335
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,436
...you need to get up to at least
level five to feel the full effect.

336
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,634
<i>But why lie,
unless he has something to hide?</i>

337
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,200
Yeah, I feel it.

338
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,272
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

339
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,872
Don't forget to breathe.

340
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,877
You went to see Galuzzo?

341
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,234
You could have exposed us both.

342
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,518
It was worth the risk.
He's definitely hiding something.

343
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,000
So now what?

344
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,995
I break into his house tomorrow,
when he's at work...

345
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,152
...try to find evidence
that he's our man.

346
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,471
And in the meantime,
what if he comes for me?

347
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,030
Do you have any way
to protect yourself?

348
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,750
A gun. I haven't used it for years.

349
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,874
Keep it loaded
and call me if you need me.

350
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,520
I'm meeting Deb for dinner.

351
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,239
- I'll check in with you later.
- Wait. Just--

352
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,877
There's one thing I was wondering
about since we last spoke.

353
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,590
Yes?

354
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,480
When Harry and I
came up with the code...

355
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,633
...he insisted
that you only kill bad people.

356
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,715
And I insisted
that the first rule of the code be:

357
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,110
"Don't get caught."

358
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,992
Giving you a little wiggle room.

359
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,116
Okay.

360
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,037
So my question is this:

361
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,236
When your sister found out about who
you were and what you were doing...

362
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,474
- ...why didn't you kill her?
- What?

363
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,798
Not that I'd advocate such a thing...

364
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,234
...but since Debra knew the truth
about you, she's clearly a risk--

365
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,312
I would never kill Debra.
She's my sister.

366
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,039
I love her.

367
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,356
What exactly do you love about her?

368
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,514
What do you mean?

369
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,076
When a psychopath
speaks about love...

370
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,152
...it doesn't really mean the same thing
as for typical people.

371
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,391
So what do you love about her?

372
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,633
I don't know.

373
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,512
I love having steaks
and beer with her...

374
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,720
...and until recently...

375
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,070
...the fact that she was always there
for me, the way she looked up to me.

376
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,474
But none of that
is really about Debra.

377
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,709
It's about what she does for you.

378
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,474
So you're saying I'm selfish?

379
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,199
I'm not criticising.

380
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,192
Selfless love is hard enough
for typical people.

381
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,591
And for psychopaths...

382
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,716
...it's impossible.

383
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,714
Why are you telling me this?
So I'll feel bad about myself?

384
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,479
Quite the contrary.

385
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,637
I want you to revel in what you are.

386
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,792
I told you, you're perfect.

387
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,115
How can you say that
when you know what I've done to Deb?

388
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,754
That's my point.

389
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,877
You're perfect as a psychopath.

390
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,312
All this talk about helping Debra,
and loving her...

391
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,633
...it's like you're Michelangelo
trying to play the banjo.

392
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm trying to be a good brother.

393
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,229
Why don't you let me help Debra?

394
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,916
Because she wouldn't even listen
to you.

395
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,080
I'm the only one who understands her.

396
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,598
Dexter, you admitted
to being the cause of her pain.

397
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,316
How can you expect to be the solution?

398
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,630
I can handle Deb.

399
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,597
I've been doing it my entire life.

400
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,750
All right, next question.

401
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,709
Physically evasive movements to defeat
an officer's attempt to control is:

402
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,193
A, active aggression,
B, physical resistance...

403
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,434
...C, active resistance,
D, active evasion?

404
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,559
B, active aggression.

405
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,436
Okay, active aggression is actually A.

406
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,355
And B, it's wrong.

407
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,798
The answer is C, active resistance.

408
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,069
Wait, I'm confused.

409
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,469
Of course you are.

410
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,831
Matthews was right.
You're a fucking lost cause.

411
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,356
Jesus, Angel. Easy.

412
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,552
Yeah, Angel. Easy.

413
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,512
I stuck my neck out
on the line for you with Matthews.

414
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,520
You better not fuck this up.

415
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,679
Will you please cut him some slack?

416
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,231
He's tired from being called out
in the middle of the night on that case.

417
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,631
What case? There's no case.

418
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,473
I'm....

419
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,234
I'm gonna let you guys talk.

420
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,157
So where did you really go at 4 a.m.?

421
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,990
Deb was in trouble
and needed my help.

422
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,551
She's been going through
kind of a hard time.

423
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,275
And why did she call you?

424
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,076
Why not her brother?

425
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,115
I don't think they're getting along,
you know, and she's a friend.

426
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,954
- I couldn't say no.
- She's more than a friend.

427
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,839
I mean, you used to fuck her.

428
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,354
And now she's calling you
for everything.

429
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,032
What am I supposed to think?

430
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,358
Jamie, I swear to you, there is nothing
going on between me and Deb.

431
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,075
Then why lie about it?

432
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,192
Because I didn't think
you'd understand.

433
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,354
Well, you're right.

434
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,676
I don't.

435
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,072
Enjoy your dinner.

436
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,637
The fuck are we doing
in this hellhole?

437
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,358
Can I get you something to drink?
We have a wide array of cocktails.

438
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,796
I'll take a bourbon, neat. Thank you.

439
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,797
Two cokes, please.

440
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,033
I knew this was a mistake.

441
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,951
I wanted to show you something.

442
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,674
You see that man over there?
The father?

443
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,074
- Yeah.
- Does he look familiar?

444
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,353
Fuck if I know.

445
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,351
<i>Fuck. He's wearing Kevlar.</i>

446
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,630
<i>Don't fucking move!</i>

447
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,593
So what, Dex?
That was a long time ago.

448
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,029
Yeah, but look.

449
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,391
See this guy, the guy you saved?

450
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,556
That's him. Right there.

451
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,879
His little girl wouldn't have a father
if it weren't for you.

452
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,439
That's why I brought you
to this hellhole, to show you that.

453
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,280
I know you think you're a bad person
after all that happened, but you're not.

454
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,518
You're a good person.

455
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,518
You brought a lot of good to the world.

456
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,031
I'm fucking starving.

457
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,793
<i>Have a nice day at the mall.</i>

458
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,280
I realise this is not the outcome
you were hoping for...

459
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,911
...but it can help
with a favourable divorce settlement.

460
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,639
If you want,
we can forward those to your attorney.

461
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,150
I don't know.

462
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,874
You don't have to decide now.

463
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,439
I realise it's a lot to take in.

464
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,354
I mean, I don't know if that's him.

465
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,470
I'm sorry?

466
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,471
This man in the pictures,
I'm not sure that's my husband.

467
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,716
That's him, all right.
Look, you can see his face.

468
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,799
Not clearly.

469
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,754
The lighting isn't very good.

470
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,919
Mrs. Gerard, I assure you,
we're always very careful--

471
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,230
This was a mistake.

472
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,995
- Mrs. Gerard--
- I'm sorry that I wasted your time.

473
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,676
I'll leave a cheque at the front desk.

474
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,434
Is she fucking kidding?
That's obviously her husband.

475
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,038
She just didn't want to see it.

476
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,669
People get used to living in denial.

477
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,676
It's just easier, you know?

478
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,999
<i>Galuzzo has to be the guy
we're looking for.</i>

479
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,479
<i>Why would Galuzzo be such a slob
everywhere else but here?</i>

480
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,879
<i>That's why the kitchen is so clean:
It's a kill room.</i>

481
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,714
<i>Galuzzo wasn't checking my body fat
for my own fitness.</i>

482
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,714
<i>He was checking to see
if I was fit to have as a main course.</i>

483
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,238
<i>He's definitely a butcher. But does
that make him the Brain Surgeon?</i>

484
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,674
<i>Our killer leaves bodies out...</i>

485
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,719
<i>...but Galuzzo keeps his bodies
to season and savour.</i>

486
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,879
<i>This brain is completely intact...</i>

487
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,960
<i>...marinating in some sort of...
garlic sauce.</i>

488
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,072
<i>Galuzzo wouldn't waste brains
by sending them to Vogel.</i>

489
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,039
<i>They're a delicacy. He eats them.</i>

490
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,878
<i>Which means whoever's after us
is still out there...</i>

491
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,396
<i>...and he still has the upper hand.</i>

492
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,232
<i>Fuck. He's wearing Kevlar.</i>

493
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,797
<i>Fuck. He's wearing Kevlar.</i>

494
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,830
Deb, what are you doing here?

495
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,597
I want to make an official statement.

496
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,113
How much have you had to drink?

497
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,273
One or two.

498
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,393
- Why don't we get some coffee?
- I don't want coffee.

499
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,711
I want to confess.

500
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,392
You want to confess to what?

501
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,671
I killed LaGuerta.

502
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,589
- You what?
- I killed LaGuer--

503
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,596
Why don't we go someplace quiet
where we can talk?

504
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,917
- Fuck!
- I got you.

505
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,030
Take it easy.

506
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,990
Calm down.

507
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,080
What are you talking about?

508
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,471
I told you. I killed LaGuerta.

509
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,075
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It does.

510
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,476
On New Year's Eve, I was at Papa's.

511
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,799
I called dispatch to find out
where she was going.

512
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,270
They said she was going
to the shipping yard...

513
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,114
...where she met Estrada before.

514
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,676
So you feel guilty
that you didn't back her up.

515
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,794
I don't feel guilty.
I am guilty.

516
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,953
No, you can't let yourself
think that way.

517
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,520
You had no way of knowing...

518
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,275
- ...what she was doing there.
- I did know.

519
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,598
I killed her.

520
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,393
Deb, Estrada killed LaGuerta.
We both know that.

521
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,035
That's not what happened.
I'll tell you what happened.

522
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,919
I know what happened.

523
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,794
The bullet that killed LaGuerta
came from Estrada's gun.

524
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,951
He shot first. It was a through and
through. Bullet was never recovered.

525
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,998
She shot back. He went down.

526
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,995
He got one more shot off, and that
bullet was traced to Estrada's gun.

527
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,435
They both died at the same time.

528
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,676
- That's not true.
- It is.

529
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,277
Remember,
Dexter walked us through it.

530
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,312
Dexter! Oh, fuck.

531
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,636
Hey.

532
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,995
Oh, God, Joey, you have to believe--

533
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,634
Okay, okay. I believe you.

534
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,718
I believe you. All right?

535
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,074
Okay.

536
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,071
Here, just write down everything you
remember from that night, all right?

537
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,230
- Okay.
- All right.

538
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,278
Good. Good.

539
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,635
- Okay.
- I'll be right back with you.

540
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,917
What about Arnold Gordon?
Trauma surgeon.

541
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,878
He definitely has the right skill set.

542
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,030
Motive?

543
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,760
He always resented
that I called him a psychopath...

544
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,391
...and he threatened to hurt me
if ever I told anyone that he was.

545
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,109
- Morgan.
- You need to get down to the station.

546
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,355
- I'm a little busy.
- Your sister just confessed...

547
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,239
- ...to killing LaGuerta.
- What?

548
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,120
<i>She's drunk, high, fucked up--
I put her in a room...</i>

549
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,715
<i>- ...so nobody could see her.</i>
- Make sure she stays.

550
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,519
- I'm on my way.
<i>- All right.</i>

551
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,480
Is everything okay?

552
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,920
It's Debra.

553
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,995
I need you to come
to the station with me.

554
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,636
- Has something happened?
- Yes.

555
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,792
I can't believe she actually confessed.

556
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,835
I thought I got her to see
that she's a good person.

557
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,391
This could have been the only way
she could relieve herself of the guilt.

558
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,479
Need you to help get her out of this.

559
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,155
Give your expert opinion
that she's having a breakdown.

560
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,789
Are you sure?

561
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,753
This could be the best thing for her.

562
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,111
Spending the rest of her life in prison?

563
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,114
- That's the last thing Deb needs.
- Or the last thing you need.

564
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,749
If Debra goes away,
odds are, you'll join her.

565
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,756
Admit it, Dexter.
You're mostly worried about yourself.

566
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,514
That's not true.

567
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,073
I told you, I love her.

568
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,720
Not the same way she loves you.

569
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,430
When Debra killed LaGuerta,
it was real, selfless love.

570
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,031
She sacrificed
everything she believed in for you.

571
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,958
Can you see that?

572
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,280
Your sister needs professional help.
There's nothing more you can do.

573
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,997
Well, I can't just give up on her.

574
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,313
I can't.

575
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,631
Dex, hey. Dr. Vogel.

576
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,038
She's an old friend of Deb's and Dad,
so I figured she could help.

577
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,396
- Is she still in the interrogation room?
- Yeah.

578
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,678
- Have you told anyone what she said?
- Course not. It's crazy, right?

579
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,990
She's going through something.

580
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,920
She's likely suffering
from posttraumatic stress disorder...

581
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,794
- ...after Captain LaGuerta's death.
- She wasn't even there.

582
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,674
One of the most common components
is survivor's guilt...

583
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,356
...the belief that she could have
somehow prevented what happened.

584
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,797
- That's what I was telling her.
- Not an uncommon response.

585
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,236
We have to get her out of here.

586
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,877
What the fuck are you doing here?

587
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,360
Watch the hallway.

588
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,596
Deb, this is Dr. Vogel.
She was a friend of Dad's.

589
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,240
You can trust her. She can help.

590
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,751
- Hello, Debra.
- I don't give a fuck who you are.

591
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,149
Get the fuck out.

592
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,876
Debra, I know how much pain
you must be feeling.

593
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,034
But we need to talk about this before
you do something you might regret.

594
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,356
Regret?

595
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,160
The thing that I regret
happened six months ago.

596
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,199
I'm confessing everything.
I'm telling the whole fucking truth!

597
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,158
There's nothing you can do
to stop me!

598
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,118
- Deb, please, let us--
- Quinn, let me--

599
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,350
- That was interesting.
- Here. Hold this.

600
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,995
She passed out.

601
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,439
We must take her home to rest.

602
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,235
Let's get her out of here.

603
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,593
Is she gonna be okay?

604
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,234
Absolutely.

605
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,115
There may be some work to do,
but I promise...

606
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,516
...Debra's gonna get through this.

607
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,949
- Is there anything else you need?
- Not right now.

608
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,720
Thanks for calling.
You did the right thing.

609
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,394
What the fuck?

610
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,151
Are you sure she'll be all right,
with everything she has in her system?

611
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,154
Physically, she's fine.
It was a very low dose.

612
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,553
But emotionally....

613
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,554
This is all my fault.

614
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,680
Go easy on yourself.

615
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,951
I should have listened to you.

616
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,999
I thought I could fix this,
but you're right. I can't.

617
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,993
I don't want to just keep
making her worse.

618
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,992
Do you really think you can help her?

619
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,234
Yes.

620
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,394
Okay.

621
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,914
Go now.

622
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,234
Let me do what I do.

623
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,559
Wait.

624
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,554
Dexter, what are you doing?

625
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,720
She's gonna be pissed
when she wakes up...

626
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,994
- ...maybe even violent.
- I can handle her.

627
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,675
You don't know my sister.

628
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,874
Thanks.

629
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,560
<i>Vogel was right.</i>

630
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,159
<i>I am perfect.</i>

631
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,033
<i>But only at one thing.</i>

632
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,958
You disgusting...

633
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,470
...cannibal.

634
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,559
Consumer of human flesh.

635
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,034
There was a time when I couldn't
imagine anyone being what you are...

636
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,872
...and doing what you do.

637
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,190
But now I realise I'm just like you.

638
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,200
I consume everyone I love.
