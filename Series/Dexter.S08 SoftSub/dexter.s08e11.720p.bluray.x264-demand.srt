1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,749
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,310
Harrison and I are
leaving Miami with Hannah.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,312
You act like this
doesn't even affect me.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,556
You can visit.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,076
I'll look you up
the next time I'm in Argentina.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,074
So you any closer
in your search for Saxon?

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,590
I wish we could just leave.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,160
I still have feelings for you.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,959
I used to feel like something
was holding me back.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,634
- Now?
- Now, I--

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,755
I want you to help me
like you helped Dexter.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,480
- I'll find a way.
- What about Dexter? He's still after me.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,716
I'll talk to Dexter.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,360
You don't think he likes killing.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,950
Let me show you how much
he doesn't like killing.

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,793
<i>No!</i>

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,077
That's Zach's head
he's sawing into.

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,357
I'd like to be a part of the team
on this one.

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,399
Thanks, but the Marshal Service
doesn't take on partners.

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,279
Looking for a new forensic tech?

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,875
- Dexter's moving on.
- Really?

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,509
It just struck me as odd
that he's leaving town...

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,320
...at the same time
Hannah McKay is rumoured to be here.

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,234
If Dexter were dating Hannah McKay,
I would know about it.

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,676
Deputy Marshal Clayton
thinks Dexter's hiding you.

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,314
Oh, God.

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,392
- What happened?
- He fell and hit his chin.

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,631
It's a deep cut.
It won't stop bleeding.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,872
Hello, Dexter.
Mother chose the wrong son.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,598
Evelyn?

31
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,629
<i>Vogel warned me
I've been straddling two worlds...</i>

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,076
<i>...and I ignored her.</i>

33
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,478
<i>For that, she paid the price
with her life.</i>

34
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,030
<i>Now I have to remove myself
from her life.</i>

35
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,834
<i>I never imagined the last homicide
I'd work would be one I'm now a part of.</i>

36
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,750
<i>I have to call this in.</i>

37
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,878
<i>I can't be seen
leaving the scene of the crime.</i>

38
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,550
<i>The last time I was in a pool
of my mother's blood...</i>

39
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,076
<i>...I was too young
to do anything about it.</i>

40
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,118
<i>But I'm no longer a child.</i>

41
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,920
She didn't say
why she wanted me to stop by.

42
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,312
The two of you were friends?
Your father knew her, right?

43
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,194
Yeah, she reached out
to both Deb and me.

44
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,039
She was a good person.

45
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,953
So you pull up to the house.

46
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,318
- You see the door kicked in--
- And I ran in. That's when I found her.

47
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,470
You moved the body?

48
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,757
Yes.

49
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,754
I tried to stem the bleeding,
but she was already gone.

50
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,479
Did you see anybody suspicious?

51
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,552
Miller was talking to the neighbours.

52
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,280
One of them saw a white male
in his 40s take off...

53
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,399
...in a white or grey pickup.

54
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,119
- Which is it?
- It was dark.

55
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,431
That's the best
they could make out.

56
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,394
Give Miller a hand,
and canvass the whole block.

57
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,758
Updates every half hour.
The media's gonna be all over this.

58
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,434
Okay.

59
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,199
- You should go.
- No, I can help.

60
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,033
Dex.

61
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,793
As much as I could use
the hand...

62
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,155
...a defence attorney
would have a field day...

63
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,159
...with a forensic tech
who not only found a murder...

64
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,953
...but knew the victim
and then worked it.

65
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,476
We gotta protect the case here.

66
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,676
So I'll see you first thing
in the morning.

67
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,077
Last day on the job.

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,119
Last day.

69
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,839
- I should--
- Go. We got this.

70
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,076
All right.

71
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,392
<i>Saxon may have a head start,
but I intend to catch up.</i>

72
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,914
Jesus, what are you doing here
so early?

73
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,315
Is Harrison with Hannah?

74
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,676
Yeah, she's helping him
get dressed in my room.

75
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,991
That kid wakes
before the fucking sun.

76
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,193
You all right?

77
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,036
Evelyn's dead.

78
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,593
Saxon killed her last night
in front of me.

79
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,350
He got away.

80
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,958
- Fuck.
- I wanted you to hear it from me.

81
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,120
Miami Metro is working the case.
It's all over the news.

82
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,877
Jesus Christ. You all right?

83
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,036
- Evelyn was....
- I know.

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,195
If it weren't for her--

85
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,795
We might not have found
our way back to each other.

86
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,640
If Saxon's out there...

87
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,396
...Harrison needs to be with Jamie.

88
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,878
She's back at Batista's.
He'll be safe there.

89
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,000
Are you gonna go after Saxon?

90
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,272
Yes.

91
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,031
Then I will too. I'll call Batista.

92
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,634
I'll go back to work today.

93
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,393
She was important to me too, Dex.

94
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,951
You're putting yourself in the same
position you've been trying to avoid.

95
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,558
Understand this: if I get Saxon my way,
I'm not handing him over to you.

96
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,599
Daddy, I combed my hair.

97
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,679
I see that.

98
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,115
He insisted.

99
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,796
I think Jamie's gonna be really
impressed. Go grab your backpack.

100
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,317
- She's waiting for us at the apartment.
- I'll help you.

101
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,594
Don't tell her
I already had a doughnut.

102
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,752
- What's this?
- I booked our itinerary.

103
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,640
The three of us fly to Rio.
When we get to South America...

104
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,235
...we catch a flight to Buenos Aires.

105
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,517
And no one can trace us.

106
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,036
That's still the plan, right?

107
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,394
Yeah.

108
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,677
- But....
- What?

109
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,992
Dr. Vogel's dead.
Saxon killed her.

110
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,471
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

111
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,313
This doesn't change anything
for us...

112
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,354
...but I need to make sure
it's taken care of before we leave.

113
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,160
You think you can
take care of it that fast?

114
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,997
Yes.

115
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,836
<i>Two days left in Miami.</i>

116
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,077
<i>Two days to find Saxon.</i>

117
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,516
<i>Two days until I start
a new life with Hannah.</i>

118
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,478
Good news.

119
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,429
I already have five people
coming by to see your place today.

120
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,795
That was fast.

121
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,998
Market's coming back.
And with a location like yours...

122
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,073
...I wouldn't be surprised
if we end up with five offers.

123
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,631
I really appreciate you taking
the listing on such short notice, Syl.

124
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,918
Course.
I was happy to get the call.

125
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,353
Oh, Harrison's gotten so big.

126
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,159
Yeah.

127
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,473
So why the sudden move?

128
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,631
Too many memories.

129
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,395
I understand.

130
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,631
After Miguel....

131
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,070
I downsized.
Focused on the kids.

132
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,279
Oh, make that six people
coming by.

133
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,596
I should take this.

134
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,359
Okay.

135
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,794
You put monkey in a box.

136
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,792
Oh, sorry about that.

137
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,638
God, seeing your place all boxed up
is making this so real.

138
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,230
You guys are really going.

139
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,631
Harrison is gonna miss you.

140
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,315
Monkey's gonna miss you too.

141
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,836
Hey, why don't you take
Harrison overnight?

142
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,238
Deb's place is so cramped, and people
are gonna be in and out of here.

143
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,629
And that way, you can--

144
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,237
Hug my favourite person
in the whole wide world all night long!

145
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,959
Stop!

146
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,990
All right.

147
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,436
- This one.
- This one, oh.

148
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,599
Oh, yeah. Looks pretty.

149
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,549
I'd like to get her inland
before Laura hits.

150
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,076
- Laura?
- Tropical Storm Laura.

151
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,358
They say she'll make landfall
in a few days.

152
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,556
She's a 2001 Century 2901
centre console.

153
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,916
I had this custom rail put in.

154
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,600
New paint.

155
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,471
Has a radar, GPS,
fish-finder, autopilot...

156
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,552
...emergency life raft.

157
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,351
And I had these twin Yamaha 250
four-stroke motors put in.

158
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,477
They got just over 400 hours...

159
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,390
...and when you open them up
and you're out there....

160
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,718
There's nothing like it.

161
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,393
Hoping she'd have
a bigger beer cooler.

162
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,634
Well, maybe she's not
the boat for you.

163
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,991
<i>Saxon moves from city to city...</i>

164
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,480
<i>...but his job never changes.</i>

165
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
<i>He inspects buildings.
It's a place to start.</i>

166
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,592
- Good morning.
- Easy for you to say.

167
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,917
You didn't spend the night
scouring Vogel's place...

168
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,549
...with nothing to show for it
except a big goose egg.

169
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,155
Nothing?

170
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,596
See for yourself.

171
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,835
No prints, no trace.

172
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,959
Oh, man, I could go for some hookers
and some blow right now.

173
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,636
But since this isn't the '90s,
caffeine it is.

174
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,837
- Want anything?
- No, I'm good.

175
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,478
<i>This hospital, closed for years.</i>

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,755
<i>Saxon issued a demolition permit,
but it's still standing.</i>

177
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,673
<i>The perfect place to cut
into your victims' skulls.</i>

178
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,231
Hey, Dexter,
Quinn is looking for you.

179
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,193
- Because?
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,080
The swab thing
in the interrogation room.

181
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,040
Okay.

182
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,753
Dex, come in.

183
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,313
Hi, Dexter.

184
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,071
He came in to clear his name
on the Cassie case.

185
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,640
I see.

186
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,520
I had no idea I was a suspect.

187
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,117
We got to your apartment,
and it was totally cleaned out.

188
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,352
You can appreciate how that looks.

189
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,357
I couldn't stay at my old place.

190
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,832
I spent so much time there
with Cassie.

191
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,194
Everywhere I looked,
something reminded me of her.

192
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,238
You can understand that.

193
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,960
You knew Cassie.
She was a great person.

194
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,673
Yes, she was.

195
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,077
For a while...

196
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,520
...I was even thinking
of leaving Miami.

197
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,512
But my business is here...

198
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,479
...my friends, family.

199
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,117
When I heard there was
an alert out for me, I....

200
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,751
I couldn't believe it.
I thought we already resolved this.

201
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,354
We appreciate you coming in.

202
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,716
Like you said,
I just wanna clear my name.

203
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,317
Good. This will help towards that.

204
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,596
What's this?

205
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,150
- DNA sample.
- Is that really necessary?

206
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,394
- You said you wanted to cooperate.
- Open.

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,674
Thanks. We're done here for now.

208
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,993
Hey, you plan on any more moves--

209
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,153
- I'll be sure to let you know.
- Good.

210
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,717
Saxon was just here, trying to
clear his name for Cassie's murder.

211
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,634
He had an answer for everything
Quinn threw at him.

212
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,076
Well, he's got balls, I'll give him that.

213
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,749
Masuka find anything to tie him
to Vogel's crime scene?

214
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,752
He came up empty, but....

215
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,320
What?

216
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,314
- Saxon agreed to a standard.
- Well, so what?

217
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,949
It's not gonna tie him
to Cassie's murder.

218
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,114
But it'll give us a matri-fucking-lineal
match to his mother.

219
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,272
Yeah, suddenly he's no longer
Oliver Saxon.

220
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,080
He's Daniel Vogel,
Dr. Vogel's psychopathic son...

221
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,312
...who died in a fire
at a psychiatric hospital.

222
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,279
Let him try to explain that away
with my boot up his ass.

223
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,951
Let me ask you a question.

224
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,594
Why are you helping us get Saxon?

225
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,312
Don't you want him for yourself?

226
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,030
I just want him taken care of.

227
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,840
Well, that's new coming from you.

228
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,478
I'm gonna go get started on this.

229
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,155
I'm gonna go find some pens.

230
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,954
Hi.

231
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,160
Your Thin Mints are
in the bottom drawer.

232
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,597
It takes supply requisition
like a week to come through, so....

233
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,796
- Right.
- You mind?

234
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,514
By all means, go ahead.

235
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,558
Thanks.

236
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,871
What the fuck is this?

237
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,356
I kept it around
just in case I decided...

238
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,318
...to marry somebody else from work.

239
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,314
You've had this in here
the whole time?

240
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,997
Keep my stapler away from Soderquist.
Guy's a fucking klepto.

241
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,639
<i>Is this old hospital
Saxon's private sanatorium?</i>

242
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,912
Saxon's kill room.

243
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,714
Zach died here.

244
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,116
And who knows how many others?

245
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,675
Doesn't look like
Saxon's been living here.

246
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,399
But he'll be back.

247
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,597
This is clearly a special place
for him.

248
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,195
You can stake out the building,
wait for him.

249
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,079
I don't have time to wait.

250
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,072
Hannah and I
don't have time to wait.

251
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,709
- I want him dead.
- By your hand.

252
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,111
Anyone's hand,
as long as he's dead.

253
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,791
That doesn't sound
like the old Dexter.

254
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,395
Maybe I'm not the old Dexter.

255
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,754
Everything Saxon downloaded
about me from Vogel's computer...

256
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,071
...is on this.

257
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,795
He recorded all his kills.

258
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,998
They're all here.

259
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,954
But you still don't know
where he is.

260
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,794
Maybe this is exactly what I need.

261
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,437
I can bring him to me.

262
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,398
Hey.

263
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,359
You calling it quits soon?

264
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,954
Yeah, I will soon.

265
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,271
I just wanna get up to speed
on a couple things.

266
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,238
Going to Dr. Vogel's memorial
tomorrow?

267
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,959
I know she helped you
get through a lot.

268
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,318
- Yeah, I'll be there.
- Need a ride, let me know.

269
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,357
Swung by Elway's.
He said you were back on the force.

270
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,399
Yeah. It's my first day back.
I'm kind of swamped.

271
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,392
What can I help you with,
deputy marshal?

272
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,836
I was hoping you could
clear something up for me.

273
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,231
- I'm just following up on a lead.
- Shoot.

274
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,120
A blond woman matching
Hannah McKay's description...

275
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,478
...walked into urgent care with
a young boy named Harrison Morgan...

276
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,313
...said she was his mother.

277
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,791
The weird part is
she gave your name and address.

278
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,593
My nephew's been staying with me...

279
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,792
...since Dexter put his condo
on the market.

280
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,670
He busted his chin, and I took him in
to get him stitched up.

281
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,752
So you took him to urgent care?

282
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,311
I told the woman at the desk I was
his aunt, but maybe she didn't hear me.

283
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,671
Still, she looked at my photo
of Hannah McKay...

284
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,513
...and swore
that's who brought him in.

285
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,911
Then she needs to get
her fucking eyes checked...

286
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,438
...because I haven't been blond
since a very bad freshman year.

287
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,195
Right, okay.
Well, look, you know what it's like.

288
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,159
I gotta check out all the leads,
even the crazy ones, right?

289
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,549
Sure.

290
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,800
All right, welcome back, detective.
I'll be in touch.

291
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,677
I'll be here.

292
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,913
Not much turnout. I guess
she didn't have many family or friends.

293
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,231
Yeah, just the son
who slit her throat.

294
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,319
Think Saxon's watching?

295
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,512
I would be.

296
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,440
Thank you, everyone, for coming.
I know most of you...

297
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,718
...didn't know Evelyn very well, but....

298
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,520
- It was a nice service.
- Yeah.

299
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,672
It's important to remember
those no longer with us.

300
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,354
Yeah.

301
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,476
Now, who wants a drink?

302
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,794
Christ. I'll be right back.

303
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,514
You know they're really
gonna miss you, right?

304
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,992
I know.

305
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,077
Maybe you should go in there and
pretend you're gonna miss them too.

306
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,749
It's your last day, you know?

307
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,880
<i>It's no longer pretend.</i>

308
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,590
Well, gain a Morgan,
lose a Morgan.

309
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,631
Harry would have been proud
of the two of you.

310
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,152
Thank you, sir.

311
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,951
I want you to know both of you
have been like family to me.

312
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,956
And, Dexter, if you ever need anything
or decide you wanna come back...

313
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,679
...this will always be your home.

314
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,671
I appreciate that.

315
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,032
So let me buy you another round.

316
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,318
- I should probably get going.
- Oh, nonsense.

317
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,876
For the next six hours,
you're still working for me.

318
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,999
You're not going anywhere.
That's an order. Come on.

319
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,795
Okay, missy, what's your poison?

320
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,150
I'll have a Diet Coke.

321
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,198
A beer for me. Thanks.

322
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,831
Well, that's a little tame.

323
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,271
Really? Are you gonna go there?

324
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,318
Well, if you put it that way, no.

325
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,040
Okay, you were all up in my shit
about a bong rip...

326
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,318
...but I don't know if you've noticed,
but we're in a bar.

327
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,392
Look, I'm sorry
about the whole pot thing.

328
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,110
You know, this whole father-daughter
thing is still kind of new, you know?

329
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,397
Yeah, I know. It's cool.

330
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,431
Everybody's really excited about
your sister being back on the force.

331
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,839
Yeah, she told me
that you two might be...

332
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,719
...back in each other's lives.

333
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,318
You okay with that?

334
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,151
Deb likes you, and with me gone....

335
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,874
I don't want her to be alone.

336
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,677
I want her to be with someone
who makes her happy.

337
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,075
That's all I ever wanted to do.

338
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,152
I'm okay with that.

339
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,992
I gotta take this.

340
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,915
- Hey, Syl, what's up?
- Dex, I'm so glad I caught you.

341
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,596
I know it's last-minute but I've got
somebody who wants to see the place...

342
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,789
<i>...wants to meet the seller,
and he's ready to make an offer, cash.</i>

343
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,794
- Give me half an hour.
<i>- Perfect.</i>

344
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,080
You remember
the first case we worked?

345
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,071
Husband, wife, lots of blood.

346
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,038
I'd never seen anything like it.

347
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,193
The strings. The look on your face.

348
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,033
You were like a pig in shit.

349
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,433
Thanks, I think.

350
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,113
Not sure what this place
is gonna be like without you.

351
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,752
You're a good friend, Angel.

352
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,640
I'm glad to hear you say that.

353
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,632
So you'll forgive me for this.

354
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,520
All right, everybody!
Everybody, come on, gather around.

355
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,960
Gather around. I know that
this is a solemn occasion.

356
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,949
But since somebody didn't
let me throw him a party...

357
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,150
...let's let this be it.

358
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,920
Dexter Morgan may be leaving
the Miami Metro <i>familia...</i>

359
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,109
...but he will always be
right here in our hearts.

360
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,832
To Dexter.

361
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,678
We wish you and Harrison luck
in whatever comes next.

362
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,036
- To Dexter.
- To Dexter.

363
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,511
Thank you. Thank you.

364
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,556
I'll miss you guys too.

365
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,917
Dexter.

366
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,398
This is Oliver Saxon.

367
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,594
<i>Again.</i>

368
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,556
He responded to the listing and was
hoping to take a look at the place.

369
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,956
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.

370
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,600
You'll have to excuse the mess.

371
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,594
No problem. They say moving's
one of the big causes of stress.

372
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,229
Almost as much as divorce.
And death.

373
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,957
Why don't you follow me?

374
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,598
So it's a one bedroom, one bathroom,
but it has an attached--

375
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,316
Would you mind if Dexter showed me?
I like to hear directly from the owner.

376
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,119
No sales pitch.

377
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,909
Sure.

378
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,636
I have a few phone calls to return.
I'll be outside.

379
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,512
I always did like this place.

380
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,438
You have the same view Cassie did.

381
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,557
What are you doing here?

382
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,672
I have a proposal.

383
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,833
Figured the safest way
to deliver it was to bring a referee.

384
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,998
I'm listening.

385
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,992
We walk away.

386
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,834
- Walk away?
- Both of us.

387
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,279
From each other.

388
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,000
Go our separate paths,
live our separate lives.

389
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,237
I forget about you.

390
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,914
You forget about me.

391
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,234
You went out of your way
to kill your mother in front of me...

392
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,153
...and you just expect me to forget?

393
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,232
May have been
a little bit over-the-top...

394
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,278
...but I was only trying
to make a point.

395
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,237
I missed the point.

396
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,553
It was a test to see if,
given the chance...

397
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,956
...she would finally choose me.

398
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,239
Well, we both know
how that turned out.

399
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,593
Yeah, so naturally,
you had to cut her throat.

400
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,878
You know what it's like. The kill.

401
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,679
It can be cathartic.

402
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,718
And it was.

403
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,349
That's why
I'm giving you a choice.

404
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,399
Go on with your life,
or come after me.

405
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,636
But choose poorly, like Mom...

406
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,152
...and you will lose.

407
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,315
You seem pretty sure of yourself.

408
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,592
You have a lot more to lose
than I do.

409
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,077
You've created the perfect cover life.

410
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,831
Cute little son, your sister.

411
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,511
Stepkids even.

412
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,914
And now you have a girlfriend.
It's Hannah, right?

413
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,790
<i>They're not a cover.
They're real to me.</i>

414
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,713
<i>Something Saxon can't understand.</i>

415
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,191
All very lovely.

416
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,797
And all very easy
to remove from your life.

417
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,473
I mean, you've already had
one wife murdered.

418
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,677
That must be an interesting story.

419
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,715
But it's gonna put you
in a very awkward position...

420
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,396
...if everyone else starts
disappearing from your life.

421
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,872
The choice is yours.

422
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,195
Yeah, I think I can live with that.

423
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,554
I'll let Mrs. Prado know
I've put an offer on the table.

424
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,757
<i>He wants me to walk away
without realising...</i>

425
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,680
<i>...he's just reminded me why I can't.</i>

426
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,153
So, what's so urgent?

427
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,633
I've got a line on Hannah McKay, but
I'm gonna need your help reeling her in.

428
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,998
- I thought you didn't want my help.
- Been looking at the wrong Morgan.

429
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,318
I think your former employee
has her holed up in her place.

430
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,634
Deb is no fan of Hannah McKay.

431
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,190
Yeah, but you said she'd
do anything for her brother.

432
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,119
Helping McKay is helping him.

433
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,358
I just need you to talk to her,
take a look around.

434
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,359
Look, Deb and I didn't exactly part
on the best of terms.

435
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,671
If you're still interested
in that reward...

436
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,719
...I suggest you find a way
to patch things up with her.

437
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,230
Hey.

438
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,798
Just trying to make our last
few days in Miami special, you know?

439
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,191
I hope you like dolmas.

440
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,189
I'm just trying to keep myself busy.

441
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,952
You should go on one
of those cooking shows.

442
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,351
The competition ones. You'd win.

443
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,910
Oh, I'd make sure that I did.

444
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,515
- It's Elway.
- Bedroom.

445
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,430
What's up, Elway?

446
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,071
Security left a couple of your
personal items back in the office.

447
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,471
Just a couple pictures and a hat.

448
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,752
You didn't have to bring them
over here. I could've picked them up.

449
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,230
Well, I actually wanted
to talk to you.

450
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,518
- May I?
- Actually, now is not a very good time.

451
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,512
It'll just take a minute.

452
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,560
I wanted to apologise
about the way I behaved when you left.

453
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,279
Don't worry about it.

454
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,238
No, no, I was a real asshole.

455
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,711
I let my ego get the best of me,
and I don't want to leave it like that.

456
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,190
I-- Well, I want us
to be friends, you know?

457
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,317
Great. Well, then we're good.

458
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,800
Now you're back on the force.

459
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,560
Maybe you and I can do
each other the occasional favour.

460
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,439
Yeah, we'll keep in touch.

461
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,520
You--

462
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,114
You expecting company?

463
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,590
I sure am, and I actually need
to get ready. So....

464
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,510
I guess the police department is
paying better than I remember.

465
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,350
Hey, Elway, I really appreciate that
apology, but I've got a lot of shit to do.

466
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,677
Could you kindly get
the fuck out of my house?

467
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,672
Yeah.

468
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,759
- He's gone, but he's onto you.
- Oh, shit.

469
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,958
The deputy marshal won't be far
behind. You've gotta move fast.

470
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,200
Hello?

471
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,875
Dex, we have a problem.
Elway was just here.

472
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,680
- Elway?
<i>- He was dropping by to talk with Deb...</i>

473
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,669
...but she's sure he was looking for me.
She thinks that he knows that I'm here.

474
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,750
Stay there.

475
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,440
Okay.

476
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,157
I tried to get an earlier flight,
but it's booked because of the storm.

477
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,953
I'm getting out of here right now.

478
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,032
She's gonna stay at a hotel
near the airport until your flight.

479
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,756
- Saxon came to my apartment.
- What? Why the fuck didn't you call me?

480
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,357
It happened very fast.
He said he wanted to offer me a truce.

481
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,115
- A truce?
- Really it was just a veiled threat.

482
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,432
He threatened you, Harrison,
Astor and Cody, and you.

483
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,512
I can handle
whatever he throws at me.

484
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,558
- You should go with Hannah.
- Yes.

485
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,713
I deposited my money into an offshore
account. We can access it immediately.

486
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,270
The storm coming
is gonna ground all the flights.

487
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,239
- Saxon isn't gonna follow us.
- What if he does?

488
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,798
I get it. I get that this is something
you feel like you have to do...

489
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,031
- ...this is who you are--
- It's not who I wanna be.

490
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,994
I have to do this first.
There's no other way.

491
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,833
I will be there.

492
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,591
I guess this is goodbye.

493
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,073
For now.

494
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,631
I can't not see
my brother and my nephew.

495
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,875
Now you're a part of that package.

496
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,598
Well, not anything I ever saw coming.

497
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,116
For what it's worth, I think Dexter's
making a mistake going after Saxon.

498
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,795
I think he should be here
with you now.

499
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,550
Have you ever known him
to be able to walk away...

500
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,871
...from something
once he's started it?

501
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,713
That's life with Dexter.
That's who he is.

502
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,792
It's like having a whole other
person in the relationship.

503
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,353
I must really love this man.

504
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,272
Me too.

505
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,870
Even when I don't want to.

506
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,477
Take care of them.

507
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,271
Yeah, I will.

508
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,238
<i>Saxon wants to make Miami
his home.</i>

509
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,915
<i>Little does he know
how hot the summers can get.</i>

510
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,353
<i>And once everyone sees the footage
of him as the Brain Surgeon...</i>

511
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,159
<i>...the heat will be unbearable.</i>

512
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,994
You know, he's not just gonna
walk away from that.

513
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,799
Exactly.

514
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,077
I'm drawing him to me.

515
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,914
So I guess you're not gonna
accept his offer.

516
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,879
Did you believe him,
that he's willing to disengage?

517
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,077
You clearly don't.

518
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,551
He came into my house
and threatened my family.

519
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,718
Now you're sounding like
the old Dexter again.

520
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,993
No, this is a different kind of kill.

521
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,396
Dead is dead, Dex.

522
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,711
It didn't used to matter
who was on my table...

523
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,912
...as long as someone was, but now--

524
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,116
It's personal.

525
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,679
It's been personal for a long time.

526
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,675
And that need you used to feel?

527
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,271
It's still there, somewhere.

528
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,711
But since Hannah came into my life...

529
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,520
...it's lessened.

530
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,637
What I need...

531
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,032
...is her.

532
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,749
So when you get to Argentina,
what happens?

533
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,154
I don't know.

534
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,715
But I can't wait to find out.

535
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,231
Sorry. Dad said you were
waiting for this DNA stuff?

536
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
Tell your dad thanks.

537
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,236
It's so weird Masuka's your father.

538
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,392
Weird awesome.

539
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,360
You're not gonna fucking
believe this.

540
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,192
Saxon is related to Vogel.
He's her son.

541
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,559
You're kidding me.

542
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,279
I thought all her family was dead.

543
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,596
You think this fucker killed
his mother along with Cassie?

544
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,190
What are you doing here?

545
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,840
Starving.

546
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,239
Saxon's DNA came back,
so they put out a warrant for his arrest.

547
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,756
Miami Metro knows
that Saxon is Vogel's son...

548
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,351
...and Elway and Clayton have
no idea where Hannah is.

549
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,911
This is your last night in Miami,
and we are having dinner together.

550
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,076
Even though you've already
packed up your kitchen.

551
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,277
You wanna help me find
a plate and some pans?

552
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,909
- I'm really not hungry.
- The next time we do this...

553
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,754
...it's gonna be
fucking tacos and tequila.

554
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,037
Or whatever the fuck they eat
in Argentina.

555
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,796
Yeah, it'll probably be steaks.
It's Argentina, not Mexico.

556
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,633
Deb, you shouldn't be here.

557
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,031
Bullshit. Do you remember
where you put the pans?

558
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,879
Listen to me. You can't be here.

559
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,550
Why?

560
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,110
- What the fuck is going on?
- I'm expecting company.

561
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,079
Saxon.

562
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,309
Just leave him to me.
And I mean leave.

563
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,880
After everything you've been through,
I don't want--

564
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,474
Listen to me.

565
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,196
Nothing, and I mean nothing...

566
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,320
...is gonna stand in the way of me
having one more night with my brother.

567
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,830
Now, are you gonna help me
find that fucking skillet or what?

568
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,639
This place has been wiped clean.

569
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,230
Almost clean. Look at this.

570
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,030
The last site someone visited on this
computer was for an Aero Sudamerica.

571
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,954
Any specific details?
Did she book a flight?

572
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,238
If she did, it's not here.
But I'll tell you what I can do.

573
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,796
Access manifests for flights
in the next few days...

574
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,111
...cross-check those names
with passport photos.

575
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,471
- Not exactly legal.
- Are you saying don't do it?

576
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,633
I'm not saying anything. While you do
whatever you're gonna do...

577
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,360
...I'm gonna tail the Morgans,
see if they'll lead me to her.

578
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,352
Done and done.

579
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,798
How are Astor and Cody
doing with the move?

580
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,960
They're better now that I told them
they could come down for Christmas...

581
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,033
...and that Astor could have my SUV.

582
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,274
You think you could drive it up to her?
She asked about you.

583
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,797
Yeah, as soon as the storm passes.

584
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,350
They're saying it might
turn into a hurricane.

585
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,871
It's one of the few things
I won't miss about Florida.

586
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,238
God, this is such a mindfuck.

587
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,556
After tomorrow, you're not gonna be
here. What the fuck does that look like?

588
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,358
We both start over.

589
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,031
Is that even possible?

590
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,000
Yeah, I think so.

591
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,153
Don't you?

592
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,393
It's just every fucked up--

593
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,880
Every time I've been a complete mess,
you've been there for me.

594
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,840
Even when it was your fault
that I was fucked up...

595
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,117
...you've never given up on me.

596
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,509
So if I can't make this work...

597
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,231
...going back to being a cop again,
then who the fuck is gonna help me...

598
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,392
...pick up the pieces of that?

599
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,120
You're not that person anymore.

600
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,112
You're stronger than that.

601
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,715
You're stronger than I'll ever be.

602
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,758
I'm not.

603
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,391
Deb, Dad and Vogel
gave me the code...

604
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,678
...so I'd know the right thing to do,
but you've always...

605
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,156
...just known.

606
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,312
It's the compass
I always wished I had.

607
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,200
And as long as you listen to that...

608
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,317
...you won't need me.

609
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,113
You'll be fine.

610
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,319
Maybe.

611
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,790
But don't ever think
that it was the code...

612
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,350
...that made you a good brother.

613
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,074
There's a human being in there.

614
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,355
There always has been.

615
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,200
Even if you can't see it.

616
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,080
<i>Miami Metro is seeking the public's help

620
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,994
Did you help them
recently obtain that footage?

621
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,039
I needed him to be a wanted man
and force his hand.

622
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,916
If he wants to take a last stab at me,
now he has to do it tonight.

623
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,600
Which I why I need you
to get out of here, Deb.

624
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,353
Please.

625
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,319

I'll take it from here.

634
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,120
Thanks, Deb.

635
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,312
Welcome home.

636
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,390
I guess this means you've
decided against the truce.

637
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,916
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

638
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,316
It's your own fault.

639
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,518
You should've walked away,
left Miami when you could.

640
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,200
I like this place. Miami's a great city.

641
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,910
I love the Cuban food.
Nice weather.

642
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,039
Murder solve rate
at about 20 percent.

643
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,918
Yeah.

644
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,437
I understand.

645
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,116
There was a time
I wasn't willing to leave either.

646
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,397
I didn't wanna give up anything.

647
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,389
Sounds like something's changed.

648
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,399
It has.

649
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,677
Your girlfriend?

650
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,476
Yeah, that's part of it.

651
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,675
I've never been good
at relationships.

652
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,311
Longest was a couple of weeks
and she was chained to my radiator...

653
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,110
- ...so I guess that doesn't much count.
- Not really, no.

654
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,273
Too much anger towards women,
I suppose.

655
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,151
I can thank my mother for that.

656
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,915
No, that's all on you.

657
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,515
Well, I wish you luck.

658
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,718
Hope you don't stab her
in the heart while she sleeps.

659
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,272
No, Oliver, I like her.

660
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,437
I love her.

661
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,875
I think about her all the time.

662
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,630
I'm thinking about her right now.

663
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,440
How I'd rather be with her
than here with you.

664
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,719
What?

665
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,036
This is usually
my favourite moment...

666
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,551
...the kill.

667
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,556
The moment before the kill,
the kill itself...

668
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,757
...the moment right after.

669
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,238
But now I don't even wanna be here.

670
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,513
I'm feeling a much stronger pull.

671
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,756
I don't need to kill you.

672
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,917
Then don't.

673
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,037
Walk away.

674
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,953
I will.

675
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,391
I guess I'll live to see another day.

676
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,069
Oh, no, you're still gonna die.

677
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,356
Just gonna be in the electric chair.

678
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,471
Hey, Deb, change of plans.

679
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,269
Dex.

680
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,511
Saxon's in here.

681
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,637
Arrest him. Take him in.

682
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,235
Arrest him? He's still alive?

683
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,316
Say you were looking into the buildings
he was inspecting. You subdued him.

684
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,040
You'll be the hero of Miami Metro.

685
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,759
I guess I fucking will.

686
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,759
What about your knives?

687
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,276
I've got a plane to catch.

688
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,312
Do you want me
to send them to you?

689
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,996
Leave them as evidence.
Say you found them in the cabinet.

690
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,880
- People will think they're Saxon's.
- Let them.

691
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,680
Give him even more credit
than he deserves.

692
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,912
Once I get settled, I'm gonna figure
out a way to get in touch.

693
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,753
- Dexter--
- My car, I'll leave it at the airport.

694
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,310
- Dexter.
- And--

695
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,119
What?

696
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,996
You could at least fucking hug me.

697
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,989
This is just for right now.
It's not forever.

698
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,396
I know that, fuckface.

699
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,754
Go get on a plane.

700
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,873
I will.

701
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,475
Are you sure about this, Dexter?

702
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,712
I am.

703
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,189
I never thought this day would come.

704
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,551
You don't need me anymore.

705
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,598
This is Debra Morgan
requesting backup...

706
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,912
...at the Rendell Psychiatric Hospital
in Allapattah.

707
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,516
What the fuck is going on here?

708
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,153
Help me, please!

709
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,357
I was abducted by the man
who was just here.

710
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,352
- Did you see him?
- I didn't see anybody.

711
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,115
Get me out of here, please,
before he comes back.

712
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,757
I thought I was gonna die.

713
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,952
Thank God you came here.

714
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,074
Don't move.

715
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,469
This is Detective Debra Morgan.
I've been shot.

716
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,720
Please send help.

717
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,034
<i>I used to live my life at night.</i>

718
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,598
<i>In the shadow of my dark passenger.</i>

719
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,353
<i>I lived in shadows for so long...</i>

720
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,513
<i>...until the dark became my world.</i>

721
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,680
<i>But over time, the people in my life...</i>

722
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,513
<i>...flipped on a light.</i>

723
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,836
<i>At first I was blinded,
it was so bright.</i>

724
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,910
<i>But over the years,
my eyes adjusted...</i>

725
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,151
<i>...and I could see.</i>

726
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,399
<i>And now what's in focus
is my future.</i>

727
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,273
<i>Bright.</i>

728
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,279
<i>Brighter than it's ever been.</i>
