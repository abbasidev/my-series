1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,789
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,880
<i>I've come to believe that the killer
could be one of my former patients.</i>

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,839
He sent both packages to you.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,720
He doesn't know how to find me.
Yet.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,560
Well, I need to get to him
before he gets to me.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,276
I've got my eye on Joey Quinn.
Quinn? There's no way he can pass

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,278
that sergeant exam.
He'll pass.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,076
I stuck my neck out on the line for you,
and you better not fuck this up.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,356
Lieutenant Morgan?

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,079
Is there a problem, officer?

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,840
Well, yes. You're in a car,
drunk, with an open container.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,153
Quinn.
Why did she call you?

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,910
She's a friend. I couldn't say no.
Come on, you used to fuck her.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,079
There is nothing going on
between me and Deb.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,956
I wanna know if there was anything
unusual about my father's death.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,389
He killed himself, Dexter.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,672
<i>Harry walked in on what he created.</i>

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,473
<i>And he couldn't live with himself.</i>

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,716
<i>Trust me when I say</i>

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,872
<i>that there's a place
in this world for your son.</i>

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,554
I told you, you're perfect.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,150
How can you say that when
you know what I've done to Deb?

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,870
Unh!

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,032
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,197
Your sister confessed
to killing LaGuerta.

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,756
What?
I'm telling the whole fucking truth!

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,917
There's nothing you can do
to stop me!

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,239
I thought I could fix this,
but you're right, I can't.

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,875
I just keep making her worse.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,233
Do you really think
you can help her?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,480
Yes.

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,995
Stop!

33
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,399
Do it, Debra. Shoot him.

34
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,595
This is not who you are.

35
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,318
You are a good cop.

36
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,110
You're a good person.
You're not like him.

37
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,070
Put him down!

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,440
It's true.

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,835
Everything she said.

40
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,480
You're a good person.

41
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,231
It's okay. Do what you gotta do.

42
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,000
Dex.

43
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,072
Tell me what you saw.

44
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,439
I don't wanna talk about it.

45
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,109
I brought you here
so we can strip away
the power

46
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,549
this place holds.

47
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,279
Talking's not gonna
change anything.

48
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,314
Neither is continuing to repress
what happened here.

49
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,999
I'm not repressing shit.

50
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,792
And I don't need you to remind me
about what happened here.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,153
You know, Dexter's need to kill was
born in a container much like this one.

52
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,920
And he's been trapped
inside its walls ever since.

53
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,316
As a psychopath,
he will never break free.

54
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,952
But you can, by reliving
the events of that night
over and over.

55
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,230
I killed him.

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,960
I shot Dexter instead
of LaGuerta.
That's what I saw.

57
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,960
Unless you're gonna
handcuff me,
I'd really like to go.

58
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,351
When you shot Dexter,
how'd it make you feel?

59
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,234
Better. Worse.
I don't fucking know.

60
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,955
What does it even matter?
LaGuerta is still dead.

61
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,231
What else could you have done?
Arrest him.

62
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,193
Now your brother's on death row.

63
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,278
We could have run.
Only to be caught.

64
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,075
You go to jail, Dexter gets
the death penalty again.

65
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,875
You've become obsessed
with the life you've taken.

66
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,152
You've forgotten the life you saved.
Of course you defend him.

67
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,592
You created him.
You're using him
to track a serial killer.

68
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,757
This isn't about Dexter
or me.

69
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,758
This is about you getting better.

70
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,475
Maybe I don't wanna get better.
I don't believe that.

71
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,960
Why the fuck should I even trust you?
Why the motherfuck do you even care?

72
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,915
Are you upset?

73
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,035
Yes, I am.

74
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,396
Good.

75
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,479
At least you're no longer
avoiding your feelings.

76
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,274
We're done for now.

77
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,839
For today.

78
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,960
<i>There are countless ways</i>

79
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,755
<i>to inflict physical trauma
on the human body,</i>

80
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,079
<i>and sometimes the deadliest wounds
are the ones we barely see.</i>

81
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,312
<i>They run deep,</i>

82
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080
<i>like the ones I've inflicted on Deb.</i>

83
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,430
What are we looking at?

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,390
Well, most of the blows
are to her face.

85
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,115
There's some bruising
around the neck.

86
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,791
It doesn't look like
there was a struggle.

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,912
No signs of a break-in.

88
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,431
Yeah, given the lack
of defensive wounds

89
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,991
and the close proximity
of her attacker,

90
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,113
I'd say you're looking
for someone she knew.

91
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,551
We have a name?
Norma Rivera.

92
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,831
Landlord said she lived here
by herself.

93
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,590
Got off the phone with the employer.
Housekeeper in Biscayne Bay.

94
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,632
Nice zip code.
Yeah.

95
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,277
Um, they said she had an ex in and
out of her life, Roberto Sagastume.

96
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,156
Me and Miller can
swing by his place.
He had a record.

97
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,033
It's good to see you taking initiative,

98
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,873
like any good sergeant should.

99
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yo.

100
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,519
You got my test back?

101
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,995
You nailed it, bro.

102
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,914
Oh.

103
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,280
Wipe that grin off your face
before Miller sees it.

104
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,191
Yeah, I've just never been
this happy to get back
a positive test, you know?

105
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,040
What does my sister see in you?
Before I forget

106
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,960
there was this hottie
asking for you at the station.

107
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,675
And you seem surprised,
why?

108
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,759
Said she'd come by later.
They always come back for more.

109
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,351
Hey. Any word on Deb?

110
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,792
Yeah, Dr. Vogel says
she's still day-to-day.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,311
Let her know I was thinking about her.
I will.

112
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,237
She's gonna be okay.

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,076
<i>Opening shop. A run.</i>

114
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,955
<i>Caffeine. All morning routines.</i>

115
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,197
<i>But lately, mine consists
of coming here,</i>

116
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,676
<i>waiting for the woman
I left my sister with</i>

117
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,076
<i>to do what I couldn't,
make Deb whole again.</i>

118
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,397
Thank you.
How is she?

119
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,190
Well, you still remain
the focal point
of your sister's pain.

120
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,476
I wanna see her.

121
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,830
I think it's better

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,354
you keep your distance
for now.

123
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,712
It's been almost a week.
Dexter, I am still not sure

124
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,197
if your sister
has hit rock bottom yet.

125
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,279
What is it?

126
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,036
I just want you to prepare
for the possibility

127
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,358
that Debra may never be able
to have you back in her life.

128
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,715
No.

129
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,397
I won't just let her go.

130
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,957
So have you had better luck
with our killer?

131
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,315
I crossed off three more
former patients from your book.

132
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,840
Who's next on the list?

133
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,110
Chapter seven.

134
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,760
A.J. Yates.

135
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,750
I'll check back in
once I check him out.

136
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,959
<i>A.J. Yates.</i>

137
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,355
<i>According to Vogel's book,
he attacked a classmate</i>

138
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,472
<i>with a chair at 12.</i>

139
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,679
<i>Institutionalised at 15.</i>

140
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,994
<i>Seems Vogel tried to channel
his violent tendencies</i>

141
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
<i>but he was beyond her help.</i>

142
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,554
<i>Eventually, he was transferred
to another hospital.</i>

143
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,192
<i>Now Yates seems to be
a productive member of society.</i>

144
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,239
<i>He's a bundler.
Cable, phone, Internet.</i>

145
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,837
<i>But I need to know if murder
is part of the package.</i>

146
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,040
<i>There's nothing here.</i>

147
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,631
<i>Nothing in Vogel's notes
about brain surgery.</i>

148
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,434
<i>His scar.</i>

149
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,999
<i>Is that the mark of one of her
unconventional methods?</i>

150
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,234
Thanks for letting me use the treadmill.
Better you than me.

151
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,113
I'm not much for running in place.

152
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,199
Is that your shrink way
of saying that I have been?

153
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,598
Is it? Care for some tea?

154
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,271
How about something stronger?

155
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,552
Come on, I just ran four miles.
What's one beer?

156
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,875
The drinks and the drugs
were keeping you numb,

157
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,914
making the symptoms
of your PTSD worse.

158
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,237
Ass off the table.

159
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,638
How long are you
expecting me to stay here?

160
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,473
I see a lot of your father in you.

161
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,757
Harry wrestled with the same
doubts regarding Dexter.

162
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,040
You're not as alone
as you might think.

163
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,637
<i>Honestly, I don't see
what the problem is.</i>

164
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,395
<i>He had everything laid out
on his bedroom floor.</i>

165
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,872
<i>Dexter saw in the paper
how this guy got off
on a technicality</i>

166
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,992
<i>so he was stalking him,
vetting him.</i>

167
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,272
<i>Even found a kill room in
an abandoned house near the park.</i>

168
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,840
<i>Just how we taught him.</i>

169
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,554
<i>What did you tell Dexter?</i>

170
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,480
<i>That this guy was too high-profile,
he'd be missed,</i>

171
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,831
<i>and that Dexter
would have to wait.</i>

172
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,191
<i>He went along with my decision.</i>

173
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,595
<i>For now.</i>

174
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,717
<i>Is this ever gonna be right?
What we've done?</i>

175
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,119
<i>I mean, Dexter isn't a kid anymore.
He's becoming a man.</i>

176
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,274
<i>He's gonna kill.</i>

177
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,631
<i>We knew that day was coming.</i>

178
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,520
<i>But what happens
when I finally tell him it's okay?</i>

179
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,913
<i>When he finally knows what it's like
to take another person's life?</i>

180
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,715
<i>The code will do
what it was designed to do.</i>

181
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,197
<i>Allow Dexter to be
who he was meant to be.</i>

182
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,920
<i>But what if it doesn't?</i>

183
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,272
<i>What if the code doesn't keep him
in check? What then?</i>

184
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,160
<i>What if this has all been
some horrible mistake?</i>

185
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,710
Obviously, Harry
came around when he realised

186
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,037
what else could he have done?

187
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,875
Locked Dexter away
in an institution?

188
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,794
Or do nothing
until he took an innocent life?

189
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,076
Or protect your brother,

190
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,756
giving him the tools
that he would need

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,276
to channel his urges.

192
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,800
The same way
you protected Dexter
in that container.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,593
It's not the same. You're wrong.

194
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,116
Deb.
I can't just accept it.

195
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,510
I'm not like him. I'm not like you.

196
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,157
Dexter-- Dex--
Dexter is fucking Dexter.

197
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,838
Debra, Harry did not
make a mistake
saving Dexter's life,

198
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,190
and neither did you.

199
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,959
That night
in the container

200
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,954
Dexter was being exactly
who he was meant to be

201
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,669
and so were you, the loving sister.

202
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,399
I--
Will get through this.

203
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,678
Can I keep that tape?
Yes.

204
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,874
<i>He had everything
laid out on his bedroom floor.</i>

205
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,471
<i>Dexter saw in the paper
how this guy got off
on a technicality....</i>

206
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,159
Dexter, you shouldn't be here.

207
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,760
I was vetting Yates.

208
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,196
What did you do to him?
What are you on about?

209
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,915
He has a scar on his head
exactly where your killer

210
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,316
has been harvesting
brain fragments.

211
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,876
Is he another one
of your little experiments?

212
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,195
We can talk about this, but not here.
Not with Debra in the other room.

213
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,833
An x-ray revealed a lesion
on Yates' brain.

214
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,159
I suspected it was contributing
to his violent behaviour,

215
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,880
so I....

216
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,954
I suggested the new hospital
remove it.

217
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,629
I never knew whether
they performed the surgery.

218
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,036
When I do what I do,
I have to know everything.

219
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,311
Sorry for the oversight.

220
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,510
Why don't you tell me
the real reason you're here?

221
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,679
You could have just called
for the scar.

222
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,278
Is it regarding what I said
about letting your sister go?

223
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,351
Dexter, I assure you

224
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,155
that I'm not judging
your relationship with Debra.

225
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,080
I'm just trying to manage
your expectations.

226
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,520
Why, because she thinks
I'm a monster?

227
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,756
You think I don't know that I'm the one
responsible for the pain she's in?

228
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,520
That's why she's here with you.

229
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,473
You have to get her to forgive me.

230
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,673
Whatever it takes, you have to
find a way. I need her in my life.

231
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,792
You need her?
Yes.

232
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,720
I understand that you love Debra
in your own way.

233
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,311
In my own way.
But why do you think you need her?

234
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,034
I just do.

235
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,074
Deb looks up to you.
Isn't that what you said?

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,070
She used to.

237
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,959
And that made you feel good?

238
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,550
Yes.
Well, no wonder you feel so lost.

239
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,191
Debra became a mirror, reflecting
a positive image of yourself

240
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,153
that you used to balance out

241
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,114
with the notion of yourself
as a monster.

242
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,879
Now that mirror is cracked,

243
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,152
and the only reflection you see
is one of darkness.

244
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,915
You make it sound like
that part of me isn't real.

245
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,554
You are no monster.

246
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,836
You never have been.

247
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,396
Anyone on my table would disagree.

248
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,877
Dexter, a monster, by definition,
is outside of nature.

249
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,396
You're a part
of the natural order of things,

250
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,354
with purpose and value,
a right to exist.

251
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,200
When you accept that,
you'll no longer be dependent

252
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,835
on Debra, or anyone's,
validation.

253
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,554
I'll still want her in my life.

254
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,673
Want, but not need.

255
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,475
<i>No van. No Yates.</i>

256
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,273
<i>No one home.</i>

257
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,191
<i>"Monterey Nursing Home.</i>

258
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,519
<i>Dad's 76th birthday."</i>

259
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,311
<i>It seems Yates found a way
to keep his family in his life.</i>

260
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,591
<i>Will I be able to do the same
with Deb?</i>

261
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,032
<i>Vogel says I don't need her.</i>

262
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,473
<i>But if that's true, will I be able to
let her go if that's what she needs?</i>

263
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,350
<i>Women's shoes.</i>

264
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,793
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's me.

265
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,320
I'm at Yates' house.

266
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,479
<i>Have you found something?</i>
Women's shoes.

267
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,320
Individual shoes, not pairs,

268
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,749
some of them older.

269
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,956
High heels are a far cry
from brains.

270
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,311
It's not exactly your killer's
usual MO.

271
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,638
<i>When this began, I expressed
my doubts that this was the work</i>

272
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,200
<i>of someone new to killing.</i>

273
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,710
<i>Albert wouldn't be the first
to alter his methods.</i>

274
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,879
Yeah, still, something
about it doesn't
quite add up.

275
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,391
But just to be safe,
I'm pulling prints off the shoes.

276
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,917
I'll run them through
the station's database
for missing persons

277
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,079
and homicide victims.
But they're only partials.

278
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,476
I won't expect anything back
until the morning.

279
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,792
And I have my son tonight.

280
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,434
<i>Understood.</i>

281
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,074
I'll let you know what I find.

282
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,440
Vogel.

283
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,109
She found herself a hero.

284
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,876
Hi.

285
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,239
Hello.
You must be Dexter. I'm Cassie, 4-B.

286
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,399
And you're in my kitchen because?
I'm a friend of Jamie's.

287
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,353
I ran out of detergent.
Daddy!

288
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,835
I see you two have met.

289
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,231
I hope you don't mind.
Who am I to deny

290
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,114
a neighbour clean clothes?
Dinner's in the oven.

291
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,959
I'll see you in the morning?
Sure.

292
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,753
I'll walk you out. Mmm!

293
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,357
Nice to meet you, Dexter.
You too.

294
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,039
Bye.

295
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,394
She's nice.

296
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,917
But does she have a kissy-neck?

297
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,797
I knew you'd pass.
I didn't.

298
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,434
Oh, thank you for that.

299
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,950
This one used to have
to write the combination

300
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,715
of his locker on his wrist
when he first got here.

301
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,197
So what? My memory sucks.
You needed the right encouragement.

302
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,596
I don't even wanna know
what that means.

303
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,154
We're empty.

304
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,953
You know,
I really am so proud of you.

305
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,073
I couldn't have
done it without you.

306
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,839
Who was behind the wheel?

307
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,390
Debra Morgan,
former lieutenant of Homicide,

308
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,758
passed out, piss drunk. Ha, ha, ha!
Come on, let it go.

309
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,673
I don't know
who was fucked up more,

310
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,997
her or the parking metre
she ran over.

311
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,192
Hey. How about
professional discretion?

312
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,750
Yeah, well, I believe
that we're off the clock.

313
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,191
But you could
lower your voice, you know?

314
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,319
Yeah, sure. No problem.
Thanks.

315
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,672
Who was that guy?
I don't know.

316
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,439
He used to bone her or something.

317
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,439
Probably the way Morgan
made lieutenant, on her back.

318
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,636
Fuck.
Hey, hey, hey!

319
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,640
That's enough.

320
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,918
Enough, I said! Enough!

321
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,356
What the hell happened?
Someone was defending

322
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,638
his ex-girlfriend's honour.
Get him out of here.

323
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,111
You know what? It's fine. Let's just go.
I'm sorry.

324
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,031
Hey, how about a round
on the house?

325
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,317
All right, lieutenant.
Fuck.

326
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,915
So we're good?

327
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,794
Mm.

328
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,960
Aah!

329
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,197
Babe. Babe, my ribs.
Yeah?

330
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,996
I'm so sorry.

331
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,471
How many, mister?
Two.

332
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,955
One for me and one for Dan.

333
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,154
Two it is.
Sorry I'm late.

334
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,275
Who's Dan?

335
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,030
Pet elephant. You don't see him?

336
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,556
You want some pancakes, Dan?

337
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,274
Eat up.

338
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,995
Make sure Dan
doesn't get any syrup
on the couch.

339
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,759
Okay.

340
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,670
My car died.
That "check engine" light
I kept ignoring?

341
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,634
Apparently it means what it says.
How'd you get here?

342
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,629
Angel. But don't worry,
my car will only be in the shop
for a few days.

343
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,356
I'm gonna see if Cassie
can give us a lift
to Harrison's preschool.

344
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,232
You know, you made
quite an impression
on her last night.

345
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,433
Impression?
She's single. Just saying.

346
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,359
Hey, why don't you take the SUV?
It's safer. I'll clear my stuff out.

347
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,598
If you can drop me off,
I'll pick up a car
from the motor pool.

348
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,120
Sure you don't mind?

349
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,277
I don't if Dan doesn't.

350
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,071
How did I let you
talk me into this
again?

351
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,078
I believe your price
was one beer.

352
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,358
So now what?
You tell me.

353
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,711
Isn't this where you think you belong?
No.

354
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,196
Frankly, I'm quite amazed
that you think you ever left.

355
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,360
Are we really gonna do this?

356
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,997
Debra, you shut yourself
inside these walls
for the last six months

357
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,237
doing your damnedest
to shut everything

358
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,432
and everyone out.
So why don't we?

359
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,399
What the fuck are you doing?

360
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,195
I want you to
convince me
how killing Dexter

361
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,040
instead of LaGuerta
would be a better choice.

362
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,039
Open the fucking door.
LaGuerta.

363
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,039
She was on her knees,
where those blood stains are,

364
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,236
isn't that right?

365
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,955
She was your co-worker,
your friend.

366
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,552
Why didn't you just stay
at the party and let Dexter
take care of everything?

367
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,391
I had to stop him.
But Dexter can't help what he is.

368
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,911
He has no conscience,
unlike you.

369
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,629
You knew the moment
you pointed that gun

370
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,672
at LaGuerta it was wrong,

371
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,997
and still, you pulled the trigger.

372
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,476
You shot a woman in cold blood.

373
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,516
You let her bleed out and did nothing.
You shot an innocent woman

374
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,434
for simply doing her job.
Because of Dexter.

375
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,472
And that's what terrifies you
the most.

376
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,436
You so desperately want to believe
that if you had just shot Dexter,

377
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,558
then you wouldn't have to
face the truth,

378
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,877
that if you had to do it
all over again

379
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,560
you'd still choose him.

380
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,114
Because in your heart,

381
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,751
you know you'll always
choose Dexter.

382
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,271
How do I make it right?

383
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,354
By finally accepting
that you're a good person

384
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,519
who was forced to do
a terrible thing.

385
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,916
And that you made the best
of an impossible situation.

386
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,510
You can walk out that door.
You can move forward.

387
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,555
The choice is yours.
It always has been.

388
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,753
Oh, lieutenant. A word?

389
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,394
Of course.

390
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,599
I was just reviewing
the sergeant's exam results.

391
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,594
And it seems you were right
and I was wrong about Quinn.

392
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,480
Apparently, he can count
past his fingers and toes.

393
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,519
He was in the 85th percentile.
So was Miller.

394
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,797
In the 88th percentile, to be exact.

395
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,392
I want you to strongly consider
making her sergeant.

396
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,595
Angie is good. I like her, a lot.

397
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,919
But I still think Quinn's the smarter--
All I said was "strongly consider."

398
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,999
This is your first departmental
promotion as lieutenant

399
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,677
and will reflect on your command.
That being said

400
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,476
it's your decision and yours alone.

401
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,398
<i>Three hits off
the partials, all reported missing.</i>

402
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,120
<i>Janet Thorton, taken two weeks ago.</i>

403
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,233
<i>Looks like Yates killed these women,</i>

404
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,598
<i>but I still can't be sure
he's the one after Vogel.</i>

405
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,473
<i>Not until he's on my table</i>

406
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,479
<i>and we have a little talk first.</i>

407
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,915
Where are we on Norma Rivera?
We're trying to find--

408
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,277
Miller.
Address for the ex is no good.

409
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,040
Nobody's seen him.
Got back the ME's report.

410
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,153
They found semen.
I'm testing it to see if it's a match.

411
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,592
Would explain why he's off the grid.
She invites him over.

412
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,799
Things get heated, he kills her,
panics and goes on the run.

413
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,515
That's one theory. Find this guy.
We're on it.

414
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,151
Dex-posé. Favour. I need you
to stay away from the lab for a bit.

415
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,829
That hottie who's been
looking for me is coming

416
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,235
and we might need alone time.

417
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,556
<i>No problem.</i>

418
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,958
You would know all about that.
- You're better than that.

419
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,836
Come on, here. There's a 20 in it
for anyone who directs her to my lab

420
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,838
and is cool about it.
Done.

421
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,474
Okay.

422
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,397
<i>I'm on my own. Perfect.</i>

423
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,354
Angel.

424
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,591
I get it, okay?
You're pissed about last night.

425
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,800
I had to run a tab so that asshole
patrolman wouldn't press charges.

426
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,277
If Matthews caught wind of this,
he'd have all the ammo he needed

427
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,995
to shoot down this promotion.
I lost my cool.

428
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,590
I need my sergeant
to be able to keep his.

429
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,995
A bar fight?

430
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,353
Technically, the place is a restaurant.
It's not like you haven't done the same.

431
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,600
You put a guy in the hospital for running
his mouth about LaGuerta using hers.

432
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,918
Allegedly. And the difference is,
I wasn't up for promotion.

433
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,913
I had already made sergeant.

434
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,359
You wanna fix this?
Solve this case.

435
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,075
Excuse me?
Are you Vincent Masuka?

436
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,155
The one, the only.

437
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,352
But you can call me Vince.

438
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,599
Just as long as you call.

439
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,560
Okay. I'm Niki.

440
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,114
I'm a student at U of M.

441
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,119
Oh, yeah. My alma mater. Come in.

442
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,278
You must be majoring in

443
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,755
beautiful.

444
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,390
This is really hard.
I know the feeling.

445
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,472
I think you may be my father.

446
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,631
You were a sperm donor
in college, right?

447
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,596
Mm-hm.

448
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,635
But you have curls.
Yeah, my mom.

449
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,838
Holy...

450
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,160
Oh, fuck.

451
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,438
This was a bad idea. Sorry.

452
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,392
I'm sorry.
It's okay. No, don't worry.

453
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,230
It's okay, don't-- Don't-- Don't--

454
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,432
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

455
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,194
Oh, my God.

456
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,280
You've got my soulful,
yet haunting eyes.

457
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,470
Night, Marty.
See you tomorrow.

458
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,632
We do have filing cabinets,
you know.

459
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,673
This is kind of my process.

460
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,190
What are you even doing here?

461
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,352
I thought you were taking
time off.

462
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,076
Turns out time off isn't
all it's cracked up to be. Heh.

463
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,109
I just wanted to get a head start on
some of the cases that you left for me.

464
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,671
Well, we're gonna need food.

465
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,633
"We"?
Yeah, we.

466
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,639
You look like you could use
a hand, and I'm starving.

467
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,678
You know, when I need a break,

468
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,712
I've got maybe two days at the most.

469
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,434
And then I go crazy.

470
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,876
I end up right back here.

471
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,319
What about you?

472
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,515
What makes you crazy?

473
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,074
Family shit.

474
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,396
Hm.

475
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,160
Nothing says family like love

476
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,039
and shit.

477
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,040
Unfortunately, my father
was an expert in the latter.

478
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,112
Texas oil.
Texas oil?

479
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,316
Mm.

480
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,120
Fuck, I hope I'm holding
my plastic fork correctly.

481
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,518
Exactly. He was all rules,
all the time.

482
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,357
My moving to Miami to be a cop,

483
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,758
that was the biggest "fuck you"
I could think of at the time.

484
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,874
When I got out of the academy,
I realised it was nothing but rules.

485
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,391
Everybody there was like your father.
You know the worst part?

486
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,475
I knew I'd made a huge
fucking mistake,
but there was no way in hell

487
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,037
I was gonna give him
the smug pleasure
of knowing he was right.

488
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,199
So I waited until he died,
quit the force.

489
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,592
I opened up this place.

490
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,991
Looks like you're doing
pretty well for yourself.

491
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,516
Trust me,
I'm still the black sheep.

492
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,111
The look on my mother's face
every time she goes
into the country club,

493
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,438
has to explain
to one of her friends
that her son is a PI?

494
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,359
That's gotta be
pretty close to priceless.

495
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,034
Mm.

496
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,796
My dad was everything to me.

497
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,919
I loved him.

498
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,193
And while he's
not the man I thought he was...

499
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,279
well, I'm...

500
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,192
I'm realising we're
more alike than I thought.

501
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,072
To dead dads.

502
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,516
Long may they haunt us.

503
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,273
Heh.

504
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,270
It's a better toast if you open it.

505
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,112
I'm good.

506
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,760
<i>Vogel says I'm not a monster,</i>

507
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,792
<i>but that's exactly the part of me</i>

508
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,311
<i>she's expecting to
remove Yates as a threat.</i>

509
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,074
<i>A threat that seems to have
left in a hurry</i>

510
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,114
<i>and taken all his shoes.</i>

511
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,752
<i>Does this prove Yates
is who I'm looking for?</i>

512
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,550
<i>The only way to know for sure is...</i>

513
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,071
<i>find where he's hiding.</i>

514
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,990
<i>He saw me here, heard everything.</i>

515
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,753
<i>Bone saw. Specimen jars.</i>

516
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,560
<i>His own cut-by-numbers guide.</i>

517
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,080
<i>Yates is the brain surgeon.</i>

518
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,789
<i>Vogel needs to know.</i>

519
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,396
<i>I know her. I pulled her print.</i>

520
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,599
<i>Yates must have stabbed her,</i>

521
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,396
<i>nicked her left pulmonary artery,
left her for dead.</i>

522
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,152
<i>Unaware cramming her
inside that cart</i>

523
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,518
<i>would put pressure on the wound
and stop it from bleeding.</i>

524
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,511
<i>Now I have to do the same.</i>

525
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,990
<i>It'll hold, but not for long.</i>

526
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,038
Do you think the girl will be all right?

527
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,634
She lost a lot of blood.

528
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,834
I stemmed the bleeding, dropped her
in the ER, got back as fast as I could.

529
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,918
Oh, God, has he been

530
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,310
doing all this because of me?

531
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,079
We can't know until we find him.

532
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,830
Let's hope there's something
on here that'll tell me how.

533
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,799
These are patient files.

534
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,793
Your patient files.

535
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,151
That's not possible.

536
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,076
This one's dated just two weeks ago.
Dexter, don't.

537
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,559
What is this?

538
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,119
You were keeping notes on me?

539
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,596
It's a journal.
I've always had a journal.

540
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,316
You were writing down everything
we did, everything we talked about.

541
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,955
I never used your name.
Yates, nor anyone else

542
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,597
could possibly know who you are.
"Somehow, he's deluded himself

543
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,674
into thinking his feelings
for his sister are genuine,

544
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,632
unaware there are no
real emotions behind them."

545
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,038
Dexter, I-- I never meant--

546
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,880
What am I, a subject
for another one of your books?

547
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,878
Is that what these are for?

548
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,556
Answer the question!

549
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,271
My notes, it's how I process--

550
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,836
You were experimenting
on me with Harry

551
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,151
and you still are.

552
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,875
I'm nothing but a lab rat,
just like Yates.

553
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,398
That's not true. You know that.

554
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,196
Is that why you wanna
keep me apart from Deb?

555
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,676
Just another way to isolate
your subject,

556
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,792
see what he'll do?

557
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,756
Dexter...
Don't.

558
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,160
When Yates is dead,
you are out of my life.

559
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,677
It's over. You understand?

560
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,749
Or do you need
to write it down?

561
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,238
I understand.

562
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,872
<i>I walked into the room and--</i>

563
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,878
<i>- Go on, tell me.
- The blood.</i>

564
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,356
<i>Evelyn, there was
so much blood, on plastic.</i>

565
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,439
<i>Dexter had placed it everywhere.
The walls, the ceiling.</i>

566
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,917
<i>There was a table in the middle
of the room. A table with--</i>

567
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,675
<i>- The body?
- Parts of one.</i>

568
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,315
<i>And when Dexter turned,
the look on his face--</i>

569
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,113
<i>He was so proud.</i>

570
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,960
<i>When-- The man Dexter killed,
he was a drug dealer.</i>

571
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,198
<i>He murdered your partner.
He was going to get away with it.</i>

572
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,754
<i>But he was a person.</i>

573
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,555
<i>Who, according to the code,
deserved--</i>

574
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,315
<i>No one deserves
to be in pieces.</i>

575
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,919
<i>In bags.</i>

576
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,636
<i>The code is a theory, an idea.</i>

577
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,277
<i>But what I saw,
what Dexter did--</i>

578
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,318
<i>What we did!</i>

579
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,596
<i>I don't think I can live with this.</i>

580
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,080
Fuck, and I'm supposed to?

581
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,629
Hello?
<i>Mr. Yates?</i>

582
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,399
Yeah, that's me.

583
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,353
<i>I'm afraid we have some bad news.</i>

584
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,517
<i>Your father's heart is failing.</i>

585
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,040
How bad is it?

586
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,199
You should come quickly.
He might not have much time.

587
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,154
Dad.

588
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,957
I got here as fast as I could.

589
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,311
I'm right here. Can you hear me?

590
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,476
It was you?

591
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,558
I was counting on you
being the good son.

592
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,918
They'll be here any second.

593
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,552
Room 26, code blue!

594
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,114
We're losing him. We're losing him!
<i>To save his own life,</i>

595
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,915
<i>Yates was willing to take his father's.</i>

596
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,759
<i>Vogel believes I'm just like
all her other experiments,</i>

597
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,112
<i>a psychopath who can't form
real connections.</i>

598
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,999
<i>But she's wrong.</i>

599
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,312
<i>Deb isn't a prop, like Yates' father
was to his son.</i>

600
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,434
<i>She's more than a mirror.
She's family.</i>

601
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,270
<i>If I have a purpose and value
and a right to exist,</i>

602
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,949
<i>so do my feelings for Deb.</i>

603
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,912
<i>This experiment is over.
Vogel can go to hell.</i>

604
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,916
Jamie packing you lunch these days?
It's for you.

605
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,759
Just came back
from Good Samaritan.

606
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,795
Run the blood on the clothes
of a stabbing victim, Janet Thorton.

607
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,071
She still alive?
Still in surgery.

608
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,034
The son of a bitch
who stabbed her
broke all of her toes.

609
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,318
How soon do you need this?
Very. On my way to the hospital

610
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,150
to get a statement, soon as docs say
she's out of the woods. Let me know

611
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,670
what comes back on those clothes.
Will do.

612
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,234
Deb.

613
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,236
What the fuck?

614
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,874
Hey.
Hey.

615
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,719
You here to see Dex?

616
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,354
Yeah.

617
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,429
Everything okay?
Because last time I saw you--

618
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,592
Yeah, I am sorry about that.

619
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,360
I'm so sorry I put you
in that position.

620
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,752
Sorry I got mad at you for calling Dex.

621
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,037
No, it's okay. You asked me not to.

622
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,873
I was in a really bad place,

623
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,074
but, you know, you were
just looking out for me,

624
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,232
like you always do.

625
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,075
Things are so easy with you.

626
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,158
I wish it was like that
with Jamie.

627
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,000
I just keep getting
tripped up, you know?

628
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,352
You all all right?
Um, she's jealous.

629
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,519
She thinks there's still
something between us.

630
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,154
Make it work with Jamie. Heh.

631
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,755
I want you happy.

632
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,676
You mean so much to me, Joey.

633
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,390
Don't you fucking forget that.

634
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,953
Thanks.

635
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,751
You sure you're okay?
I gotta go.

636
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,152
Bye, Joey.

637
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,880
<i>Deb.</i>

638
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,632
<i>The body forms scar tissue
to close a wound.</i>

639
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,758
<i>Has my sister begun to do the same?</i>

640
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,469
<i>Eventually, scars fade. Who knows?</i>

641
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,673
<i>With enough time, you may not
even remember how you got them.</i>

642
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,393
Dex.

643
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,672
Hey, Deb. What's up?

644
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,677
We should talk. It's important.

645
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,951
<i>Yates can wait. My sister can't.</i>

646
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,793
Sure, I'd like that.

647
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,479
Just not here.

648
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,153
Can we take a ride?

649
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,158
It's good to see you.

650
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,919
Vogel said it was best
I stay away.

651
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,512
What the fuck
does she know?

652
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,758
If it's any comfort,
we're not on the best
of terms anymore.

653
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,792
She doesn't understand us, Dexter.

654
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,593
Exactly.

655
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,550
She said I might lose you,

656
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,439
but we'll always be together, right?

657
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,993
Vogel had these DVDs
of her and Dad.

658
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,998
Did she ever show them to you?

659
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,874
A couple. You?

660
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,518
There was one that was
really interesting. It was, uh,

661
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,554
just before Dad died.
It was his last session with her.

662
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,353
Did Dad kill himself?

663
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,320
Yeah.

664
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,196
A few years back,

665
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,158
Matthews told me the truth.

666
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,872
Harry OD'd
on his heart medication.

667
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,916
Was it because of you?

668
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,680
He thought he'd created a monster.

669
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,156
I think I know how he felt.

670
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,356
Why he killed himself.

671
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,313
But he only got it half right.
