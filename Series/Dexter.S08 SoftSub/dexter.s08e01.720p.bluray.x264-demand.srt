2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,598
Oh, my God.
Dexter, what the fuck?

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,280
Travis was here. He came at me.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,996
When I thought about everything he did,
I wanted him dead, so I killed him.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,392
I have to call this in.
Maybe we should get rid of the body.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,674
Gasoline, fire, it'll erase any trace
that we were ever here.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,071
I never wanted her
to go through this, Dex.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,430
Neither did I.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,354
I found a blood slide exactly like
the ones we found in Doakes' car.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,199
Bad people are still going missing,
and Doakes--

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,596
Was the Bay Harbor Butcher,
end of story.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,399
I have to keep my secret safe.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,520
Otherwise my life, her life,
will never be the same.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,835
Are you a serial killer?

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,191
I only kill certain kinds of people.
Oh, God.

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,911
Are you the Bay Harbor Butcher?
Dad taught me. He gave me a code.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,190
Dad knew?

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,632
You're like a magnet.
Bad shit is gonna find you.

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,036
Dexter is a blood-spatter analyst

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,880
and Doakes always thought
something was off about him.

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,077
What if Doakes was on to him?

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,354
The Bay Harbor Butcher.
Maria thinks it might be you.

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,636
Me?

Hannah McKay.
She stabbed a woman five times.

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,434
All I can think about
is giving her what she deserves.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,955
Do what you gotta do.

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,596
Dexter...

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,077
You're the only person
I don't have to hide anything from.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,194
Maybe you understand me
a little better than I understand myself.

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,114
I love you.
It's because she's a serial killer?

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,513
If you love me, you'll accept this.
If I love you? I'm in love with you!

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,870
Wha--?

33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,638
Debra's been in a car accident.
You poisoned Debra.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,719
You were supposed to choose me.
She's my sister.

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,235
Goodbye, Dexter.

got the call on the burning church.

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,318
What were you doing there, lieutenant?
Are we really that fucked?

39
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,751
If all she's got is that DVD,
I can handle this.

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,355
LaGuerta's an innocent.
She doesn't even meet the code.

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,994
It's the only option.

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,154
Hector Estrada. I was three years old
when you murdered my mother.

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,033
You're Dickie Moser!

- It's not so easy.

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,358
I can't let Deb go down
for what I did.

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,155
It's Deb. Whatever you're thinking,
please don't do it.

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,396
So, what's the plan?

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,195
I use her gun to shoot Estrada
in his puncture wound.

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,835
Use Estrada's gun
to shoot LaGuerta.

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,673
Deb.
Dexter?

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,199
You shouldn't be here.
Why shouldn't I be here?

53
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,629
Shoot him, Debra.

54
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,351
You have to end this. Shoot him.

55
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,120
Stop!
Do it, Debra. Shoot him.

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,673
Do it! Shoot him!

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,837
This is not who you are.

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,000
You're a good person.
You're not like him.

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,993
Put him down!

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,556
It's true.
Everything she said.

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,916
You're a good person.

62
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,153
Do what you gotta do.

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,510

And I know for a fact that she
never regretted one day of service.

It's a choice
that none of us take lightly.

Maria was very important to me.

81
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,798
She was a good cop.
She was my boss.

Very briefly my wife.

83
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,991

Bye, Daddy.

See you after work, Harrison.
Okay.

93
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,634
A bench. Why a bench?

94
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,153
She deserves more than a place
where people park their butts.

95
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,476
It's a nice bench.

96
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,639
It's concrete, very sturdy.

97
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,998
You can buy them at the parking lot
at Home Depot.

98
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,995
I'm sorry. Was that insensitive?
No, that's exactly my point.

99
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,591
This all feels so cold.

100
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,595
You're still hurting, I can tell.
All right,

101
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,838
look, first of all, it's weird
when you try to speak Spanish.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,231
Second, don't ever touch me.
It's been six months.

How am I supposed to move on?

105
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,755
My dining room is filled
with boxes of her stuff.

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,151
He's right, you know?
It's been six months.

107
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,037
Maybe you should just get rid of it.
And then what? She just disappears?

108
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,915
Hey, Dex, I was kind of hoping
your sister would stop by.

109
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,560
Yeah, how is Deb?

110
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,151
She really wanted to be here,
but she's working long hours.

111
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,794
She's better?

112
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,235
Oh, yeah, she's great.

113
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,715
That's good to know.

114
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,511
Yeah, she took LaGuerta's death
kind of hard,

115
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,871
even though
they didn't seem all that close.

116
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,311
There's no telling
how you're gonna react.

117
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,995
You know,
when Mike Anderson was killed,

118
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,635
I just wanted to get away
from all this.

119
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,072
It took Maria's death
to turn me back.

120
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,440
It made me want to do nothing
but chase bad guys.

121
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,917
I can't tell you how many times
all I wanted to do is what Deb did,

122
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,874
walk out of here at lunch
and never come back.

123
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,960
Yeah, Deb can be impulsive
sometimes.

124
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,560
Tell her to drop by sometime.

125
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,996
Place isn't the same without her.

126
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,400
For a while, I heard from her every
other day, asking for some favour,

127
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,513
but I haven't spoken to her
in a couple weeks now.

128
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,638
Why is that?

129
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,439
She's out of town.

130
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,432
Right. The Keys.

131
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,393
No, Fort Lauderdale.

132
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,279
Right. Fort Lauderdale.

133
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,831
Well, when she gets back,
let's set something up.

134
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,032
It'd be good to see her.
Yeah, it would.

135
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,072
I mean, I'll tell her.

she'd talk to me once in a while.</i>

142

144
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,474
Mm. I'm sorry.
I guess I got carried away.

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,196
You're gonna have to share.

146
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,798
Gotta take this. Business.
Okay.

147
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,675
Yeah.

148
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,199
No, I'm not splitting it up.
All or nothing.

149
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,155
That is my best price.

What happened to your normal guys?

154
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,359
I don't know.
They disappeared on me.

155
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,792
Funny thing, being a fence doesn't
seem to be a long-term occupation.

156
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,591
What about this guy?
Can you trust him?

157
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,194
Can you trust anybody?

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,673
Uh-uh.

159
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,158
Maybe if you want,
I can back you up.

160
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,720
I don't want you involved.

00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,509
I appreciate it...

163
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,751
Ha-ha.
but I got it covered.

164
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,072
Ahh. What do you want to do today?

165
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,397
Preferably something
that involves you in a bikini.

166
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,557
Why don't we rent a boat?

167
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,470
Like a pontoon, little thing,
we could go out, relax on the water.

168
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,519
No, get something fast.
Let's get a speedboat.

169
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,393
We can buzz the cruise ships.

170
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,274
You like causing trouble,
don't you?

171
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,710
I can't help it.

172
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,117
It's funny how these things work,
isn't it?

173
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,913
What do you mean?

174
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,993
Like when I met you, I'd been
in that bar for almost an hour.

175
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,913
I was about to leave.

176
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,918
Then you walked in.
Yeah, I did.

177
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,232
It's funny how something so simple

178
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,274
as you walking in the door
at the exact right moment

179
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,278
can suddenly change everything.

180
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,758
Yeah.

181
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,999
What are you doing here, Dexter?

182
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,754
She could be inside.

183
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,475
You know what she's been
going through. She could've

184
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,393
done something.

185
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,674
Deb.

186
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,277
Deb, you in here?

187
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,071
She's not here, Dexter.

188
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,197
She asked you to leave her alone.

189
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,960
For how long?

190
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,992
I haven't talked to her
in over a month.

191
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,635
I haven't seen her in two months.

192
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,195
She's disappeared.

193
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,551
She's disappeared
from you, Dexter.

194
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,790
And that's her choice.

195
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,472
What is this?

196
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,074
Xanax.

197
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,835
Paxil.

198
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,230
Adderall.

199
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,319
More Xanax.
All from different doctors.

200
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,590
And pot.

201
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,355
Great, she's mixing all this shit.

202
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,954
I have to find her.

203
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,595
Dexter, you're the problem,
not the solution.

204
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,634
The best thing you can do for Debra
is to stay away from her.

205
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,632
I'm the only one
who knows what happened.

206
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,520
I'm the only one who can help her.
She needs me.

207
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,512
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

208
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,399
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

209
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,032
I have to find her.

210
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,150
Hi.
Hi.

211
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,356
Can I help you?

212
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
Yeah, I'm--
Dexter Morgan.

213
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,511
Elway. Nice place.

214
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,830
Thank you.

215
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,875
Yeah, yeah, it's a big step up from
my robbery desk at Miami Metro, huh?

216
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,437
And it's a good change for Deb
as well.

217
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,798
Very smart of her, making a move
to the private sector, I'll tell you.

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,310
She here?
She is not.

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,480
You know when she'll be back?

220
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,637
Not a clue.

221
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,395
She's got a big problem
of disappearing on me.

222
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,239
What does that mean?

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,310
She don't like to check in
when she's supposed to.

224
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,591
When's the last you heard from her?

225
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,351
Been a couple of weeks,
at least.

226
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,157
And that's normal for her?
Of course not normal. Debra Morgan.

227
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,353
There's no "normal" for her.
That was the deal when I hired her.

228
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,632
She's her own agent, she chooses
the cases she wants to work on,

229
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,832
and she calls in
when she feels like it.

230
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,829
But...
But what?

231
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,320
She's never waited two weeks
to call me back.

232
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,712
What case is she working on?

233
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,038
Some smash-and-grab.
Guy skipped out on bail.

234
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,077
Uh... Name is...

235
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,951
Briggs. Andrew Briggs.

236
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,715
Skip tracing, bounty hunting?
Isn't that beneath her?

237
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,990
Tell me about it.

238
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,840
I try to give her bigger clients,
higher-profile cases,

239
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,039
but she seems to like
the down and dirty stuff.

240
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,635
Your sister's a bit of a thrill seeker.
Really?

241
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,390
Easy money for her. Gets a percentage
of everybody she brings in, so...

242
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,071
Well, what else can you tell me
about the case?

243
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,397
Not much more to it.
Find him, bring him back.

244
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,717
If she brings the jewellery,
she gets a cut.

245
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,553
That's all you know?
Like I said

246
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,234
she's not big on checking in, so...

247
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,515
I gotta go.

248
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,753
If you hear from her, call me,
all right?

249
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,954
<i>Is this how I'm going to find Deb?</i>

250
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,436
<i>Dead and alone?</i>

251
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,830
Are you looking at my ass?
No.

252
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,430
I mean, yes.
What size do you wear?

253
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,239
None of your damn business.

254
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,110
It's just that I have all of Maria's
clothes, and I just thought maybe...

255
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,555
Oh.
Yeah, no, it's--

256
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,790
It's not your style. I get it.

257
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,469
She was a very colourful woman.

258
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,873
Hey, what do we have?

259
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,035
Robert Bailey, 42 years old,
Miami resident.

260
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,318
Killed by a single gunshot wound
to the chest,

261
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,670
right above the heart.

262
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,755
Judging from the stippling
on the wound, it looks like the muzzle

263
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,151
was in contact
with the chest when fired.

264
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,436
Suicide?

265
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,832
No, the victim was killed elsewhere
and dumped here.

266
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,434
Whoa.

267
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,631
Parietal and occipital bone
sliced through.

268
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,557
Back of the cranium removed.

269
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,359
Okay, that's weird.

270
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,000
And...

271
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
looks like a piece of it
has been scooped out,

272
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,999
like with a melon baller.

273
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,039
Just got weirder.
We have a gun.

274
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,310
So someone shoots this guy,

275
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,955
cuts his head open,
and messes with his brain.

276
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,598
He takes the body and the weapon
and brings them all the way out here.

277
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,274
Why?

278
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,880
People are crazy.

279
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,679
I think we're done here.

280
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,918
Okay, process the gun
for DNA and prints.

281
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,834
With the rain...
Yeah, do it anyway.

282
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,434
Dexter, follow up on the body.

283
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,199
Will do.

284
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,152
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

285
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,114
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

286
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,118
<i>Where the hell are you, Deb?</i>

287
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,994
<i>Andrew Briggs.</i>

288
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,677
<i>The man Deb was looking for.</i>

289
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,557
<i>Clubbed a security guard over the head,
robbed a high-end jewellery store.</i>

290
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,994
<i>Got away with over a half a million
in unrecovered merchandise.</i>

291
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,790
<i>Skipped on his bail,
been on the run ever since.</i>

292
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,112
<i>Arrested three times for assault.</i>

293
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,955
<i>Sent one guy to the hospital
with a broken jaw.</i>

294
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,713
<i>This guy is dangerous.</i>

295
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,630
<i>Did Debra get in over her head?</i>

296
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,315
<i>"Password"?</i>

297
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,040
<i>Nope.</i>

298
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,750
<i>"Fucking password."</i>

299
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,275
<i>Here we go.</i>

300
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,591
<i>All of her charges for three weeks
have been in Fort Lauderdale.</i>

301
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,197
<i>And mostly at El Mercado
on East 4th Street.</i>

302
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,352
<i>She was there yesterday afternoon.</i>

303
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,916
<i>I can be there in half an hour.</i>

304
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,110
<i>That's the guy
she's supposed to bring in.</i>

305
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,393
What kind of tequila you like?

306
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,836
The kind that makes you fall down.

307
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,912
I'll see what I can do.

308
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,160
Hmm.

309
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,874
What the fuck?

310
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,154
Deb, what's going on?

311
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,031
I'm working a case.
You should get the fuck out.

312
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,192
You found your guy.
Why haven't you brought him in?

313
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,518
How do you know what I'm doing?
I talked to Elway.

314
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,960
You talked to Elway?

315
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,039
He said you hadn't checked in.
I was scared something happened.

316
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,794
I'm fine. You should get out.

317
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,676
Deb, you haven't talked to me in weeks.
You haven't returned any of my calls.

318
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,116
You completely missed
LaGuerta's memorial.

319
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,879
Jesus Christ, I wonder why.

320
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,794
And would you please erase
the messages on your phone?

321
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,235
No one has heard from you.

322
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,432
Yeah,
I'm fucking getting close to Briggs

323
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,638
so that I can get the jewellery
before he fences it, all right?

324
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,399
I'm a professional working a case.

325
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,119
Why don't you get out of here
before you ruin it?

326
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,079
You having sex with that guy?
What the fuck?

327
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,350
My life is none of your business.

328
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,954
Go.

329
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,594
No, I'm not leaving.

330
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,719
Fuck you.

331
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,197
Do you wanna know why
I'm not returning your phone calls?

332
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,033
Because I don't wanna talk to you.

333
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,677
And I really don't wanna
fucking see you.

334
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,794
Why?
Why?

335
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,074
Um...

336
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,673
Because you made me compromise
everything about myself I care about.

337
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,076
And I hate you for it.

338
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,676
No, you don't.

339
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,592
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

340
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,757
Who's this guy?

341
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,794
Just some loser.

342
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,032
Is there a problem?

343
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,594
Let's go.

344
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,317
She doesn't hate me.
She's messed up. She doesn't
know what she's doing.

345
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,960
It's none of your business.

346
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,840
She's using this job
as a way to escape.

347
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,919
She can't deal with everything
that's happened. She's lost, Dad.

348
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,352
You've done this to her.
Don't make it worse. Leave her alone.

349
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,592
Motherfucker cut me off.

350
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,992
Dexter, what are you doing?

351
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,033
Hey, what's going on?

352
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,435
You cut me off.
I'm sorry. I didn't--

353
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,280
You lost control out there, Dexter.

354
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,079
He knows what he did.

355
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,158
Go home, son.

356
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,797
Right there...

357
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,314
Oh.

358
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,556
Stop.

359
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,070
Don't stop. Don't stop.

360
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,914
Don't stop.
Jamie, I'm home.

361
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,470
Oh, God-- You stopped.
Someone just came in.

362
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,956
It's just Angel.
Yeah, what?

363
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,270
What?

364
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,234
I'm sorry, I can't have sex
with my lieutenant 20 feet away.

365
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,590
I'm not having a problem.

366
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,712
That's because you're
fucking superhuman.

367
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,553
Oh, come on.

368
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,356
Joey, the chance that someone
might find out our little secret...

369
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,880
I know. Not gonna happen.

370
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,470
makes it even more fun.
It's not gonna happen.

371
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,674
Come to my place
tomorrow morning,
we can finish where we left off.

372
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,872
I can't. I have to be
at Dexter's by 7.

373
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,116
What?

374
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,560
Fuck. Mm.
Mm.

375
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,120
Do me a favour?

376
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,636
Distract him so I can
go out the side door, okay?

377
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,274
How am I supposed
to do that?

378
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,836
Throw some fucking
pork rinds on the floor.

379
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,110
You owe me.

380
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,000
Hey.

381
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,998
You're all sweaty.

382
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,760
Uh... Yeah.

383
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,639
It's good that you're working out.

384
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,480
Yeah, just doing a little cardio.

385
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,909
What are you gonna do
with Maria's stuff?

386
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,312
Don't worry. It'll be gone by tomorrow.
Where?

387
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,877
Charity workers are coming in
first thing in the morning.

388
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,997
Feels sad, though.

389
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,632
An entire life
just packed up in a bunch of boxes.

390
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,392
You know, maybe...

391
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,909
you should pick out
some things to keep.

392
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,710
Come on. I think it'll be good.
You're right. You're right. You're right.

393
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,479
Warrants...

394
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,273
to trace Dexter's and Deb's phone.

395
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,355
Right to the end,
she couldn't let it go.

396
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,990
Tracking down Estrada by herself,
that's what got her killed.

397
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,317
Yeah, well,
that's just who she was, Angel.

398
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,677
Yeah.
A cop.

399
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,400
That's who she was.

400
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,234
<i>Deb should be up there
leading this briefing.</i>

401
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,391
<i>I have to find a way
to get through to her.</i>

402
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,313
This doesn't look good.
Who do you think she is?

403
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,196
Methinks a riddle,
wrapped in Dolce & Gabbana
inside a--

404
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,670
Can't you ever talk
like a normal person?

405
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,834
Everyone, your attention, please.
As you can see, we have a guest.

406
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,717
This is Dr. Evelyn Vogel.

407
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,520
She and I first met
when she consulted on a case.

408
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,439
When most of you were
in high school.

409
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,280
Dr. Vogel's been away from Miami
for a number of years

410
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,631
but she's back
and has graciously offered

411
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,797
her expertise
with our recent body dump.

412
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,674
But we're only a day
into our investigation.

413
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,395
I'm not here to step on
anyone's toes, lieutenant.

414
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,670
It's off the books.

415
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,553
Evelyn is a neuropsychiatrist.

416
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,198
She's served as a consultant
on high-profile cases over the years.

417
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,276
And she has written the definitive
textbook on the brains of psychopaths.

418
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,234
That's how I know you.
Your work on profiling is classic.

419
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,590
Thank you.

420
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,833
I wouldn't normally
insert myself into an investigation.

421
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,235
She said "insert herself."

422
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,352
When I read about the body
in the paper,

423
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,674
there was one aspect of this murder
that I found particularly intriguing.

424
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,679
Vince, bring up that x-ray
the M.E. sent over.

425
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,795
Thank you.

426
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,434
You see this part here?

427
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,996
That's the anterior insular cortex,

428
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,472
the portion of the brain
that processes empathy.

429
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,240
And the hallmark of a psychopath is...

430
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,472
<i>They have no empathy.</i>

431
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,438
they have no empathy.

432
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,671
Now, it's possible
this is mere coincidence

433
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,752
but if someone goes
to the trouble

434
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,555
of carefully extracting
a core from the brain,

435
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,237
I think they'll give some thought
to what part of the brain he's taking.

436
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,954
So why do you think
he did this?

437
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,437
It's too early to say, but maybe
he wanted to perform an experiment,

438
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,518
or maybe this was
simply a message.

439
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,239
He wouldn't be the first killer

440
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,557
to attempt to communicate
through a victim.

441
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,036
Who was the victim?
Robert Bailey. Mechanic.

442
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,749
According to his wife,
been missing for nearly a week.

443
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,476
Was the brain drilled into
while the victim was still alive?

444
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,119
Dexter?

445
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,552
The ME indicated
it was done post-mortem.

446
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,158
The preliminary autopsy also showed
bruising on the knuckles and knees,

447
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,234
which could indicate the victim
was held captive in an enclosed space.

448
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,955
There were no contents
in the victim's stomach.

449
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,674
Signs of dehydration.

450
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,918
The victim was missing for five days.

451
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,438
That suggests a pretty elaborate
pre-kill ritual for a serial killer.

452
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,275
This was just one body.

453
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,474
How do you know it's a serial killer?
Oh, I doubt that this is his first kill.

454
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,558
Those are usually more spontaneous.

455
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,719
This was planned ahead of time.
A lot of thought went into it.

456
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,796
I'm thinking we're looking for someone
at least in their 30s.

457
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,997
Intelligent, organised.

458
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,072
Takes great pride in his work.

459
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,432
I think he'd enjoy the fact
that we're talking about him right now.

460
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,994
You think there will be more?

461
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,635
I'd be surprised if there are not.
Any suspects?

462
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,992
No prints on the gun.
It sat in the rain all night.

463
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,669
Same story with the body.
We're still combing for DNA.

464
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,159
Okay, let's widen our interviews with
friends and co-workers of the victim.

465
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,835
We need to find
where he intersected with the killer.

466
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,430
Masuka, when ballistics comes in--
On your desk.

467
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,790
Dexter, stay on the DNA.

468
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,154
Thank you.

469
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,033
Thank you.
Thank you.

470
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,518
I hear the FBI calls her
the Psychopath Whisperer.

471
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,393
How lucky are we
she's on this case?

472
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,920
Yeah.

473
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,236
How lucky.

474
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,594
<i>Dr. Evelyn Vogel, neuropsychiatrist,
lecturer, just published her third book.</i>

475
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,597
<i>And the last person I need
looking in my direction right now.</i>

476
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,033
What do you think?

477
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,152
It's nice, right?

478
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,070
I guess so.

479
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,073
Maria always had it in her office.

480
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,676
I want you to have it
to remember her by.

481
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,274
Oh, thanks. That's nice.

482
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,639
You still haven't forgiven her?
It's complicated.

483
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,752
It's all right. I understand.

484
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,074
But if you can't accept it from Maria,
accept it from me.

485
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,960
It'll make me feel better.

486
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,160
Now, I know things were awkward
between the two of you

487
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,636
before Maria so tragically died.

488
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,910
So tragically died--

489
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,919
She died because
she wouldn't leave things alone.

490
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,512
I don't know why I said that. Sorry.

491
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,510
I hope you
find it in your heart to forgive her.

492
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,909
Yo, Dex-bot.

493
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,999
Vogel wants your presence
in the morgue.

494
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,360
Great.

495
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,320
El Sapo.

496
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,993
Hello, Mr. Toad.

497
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,757
You stay in here.
I'm gonna meet him outside.

498
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,275
Are you selling the stuff?

499
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,394
Well, I don't have it on me,
but I'm gonna give him a little show.

500
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,110
Deb, hey.
Been a while. How are you?

501
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,875
I'm working on a case.
Andrew Briggs.

502
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,034
All business, huh?
I only have a fucking second, okay?

503
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,954
So can you look into someone
named "El Sapo" for me?

504
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,920
Hold on.

505
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,791
<i>Who is he?</i>
He's a fucking fence.

506
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,356
I'll run it by the guys in Robbery
as soon as I get--

507
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,559
You're welcome.

508
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,793
How'd it go?
I'm gonna be rich.

509
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,716
Dr. Vogel?

510
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,073
I got a message
you wanted to see me.

511
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,995
Yes. Thank you for coming.

512
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,312
I was wondering if you'd had any luck
with finding DNA on the body.

513
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,831
No. We found a few hairs,
but they all belong to the victim.

514
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,960
Ah. So the killer
will have to be found
the old-fashioned way.

515
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,919
Boots to the ground.

516
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,474
Yeah, I suppose.

517
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,799
Quinn and Batista having any luck?

518
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,156
Not as far as I know.

519
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,353
The victim led a quiet life.
No enemies.

520
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,870
Serial killers don't have enemies.

521
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,713
Everyone's a potential victim.

522
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,635
Well, if you need anything else,
just pick up the phone.

523
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,320
Anybody at the lab can help you.

524
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,236
I was interested
to have your take on this case.

525
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,640
Me?

526
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,394
Why? I'm the blood guy.

527
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,713
The blood guy.

528
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,274
How did you end up here?

529
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,632
My dad was a cop.

530
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,991
He kind of steered me away
from that.

531
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,159
This seemed like a better fit.

532
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,400
I was drawn to forensics too.

533
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,836
But I chose to focus
on neuroscience.

534
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,759
Psychopaths.

535
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,557
We both chose murder.

536
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,719
Maybe we're both a little crazy.

537
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,119
Maybe.

538
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,874
Mad scientists trained
to look at this as a biological mass.

539
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,833
A body part.

540
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,560
Yet somehow,
from all those firings of neurons,

541
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,229
something intangible emerges.

542
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,318
Emotions.

543
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,359
Trust, morality, love.

544
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,114
Unless you're a psychopath.

545
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,240
But even then,
belief systems emerge.

546
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,553
As with the Bay Harbor Butcher.

547
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,198
What was he like?

548
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,073
Who?
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

549
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,596
James Doakes.

550
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,875
If I'm not mistaken,
he worked with you
here in Miami Metro.

551
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,278
He was angry. Had a short fuse.

552
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,597
Well, that doesn't
sound right to me.

553
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,838
As a psychopath, he would be
disassociated from his feelings,

554
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,555
not quick to anger.
Maybe he wasn't a psychopath.

555
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,639
Oh, yes, the Bay Harbor Butcher
was definitely a psychopath.

556
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,639
He'd have to be
to masquerade the way he did.

557
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,792
But he was an odd one,
that's for sure.

558
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,440
You're the expert.

559
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,431
Just the way he picked his victims,

560
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,878
persons who, on the whole, had
some sort of criminal background

561
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,878
speaks to a strong belief system.

562
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:35,394
Almost as if he operated
with some sort of moral guidelines.

563
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,790
Guidelines.

564
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,040
Yet clearly it wasn't a moral choice,
as psychopaths have no conscience.

565
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,876
So why else would he kill that way?

566
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,837
So he could

567
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,271
get away with it as long as he did?

568
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,678
People are less likely
to miss criminals when they disappear.

569
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,435
Doakes was Special Ops.
Maybe he picked that up there.

570
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,000
Maybe he did.

571
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,111
Makes an interesting case study.

572
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,276
I wish I could have interviewed him.

573
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,280
Sorry.

574
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,875
I look forward to working with you,
Dexter Morgan.

575
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,790
Yeah?

576
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,593
Oh, Dexter.
Hi.

577
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,073
Come on in. Come on in.
Thanks.

578
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,392
This Evelyn Vogel--
Quite a looker, that one.

579
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,519
Heh. You know her?
Yeah, I know her.

580
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,832
She consulted for us on
a couple cases when
I was a captain.

581
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,117
Last I heard,
she'd moved back to England.

582
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,836
I hadn't talked to her in years.
And she's here now...

583
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,874
Why? Because a killer took
a part of a victim's brain?

584
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,471
She called me up out of the blue, said
she'd moved back about a year ago.

585
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,514
She asked was I free for lunch,
I filled her in on the case,

586
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,519
she offered to help.
Why, is she being a pain in the ass?

587
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,316
No. I'm just trying to figure out
if she's an asset or not.

588
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,752
Oh. Well, she's smart.

589
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,753
So use her to your advantage.

590
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,514
Will do.

591
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,111
Why do you think she called now?
Like you said, out of the blue?

592
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,239
Maybe the stars aligned.

593
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,877
Maybe Mercury is in retrograde. I don't
really care the reason she called.

594
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,756
All I know is this is law enforcement.
You take whatever free help
you can get.

595
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,237
So keep her in the loop, Dexter.

596
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,074
Will do.

597
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,071
<i>What if I'm the reason she's here?</i>

598
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,160
Hey, when you talk to your sister, can
you tell her to check her messages?

599
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,955
She asked me for some help,
and now I can't reach her.

600
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,475
Will do.

601
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,592
Is this about, uh, Briggs?

602
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,677
No, she asked me to look into
this fence named El Sapo.

603
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,071
Nobody in Robbery's heard
of the guy.

604
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,352
All I know is
Briggs robbed the wrong store.

605
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,914
It belonged to some mob guy.

606
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,876
Now nobody's willing to buy what
he's selling except this El Sapo guy.

607
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,355
All right.

608
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,915
<i>El Sapo.</i>

609
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,634
Daddy.

610
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,757
Harrison, hey.

611
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,235
What a nice surprise.

612
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,154
No, not a surprise. We discussed this.
We did?

613
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,311
Dex, you know I love
working for you, but I need
an occasional night off.

614
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,314
Right. We discussed it.
Okay, I've got his dinner in here.

615
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,831
Spaghetti and meatballs,
green beans, chocolate pudding.

616
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,596
Yeah, about tonight, maybe we could--
Harrison, those are Daddy's things.

617
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,837
What's this?
Bye.

618
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,478
It's a very expensive centrifuge.

619
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,440
Come on,
let's get your dinner set up.

620
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,114
Pudding!
After dinner.

621
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,436
Pudding!

622
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,874
Hello?

623
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,035
I thought I made it clear.

624
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,318
You meet me here with the money,
and I take you to the stuff.

625
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,318
Yeah, I'll be alone.

626
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,760
Fucking El Sapo is "El Idiot."

627
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,316
When he comes here,
you keep yourself hidden, okay?

628
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,556
Why?

629
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,678
Because I don't know him.
Might be freaky.

630
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,116
I wanna go with you.
We talked about this.

631
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,877
I'm not doing anything
that might get you hurt.
I'll meet him outside.

632
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,279
You stay in here.

633
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,876
I love this guy.
I love that guy.

634
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,629
<i>El Sapo.</i>

635
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,275
<i>Real name: Javier Guzman.</i>

636
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,160
Harrison, please.

637
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,839
<i>Robbery didn't know the name El Sapo
because he's not a fence.</i>

638
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,272
<i>He's a hit man.</i>

639
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,714
Jesus, Harrison!

640
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,519
Look at what you did!

641
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,869
Uh, I'm sorry.

642
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,311
It's okay. I'm sorry I yelled.

643
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,318
It's okay.

644
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,398
Just give me a second.

645
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,392
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

646
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,240
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

647
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,234
Come on. We're going.

648
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,596
<i>If Deb is with Briggs
when El Sapo shows up,</i>

649
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,910
<i>he might take her out as well.</i>

650
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,875
<i>It's Joey Quinn. Thrill me.</i>

651
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,032
Quinn, it's Dexter. Call me.

652
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,559
The fuck!

653
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,077
Yeah! I'm coming!

654
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,999
The fuck?

655
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,639
Hey. You brought the kid.

656
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,995
What's going on?
You didn't answer your phone.

657
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,399
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Well, I need to get ahold of Deb.

658
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,354
And you need me for that, why?

659
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,315
I don't know where she is.

660
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,514
What do you mean, you don't know?
I just don't.

661
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,111
Look, I know she's in Fort Lauderdale.
I need to know where she's staying.

662
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,317
She talks to you.
Do you know where she is?

663
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,797
Yeah, the last she mentioned
she was at this place, the Pink Motel.

664
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,198
Some dump.
Thanks. Come on.

665
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,037
Was that Dexter?

666
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,793
Yeah. He was looking for Deb.

667
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,394
Fucking strange.

668
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,920
Hmm.

669
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,160
I don't want to talk about that.
Come here.

670
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,316
Mm.

671
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,635
Oh, my God. Why is the
whole world against us?

672
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,354
Ignore it.

673
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,397
<i>This is Jamie Batista.
Please leave a message.</i>

674
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,710
Jesus.

675
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,032
Doesn't anybody answer
their fucking phone?

676
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,200
We're going for a drive.
Okay, Daddy.

677
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,477
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

678
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,115
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

679
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,635
What the fuck?
I told you to stay away from here.

680
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,479
I know, but you're in danger.

681
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,194
Someone is gonna kill Briggs.

682
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,720
You need to come with me now.

683
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,237
The fuck I do.
Briggs is about to meet his fence.
I'm gonna make a fuckload of money.

684
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,995
That's who's gonna shoot him. I'm
trying to keep you from getting shot too.

685
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,271
That's bullshit.
No, it's not.

686
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,039
El Sapo isn't a fence. He's a hit man.

687
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,112
He's gonna get the jewels
and kill Briggs.

688
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,715
I know you don't wanna see me,
but I had to tell you.

689
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,037
All right, you told me.
It's very dangerous.

690
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,038
I get that.
You need to come with me.

691
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,675
You could die here.
I don't fucking care!

692
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,280
Deb.

693
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,434
What?

694
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,555
What, aren't you the one always saying
that bad people deserve to die?

695
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,515
You're not a bad person.
I killed LaGuerta.

696
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,518
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter?

697
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,951
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter,
it doesn't matter!

698
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,271
That's not what I meant! Come on!

699
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,836
Deb, it's been months of this.

700
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,719
You can't keep me away forever.

701
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,989
You don't understand anything,
do you?

702
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,510
I wake up every day,

703
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,037
thinking of every bad decision
that I ever made because of you.

704
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,438
And it kills me
that I can't take any of it back.

705
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,996
I'm sorry.

706
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,874
Don't fucking make that face
and say "I'm sorry" to me.

707
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,278
Even if it were fucking true,
it wouldn't make any difference.

708
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,791
Because we can't undo any of it.

709
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,670
So why don't you go back to your little
life and pretend everything's fine

710
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,470
but I can't do that
because I am not fucking like you!

711
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,270
We can talk about this later,

712
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,432
but you need to come--
No, we fucking can't.

713
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,398
You again?

714
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,430
Let's go.
Asshole, get your hands off her.

715
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,310
What the fuck?

716
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,113
What did you do?

717
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,235
I felt okay around him.

718
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,400
You didn't belong with him.

719
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,109
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!
Deb--

720
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,676
Will you fucking go? Will you go?

721
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,280
Please go.

722
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,755
I came here to save you.

723
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,280
No...

724
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,793
Deb, look at yourself. You're lost.

725
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,839
I am not lost.

726
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,634
I know exactly where I am.

727
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,277
I am in some shitty fucking hell,
which is exactly what I deserve.

728
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,960
But you...

729
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,552
You are lost.

730
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,960
All my life, I thought I needed you.

731
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,511
That I couldn't survive without you.
Fuck. Fuck.

732
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,030
It was the other fucking way around.

733
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,436
It was the other way around.

734
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,234
Deb--
Fucking go.

735
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,038
Don't-- I'll get rid of the body.

736
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,711
No, don't you fucking do anything,
all right? I'm gonna handle this.

737
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,553
But if El Sapo comes, he's a hit man--
He has no clue who I am.

738
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,877
If he comes and sees--
Would you fucking go?

739
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,753
I'm gonna call this in.

740
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,475
The police?
Yes.

741
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,478
You should go.

742
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,677
I'd like to report
a suspected homicide.

743
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,119
Go.

744
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,235
The Pink Motel in Broward.

745
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,710
Oh, fuck.

746
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,112
Harrison? Harrison?

747
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,551
Harrison! Harrison!

748
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,315
Daddy?

749
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,879
Come here, buddy. Oh.

750
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,037
I couldn't find you.

751
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,030
I'm here, buddy. I'm right here.

752
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,316
Where are we, Daddy?

753
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,959
<i>Lost.</i>

754
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,996
So you work
for Elway Investigations.

755
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,318
Did a skip trace on Briggs,
you went out for a sandwich,

756
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,274
and you found him dead
when you got back.

757
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,635
That's it.

758
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,071
Any idea who
might want to kill him?

759
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,880
No.

760
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,315
We'll call you
if we have any more questions.

761
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,836
Elway, I've got a good news,
bad news situation here.

762
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,596
Briggs is dead, but I think I have a lead
on where the jewellery might be

763
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,991
so we might have a shot
at coming out ahead

764
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,637
but I'm gonna talk to you about it
when I get to the office, okay? Bye.

765
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,839
Mm.

766
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,192
<i>Debra was right. I was wrong.</i>

767
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,312
<i>It's me who's lost.</i>

768
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,873
<i>A better person would let her go.
But I don't know how.</i>

769
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,479
<i>Without her,
I don't know who I am anymore.</i>

770
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,719
Dexter?

771
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,357
This isn't a good time.

772
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,273
I was hoping
to share something with you.

773
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,592
I told you I'm not in the mood
for this.

774
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,878
Well, then maybe I can
just leave this with you.

775
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,155
Dexter, please.
What is it you want?

776
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,630
Please let go.

777
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,871
You can't kill me.

778
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,434
Why?

779
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,792
Because I don't fit Harry's code.
