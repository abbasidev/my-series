00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,829
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,793
Who's the guy that dropped you off?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,514
We didn't sleep together.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,757
You are certainly allowed
to be a player.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,192
You remember Cassie, right?
Yeah.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,436
New neighbour. Hi.
Hi.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,120
I kind of need to leave.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,755
I'll take care of Jamie.
Maybe we could reschedule?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,559
Yeah. I'd like that.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,872
Any reason why you
haven't taken the exam?

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,959
I got your brother on my ass
about taking the sergeant's test--

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,231
What is so wrong about
bettering yourself?

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,635
You nailed it, bro.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,231
Is he your choice for sergeant?
I'm ready for more responsibility.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,830
I want you to strongly consider
making her sergeant.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,360
I think you may be my father.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,150
Family showing up out of nowhere?
A lot of times, they want something.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,551
I you to do a background check
on someone.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,320
You think she's here to rip you off?
I don't know.

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,836
Norma Rivera.

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,794
She'd been having an affair
with the boss, Ed Hamilton.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,957
Dad, what's going on?
The Hamilton's son.

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,351
Did you go to where
Norma Rivera was killed?

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,758
I did.
What did you see in your analysis?

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,798
Leave the kid alone.
He killed her.

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,191
You don't know that.
Your only witness recanted.

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,756
No reason to make enemies
unless we really have to.

28
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,792
Where's Yates?

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,799
So this is finally over.
My tormenter's dead.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,276
Thanks to you, Dexter.
And Deb.

31
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,711
I'm glad you found your way
back to each other.

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,798
Well, the family that kills together...

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,959
A few days ago, everything seemed
hopeless between Deb and me.

34
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,436
But through Dr. Vogel,
I've got my sister back.

35
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,120
It's beautiful out here, Dexter.

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,919
I wanted to be with family.

37
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,795
<i>Accidents happen,</i>

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,151
<i>shattering our sense of control,</i>

39
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,278
<i>if not our lives.</i>

40
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,035
<i>It's no accident
that Zach Hamilton is here.</i>

41
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,119
<i>He's drawn to blood, like me.</i>

42
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,519
<i>Did he kill Norma Rivera?</i>

43
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,356
<i>After a week of vetting him, I haven't
been able to find definitive proof.</i>

44
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,673
<i>But I'm sure if I keep following him
the truth will become clear.</i>

45
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,559
<i>Or it could get murkier.</i>

46
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,076
Dexter.

47
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,431
Have you taken on
Zach Hamilton as a patient?

48
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,835
It's nice to see you too.

49
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,158
I have to protect you from another
murderer? How did he get to you?

50
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,960
His father contacted me

51
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,915
because of my reputation
for working with psychopaths.

52
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,234
He's concerned about his son's
behaviour, his propensity for violence.

53
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,874
It's more than a propensity.

54
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,312
I think Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.

55
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,478
And I take it that
you followed him here today

56
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,672
because you're planning
to kill him?

57
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,078
The thought had
crossed my mind, yes,
if I can find solid proof.

58
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,871
Well, then it would seem
that we have a conflict of interest.

59
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,197
I don't believe this.

60
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,716
You're going to work with another killer
after what happened with Yates?

61
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,834
Dexter, I appreciate your concern,

62
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,829
but I'm not going to talk about
Zach Hamilton with you any further.

63
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,120
It wouldn't be ethical.

64
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,437
Suddenly,
you're worried about ethics?

65
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,070
I know. I threw them out
the window when I met you

66
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,351
because my life was on the line.

67
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,518
Now the threat is over.

68
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,916
You're bringing another threat
into your life.

69
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,397
It's my work. What can I say?

70
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,951
I treat dangerous people.

71
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,793
It's a hazard of the job.

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,514
Besides, you have no proof

73
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,951
that Zach Hamilton
is guilty of anything.

74
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,796
I will.

75
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,634
If you do,

76
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,797
then come to see me first,

77
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,554
before you do anything,

78
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,195
and we'll have
another conversation.

79
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,232
Would you do me that favour?

80
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,959
We'll see.

81
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,909
Maybe this is why
she tracked me down, for money.

82
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,873
You don't know that.

83
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,640
I mean, maybe she genuinely
wanted to get to know you.

84
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,560
What, at the same time
her Hyundai's being repossessed?

85
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,070
Has she asked you for money?
No.

86
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,557
But she always seems
to be missing her purse
when the check comes.

87
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,590
I thought we had a real connection.
You like having Niki in your life?

88
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,632
I do.
Then why don't you wait it out

89
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,997
and see how it plays out?

90
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,114
In the meantime,
you can enjoy her company.

91
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,634
Okay.

92
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,599
Hm, heh.
Thanks, Deb.

93
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,399
Welcome.

94
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,360
Deb, got a new case.

95
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,520
Let me guess, someone suspects their
significant other is fucking around.

96
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,511
Yeah, but this one
is a bit different.

97
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,519
How?
Because the person is me

98
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,200
and the significant other

99
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,040
is my sister's ass-chasing,
shithead boyfriend.

100
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,072
Kevin Wyman, notorious player,

101
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,193
frequents a singles bar in a hotel
where he keeps a suite.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,878
Have you tried talking to her?

103
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,150
Susan doesn't listen to me.

104
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,591
It'd just push her
more quickly into his arms.

105
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,029
So that's off the table.

106
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,756
Well, going behind her back
seems kind of fucked up.

107
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,680
It's gotta be this way.
I gotta catch this guy in the act.

108
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,599
Okay, but you're doing it
by yourself.

109
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,200
I need your help on this, Deb.

110
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,510
It'd be a lot less conspicuous

111
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,399
if we work this as a couple.

112
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,751
Well, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable.

113
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,156
Well, are you comfortable
getting a pay cheque?

114
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,795
Okay, boss.

115
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,433
Thank you.

116
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,671
Where does this piece go?

117
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,759
Right here.

118
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,800
Very good.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,593
Dex?

120
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,355
Don't forget, my birthday picnic's
in a few days, okay?

121
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,069
On the beach, outside of Papa's.
Bring Harrison.

122
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,158
Yeah, we'll be there.
Great.

123
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,313
You know who else
will be there? Cassie.

124
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,749
I heard you have a date with her.

125
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,076
No, it's not a date.

126
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,155
I felt like I owed her one after we both
bailed on your dinner the other night.

127
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,511
Why won't you just admit
that you like her

128
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,712
and that I am an
awesome matchmaker?

129
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,271
I admit that you're an awesome nanny.
You'll have to settle for that.

130
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,552
We'll revisit this after the date.

131
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,360
Oh, by the way,

132
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,233
the TV remote has

133
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,510
been missing since yesterday.

134
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,433
I think somebody hid it

135
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,514
but I can't get anything
out of him.

136
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,117
Harrison, did you
take the TV remote?

137
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,595
No.

138
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,554
Do you know where it is?
No.

139
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,156
He says he didn't take it.

140
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,470
Right.

141
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,195
Guess I'll just keep looking for it.

142
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,115
Homicide in Liberty City.

143
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,358
It looks like you're gonna have
to finish that puzzle on your own.

144
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,597
I'm doing all the work anyway.

145
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,956
Yeah, you are.

146
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,072
Bye.
Bye.

147
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,759
Welcome to spatter-land.

148
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,314
Hope you brought extra string.

149
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,597
Never leave home without it.

150
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,350
Good news.

151
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,637
We have the victim's boyfriend
in custody.

152
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,309
A witness saw him
taking off from the scene,

153
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,512
and he forgot to change
his bloody socks.

154
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,473
Heh. God bless stupid killers.

155
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,353
<i>Once again, drawn to blood.</i>

156
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,557
<i>Looks like Zach has just given me
the in I need.</i>

157
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,076
Zach Hamilton, right?

158
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,953
You were at my house.

159
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,316
That's right.

160
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,315
You guys find out
who killed Norma?

161
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,674
No luck. It's a dead end.

162
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,800
You like to shoot crime scenes?

163
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,919
Yeah, I got a police scanner
app on my phone.

164
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,600
Better than playing video games.

165
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,594
You ever been on the other side
of the yellow tape?

166
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,760
Nope.
This is as close as I've gotten.

167
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,950
Well, come on.

168
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,111
Are you serious?
Yeah, just don't touch anything.

169
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,553
Whoa.

170
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,432
This is amazing.

171
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,038
<i>I remember that feeling.
Awe, wonder.</i>

172
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,356
<i>It only fed the urge.</i>

173
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,029
Hey, can I take some pictures?

174
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,556
It's usually against protocol,

175
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,029
but what the hell? Go ahead.

176
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,397
Cool. Thanks.

177
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,990
So, what happened to her?

178
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,714
She was stabbed.

179
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,435
Yeah, obviously.
But, like, you know, how?

180
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,719
<i>If I open up to him,
maybe he'll open up to me.</i>

181
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,434
Come on. I can handle it.

182
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,077
Well, the victim
tried to defend herself.

183
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,232
There were defensive
wounds on her body

184
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,559
but you can also tell by these
big, round drops on the ground.

185
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,998
And this multiple cast-off spatter

186
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,352
suggests that she was
stabbed several times.

187
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,280
And the arterial spurting here

188
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,359
indicates that the killer
severed her carotid artery

189
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,233
with the first stab.

190
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,959
You can tell all that
just by looking at the blood?

191
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,990
Pretty much.

192
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,473
Awesome.

193
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,831
So I heard you caught
the guy who did it.

194
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,872
Yeah, her boyfriend.
How?

195
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,073
He was sloppy.
Left a bloody print and DNA.

196
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,471
He was spotted
driving away from the scene.

197
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,353
Oh, yeah? What kind of car?

198
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,916
<i>Must have heard his Porsche
was seen at Norma's apartment.</i>

199
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,355
No one noticed.

200
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,272
So the killer,

201
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,431
he should've worn gloves
and long sleeves,

202
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,120
made sure
he was covered up.

203
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,119
<i>He's making this a teaching moment.</i>

204
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,275
Well, yeah, if he was smart.

205
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,875
<i>The kid's a quick study,</i>

206
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,515
<i>but that doesn't prove
he killed Norma Rivera.</i>

207
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,711
So, hey, I gotta get going,
but thanks.

208
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,632
Hey, why don't you give me a call
when you print those up?

209
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,832
I'd love to take a look.

210
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,519
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

211
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,755
<i>Time to make another connection.</i>

212
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,712
Here you go.
Thank you.

213
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,230
Thank you
for doing this with me.

214
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,558
When you own a food truck,
you have to scope out
the competition.

215
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,274
Plus I just really love to eat.

216
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,556
Yeah, no problem.

217
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,036
I wouldn't miss these peanut butter
and Nutella fries for anything.

218
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,754
Mm-hm.

219
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,516
So you're indulging me
in my favourite pastime.

220
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,359
What do you like to do for fun?

221
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,995
You know, normal stuff.

222
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,233
Like what?

223
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,630
Um...
Heh, heh.

224
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,917
I like spending time with my son.

225
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,316
I already know you're
a great dad. What else?

226
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,270
I love my job.

227
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,560
But that's work.
What are you passionate about?

228
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,994
I like to bowl.

229
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,873
You're passionate about bowling?

230
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,678
No. Heh.
Heh, heh.

231
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,678
Of course not.

232
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,475
I just do it for fun, once in a while.

233
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,717
What about your weekends
or your free time?

234
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,640
Oh, I have a boat.

235
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,115
Oh, I love to sail.

236
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,677
No, it's a motorboat.

237
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,997
Oh. You water-ski?

238
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,720
No.

239
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,520
Race?
No.

240
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,033
Do you scuba dive?

241
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,994
No.

242
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,755
Heh, heh.
What do you do on your boat?

243
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,480
I just...

244
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,679
Take it out and...

245
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,552
Turn around and come back.

246
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,076
That's it?

247
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,556
<i>That's all I can tell you.</i>

248
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,793
I think we may need
some alcohol.

249
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,234
Right.

250
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,035
<i>Dating is harder than I remember.</i>

251
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,713
Oh, this guy is fucking pathetic.

252
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,520
I get that you hate the guy,
but looking isn't cheating.

253
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,632
It's a slow night.
Give him a minute.

254
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,239
So you said Susan
doesn't listen.

255
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,909
Does that mean you all
have a strained relationship?

256
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,600
Not from my end, no.

257
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,313
But from hers?

258
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,959
Yeah, you know, probably.

259
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,599
I mean, look, I couldn't wait
to get away from my old man,

260
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,393
and Susan was just a kid.

261
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,560
You know, I should have
at least picked up the phone.

262
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,109
But I never did,
you know, so...

263
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,790
Well, you can't undo the past.

264
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,000
And families fuck you up.
That's just the way it is.

265
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,120
I can stop Susan from
fucking up her future.
I can do that.

266
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,515
It looks like he's
packing it in for the night.

267
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,116
If you wanna catch this guy,
why don't I set him up?

268
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,392
We can see if he takes the bait.
No, I don't want you doing that.

269
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,439
I worked Vice. I've done
worse than that before.

270
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,751
I just need pictures
of him hitting on you.

271
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,553
Certainly nothing
more than that.

272
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,114
Are you sure?

273
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,990
I mean, I could marry him,
maybe pop out a couple of babies.

274
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,914
Let's go.

275
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,192
Dexter, thanks for coming.
Sure.

276
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,792
Couldn't wait to show you
these photos.

277
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,912
Yeah, no problem.
It's on my way to work.

278
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,236
Doughnut?

279
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,229
Fucking A.

280
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,236
Mm.

281
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,959
Well?

282
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,351
<i>He treats the blood
like a swimsuit model.</i>

283
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,753
Well,

284
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,119
very colourful.

285
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,870
You know, a lot of photographers
like to mute down their reds.

286
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,794
You know,
find it too distracting,

287
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,350
but I like to ride the saturation.

288
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,795
Hm.

289
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,074
You think I overdid it?

290
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,752
No way. These are you.

291
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,474
That's the important thing.

292
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,360
Well, I can work you up
some prints, if you want.

293
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,954
I wouldn't have them
if it weren't for you.

294
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,312
Actually, I think I have
plenty of my own.

295
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,840
Right.

296
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,475
Of course.
I forget it was a crime scene.

297
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,594
Keep thinking that dead chick
spilled all that blood just for me.

298
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,840
Who's she?

299
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,434
Uh, it's nothing.

300
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,359
Just a lens test.

301
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,075
New 300 millimetre.
Fucking monster.

302
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,270
Wow.

303
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,120
Excuse me.

304
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,680
Yep?

305
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,194
Jesus, you still drunk from last night
or are you starting a new bender?

306
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,070
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I said okay.

307
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,991
Uh, I gotta go.

308
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,436
Anything wrong?
It's fine. I just gotta go.

309
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,119
Sure, some other time then.

310
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,759
<i>I'll have to find another way
to get to him.</i>

311
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,036
Ah, lieutenant.

312
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,993
Tell me something.

313
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,237
Did you decide
you don't need a sergeant?

314
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,875
Sir?
I expected an announcement by now.

315
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,116
What's going on?

316
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,919
To tell you the truth, I'm having trouble
narrowing down my choice.

317
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,311
I know you want me to pick Miller,
and on paper, I can't argue with that.

318
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,319
Scored higher on the test,
got the experience, the record--

319
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,398
She's African-American,
a woman.

320
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,798
Here's the thing,
Quinn has his attributes too.

321
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,956
Name one.

322
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,196
He's street-smart.

323
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,078
Look, I know what's going on here.

324
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,556
What do you mean?
You want me to be the bad guy.

325
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,996
You want me to insist
that you promote Miller.

326
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,431
That way you can tell Quinn,
"I had no choice."

327
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,956
I'm not sure that's--
You're lieutenant now.

328
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,640
Time to grow a set of balls.

329
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,435
I wanna hear something
by the end of the day.

330
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,390
Just like old times, huh?

331
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,874
You, me, steak, beer.

332
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,072
Yeah, it's been a while.

333
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,035
So how are things?

334
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,550
Good, great. You?

335
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,798
Fine. Better.

336
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,432
Good. I'm glad.

337
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,593
Me too.

338
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,759
I think these are done.

339
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,236
Well, how's work?

340
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,432
Uh, crazy.

341
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,520
Elway wants to catch his sister's
boyfriend fucking around on her,

342
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,798
so I offered myself as bait
so he'd get it done.

343
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,390
What--? You did what?

344
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,438
I used to do it
all the time in Vice.

345
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,996
Yeah, and you hated it.

346
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,032
Why put yourself
in that position again?

347
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,754
Because he's my boss.

348
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,351
And because I can only take
one control freak at a time.

349
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,594
Sorry.

350
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,399
This is tough.

351
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,676
A little.

352
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,515
Not exactly worth living for.

353
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,393
What?

354
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,800
You said that once
when you tasted one of my steaks,

355
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,559
that it was worth living for.

356
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,520
For some reason,
I've always remembered that.

357
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,750
It'll get easier, Dex.

358
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,156
We're just getting
back in the saddle, you know?

359
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,398
Yeah, I think we might be
eating a saddle.

360
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,276
Are you still seeing Dr. Vogel?

361
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,678
Yeah, it's too bad for me
there's no magic pill to cure PTSD.

362
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,352
Well, as long as she's helping you.

363
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,840
Like, she knows everything
about our lives because of Dad,

364
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,639
but I know jack shit about her.

365
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,672
Where'd she get
that fucking accent?

366
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,991
And who the fuck is Rich?

367
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,200
Her husband.
She was married?

368
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,039
When I first looked into her,

369
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,471
I found out some stuff
about her background,

370
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,474
and she was married
to a Dr. Richard Vogel.

371
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,200
Huh.

372
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,039
Okay, so Harrison's asleep.
And look what I found under his bed.

373
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,560
Ooh, someone's in trouble.

374
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,955
He lied about it.

375
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,514
At least now we know why.

376
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,313
I hope it's under warranty,

377
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,912
or I'll be stuck with whatever's on
PBS Kids for the foreseeable future.

378
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,952
I'll talk to him.
Okay.

379
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,635
Enjoy your dinner, guys.
Bye.

380
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,116
Should I be worried
that Harrison's lying?

381
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,391
He's 4, doofus.

382
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,114
Right.

383
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,276
This steak tastes like asshole.
Yeah.

384
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,273
Let's order pizza.

385
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,800
With pineapple, please.

386
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,957
Not on my half.

387
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,313
Sorry, cow.

388
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,514
What's up?

389
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,591
I'm promoting Miller to sergeant.

390
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,800
Say that again?

391
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,398
I'm giving Miller the job. I'm sorry.

392
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,752
I just think she's
the most qualified candidate.

393
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,397
Are you fucking kidding me?
I mean, after all the quizzes,

394
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,956
and the speeches
about bettering my life?

395
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,356
You actually made me want this,

396
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,592
and now you're gonna take it away.

397
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,951
Why, because I didn't solve
the Rivera case?

398
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,560
No, of course not.

399
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,753
It's just a lot of other stuff
I can't ignore, man.

400
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,916
The Nadia thing,
shooting Novikov.

401
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,270
You know what? Fuck it.

402
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,915
You did what you thought was right.

403
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,799
Leave it at that.

404
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,234
Hey.

405
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,672
I need everything you got
on the Norma Rivera case,

406
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,640
anything that points
to Zach Hamilton.

407
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,000
Uh, well, forensically,
there's not much.
There's nothing, actually.

408
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,949
Fuck it. I'll just tail the little prick 24/7
until I get what I need.

409
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,913
<i>If Quinn's stalking Zach, how can I?</i>

410
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,197
Won't even know I'm there
till I bust him.

411
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,318
You mind if I come along?

412
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,633
You want to come along?

413
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,876
Things are slow here.
I'm going a little stir-crazy.

414
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,952
Maybe you could use
another set of eyes?

415
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,194
Sure.

416
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,751
I mean, you think
Miller's clean? Come on.

417
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,270
You dig deep enough
on anyone in this department

418
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,477
and you know what you find?

419
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,752
What?
The shit.

420
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,952
It's there. I mean, we all got it.

421
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,317
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

422
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,749
Yeah, I can't argue with that.
We've all got the shit.

423
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,360
Yeah.

424
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,120
Big difference is some people
get away with theirs

425
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,039
and some people don't.

426
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,912
You're a good detective.
It'll work out.

427
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,794
Yeah, I'm just worried about
how Jamie's going to take it.

428
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,437
I think she was all excited
about me moving up in the world,

429
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,637
making something out of my life.

430
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,833
She'll probably break up
with my ass now.

431
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,678
Jesus Christ, how many pictures
of fucking women in tights

432
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,234
does this pervert need?

433
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,718
Apparently, a lot.

434
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,711
How's Deb doing?
I've been worried about her.

435
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,273
She's good. She's much better.

436
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,440
You guys work out
whatever your issue was?

437
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,710
What do you mean?

438
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,755
I mean, you guys have
been connected at the hip
for most of your lives.

439
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,232
All of a sudden, you're not talking,
you don't see each other.

440
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,391
Somebody shit
in somebody's Cheerios.

441
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,114
Yeah.

442
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,156
Just typical brother and sister stuff.
It's no big deal.

443
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,595
Something had her fucked up.

444
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,674
How weird was it that
she confessed to killing LaGuerta?

445
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,599
<i>I should have stayed in my office.</i>

446
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,757
What was that about?

447
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,518
<i>That's the woman in the photo
that Zach didn't want me to see.</i>

448
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,597
<i>And he isn't looking at the class,
he's looking at her.</i>

449
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,435
You know what I'm saying?

450
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,915
<i>Fortunately, Quinn isn't.</i>

451
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,469
Well, people do weird stuff
when they're under a lot of stress.

452
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,354
We may never know
what that was all about.

453
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,153
All right, see you guys later.

454
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,558
Looks like they're done.
- So is our guy
.

455
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,876
Buckle up.

456
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,554
Hey.
Hey.

457
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,235
Wow. Okay. Uh...
What?

458
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,591
You look incredible.
Good job.

459
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,440
Well, that's the point.
Don't look so fucking surprised.

460
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,155
Didn't leave me a lot of places
to put the transmitter.

461
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,716
Are you bitching? I'm the one
helping you, remember?

462
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,112
I just don't wanna touch
anything I'm not supposed to.

463
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,680
Here.

464
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,279
Thank you.

465
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,120
Mic?
There you go.

466
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,755
I'm not looking.
I'm not looking.

467
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,436
Okay.
Okay?

468
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,552
Yep.
All right.

469
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,358
Quickly
,
just say something for me.

470
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,358
You blush like a little girl.

471
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,558
Heh, heh. Okay, just...

472
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,909
Just get him alone.
That's all I need, okay?

473
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,840
Okay.
Thank you.

474
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,991
I'm really glad we met.

475
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,519
Me too.

476
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,000
You know, I didn't know
if I mentioned it,

477
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,391
but tonight's kind of a celebration.

478
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,398
Yeah?

479
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,196
Closed a huge deal.

480
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,199
Two blocks downtown,
prime views of the bay.

481
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,677
It's gonna rent through the roof
and I get a big piece of it.

482
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,351
Something tells me you like
getting a big piece of everything.

483
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,352
Whenever I can manage.

484
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,835
Congratulations.

485
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,269
Thank you.

486
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,750
I just wish I had a present for you.

487
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,520
What do you say we migrate
to my suite?

488
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,280
Got a nice little private bar.

489
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,080
It's a lot quieter than this place.

490
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,239
All done here.

491
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,638
You're gonna love the views.
It's beautiful.

492
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,951
Nice, light music.

493
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,994
It'll be real nice.
No, save it for the room.

494
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,760
What, you playing hard to get?
I don't kiss in public.

495
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,639
You're bashful.
Mm-hm. Maybe.

496
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,430
Get your fucking hands off of her!

497
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,235
Jesus, Elway.

498
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,996
The hell is going on?

499
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,795
She's wired, douche bag.
You're done.

500
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,229
You fucking son of a bitch.

501
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,194
You're gonna call Susan tonight.
Tell her it's over.

502
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,830
If you don't, she's getting an e-mail.
You got it?

503
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,318
You got it?

504
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,591
Yeah, I got it.
Good.

505
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,359
You're an asshole.

506
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,754
The fuck are you thinking?

507
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,157
I'm sorry, all right? I just--

508
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,798
Seeing him paw all over you like that,
I don't like that shit.

509
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,275
I'm sorry about your top.

510
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,075
That's okay. It's all right. I got it.

murder weapon in hand.</i>

524
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,431
<i>All the proof I need.</i>

525
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,477
You wanted proof. There it is.

526
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,592
Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.

527
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,516
Yes. I know.

528
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,798
You know?
Mm.

529
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,031
Zach told me
during our first session.

530
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,835
But you didn't tell me
because of your sense of ethics?

531
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,311
Oh, forget ethics.

532
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,036
Why would I help facilitate the death
of someone I see potential in?

533
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,277
Potential? He's a killer.
He deserves to die.

534
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,878
Heh, heh.
Isn't that a little intolerant,
coming from you?

535
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,719
I don't kill innocent people.

536
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,393
But you might have,

537
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,312
if it hadn't been for Harry and me.

538
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,355
You could even
be on death row right now.

539
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,233
Right.

540
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,552
But you were spared.
Yeah, spared because of the code.

541
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,109
That's an interesting idea.

542
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,720
What do you mean?

543
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,750
What if we were
to teach Zach the code?

544
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,276
You can't be serious.
Why not?

545
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,678
It never occurred to me to try again,

546
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,116
because I didn't have Harry.

547
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,757
But now I have you.

548
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,197
Maybe it's time to see

549
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,674
if the experiment will work.

550
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,553
This isn't a science project.

551
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,151
No, but it's a matter of life and death.

552
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,000
Zach's life is on the line.

553
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,114
What possibly makes you think
Zach could be taught the code?

554
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,036
I told you, I see something in him.
And it worked with you.

555
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,034
Zach and I are nothing alike.
No, of course not.

556
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,034
You are definitely one of a kind.

557
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,994
He killed an innocent
and he's getting ready to do it again.

558
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,919
He needs to die.

559
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,519
<i>Harrison.
I never intended to have a son,</i>

560
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,834
<i>but now he's the one thing in my life
that seems most right.</i>

561
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,952
There she is!

562
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,276
Hi!

563
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,391
Yay! Aw. Mwah.

564
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,718
Happy birthday.
Aw, thanks, Dex. Thank you.

565
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,956
Can I go play?

566
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,835
Yeah, sure. Have fun.

567
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,316
Stay close, Harrison.

568
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,836
Yeah, I'm--

569
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,993
I'm not sure if he's a date
or just a friend.

570
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,590
I mean, what I do know
is that she's very attractive,

571
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,876
and men like her,

572
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,720
so if you want a chance,
you better move fast.

573
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,039
Right.

574
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,753
I think I'm gonna go grab a beer.

575
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,112
You know, this may sound weird,

576
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,392
and I don't mean
to sound creepy or anything,

577
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,432
but I think I really like you.

578
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,518
Aw, I like you too.

579
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,477
I'm not really ready
to call you "Dad,"

580
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,354
but you're cool.

581
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,553
"Cool"? Usually, I'm the only one
that calls me that.

582
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,274
So that's awesome.

583
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,234
Oh, hey. I got you something.

584
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,114
What?
It's really not a big deal.

585
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,154
It's not a big deal?
You're giving me $5000? Why?

586
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,829
Hey, I know
you could really use it.

587
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,112
But you should know that
that's really all that I can afford.

588
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,198
I don't understand.
How do you know that?

589
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,039
Well, you know,

590
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,072
I just did a little research on you.

591
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,996
You checked into me?
Like a criminal?

592
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,032
No, I just wanted to make sure

593
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,038
you were who you said you were.

594
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,556
And that I wasn't after you
for your money?

595
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,432
I just--
Look, I have debts,

596
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,154
but they're soon to be paid,

597
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,431
and that's not really
any of your business.

598
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,552
I wouldn't ask you for this.

599
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,989
I'm really sorry.

600
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,635
Do you understand that it was
hard for me to do this?

601
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,916
To find my father?

602
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,430
But I felt like it was worth it
to get to know you.

603
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,553
You know, maybe I was wrong.
Here you go. No, thank you.

604
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,916
Hey, Niki--

605
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,476
All right, everyone.
I'd like to make a toast.

606
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,317
To the best kid sister
a guy could ever have, Jamie.

607
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,789
Aw.
Aw. Thank you.

608
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,229
I love you.
Happy birthday.

609
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,073
I love you too.

610
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,509
Aw, thank you, guys.

611
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,313
Thank you so much for coming.

612
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,355
You guys are the best,
and it really is so nice
to have you all

613
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,199
here in one place together.

614
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,676
I love you guys. Cheers.

615
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,477
Happy birthday.

616
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,793
And here's to you, Sergeant Quinn.

617
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,875
I know it's premature--

618
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,753
Way premature.
You didn't tell her?

619
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,395
I didn't want to upset her
on her birthday.

620
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,354
No.

621
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,831
You didn't get the job?

622
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,195
You didn't give it to him?

623
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,835
I had to go with the person
best for the job.

624
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,190
And how is that not Joey?

625
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,596
Hey, it's okay.
He gave the promotion to Miller.

626
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,836
It's, you know...

627
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,430
But going for sergeant
was your idea in the first place.

628
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,914
You set him up.

629
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,032
I didn't mean to.
Jesus, Angel.

630
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,233
Hey.
Dexter, hi.

631
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
How are you?
I'm great. You?

632
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,317
Great. Nice party, huh?

633
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,079
Yeah.

634
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,633
The beach.

635
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,634
Yeah. Harrison looks like
he's having a really nice time.

636
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,473
Yep.

637
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,310
Uh, Dexter, this is Oliver.
Oliver, Dexter.

638
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,080
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.

639
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,159
I didn't know if you wanted
the Belgian brown or the pilsner,

640
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,431
so I got you the one
with the moose on it.

641
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,871
Can't go wrong with a moose.
Heh, heh, heh.

642
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,159
I'm gonna go check on Harrison.

643
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,990
Okay, take care.

644
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,353
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, that's great.

645
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,791
- That's your neighbour, right?
- Yes.

646
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,840
What happened with Susan?
Wyman break up with her?

647
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,838
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

648
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,516
So it's a win.

649
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,116
Why do you look like someone
just ran over your dog?

650
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,552
I just got off the phone with her
and she couldn't stop crying.

651
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,474
She thinks it's all her fault,

652
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,559
like somehow, she's not
good enough or something.

653
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,719
Well, she would've caught him
cheating eventually.

654
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,389
The result
would have been the same.

655
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,151
Yeah, but it wouldn't be me
that made her cry.

656
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,516
Jesus, I just feel like shit.

657
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,232
People can't help
sticking their noses in

658
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,193
when it's someone
they care about.

659
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,313
I know.

660
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,160
I know. You tried to tell me.

661
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,952
So does that mean
you care about me?

662
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,871
Only to the extent
that you sign my pay cheque.

663
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,873
Touché.

664
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,676
Okay, what are we
gonna read tonight?
Let me guess, <i>Wee Monkeys.</i>

665
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,473
<i>Wee Monkeys!</i>

666
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,196
Before I read to you,
I gotta talk to you
about the TV remote.

667
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,800
You said you didn't take it,

668
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,430
but Jamie found it
under your bed.

669
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,354
I didn't mean to break it.

670
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,597
I was pretending
it was a Thunder Blaster

671
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,230
and I dropped it in the kitchen.

672
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,352
Well, yeah, that's okay.
Accidents happen.

673
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,279
But you lied to me.
That's a big deal.

674
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,312
We should never lie.

675
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,112
But, Daddy,

676
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,752
you lie.

677
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,073
What do you mean?

678
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,080
You told me Doggy got lost.

679
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,840
I saw you throw him in the trash.

680
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,350
I had to rescue him.

681
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,037
You're right. I lied.

682
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,872
Doggy got dirty,
and I tried to clean him up,

683
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,800
and when I couldn't,
I threw him away.

684
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,910
I'm sorry I lied to you, Harrison.

685
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,680
That's okay.
But can I keep him?

686
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,519
I really love him.

687
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,155
<i>He's soaked in blood
that links me to a murder.</i>

688
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,114
Yeah, but maybe
he should live under the bed.

689
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,551
Okay.
Okay.

690
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,989
<i>Wee Monkeys.</i>

691
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,157
<i>Wee Monkeys!</i>

692
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,956
<i>It's no accident,
Harrison catching me in a lie.</i>

693
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,350
<i>I can live with my lies,
but how long can Harrison</i>

694
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,120
<i>before he finally sees through?</i>

695
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,158
I should be back
in a few hours.

696
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,114
Sorry to keep you late
on your birthday.

697
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,119
Trust me, it'll probably be
the highlight of my day.

698
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,518
<i>Vogel doesn't want me to kill Zach,
but she's wrong about him.</i>

699
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,871
<i>He deserves nothing but my table.</i>

700
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,798
<i>He's here.</i>

701
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,756
Hey, Zach, it's Dexter.

702
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,073
<i>Where is he?</i>

703
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,395
<i>Why would Zach buy a car
for $1200?</i>

704
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,115
<i>Because the one mistake
he made with Norma Rivera</i>

705
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,750
<i>was showing up to kill her
in a red Porsche.</i>

706
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,350
<i>He's going to kill Sofia tonight.</i>

707
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,160
<i>Cypress Harbour Yacht Club.</i>
Hi.

708
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,239
Could you tell me
if Sofia Fuentes is working tonight?

709
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,194
<i>She gets off here in a few minutes.</i>
Thank you.

710
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,233
<i>Zach, waiting to make his move.</i>

711
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,071
<i>And Quinn,
still trying to prove he's a good cop.</i>

712
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,792
Hey, Dex.
<i>Hey.</i>

713
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,357
Look, this is probably
none of my business,

714
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,280
but I feel like I should
tell you about Quinn.

715
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,996
Okay.

716
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,197
He thinks you're gonna
break up with him.

717
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,800
<i>Break up with him? Why?</i>

718
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,838
Because he didn't make sergeant.

719
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,069
That's crazy.

720
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,430
Why would he think that?

721
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,714
Maybe you should, um, invite him over.
I think he's feeling pretty down.

722
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,758
<i>Yeah. Yeah, of course.</i>

723
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,392
Thanks, Dex, for calling.
That really is so sweet of you.

724
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,790
Sure.

725
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,280
<i>Quinn problem solved.</i>

726
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,110
<i>And there's Sofia.</i>

727
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,633
<i>Zach's father.</i>

728
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,199
<i>Sofia is Hamilton's mistress,
just like Norma before her.</i>

729
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,437
<i>What is he doing?</i>

730
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,790
Hey.

731
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,559
I know what you're doing.

732
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,955
Quinn.

733
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,109
You playing detective?
Watching Zach?

734
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,794
Yeah, you caught me.

735
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,477
I'm going to see Jamie.
Keep an eye on Zach.

736
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,434
Jesus. What the fuck?

737
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,512
What are you doing?

738
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,676
Why were you going
to kill your father?

739
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,396
What? I wasn't trying to kill my--
I know you killed Norma Rivera.

740
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,230
I thought you were going to kill Sofia,
but you were going after your father.

741
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,159
Why?
You're crazy.

742
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,875
I didn't try and kill my father.

743
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,194
You tell me one more lie,
and I'll kill you.

744
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,793
I had to.

745
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,191
Why?
Because he's killing my mother.

746
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,432
She's drinking herself to death
because of him.

747
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,797
Over the years,
one affair after another,

748
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,560
and he doesn't
even try and hide it.

749
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,152
I thought killing Norma
would put an end to it,

750
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,232
but two days later,

751
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,557
he's banging some hostess
from the club.

752
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,713
I knew if I wanted it to stop,

753
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,116
I had to kill Dad.

754
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,791
So that's what this is all about,

755
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,469
you trying to protect your mother?

756
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,473
You actually care about her?

757
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,351
Of course I do. She's my mother.

758
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,438
But showing up at crime scenes,

759
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,836
accidents,

760
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,753
taking pictures of all the blood.

761
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,792
This is about more than
just your mother.

762
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,559
No, I had to protect her.

763
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,190
Yeah, I believe you.

764
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,030
But you killed because you want to kill.
No.

765
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,272
Yes.

766
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,760
To take a living person

767
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,751
and make them dead,

768
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,713
imagining that you can
actually hear the moment

769
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,310
when their heart stops beating,

770
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,876
smell the blood
as it pools across the floor.

771
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,872
I can't help it.

772
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,960
It just builds up inside me

773
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,272
all these years.

774
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,234
But Norma was the first time
I ever followed through.

775
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,318
And how was it,

776
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,440
once you'd killed her?

777
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,116
It felt like this huge weight

778
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,636
was lifted off my chest,

779
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:02,154
this release of something
horrible inside me.

780
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,435
Like you were finally in control.

781
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,279
Yes.

782
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,949
You should just
go ahead and kill me.

783
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,996
Why?

784
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,840
Because if you don't,
I know I'll do it again.

785
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,279
I don't want to be like this,
but I can't help it.

786
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,679
I just am.

787
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,872
I'm some kind of freak.

788
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,799
A monster.

789
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,234
Yes.

790
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,872
You haven't told anyone else
about this?

791
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,077
Besides Dr. Vogel.

792
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,920
No, I couldn't.

793
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,949
You never had a Harry.

794
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,713
A what?

795
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,396
Someone to talk to.

796
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,957
Someone to teach you.

797
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,396
<i>Some things happen to us
by accident.</i>

798
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,792
<i>Others are choices.</i>

799
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,352
<i>There are parts of me that I can
never share with my own son.</i>

800
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,438
<i>But with Zach,</i>

801
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,838
<i>could I teach him?</i>

802
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,077
<i>Am I ready for this,</i>

803
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,199
<i>to be a spiritual father?</i>

804
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,400
So how'd your sting go with Elway?

805
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,958
Terribly.

806
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,433
Didn't work out?

807
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,430
No, it worked out fine, but--

808
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,633
What?

809
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,233
He likes me.

810
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,034
Oh.

811
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,790
That's a bad thing?

812
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,516
Well, he likes me because he doesn't
know a fucking thing about me.

813
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,474
"Yeah, I killed two people
and tried to kill myself and my brother.

814
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,195
But, sorry, what kind of wine
would you like to order?"

815
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,120
I mean, what the fuck?

816
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,677
Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.

817
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,156
How are things with Cassie?

818
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,514
Um...

819
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,477
I don't think there's
much of a future there.

820
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,514
Maybe the Morgans just
aren't meant for relationships.

821
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,797
Yeah, maybe not.

822
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,109
But, hey, life is good.

823
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,755
I'm feeling optimistic
for the first time in a while.

824
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,839
I'm even thinking about
taking on a kind of...

825
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,840
Intern.

826
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,554
Hm...

827
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,877
Well, that's a big step for you, right?

828
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,040
Letting some novice
into your private lab.

829
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,794
Yeah.

830
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,597
Hey, are you okay?

831
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,951
I don't feel so good.

832
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,438
What's wrong?

833
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,076
I feel kind of dizzy.

834
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,634
Deb?

835
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,952
Hello, Dexter.

836
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,957
Remember me?
