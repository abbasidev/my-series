1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,879
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,440
What did you do to Yates?

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,714
He has a scar exactly
where your killer has been
harvesting brain fragments.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,355
High heels are
a far cry from brains.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,876
It's not exactly
your killer's usual MO.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,760
Albert wouldn't be
the first to alter his methods.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,111
She's found herself a hero.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,917
I know her. Janet Thorton.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,480
Think the girl will be all right?

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,075
I stemmed the bleeding,
dropped her off in front of the ER.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,040
Patient files. Your patient files.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,270
Dexter, don't.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,955
"Somehow he's deluded himself
into thinking

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,635
his feelings for his sister
are genuine."

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,632
You're trying
to keep me from Deb.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,917
It's another way to isolate
your subject.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,552
See what he'll do.
When Yates is dead,
you are out of my life.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,833
You understand?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,912
What about you?
What makes you crazy?

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,634
Family shit.
Nothing says family like shit.

21
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,118
I see a lot of your father in you.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,273
Harry wrestled
with the same doubts
regarding Dexter.

23
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,517
<i>The code is a theory.</i>

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,559
<i>What Dexter did--
What we did--</i>

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,439
<i>I don't think I can live with this.</i>

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,234
Did Dad kill himself?

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,272
He OD'd on his heart medication.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,551
He thought he'd created
a monster.

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,319
I think I know how he felt.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,199
But he only got it half right.

31
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,800
Well, we're never
gonna get anywhere

32
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,997
unless one of you starts talking.

33
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,913
Okay.

34
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,674
Debra, it seems that you tried
to kill Dexter as well as yourself.

35
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,035
Yes, but then I saved him.

36
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,276
You saved me?
You only had to save me
because you tried to kill me.

37
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,069
I know, but--
You almost left my son an orphan.

38
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,630
Harrison.
Who's gonna take care of him?

39
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,234
Who?

40
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,359
I don't know.
All I've done my whole life

41
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,910
is try to take care of you,
to protect you.

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,511
Protect? Jesus Christ.
If this is your way of protecting me--

43
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,149
Okay, so I'm not perfect!

44
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,678
You think it's easy
being your brother?

45
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,792
You're not even listening to me.

46
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,953
You don't understand.
I've been trapped in a fucking fog--

47
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,520
No, I don't understand.

48
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,149
Haven't you heard
anything she said?

49
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,630
I'm stupid that way.
My brain is limited.

50
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,431
So when my sister tries to kill me,
for some reason, it doesn't make sense.

51
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,920
It's true, Dexter, what she said.

52
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,909
While in the throes of PTSD,
one's thinking becomes cloudy.

53
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,312
The weight of what
she has been through

54
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,517
has been too much for her to bear.

55
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,633
Debra has been in such a turmoil

56
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,151
that she sought out the first solution
that presented itself.

57
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,990
I had just found out that Dad
killed himself because of you.

58
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,751
Because of what you are.

59
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,640
I was fucking traumatised
by all this shit.

60
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,639
Yeah, so try to kill us both.
That solves everything.

61
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,437
You are overlooking an important part
of what happened, Dexter.

62
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,076
Yes, she tried to kill you,
the both of you.

63
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,954
And that was Debra
hitting rock bottom.

64
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,232
But ultimately, as she said,
she saved you.

65
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,076
And that was Debra's
first step toward recovery.

66
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,273
You should see that as
a promising sign for your sister.

67
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,714
Great.

68
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,315
I'm so fucking happy for you.

69
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,552
I was trying to catch a serial killer
before you tried to drown me.

70
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,552
I think I'm gonna get back to that.

71
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,120
Which, to you, is all I'm good for.

72
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,756
Don't, Dexter.

73
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,832
To hell with both of you.

74
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,475
Don't forget to write all this down.

75
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,352
I've never seen him so mad.

76
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,753
That wasn't just anger.

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,037
Fuck, it wasn't?
No.

78
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,471
Underneath all that is hurt.

79
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,075
Dexter is deeply hurt
by what you did.

80
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,431
Well, that makes two of us.

81
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,799
<i>Family therapy. Who needs it?</i>

82
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,920
<i>Family. A burden.</i>

83
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,072
<i>They interfere.</i>

84
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,033
<i>They annoy.</i>

85
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,314
Daddy, I wanna watch cartoons.

86
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,550
<i>They interrupt.</i>

87
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,393
You need to get ready for school.

88
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,711
I wanna watch cartoons.
School.

89
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,475
<i>Yates could be anywhere now.
He could've left Miami.</i>

90
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,359
Dexter, do you have
any plans for tonight?

91
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,556
Um...

92
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,513
Not sure.

93
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,675
<i>Dexter Morgan.</i>

94
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,030
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

95
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,157
It's me. Can we talk?

96
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,119
Fuck.

97
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,074
Harrison, apple or banana?
Banana.

98
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,311
I was thinking of having
Cassie over for dinner.

99
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,355
Okay, go ahead.

100
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,795
I mean here.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,036
Why?

102
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,993
I think you'd hit it off.

103
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,914
Five minutes of cartoons.
No minutes of cartoons.

104
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,959
You need to get dressed.
So is that a yes?

105
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,430
Is what a yes?
Dinner tonight.

106
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,000
Two minutes of cartoons?

107
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,714
This is not a negotiation.

108
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,394
Now.
Eight o'clock?

109
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,835
Please, please, please?

110
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,552
Yeah, fine.
Harrison, last warning.

111
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,914
I gotta go.
Okay, bye.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,880
<i>This is one of the first days
I'm glad Deb isn't here.</i>

113
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,354
<i>I can lock myself in the lab,</i>

114
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,115
<i>don't have to listen
to anyone's voice but my own.</i>

115
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,919
We gotta go
to the briefing room.

116
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,194
Now?

117
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,754
Now would be good.

118
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,038
Probably wondering
why I'm smiling.

119
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,590
I'm never wondering
why you're smiling.

120
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,434
I've just confirmed
that I have a daughter.

121
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,836
Someone let you impregnate them?

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,720
Made a donation
to a sperm bank 20 years ago.

123
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,679
You're not saying there's
a female version of you?

124
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,111
You met her. Niki.
The one you showed in.

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,596
That chick in your lab? No way.
Yes way.

126
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,036
That beautiful girl
came from you?

127
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,114
Yes, indeed.

128
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,600
Are you sure she's yours?

129
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,673
Who you talking to here?
She came in with the paperwork.

130
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,833
I pulled a piece of her hair.
I just finished testing it.

131
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,793
She's a Masuka,
through and through.

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,559
That poor sweet child.

133
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,430
So you and me, Dex,
both dads. How about that?

134
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,397
Great news, Vince.

135
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,474
You know, I'm sure it's all fine,
but just be careful, you know?

136
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,956
Family showing up like that,
out of nowhere?

137
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,634
Hey, what do you mean?

138
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,793
Sometimes it's just because
they want something, you know?

139
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,476
Money, a place to stay,
a fucking kidney.

140
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,313
<i>Or they wanna kill you.</i>

141
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,430
Lieutenant Batista is currently
with Janet Thorton,
the, uh, stabbing victim

142
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,115
who was dropped at the hospital.
She came to

143
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,680
and is ready
to make a statement.

144
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,910
<i>She survived.</i>

145
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,077
<i>One less trophy for Yates.</i>

146
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,677
So I'm running the briefing.
The Norma Rivera case.

147
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,714
The victim had sex with someone
before she was killed.

148
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,670
We're following the theory
that whoever she had sex with
is her killer.

149
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,275
Were you able to identify
anyone via the semen?

150
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,000
Uh, no matches in any
of the criminal databases.

151
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,790
Whoever had relations
with Ms. Rivera
has never been arrested.

152
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,952
ME's report showed
no defensive wounds?

153
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,760
Correct.
It's most likely not a rape.

154
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,674
She was probably friendly
with whoever killed her.

155
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,874
What about
the ex-boyfriend?

156
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,474
No, we ruled him out.

157
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,872
He's been locked up in Orlando
for the week on assault charge.

158
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,078
We questioned the staff
of Ms. Rivera's former employers.

159
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,880
They led us to believe
she'd been having an affair

160
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,912
with the boss, Ed Hamilton.

161
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,073
When we tried to speak to him,
he lawyered up immediately.

162
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,233
So we got a court order
to compel a DNA sample from him,

163
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,551
see if Hamilton was
Rivera's last visitor.

164
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,674
You think Hamilton killed Norma
to cover up their affair?

165
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,119
We're looking into it.
Old, rich men don't like
having their dirty laundry aired,

166
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,033
especially when it's the maid.

167
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,194
Dexter, I'm gonna need you to join me
and Miller in paying Hamilton a visit.

168
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,835
Janet Thorton gave us
the name of her abductor.

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,912
Albert Yates.
We got a home address.

170
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,720
I'm grabbing some unis now
and heading over there.

171
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,200
<i>You won't find him home.</i>

172
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,317
All right, let's get moving.

173
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,998
Lieutenant, got a minute?
Yeah.

174
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,039
You had Quinn run the briefing.
Yeah, how'd he do?

175
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,680
He was fine.

176
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,360
Really? Good.

177
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,035
Is he your choice
for sergeant?

178
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,471
I haven't yet
made that decision.

179
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,991
I used to run
the morning briefings
back in the Gang Unit.

180
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,880
I'm ready to take on
more responsibility.

181
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,034
Good to know. Thanks.

182
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,431
I just wanna make sure
you're aware

183
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,230
that the Hamiltons are
good friends to Miami Metro.

184
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,873
Sure.

185
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,191
Be respectful.

186
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,071
Any of Mr. Hamilton's
indiscretions

187
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,996
should take a back seat
to solving Ms. Rivera's murder.

188
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,878
I understand.

189
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,680
Good.

190
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,720
We're here for Mr. Hamilton.

191
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,473
Mr. Hamilton.
Mm-hm?

192
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,673
These police officers
are here to see you.

193
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,158
Thank you, Claudia.

194
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,119
My lawyer made it clear
I wouldn't be speaking to you.

195
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,879
You don't have to say a word.

196
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,599
We're just here for a cheek swab.

197
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,672
A what?
It's a DNA sample.

198
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,956
We have a warrant.

199
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,117
Failure to cooperate
will give us no choice

200
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,476
but to arrest you.
Why do you need DNA?

201
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,233
Ms. Rivera's autopsy revealed

202
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,993
she recently had sexual relations.

203
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,994
My forensics partner is here
to see if it was with you.

204
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,039
Wait, wait. There's no need for a test.

205
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,715
Norma and I were having an affair.

206
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,072
My wife found out
and insisted she be dismissed.

207
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,960
<i>A scorned spouse. Was it the wife?</i>

208
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,840
- So your wife knew?
- Just how upset was she?

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,960
No. My wife's been in Atlanta
visiting her sister
for the past two weeks.

210
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,476
Which is giving you time
to visit Ms. Rivera.

211
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,120
No. Yes.

212
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,916
I mean,
I didn't visit her.

213
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,791
She came by here
to pick up a few things
she left behind...

214
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,036
and one thing
led to another, and, uh...

215
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,229
we did have sex that day.

216
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,590
But she left here alive.

217
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,079
You, uh, didn't visit her apartment

218
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,276
later that day, did you?

219
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,760
I was here all day.

220
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,320
<i>The Hamiltons' son.</i>

221
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,113
Can anyone corroborate that?

222
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,396
Dad?

223
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,791
Dad, what's going on?
Go inside.

224
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,670
You want me to call someone?
I don't want anything. Go inside.

225
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,154
All right.

226
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,951
Sorry about that.
Where were we?

227
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,833
You were saying you have proof

228
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,554
that Ms. Rivera left the premises.

229
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,154
My security cameras.

230
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,754
You'll see Norma
arrive and leave

231
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,634
through the main gate,
alone.

232
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,276
I never, ever
would hurt Norma.

233
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,993
I loved her.

234
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,159
<i>But does he love his son?</i>

235
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,352
<i>It's Deb.</i>

236
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,120
Hello--

237
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,360
<i>Damn it.</i>

238
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,074
Hey.

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,400
Hey.

240
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,831
So you're, like, what, the DNA guy?

241
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,910
I'm a forensic technician,
specialising in blood
spatter analysis.

242
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,355
Whoa.

243
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,554
So did you go to the place
where Norma Rivera was killed?

244
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,915
I did.

245
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,916
And what did you see in,
you know, your analysis?

246
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,598
She was beaten to death.

247
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,952
Confidential, huh?

248
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,034
Well, for what it's worth,

249
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,999
you're wasting your time
investigating my dad.

250
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,994
He's an asshole, but not a killer.

251
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,351
That's quite a testament.

252
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,514
In my family,
it's about as good as it gets.

253
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,755

Dr. Vogel, it's Debra. I'm--

265
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,792
I need to talk to you, so...

266
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,718
I'm gonna come by.

267
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,112
Dr. Vogel?

268
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,796
Fuck.

269
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,514
<i>Graves marked by rosebushes.</i>

270
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,353
<i>Yates' previous victims.</i>

271
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,075
<i>He liked to keep them close.</i>

272
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,310
Three bodies so far.
A rosebush planted
on top of each.

273
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,360
You think there are three more?

274
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,556
Count on it.

275
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,918
The sick bastard turned his basement
into a torture room.

276
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,150
Yo, Dex, check this out.

277
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,714
All of his victims
have broken phalanges.

278
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,392
And it looks like the bones were
broken in sequence, not all at once.

279
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,474
Look. This bone here had
begun the process of mending.

280
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,235
So he kept them there
in that room for what, weeks?

281
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,996
Looks like it.
He broke each of their toes
until he was done, then--

282
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,994
Finished them off with
a single stab to the chest.

283
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,356
We think this was
one of his first victims.

284
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,554
We believe it's Kendall Jaynes,
been missing since 2008.

285
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,714
He buries the victims' purses
and IDs with the bodies.

286
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,557
And, get this, with each one,
the left shoe.

287
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,198
I mean, heh, I like feet,
but this is just cray-cray.

288
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,473
Deb. Looking to get
your old job back?

289
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,199
We could use you.
We have six bodies.

290
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,158
I need to talk to Dexter.

291
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,674
Dex.

292
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,360
Thanks. Deb, this isn't--

293
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,876
It's an emergency.
Vogel's been taken.

294
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,636
What do you mean?
I went to her house.

295
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,996
Someone had smashed the window.
She's gone.

296
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,554
Have you called her?

297
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,513
A fucking dozen times, no answer.

298
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,991
It's Yates. He's still in Miami.
I should've killed him already.

299
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,833
I wanna help.
No.

300
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,152
Dexter--
You tried helping, it didn't work out.

301
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,630
That was about killing.
This is about saving.

302
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,395
It's dangerous.
I fucking know it's dangerous.

303
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,358
Vogel's life is at stake.

304
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,872
You can hate me,
but can we just set that aside

305
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,351
until we know that she's okay?
I don't hate you.

306
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,518
Why'd you save me?
Why didn't you let me drown?

307
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,712
I saw the car going underwater.

308
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,716
I knew you were gonna die.

309
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,559
I couldn't imagine my life
without you in it.

310
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,315
So now what? Everything
just goes back to normal?

311
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,517
It was never normal.

312
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,710
I need to do this.
I really need to help.

313
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,114
We need to find Vogel.

314
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,672
We should bring
the police in on this.

315
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,719
They're already doing
everything they can
to find Yates.

316
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,395
This is his work log.

317
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,231
These are all the houses
he's worked in,

318
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,279
some of which might be empty
during the summer.

319
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,830
That's the perfect place
to go with a hostage.

320
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,038
That is a lot of places
to search, Dexter.
We need Metro's help.

321
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,872
They'll be helping us.
They just won't know it.

322
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,920
Just plot those places out on a map.
Don't do anything on your own.

323
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,871
You still don't trust me, do you?

324
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,918
I don't want you hurt.

325
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,996
So who's the guy?

326
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,798
What guy?

327
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,600
A.J., this is very serious,
what you're doing.

328
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,271
The guy who broke
into my house!

329
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,673
He's a friend of mine.
I don't like him in my house

330
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,240
going through my things.

331
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,598
No. I understand.
Good!

332
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,633
A.J., I think I know
what this is about.

333
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,237
It's your surgery.
You blame me.

334
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,872
What? This little thing? No!

335
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,233
I liked having my skull sawed open
and a chunk of my brain carved out.

336
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,550
Who wouldn't?

337
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,634
Well, you had a lesion
on the limbic area of your brain.

338
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,355
And I thought
it was causing your--

339
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,830
Your violent episodes.

340
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,397
I was only trying
to make you better.

341
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,796
Well, it worked really well,
didn't it?

342
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,475
You're a hell of a doctor!

343
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,916
I only wanted
what was best for you.

344
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,594
I still do.

345
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,514
That's why you sent your friend
after me.

346
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,349
I asked him to protect me.
I had no choice.

347
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,756
You should've just left me alone.

348
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,480
I will. I will.

349
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,518
You made your point.

350
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,275
There's no reason for us
to go any further.

351
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,515
If you do, you'll be caught
and you'll go to jail and--
Or worse.

352
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,949
My friend is looking for you.

353
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,440
Ah.

354
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,038
Good!

355
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,318
I can't wait till he finds me.
No, no!

356
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,319
The way I hear it,
the sergeant spot is going
to be between you and me.

357
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,671
That so?
Not gonna ruin our friendship

358
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,196
when one of us gets it
and the other doesn't?

359
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,272
I didn't know
we had a friendship.

360
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,396
Excuse me.

361
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,279
Miami Metro Homicide.

362
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,114
Don't worry, you're not in trouble.
What's your name?

363
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,840
Armando.
I'm Quinn. This is Detective Miller.

364
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,111
There was a murder here
a few days ago.

365
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,475
Take a look at this.

366
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,112
We were wondering
if you saw that man

367
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,476
around this time of day,
early afternoon?

368
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,839
<i>Sí,</i> I saw him.

369
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,753
Can you point him out to me?
Uh, this one.

370
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,518
Are you sure?
Yes. He drive a Porsche.

371
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,512
You don't see many
Porsches around here.

372
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,396
Would you be willing to give a statement
that that's the guy you saw?

373
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,474
I can come by later today.
Yeah, that's fine.

374
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,597
Here. Ask for me at the front desk.

375
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,795
Great.
Wanna get his information?

376
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,196
Hey.
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

377
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,274
Just got an eyewitness to place
Zach Hamilton at Norma Rivera's

378
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,954
around the time of her killing.

379
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,554
The son?

380
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,440
I wasn't expecting that.
<i>- Me neither</i>
.

381
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,796
Hm. I'll let Matthews know.
He's been all over me
about this case.

382
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,997
<i>All right, bye.</i>
All right.

383
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,879
This is awkward, isn't it?

384
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,276
Heh, heh. Ahem.

385
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,439
Uh, why'd you decide
to look me up now?

386
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,716
Ahem.
Um...

387
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,395
Well, you know,
partly because I moved down here

388
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,119
from St. Augustine for school.

389
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,916
Oh. And what's the other part?

390
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,595
My mom passed recently.

391
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,275
So, um, it's just me now.

392
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,353
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

393
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,040
Thanks.

394
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,149
And, uh, your mom
never married?

395
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,519
No, it was always
just the two of us.
So now that she's gone,

396
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,600
I guess I've been feeling
kind of alone.

397
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,195
Well, I'm glad
you reached out.

398
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,437
Me too.

399
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,354
What about you?
Are you still single?

400
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,916
Yep. Ahem.
Heh, where do you live?

401
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,595
Oh, I've got a house
down in Coconut Grove.

402
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,513
Fancy.

403
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,876
Are you, like, Mr. Rich-Guy?
Ha, ha.

404
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,034
Well, uh...

405
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,799
I bet you drive a Ferrari.

406
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,153
Masook, what can I get for you?

407
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,437
Hey, Marty, um, just a coffee for me.

408
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,920
And, uh, Niki?

409
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,389
Um, can I have
a double cappuccino
and a blueberry muffin?

410
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,990
And a veggie burrito to go, please.

411
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,030
I left my bag in the car.
I'm sorry. Can you get this one?

412
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,237
Yeah, no, no. Heh, heh.
I'll get the next one.

413
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,033
No problem, my treat.

414
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,720
Thank you.
Yeah.

415
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,439
Oh, hey, uh, can you add, um,

416
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,716
cheese to my burrito?

417
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,111
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

418
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,192
<i>Yates has installed cable and Internet</i>

419
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,192
<i>from one end of Miami to the other.</i>

420
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,432
<i>If I only look at homes he worked on
in the past two weeks,</i>

421
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,951
<i>it'll still take days to figure out
which homes are vacant.</i>

422
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,397
<i>If he's even in one of them.</i>

423
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,918
<i>And with Vogel being held by Yates,
doing what he does...</i>

424
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,238
<i>Batista should be done looking
into Yates' money trail.</i>

425
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,911
<i>Time to see if Miami Metro
can help me narrow this down.</i>

426
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,318
Yeah, I'm on hold. Come in.

427
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,354
Just checking to see how
your end of the hunt's going.

428
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,150
Well, just got his credit history.
He hasn't used his charge cards

429
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,277
in the last three days,
so that trail is cold.

430
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,996
So he's using cash?
Yeah.

431
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,196
He's on the run.

432
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,115
He'd probably have to be
withdrawing his funds
from his bank or ATM.

433
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,000
I got a judge to expedite
a warrant on his accounts.

434
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,389
I'm on hold with the bank.

435
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,199
<i>Thank you for holding.</i>

436
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,840
<i>Withdrawals were
in Morningside Park.</i>

437
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,469
<i>Would you like receipts?</i>
That would be fine.

438
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,160
<i>Thank you. Bye.</i>
Thank you.

439
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,069
Good news?

440
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,835
Yates hit up an ATM
near Morningside Park

441
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,390
two times in the last couple of days.

442
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,156
He could be holed up in that area.
We'll get some unis out there.

443
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,558
If he shows his face, we'll get him.
Yeah, we'll get him.

444
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,634
No, it's a clusterfuck.
We had a witness place Zach

445
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,360
at the murder scene
within the time of her death.

446
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,989
We bring him in,
he can't remember anything.

447
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,470
Not unusual for a witness
to change his mind.

448
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,200
Someone paid him off.
Rich parents like Zach has,

449
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,039
it's not hard to put
two and two together.

450
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,432
Hm. You have any other witnesses
that put Zach at the scene?

451
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,514
No. I'll bring that kid in for questioning
and get a confession out of him.

452
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,916
Waste of time.
You have nothing to go on.

453
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,993
His lawyers won't let him say a word.
He killed her.

454
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,153
You don't know that.
Your only witness recanted.

455
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,834
You have no case.

456
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,959
Now, look, you find
something more concrete,

457
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,679
you'll have my full backing.

458
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,991
But until then,
leave the kid alone.

459
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,358
No reason to make enemies
unless we really have to,

460
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,391
especially when there are people
trying to move up to sergeant.

461
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,074
Capiche?

462
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,993
Yeah.

463
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,192
What exactly are we looking for
in the Morningside Park area?

464
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,751
We need to start figuring out
what kind of buildings these are.

465
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,630
Any apartments or condos
or businesses can be
scratched off the list.

466
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,076
And why are we...?
I can't.

467
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,393
I know, got it. Top-secret shit
between you and your brother.
Understood.

468
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,076
Look at that, a paying client.

469
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,476
I guess I should go and--
Oh, that's a friend of mine.

470
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,631
Good. Hope he needs a favour.

471
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,875
Masuka, what's up?

472
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,275
I pass by here all the time.

473
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,434
I figured I'd finally
see where you work.

474
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,438
This is it.

475
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,438
It's nice.
Yeah.

476
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,638
Can we go somewhere
more private to talk?

477
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,071
Sure.
Okay.

478
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,556
What's up?

479
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,800
I wanna hire you to do
a background check on someone.

480
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,351
You do background checks
all the time.

481
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,120
Why would you waste your money?
I know, right.

482
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,390
It's more of a personal situation.

483
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,832
Right. Who are we stalking?

484
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,878
Heh, heh, heh.

485
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,438
It's, uh, a family member.
Ooh, gotta be careful.

486
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,115
Don't always wanna know
everything about family.

487
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,715
Yeah, well, I really need this.
All right.

488
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,191
Give me a name.
Niki Walters.

489
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,115
Who is it? A cousin?

490
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,595
Daughter.

491
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,914
I know, right?

492
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,958
I donated sperm
back in college.

493
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,391
I've got a 20-year-old daughter.

494
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,080
She just showed up out of the blue.

495
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,350
Wow, that's fucking weird.

496
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,831
I mean, she seems
really nice, you know?

497
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,956
She's smart. She's pretty.
Seems normal.

498
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,394
But I keep asking myself,
"What's the catch?"

499
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,274
Maybe she just wants
to get to know you.

500
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,040
Maybe.

501
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,717
Or maybe she saw an easy mark
to hit up for money.

502
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,389
You really think
she's here to rip you off?

503
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,356
I don't know what to think.

504
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,071
I've got no family
except for my parents.

505
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,950
And they're off, retired,
living <i>la vida loca</i> in Tampa.

506
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,317
So it's just me.

507
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,797
And now Niki shows up.

508
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:21,196
I mean, I like the idea
of having a daughter,
family, right?

509
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,512
But if she's here
just for my money...

510
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,349
I'm sure it's fine.

511
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,837
And either way, it's--

512
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,039
It's really nice to have family.

513
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,152
Trust me.

514
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,439
You'll be discreet?
I don't want her to know

515
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,672
I'm looking into her like this.
She'll never know.

516
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,797
- Yes, please.
- Oh yeah
,.

517
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,557
Hey.
Hey.

518
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,870
You want a beer?

519
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,679
You remember Cassie, right?

520
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,758
Cassie, yeah.
New neighbour, hi.

521
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,271
Yes, it's good to meet you again.

522
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,193
Jamie, can I talk to you for a sec?

523
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,234
Sure. Joey, keep stirring that.

524
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,192
What are they doing
in my apartment?

525
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,352
Did you forget we had plans?
Plans?

526
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,840
Dinner, remember?

527
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,870
Right.

528
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,993
I figured we'd make it
a double date.
Less awkward this way.

529
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,470
I'm gonna have to reschedule.

530
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,759
Excuse me just a sec.
Joey, keep stirring that.

531
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,280
I'm stirring it!

532
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,036
Dexter. You can't do this.

533
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,316
Do what?

534
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,472
I went out of my way
to set this up.

535
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,633
I made <i>platanos fritos.</i>
I planned this whole night for you.

536
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,120
I'm sorry, something came up.

537
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,432
No. No, you do this to me
all the time.

538
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,037
And I don't mind, I really don't.
But I invited Cassie and Joey.

539
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,880
You can't be rude to them.
Jamie, really, I have to go.

540
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,759
If you even try
to walk out that door,
Dexter, I will leave.

541
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,674
You'll be stuck here
with Harrison all night long.

542
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,116
Jamie--
This is for your own good.

543
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,557
You haven't gone out with anyone
since Hannah. Stay for dinner.

544
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,791
When we're done,
I'll stay with Harrison

545
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,236
so you can go do
whatever you have to do.

Born and raised.

548
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,077
Dexter's lived in Miami
his whole life.

549
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,391
I'm gonna get some more wine.

550
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,872
Deb.
I've got 12 potential homes

551
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,238
Yates could be using as a hideout.
Shit. I've got seven.

552
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,437
That's a lot to cover.
Let's go.

553
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,351
I'll call you back in five minutes.

554
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,398
- So another S.
- Yeah to you

556
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,079
I love blunt things in my mouth.

557
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,356
Oh, jeez.

558
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,159
Excuse me.

559
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,357
Hey. Want some help
opening the wine?

560
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,680
Ah, actually, this is a little embarrassing,
but I kind of need to leave.

561
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,071
Oh, work? I get it.

562
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,516
When I worked in finance,
I was at it 24/7.

563
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,956
Yeah, 24/7.

564
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,951
But the thing is, Jamie's put
a lot of time into this whole thing.

565
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,557
Right, you don't wanna piss off
the nanny. Look, um, go.

566
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,598
I'll take care of Jamie. We'll be fine.

567
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,112
Maybe we could reschedule?
Yeah. I'd like that.

568
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,391
Perfect.
Okay.

569
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,559
I'm really sorry to be the party pooper
but I've got an early morning.

570
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,200
Mind if I call it a night?

571
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,397
Yeah, turns out
I have to take off too.

572
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,520
Thanks for watching Harrison.
I'm sorry.

573
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,518
I know you went to so much trouble.

574
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,200
What the fuck took you so long?

575
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,993
It's a long story.

576
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,720
We have 19 houses
we have to look into.

577
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,554
At night? Fuck me.
How are we even gonna see

578
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,714
if Vogel and Yates are in a house,
if they're even holed up
in one of these?

579
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,952
What if he's already killed her?
He hasn't. She's fine.

580
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,597
He keeps his women alive
for weeks. We'll find her.

581
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,797
Yeah, we will. We have to.

582
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,509
I'll pick you up in five minutes.

583
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,358
We'll find her.

584
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,754
Stay still.

585
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,640
Unless you want me
to restrain you.

586
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,351
You're not angry with me, A.J.

587
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,752
You're angry with her.
Shut up.

588
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,640
And you have every right to be.

589
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,280
Your mother abused you horribly,
beat you.

590
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,119
Probably caused the lesion.
Don't talk about her.

591
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,714
But I understand, A.J.

592
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,709
I understand the terror you felt.

593
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,310
She hit you, slapped you.

594
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,595
You'd find a safe place
under the bed.

595
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,395
And she'd look for you, raging.

596
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,718
And you'd curl up under there,

597
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,597
looking out, waiting.

598
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,674
She'd pace back and forth
in front of the bed.

599
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,274
Yes.

600
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,320
Shoes clacking.

601
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,512
Feel the panic rising.

602
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,075
The pain you knew awaited.

603
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,915
Hm.

604
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,075
Don't say another fucking word.

605
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,320
No, no.

606
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,554
Now, you can take the pain
and live a little longer

607
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,760
or you can stop struggling,
and I'll kill you right now.

608
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,720
Good.

609
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,434
So...

610
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,392
which little piggy
won't be making it to market?

611
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,276
Albert, stop it!

612
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,520
Don't call me that.
Only my mother called me that.

613
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,752
Stop that, Albert, now.
No.

614
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,355
Don't you talk back to me,
you little shit!

615
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,311
I'm not afraid of you.
All you ever do is disappoint me.

616
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,798
Enough!

617
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,159
Stay.

618
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,836
<i>Don't know this number.</i>

619
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,593
<i>Not this house.</i>

620
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,753
Morgan.

621
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,319
<i>Here.</i>

622
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,314
<i>Let me help you with that cut.</i>

623
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,355
You shouldn't call me Albert.
My name is A.J.

624
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,034
I'm sorry.

625
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,436
It's Vogel. She's alive.
What?

626
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,518
She is with Yates.
She called me.

627
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,751
She left her phone out
or something.

628
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,879
Oh, my God.
<i>You're still bleeding.</i>

629
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,236
It's local. You think Elway
can trace this?

630
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,911
I don't know. I can fucking ask him.
<i>Let me take care of you.</i>

631
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,990
Deb, what's up?

632
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,793
Look, I don't wanna
explain to you

633
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,953
why I can't go
through the police,
and I know it's illegal,

634
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,720
but I need you to trace
a number for me.

635
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,236
What's the number?

636
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,039
<i>You're no different than Mom.</i>

637
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,476
<i>Yes, I am. I understand.</i>

638
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,438
How long is this gonna take?

639
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,831
Fuck if I know.

640
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,432
What if he kills her?

641
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,794
I thought you said it takes
like a week for him--

642
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,917
I know what I said.
<i>It's bullshit.</i>

643
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,753
<i>You're angry.</i>

644
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,513
Let's not think like this.

645
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,239
<i>You had a horrible childhood.</i>

646
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,878
<i>But you don't have to live your life...</i>

647
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,750
Yeah?

648
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,912
<i>You're a fucking saint. Thank you.</i>

649
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,356
One-five-seven Montgomery.
You know where that is?

650
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,558
<i>You shouldn't have hit me.</i>

651
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,713
She hit him?
<i>I was scared.</i>

652
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,200
I can still help you.

653
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,113
You don't have to be angry at me.

654
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,431
You can't help me.
I can.

655
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,195
I understand
what you've been through.

656
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,640
<i>No child should ever have to hide
under a bed from a parent.</i>

657
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,555
<i>You sought connection with her,</i>

658
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,160
and all she gave you
was pain.

659
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,878
What-- What you do
for your women,

660
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,716
it's a search
for that same connection

661
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,395
that you never got
from your mother.

662
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,878
<i>But what we have here now,
in this moment, you and I?</i>

663
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,995
<i>This is real human connection.</i>

664
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,637
<i>What you have with your victims,
that only pales in comparison.</i>

665
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,871
<i>Do you understand?</i>

666
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,959
My poor, poor boy.

667
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,158
All you want is to belong, don't you?

668
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,071
<i>I can help you.</i>

669
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,954
<i>I can, trust me.</i>

670
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,629
Oh, what did you do?
I didn't.

671
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,840
Who did you call? Is this your friend?
Dexter, Dexter!

672
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,640
<i>Yeah, you call him. Fuck you, Dexter!</i>

673
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,634
Fuck.

674
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,435
You okay?
Yeah.

675
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,432
Oh, fucking Christ.

676
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,480
Are you all right?

677
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,790
Yeah, I think so.

678
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,077
Did he hurt you?
No.

679
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,153
No. Thank you. Thank you.

680
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,397
Where's Yates?

681
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,309
Let's get you out of here.

682
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,312
Then we can find Yates.

683
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,440
Debra, are you okay?

684
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,632
I'm good.

685
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,593
Really, I'm good.

686
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,480
Let's just get this cleaned up
and get out of here.

687
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,432
Brain cores.

688
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,914
I'll dump them
with Yates' body.

689
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,632
So this is finally over.

690
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,276
My tormentor is dead.

691
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,631
Thanks to you, Dexter.

692
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,316
And Deb.
Yes. And Deb.

693
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,399
I'm glad to see that the two of you
have managed

694
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,233
to find your way back to each other.

695
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,880
Well, the family that kills together...

696
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,037
You're doing well, Debra.

697
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,759
You're very resilient.

698
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,309
We'll see.

699
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,000
You are.

700
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,511
And you never
gave up on her.

701
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,353
I'm impressed.

702
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,436
I know Harry would be too.

703
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,350
He was always concerned
that, as you grew older,

704
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,830
you might drift apart.

705
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,313
Well, we never really
had a choice.

706
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,110
If anyone really knew us,
they would run screaming.

707
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,359
This is everything.

708
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,675
Okay.

709
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,037
So is this it?

710
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,072
<i>A few days ago, everything seemed
hopeless between Deb and me.</i>

711
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,399
<i>But through Dr. Vogel and Yates,</i>

712
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,631
<i>I've got my sister back.</i>

713
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,275
<i>Not like things were before.</i>

714
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,077
<i>It's something different.</i>

715
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,280
<i>But for now, it's enough.</i>

716
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,834
It's beautiful out here, Dexter.

717
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,839
I like it.

718
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,838
It's peaceful,
alone on the water.

719
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,796
Tonight, you brought us.

720
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,591
Yes. Why?

721
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,595
I wanted to be with family.
