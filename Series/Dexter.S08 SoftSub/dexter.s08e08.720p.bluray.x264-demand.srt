00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,079
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,431
Remember me?
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,160
You should leave
before my husband returns.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,754
Your husband?
Oh, God.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,071
You're still in love with her?
No.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,596
We have got to get her
out of our lives.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,274
What is it you'd like to do?

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,036
I would like to take her to Marshal
Services and have her arrested.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,558
When the Brain Surgeon was out there,
I trusted Dexter to solve the problem.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,672
Before you take matters
into your hands,

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,435
be sure to consider
all the consequences.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,200
Can I borrow that
high-tech GPS tracker?

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,237
Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,512
What if you were to teach Zach
the code?

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,715
Am I ready to be a spiritual father?

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,113
Are you gonna help me be like you?

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,634
Hi, Dexter!
Going for a little night swim.

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,235
Enjoy.
What the fuck were you thinking?

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,359
That asshole is walking around free.
We have nothing.

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,354
That's why I was following him.
Let it go. That's an order.

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,671
By the way, me and Jamie
are moving in together.

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,872
What?
Why did you marry him?

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,793
He was there when you weren't.

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,270
No, Miles, stop.
You'll never leave this boat.

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,397
I told the crew that Miles was
going to New York for a few days.

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,910
Please don't leave town
before we talk again.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,193
I won't.

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,000
Come on, what the fuck? Dexter!
It looks like he's not home.

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,833
Cassie.

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,874
Norma Rivera was bludgeoned.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,715
Is it possible Zach did this?

32
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,990
<i>Every contact leaves a trace.</i>

33
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,715
<i>That idea is the foundation
of all crime scene analysis.</i>

34
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,440
<i>I should be focused
on who bludgeoned Cassie and why.</i>

35
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,633
<i>But instead,</i>

36
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,030
<i>ever since Hannah
came back into my orbit,</i>

37
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,192
<i>she's all I can think about.</i>

38
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,672
Manner of death?

39
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,274
Swan.

40
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,433
Killer didn't plan this.
It was impulsive.

41
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,320
<i>This is just how Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.</i>

42
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,120
She was killed pretty deep
in her apartment.

43
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,351
Like she let the killer in herself.

44
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,273
So she knew him.

45
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,557
That guy she was dating.

46
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,832
You said you were coming here
to pick Cassie up for a date.

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,153
Yes, I was late.
Where were you coming from?

48
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,791
I had a-- The building inspection.

49
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,156
I'm a structural engineer.

50
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,149
Well, maybe I was wrong.
Maybe it was the repairman
or the delivery guy.

51
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,760
<i>Or Zach Hamilton.</i>

52
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,435
<i>If I'd paid more attention to Zach
instead of being with Hannah,</i>

53
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,200
<i>would Cassie still be alive?</i>

54
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,239
<i>Is that Zach's blood?</i>

55
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,992
<i>Zach knew Cassie.
He met her once, here with me.</i>

56
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,794
Cassie was a good person.

57
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,032
You sure there was no one else
she was having issues with?

58
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,396
I can't think right now.
Will you please--?

59
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,358
It's okay, it's okay.

60
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,432
Hey, Deb. How are you?

61
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,353
I'm okay.
It's good to see you

62
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,510
at a crime scene.

63
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,239
Heh. I'm gonna talk to Dex.

64
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,834
Go ahead.

65
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,631
Harrison's asleep.

66
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,356
Thanks.

67
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,359
That's a break.

68
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,351
Could that be the killer's blood?
Here's hoping.

69
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,352
Are you okay?

70
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,713
Sure.

71
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,440
Why the fuck do I even ask?

72
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,035
What about Hannah?

73
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,589
What about her?
Is she still here?

74
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,876
Hey, Deb.

75
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,918
Hey.

76
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,278
Who would want to kill Cassie?
She owe people money?

77
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,877
We're looking into that.
What about customers or a vendor?

78
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,477
Sorry.
I have no fucking business being here.

79
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,916
Any time you wanna come back,
the door's always open.

80
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,514
Maybe I'll put an application
in the mail.

81
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,240
I'll come back to finish
this conversation, yeah?

82
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,240
Okay.

83
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,880
<i>Can't wait.</i>

84
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,511
<i>I would give everything
to feel nothing again.</i>

85
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,989
We need to get you out of town
as soon as possible.

86
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,200
I need a new passport.
I have a guy that can do that.

87
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,115
I'll find out what he needs.
That's just a phone call.

88
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,595
You could have phoned me, rather
than driving all the way down here.

89
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,431
This was on the way to the lab.

90
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,636
This marina is not
on the way to the lab.

91
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,313
You know, we, um...

92
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,191
We missed a spot of blood
cleaning up.

93
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,757
No, we didn't.
Edge of the whisky bottle.

94
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,037
I noticed it this morning.

95
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,439
I was so glad to see it
because it reminded me of you.

96
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,197
Did you clean it up?

97
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,919
Yes, I cleaned it up.

98
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,829
With bleach?
Yes.

99
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,755
Miami is not the place
for you to be right now.

100
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,476
The sooner we get you out of here,
the better.

101
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,276
I completely agree.

102
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,999
<i>It is Zach's blood
under Cassie's nails.</i>

103
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,720
<i>He killed another innocent woman.</i>

104
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,238
<i>What a waste.
He could have had a great future.</i>

105
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,195
<i>Miami Metro can never know.
It's one small step from Zach to me.</i>

106
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,680
Hey, Dex.

107
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,878
Remember Niki, the apple
that didn't fall too far from my tree?

108
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,440
Hi.
Hi.

109
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,077
Around here we call Dexter
"the king of spatter."

110
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,597
We do?
I do, in private.

111
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,316
Hey, feel free to send
any and all paperwork her way.

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,514
Here you go.
Oh, uh,

113
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,990
the blood under Cassie's nails?

114
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,793
No luck. It was hers.

115
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,431
From a transfer
after her head started to bleed.

116
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,991
"The victim collapsed
into a pool of her own blood."

117
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,550
Hey, are you--?
Are you okay with all this?

118
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,760
I mean, I am a little bit worried
about the energy around here.

119
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,719
Well, then maybe we can hang
a crystal in the corner.

120
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,676
Yeah, we should sage the place first.

121
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,913
Could I talk to you for a sec?

122
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,992
Actually, I'm--
Real quick.

123
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,638
You recognise these?

124
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,715
Yeah, I took them.
Yeah, now look at these.

125
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,156
Norma Rivera, Cassie Jollenston.

126
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,397
Are they fucking similar, or what?

127
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,355
They were both bludgeoned.
Bludgeonings can look
pretty fucking similar.

128
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,480
Do you think Zach Hamilton
could have done this?

129
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,432
Zach knew Norma. How could
he have possibly known Cassie?

130
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,389
I know, it's crazy, I--
What's crazy is Batista and Matthews

131
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,314
wanted you to lay off
looking into this Hamilton kid.

132
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,759
This Hamilton kid
is a fucking monster.
You know it too.

133
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,391
Not really.
I think you should drop this.
Think about your career.

134
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,399
It's not like I'm gonna make sergeant.
Do me a favour.

135
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,195
You see any of Zach's DNA
at the crime scene, just let me know.

136
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,998
Absolutely.

137
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,956
He hasn't returned my calls.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,519
I tried to reach him too.
I spoke to his parents,
they haven't seen him.

139
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,912
He could be on the run,
hiding out somewhere.

140
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,555
Were you with that Hannah person?

141
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,632
Is that why this woman is dead?

142
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,514
She's dead because you talked me out
of killing Zach in the first place.

143
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,233
He showed real potential.
You saw that.

144
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,792
I thought you were having
an impact on him.

145
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,716
Zach spoke to me of trying to live up
to your rules, your standards.

146
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,235
I thought he was processing it all.

147
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,716
Yeah, Zach's smart,
but he can't control himself.

148
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,553
We both should have seen that.

149
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,871
Zach's just a boy.

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,231
A boy who knows
too much about me,

151
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,276
about you,
who's killed two innocent women.

152
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,679
No, I guess you don't have
many options, do you?

153
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,314
No.

154
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,710
I wonder if it will be different for you,
because of what could have been.

155
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,551
I doubt it.
But surely there have been

156
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,758
people that were
more difficult for you to--

157
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,357
How do you like to say it?
Take care of.

158
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,354
Zach Hamilton is not one of them.

159
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,430
I'm not sure I believe you.

160
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,551
<i>Zach rented a room in Fiesta Key.</i>

161
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,519
<i>He's on the run,
and using his own credit card.</i>

162
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,149
<i>Rookie mistake.</i>

163
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,711
<i>I forget the impact murder has
on real people.</i>

164
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,000
Deb.

165
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,869
Ahem. Any luck?
With what?

166
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,833
Cassie's case?
Is that why you're here?

167
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,434
No.

168
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,754
Hey, Jamie.
How are you doing?

169
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,600
I don't know how you two
do this every day.

170
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,319
I don't.

171
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,314
Right.

172
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,153
On a scale of one to 10,
10 being out of our lives forever,

173
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,035
where the fuck is Hannah?
She's not a threat.

174
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,795
Last time we talked,
you said, "I'm on top of it."

175
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,237
And I am.
Are you on top of it, or on top of her?

176
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,198
Deb--
Is she in Miami?

177
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,476
What the fuck is she doing here?
It has to do with her husband.

178
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,350
The casino guy?
He's abusive, verbally and physically.

179
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,877
They seem perfect.

180
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,114
What about him?
She wanted me to--

181
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,510
Why didn't she do it herself?
Too much scrutiny.

182
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,233
Did you do it?

183
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,634
No.

184
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,156
Well, that must have pissed her off.

185
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,231
What's to keep her
from trying to kill us again?

186
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,319
She didn't try to kill us.
She wanted my attention.

187
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,837
By poisoning me and leaving you
on the side of the fucking road?

188
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,755
You have the fucking altitude
to see all of this,

189
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,277
that she's using you,
and you still want to protect her?

190
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,633
Once she gets her passport,
she'll be out of our lives forever.

191
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,794
You believe that?
I do.

192
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,795
Well, that's the thing
that you can't see,
that you're lying to yourself.

193
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,512
She's a murderer.

194
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,151
She needs to be locked up.
She could talk.

195
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,597
After LaGuerta, I can't afford
another round of questions.

196
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,229
She's a fugitive. She's a poisoner.
She's easily discredited.

197
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,319
Enough already.

198
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,076
We were supposed
to have lunch together,
Cassie and me.

199
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,397
Jamie, I'm sorry.

200
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,709
I can't be here right now.

201
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,000
I can take Harrison with me.

202
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,913
I moved in with Joey.

203
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh.
I thought we'd go there,

204
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,595
since you're on the next few days.

205
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,479
I mean, if that's okay with you.

206
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,757
Yeah, that's okay with me.

207
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,718
Don't smile?

208
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,357
Just send this
to the passport guy.

209
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,680
He'll have a new identity

210
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,952
and all the paperwork for you
by tomorrow.

211
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,396
Do I get to pick my name?

212
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,071
I doubt it, but I'll ask.

213
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,040
So does he drop it off, or--?

214
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,878
No, I will.
Okay, so just wait here?

215
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,760
Maybe you should come with me.
Where?

216
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,596
I have to go to the Keys tonight.
The Keys?

217
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,039
It would just be for the night.

218
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,073
Besides, it's not safe for you
to be here.

219
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,514
Safe?
You know, alone.

220
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,311
I sent the crew away for a few hours
because I knew that you were coming.

221
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,995
They can protect me
from almost anything.

222
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,720
It's the "almost" that concerns me.

223
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,232
So, what's in the Keys,

224
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,551
or should I say who is in the Keys?

225
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,871
I'll tell you on the way down.

226
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,600
How would you like to make
a boatload of cash?

227
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,911
I'm assuming that's
a rhetorical question.

228
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,311
U.S. Marshal Service
is offering $25,000

229
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,314
for information leading
to the arrest of Hannah McKay.

230
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,075
Sal Price's publisher is
offering another 125,000,

231
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,800
his family, another hundred.
Put that together--

232
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,392
Two-fifty. Yeah, I can do math.
I think Hannah McKay is back in Miami.

233
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,875
And you think this because...?
Are you interested or not?

234
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,399
Very.

235
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,235
No fucking way. They're gone.

236
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,198
You sure this is the Castner slip?

237
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,875
I'm sure.
You sure McKay was under the alias

238
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,680
of "Maggie Castner"?
Yes.

239
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,558
What, you don't believe me?

240
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,951
Lot of pretty blond girls in Miami.
You sure Hannah McKay was here?

241
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,676
I know for a fucking fact that she was.
How?

242
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,789
I just do.

243
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,799
You really don't like her, do you?
Nope.

244
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,993
I'm just saying, emotions cloud
your judgement, you know?

245
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,994
You keep it about the money,
someday you may have a yacht.

246
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,516
I don't want a fucking yacht.
Well, I do.

247
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,440
So let's keep it
about my money, all right?

248
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,116
So the yacht may be gone,
but we don't know if they were on it.

249
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,269
Maybe the dock master
knows something. I'll see.

250
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,233
I'll meet you back at the office,
all right?

251
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,080
Joey, I don't want to be here alone.

252
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,433
You're not alone, you got the kid.

253
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,590
My name is Harrison.

254
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,674
And a fine name that is.
Don't you got some cartoons to watch?

255
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,192
Joey, I am freaking out.
My friend was murdered.

256
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,600
I-- Look, I know,
but once I catch the killer,

257
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,190
you're not gonna have
to be scared anymore, okay?

258
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,230
You know,
if it were Deb asking you to stay,
you wouldn't even put up a fight.

259
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,312
Deb wouldn't ask me to stay.

260
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,876
She'd want to catch the killer
as bad as I do.

261
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,077
Sorry I'm not Deb.

262
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,191
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

263
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,558
You need me to stay here,
I'll stay here, okay?

264
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,360
Motherfuck it.

265
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,794
Hey, Deb, what's up?

266
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,158
<i>Hey, just checking in about Hannah.</i>

267
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,596
I haven't seen her.

268
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,480
<i>Where are you?</i>
Grabbing some dinner.

269
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,836
Oh, yeah? Want company?

270
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,119
No, I'm good.
<i>No, seriously.</i>

271
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,313
I'll join you. Where are you?
<i>Um...</i>

272
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,160
Look at a fucking street sign.

273
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,829
I'm on the highway.
How about tomorrow?

274
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,200
Sure.

275
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,352
Dick for brains.

276
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,160
She's a ray of sunshine, isn't she?

277
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,717
So, what'd you say to the crew?

278
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,111
I told them
to head on to St. Kitts.

279
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,433
It was our next stop
after Miami anyway.

280
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,880
They're paid not to ask questions.
Hm.

281
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,914
So who are you after?

282
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,797
His name is Zach.

283
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,072
What did Zach do?

284
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,757
Disappoint me.

285
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,632
He was someone
Dr. Vogel thought I could, uh,

286
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,995
mentor.

287
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,038
Who's Dr. Vogel?

288
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,716
Dr. Evelyn Vogel.
She studies psychopaths.

289
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,796
My father went to see her about me.

290
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,839
Heh. How did that conversation go?

291
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,879
"Hey, I've got this son
who has these urges."

292
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,997
He was at the end of his rope.

293
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,670
Dr. Vogel's the one who came up
with the idea of the code.

294
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,354
She...

295
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,430
created me.

296
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,635
Wow.
I know.

297
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,630
So how does it feel
to finally meet her,

298
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,996
to find out that she even existed?

299
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,550
Like finding a family member.

300
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,071
Well, she must be very proud of you.

301
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,954
Are there others of you out there?
Just Zach, as far as I know.

302
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,839
She thought he...

303
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,431
She saw a little of me in him,

304
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,557
or who I used to be.

305
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,518
Focused.

306
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,434
Driven.

307
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,275
There's one big difference though.
He'd already killed an innocent woman

308
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,195
when I met him,
and now he's killed another.

309
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,118
So he's a terrible student.

310
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,559
I wasn't exactly a hands-on teacher.

311
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,953
He's fled to the Keys.

312
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,113
I can't have him
out there in the world.

313
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,840
He's a problem
you have to solve.

314
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,240
I was a problem you had to solve too,
and I escaped.

315
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,593
How come you never tried to find me?

316
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,319
And do what?

317
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,556
Solve the problem.

318
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,956
I liked knowing you were out there.

319
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,834
Elway, it's me.

320
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,878
<i>Hey, I was just about to call you.</i>

321
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,838
<i>Dockmaster ends up
being a gabby fuck.</i>

322
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,469
He heard Mr. Castner
flew yesterday to New York

323
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,475
sans Mrs. Castner, who just sent
the yacht to St. Kitts earlier today.

324
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,951
Where she is now is anybody's guess.
I'll venture one, the Keys.

325
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,954
<i>Is this something you just know,
or you have a source?</i>

326
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,476
I'm on my way down there now
to check it out.

327
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,791
You know about her husband
being with her?

328
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,599
<i>You said Castner was in New York.</i>

329
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,480
I checked the airport, the Gulfstream
never left the tarmac, so...

330
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,154
I wonder if she killed him.
<i>Heh-heh-heh. There's a leap.</i>

331
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,834
That's what she fucking does.

332
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,469
She murders people
and she gets away with it.

333
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,950
I cannot wait to fucking find her.

334
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,794
Remember what I said.
No crusaders on the payroll.

335
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,670
<i>Let's find her, let's bring her in,
let's get paid, okay? Thank you.</i>

336
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,234
Shrimp?

337
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,594
Yeah.

338
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,078
Bottom feeders.

339
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,360
Uh-huh.

340
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,194
They eat all the garbage
at the bottom of the ocean.

341
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,800
They take out the trash.
Mm.

342
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,278
Is that what you do?
You take out the trash?

343
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,951
Thought might have crossed my mind.

344
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,677
You have all these clever sayings
inside your head, don't you?

345
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,912
About what you do and who you are.

346
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,154
Yeah, I think a lot.
Mm. I'm sure you do.

347
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,835
So, what brilliant turn of phrase
have you come up with to describe me?

348
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,437
The evil temptress?

349
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,920
Passionate poisoner?

350
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,554
Heh.

351
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,712
Fiendish florist.

352
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,800
Really, when you're lying in bed at night
and I happen to cross your mind,

353
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,679
what do you call me?

354
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,913
Hannah.

355
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,158
You're just Hannah.

356
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,316
You're such a flirt.

357
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,838
No, I'm not. I'm just being honest.
Please, you're the master manipulator.

358
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,555
I am?
Yes, you are.

359
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,034
Is that what you call me?
No, I have a million names for you.

360
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,590
Really? I'd love to hear them.

361
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,869
What can I get you guys?

362
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,870
Are you sure this is the place?

363
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,237
Just wait in the car.

364
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,952
<i>What is all this?</i>

365
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,237
A for effort, huh?

366
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,990
He made a lot of mistakes.

367
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,235
But for a first try, it's not bad.

368
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,797
It's not bad. No.

369
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,911
It's not great either.

370
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,351
Better than your first try.

371
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,758
Do you have to do this?

372
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,638
Yes, I do.

373
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,993
And when I find him,
I'll use this room.

374
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,557
Detective Quinn.
Hey, how are you holding up?

375
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,796
I haven't slept much, to be honest.

376
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,513
We, uh,

377
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,232
talked about a life together,
Cassie and I.

378
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,359
I know it's fast, but--
No, no, no.

379
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,638
I move fast too. Too fast.

380
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,598
Well, when it's right...

381
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,673
You're going through a tough time.

382
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,351
I was wondering if you could
take a look at a photo for me.

383
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,510
Have you seen that kid
around Cassie?

384
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,279
Maybe at her food truck?

385
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,753
Is this who you think killed her?

386
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,113
Just a person of interest.

387
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,032
I don't know him.

388
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,117
He looks familiar, but...

389
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,914
I'm sorry.

390
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,712
What on earth
is your daughter doing?

391
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,238
She's just clearing
the bad murder juju out of the lab.

392
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,517
Does she realise this is a department
founded in bad murder juju?

393
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,909
Where are we on this
Cassie Jollenston murder?

394
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,675
Been working on the customers
from her food truck,

395
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,517
but most of them paid in cash, so...
So they're hard to track down.

396
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,390
Any other leads?
None worth talking about.

397
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,110
I thought you said you weren't
a real hands-on teacher.

398
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,193
I didn't teach him this.

399
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,637
You did this to him?

400
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,952
Yes.
And he escaped.

401
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,072
I let him go.

402
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,393
Like me?

403
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,079
Not quite.

404
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,157
Dexter? What the fuck?

405
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,871
I told you to control yourself,
and what did you do?

406
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,838
You killed Cassie.
Cassie?

407
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,037
Who's Cass--?
Who the fuck is that?

408
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,915
You killed her next door to me,
to my son!

409
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,914
No, no, no!
I went after Shawn Decker.

410
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,958
Shawn Decker, who is that?
Wait.

411
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,919
Aren't you that old guy's wife?
Your ex-girlfriend?

412
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,720
She's with me now.

413
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,759
Nice. Did you take out
her husband?

414
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,240
Who is Shawn Decker?
This asshole I knew in high school.

415
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,791
He offed a girl two years ago
on spring break
then bragged about it.

416
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,792
Is she cool?
Yes.

417
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,792
She's cool.

418
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,394
Where were you two days ago?

419
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,671
I stopped by your place
after you blew me off,

420
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,197
then I came straight here.
I met your neighbour, the hot one.

421
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,033
That was Cassie.

422
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,551
She was alive when I left.

423
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,952
I've been on Shawn the whole time.
I'll show you on my camera.

424
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,629
How did you--?
How did you find me?

425
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,678
I tracked your credit card.

426
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,513
Right.

427
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,195
Shouldn't use my own card,
fuck-up on my part.

428
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,398
What'd you think of the room?
Did you do something to it?

429
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,597
Just show me the pictures.
Sorry.

430
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,677
This is Shawn Decker.

431
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,599
He lives here.

432
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,437
You can see by the time stamp,
I've been hunting him.

433
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,394
So I decided to go after a killer.

434
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,677
Someone who deserves it.

435
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,916
<i>He was following the code
without even knowing it.</i>

436
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,398
Do you have proof
that Shawn killed someone?

437
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,631
Yeah, he pulled me aside at a party,

438
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,952
showed me this video
of this redhead he met in Daytona.

439
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,951
He accidentally strangled her
while they were having sex.

440
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,277
Believe me,
world's better off without him.

441
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,712
Where is Shawn now?

442
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,240
It--

443
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,917
It didn't go exactly as I planned.
I thought I could just knock him out.

444
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,436
You sedated me, didn't you?
What did you use?

445
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,796
What happened?
I hit him over the head,

446
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,394
but it wasn't hard enough.

447
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,715
He barely went down,
so I just kept hitting him,
like, a lot.

448
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,360
Did anyone see you?

449
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,795
No, we were alone.

450
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,395
What were you planning
on doing with the body?

451
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,994
I didn't totally know.

452
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,914
I was gonna come back here,
get my camera, my knives,

453
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,391
I don't know, guess I just thought
drop him in the Everglades--

454
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,712
So you didn't have a plan.
I did. I was gonna do it here.

455
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,917
I mean, this place isn't bad, is it?

456
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,958
You see that second floor?

457
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,635
Anyone could see you
moving a body.

458
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,635
That wasn't on the website.
Pick a different place.

459
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,359
I'd already paid for the room.

460
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,713
You need to have a plan
and a backup plan, always.

461
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,510
Driving with a body in your trunk
in this heat is no plan at all.

462
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,558
You didn't even put plastic
in your car.

463
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,280
Oh, okay, that would've been
a good idea, yeah.

464
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,439
You and I are gonna
deal with this body,

465
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,196
and then scrub the car clean of DNA,
because one drop of blood,

466
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,320
a single hair,
could lead straight back to you.

467
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,631
Then after that,
we're gonna dump the car.

468
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,071
Well, how am I gonna get home?

469
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,072
We'll take you.

470
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,556
Awesome.

471
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,360
Can you deal with the room?
We should be a few hours.

472
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,273
Yeah, drive safe.

473
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,874
Dude.

474
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,636
Do not "dude" me.
Get in the car.

475
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,473
Watch yourself on the handle.

476
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,394
I cut myself on that piece of shit
a few days ago.

477
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,398
Have you cut yourself on this before?
No.

478
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,035
<i>Is that somehow how Zach's blood
ended up under Cassie's nails?</i>

479
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,078
I bled all over the place.

480
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,834
Look.

481
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,071
Fuck me. Gloves!

482
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,436
Just put your seat belt on.

483
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,351
Hannah-fucking-McKay.

484
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,590
Don't even think about it.
Where's Dexter?

485
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,559
Out.
Great, that'll make this a lot easier.

486
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,518
I'm supposed to just put those on?

487
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,559
You're under arrest.
You're not a police officer anymore.

488
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,518
Citizen's arrest.
Oh, right, really?

489
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,479
How about I arrest you
for aiding a serial killer?

490
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,838
You want that information out?
Talk all you fucking like.

491
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,791
No one would fucking believe you.
Better people than you have tried it.

492
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,996
Go ahead.
No!

493
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,631
The only way I'm leaving
is if you shoot me,
and you're not gonna.

494
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,913
I have done terrible things in my past,
but I've come to realise that as people,

495
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,640
we're all horribly flawed,
some more than others.

496
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,191
I'm not interested.
But we all have a will to survive,

497
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,070
and when in extreme situations,
people do extreme things.

498
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,834
That doesn't make it right.

499
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,555
Right or wrong doesn't make it
into the equation.

500
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,509
There are other forces driving us.
What's driving you?

501
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,113
Dexter.

502
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,992
The passing of the torch.

503
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,390
I taught you the code.

504
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,597
Now he's learning it from you.

505
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,513
And look at him.

506
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,640
You used to feel like that after a kill.

507
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,278
At peace.
Life was so simple then.

508
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,559
Killing consumed you,
crept into everything you did.

509
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,712
It was all you had.

510
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,159
But now?

511
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,030
Now I have Harrison.

512
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,795
He isn't a complication.

513
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,758
Hannah is.

514
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,672
She's more of a...

515
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,952
distraction.

516
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,636
Or is it possible
there's a stronger desire in you now?

517
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,276
Stronger than the need to kill?

518
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,997
I don't enjoy killing.

519
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,600
Why do you do it?

520
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,116
Sometimes it's the only way
to solve a problem.

521
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,193
When somebody comes at me
or threatens me, my life--

522
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,000
Like me?
I could've killed you the other day

523
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,720
and it would've made
my life easier, but I didn't.

524
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,594
Why?
Because I love your brother, and I--

525
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,350
I've learned how much
he cares about you.
I didn't want to hurt him.

526
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,674
He loves me too.
Do you really want to hurt him?

527
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,794
Fuck.

528
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,400
My brother screws up everything.

529
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,918
Oh, you're both still breathing.
That's a good sign.

530
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,034
What are you doing here?
I came here for her.

531
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,954
But how did you--?
GPS. I put it under your car.

532
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,476
You what?
I knew you wouldn't stay away.

533
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,520
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

534
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,677
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know anything else ever.

535
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,911
She's your problem now.

536
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,193
Dude.

537
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,792
I'm sorry,
you got girls fighting over you?

538
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,354
Let's get out of here.

539
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,479
Are we there yet?

540
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,990
Zach.

541
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,799
Hey.

542
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,079
Zach, it turns out, is a fast learner.

543
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,318
Well, I'm very relieved to hear that.
Why don't you come in, have dinner?

544
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,120
I'm starving.
I can't.

545
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,674
Who is that in the car?

546
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,878
That's Hannah.

547
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,114
Hannah McKay?

548
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,073
You weren't going
to introduce us?

549
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,234
Well, we've had a really long drive,
and she's leaving early tomorrow.

550
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,120
I think we're tired.
Surely, you must be hungry.

551
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,794
She can join us for dinner.

552
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,519
No, that's not--
I insist.

553
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,640
Either you invite her in or I will.

554
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,117
Dr. Vogel, um, this is Hannah.

555
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,318
Hi, nice to meet you.
Pleasure.

556
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,039
Call me Evelyn.

557
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,071
I trust there are no vegetarians here.

558
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,154
Hand me your plate.

559
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,920
It looks delicious.

560
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,596
An old family recipe.
Hope it holds out.

561
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,116
I can pass it along to you
if you'd like.

562
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,630
I guess you know your way
around the kitchen.

563
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,234
I'm an okay cook.

564
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,357
You're better than okay.

565
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,753
Well, I prefer gardening.

566
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,357
Bringing things to life.

567
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,113
Perfect.

568
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,313
The best hobbies are the ones
that take us furthest
from our primary occupation.

569
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,837
So you have a fascinating field.

570
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,231
How did you get interested in it?

571
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,437
Oh, an incident long ago
that I won't bore you with.

572
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,393
As to what keeps me
interested, well...

573
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,197
look around the table.

574
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,754
Elbows.

575
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,715
I've always maintained
that the greatest obstacle
in life isn't danger,

576
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,996
it's boredom.

577
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,351
Boredom?
Mm. The battle against it

578
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,194
is responsible for most
of the events in the world,

579
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,080
good or ill. I'm convinced of it.

580
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,594
Anyway, my patients
never fail to surprise.

581
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,589
They make life interesting,
thus, worth living.

582
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,632
For example,
I would never have imagined

583
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,238
that the affection you two share
could be possible,

584
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,750
for people like yourselves.

585
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,712
You are obviously
quite taken with each other.

586
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,751
You both have
a healthy blush response.

587
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,431
I'm embarrassing you.
Gee, you think?

588
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,195
The truth is,
you make a good couple.

589
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,359
And probably a bad one too.

590
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,433
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

591
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,511
Mm. There's too much red wine.

592
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,871
Yeah, there is.
No, it's perfect.

593
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,356
Dexter, you haven't said much.
Something on your mind?

594
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,514
It's, uh, Cassie's murder.

595
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,278
I doubt there's anything
this table can't handle.

596
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,470
The scene, it doesn't make sense.

597
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,358
Did you take any pictures?

598
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,152
Whoa.

599
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,591
It's just like Norma Rivera.

600
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,039
Look at the blood.

601
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,280
When someone's
bludgeoned to death,
blood is no longer just blood.

602
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,320
It's cast-off blood,
atomised blood, pooled blood.

603
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,032
Different first names
but same family,

604
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,950
with one story to tell.

605
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,599
I found your blood
underneath Cassie's fingernails.

606
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,400
But Zach had nothing to do
with Cassie's murder.

607
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,438
So how'd my blood end up there?

608
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,274
I'm wondering if it came
from your car door handle.

609
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,558
Think someone could have
done that to your car on purpose?

610
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,155
To set you up for her murder?

611
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,915
If so, they went to
a lot of trouble to frame you.

612
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,072
And why would someone do that?

613
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,833
Money?

614
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,436
You see?
Never a dull moment.

615
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,076
Hey, look at this, full house.

616
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,158
Welcome home.

617
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,113
Hey, buddy, what's that?

618
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,959
A zombie.
Nice.

619
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,796
I hope you don't mind that we're here.
Not at all.

620
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,917
Something happen with Quinn?

621
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,080
No, we're fine, I just--

622
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,675
You're still shaken up
about Cassie.

623
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,879
Is it okay if we stay with you tonight?

624
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,150
You two can stay here
as long as you want.

625
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,915
Thanks.
Especially if you're gonna cook.

626
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,992
Oh...

627
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,514
What happened with our fugitive?

628
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,520
Does it look like
she's handcuffed to my desk?

629
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,959
It does not.

630
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,393
You couldn't find her, so we will--
We'll keep looking.

631
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,156
Oh, fuck that, Hannah's probably
left the country by now.

632
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,152
It's a lost cause.
Heh.

633
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,155
What happened
to Miss Personal Vendetta?

634
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,154
She took your advice and let it go.

635
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,916
There's a lot of money in this.

636
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,357
I don't care about the money.

637
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,719
What the fuck
are you doing here then?

638
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,873
I don't know.
I've been asking myself
the same question.

639
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,635
Okay, is there something
you want to say to me?

640
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,354
I'm not sure I'm cut out
to be a private investigator.

641
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,672
Bullshit. Bullshit.
You're the best
I've ever worked with--

642
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,834
Given the work we do,
I'm not really sure that
I want it on my tombstone.

643
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,152
Fuck, sorry. I don't mean
to offend you or anything.

644
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,279
It's all right, it's all right.
Forget it, forget it.

645
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,992
I want to wake up now and then
and feel like what I do matters
more than a pay cheque.

646
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,994
Gotcha. So, what are you gonna do?
You--? You gonna--?

647
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,073
Gonna go back to being a cop?
That what you're gonna do?

648
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,715
I don't know, maybe. Yeah.

649
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,679
There's a reason
they call it a public servant.

650
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,390
You want to put your life on the line
for slave wages, be my guest.

651
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,873
But I'd advise you to think carefully
about throwing away this opportunity.

652
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,478
Hannah, I wish you the best of luck
with whatever's next.

653
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,791
Thank you.
And thank you for dinner.

654
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,720
It's refreshing to see a girl
who can really eat.

655
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,753
We have to go.

656
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,032
Can you drop Zach off at his home?
Of course.

657
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,112
Can I drive?
Not a chance.

658
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,511
My car's older than you.

659
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,073
It's not too bad.

660
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,277
Yeah, it's nice.

661
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,754
I'll be by at 6 tomorrow to pick you up.
I'll take a cab.

662
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,799
It's no problem.
I don't want to do this again. I--

663
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,919
I can't do this again.

664
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,476
Say goodbye.

665
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,350
You need anything? Are you hungry?
We just ate.

666
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,274
I'm sure if I get hungry
there's room service here.

667
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,510
Probably.

668
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,993
I'm just gonna shower
and go to bed, get up,
go to the dock.

669
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,880
Your plane leaves at 8:00.
Twenty-seven minutes later,
you'll land in Nassau.

670
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,591
Destroy your old passport.

671
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,035
From there,

672
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,591
where you go is up to you.

673
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,359
Where do you think you'll go?

674
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,672
Haven't decided.

675
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,917
Argentina?

676
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,798
Maybe.

677
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,958
Will you let me know?

678
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,873
Yes.

679
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,114
Okay.

680
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,553
I'll wait to hear from you.

681
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,440
Dexter, my passport.

682
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,717
Oh, right.

683
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,632
Almost forgot.

684
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,596
"Claire Thompson."

685
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,116
I guess I look like a Claire.

686
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,310
He assured me it's a name
that won't get flagged.

687
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,039
It's perfect. Thank you.

688
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,999
And here's a "Claire Thompson"
credit card.

689
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,631
I have some cash too, so...
When you land in Nassau,

690
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,759
make your last withdrawal
as Maggie Castner.
Keep it under 10 grand.

691
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,880
I can talk you through how to set up
an international bank account.

692
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,397
You should go.

693
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,194
I should go.

694
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,630

701
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,720

702
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,831
<i>But the changes...</i>

703
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,919
<i>they're never what we anticipate.</i>

704
00:50:54,360 --> 00:51:00,550
That's right. I believe Hannah McKay
was just in Miami going under
the alias of "Maggie Castner."

705
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,439
Hannah.

706
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,033
Don't go.

707
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,792
Stay with me.
