<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,037
It's no accident
that Zach Hamilton is here.

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,913
He's drawn to blood, like me.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,835
The arterial spurting here...

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,557
...indicates that the killer severed
the carotid artery with the first stab.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,638
- I'm promoting Miller to sergeant.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,197
You actually made me want this,
and now you're gonna take it away.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,795
I just did a little research on you.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,316
You checked into me, like a criminal.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,233
Hey, Niki....

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,997
Dexter, this is Oliver. Oliver, Dexter.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,719
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,672
Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.
He deserves to die.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,878
Isn't that a little intolerant
coming from you?

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,158
What if you were to teach Zach
the code?

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,837
Maybe it's time to see
if the experiment will work.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,232
What possibly makes you think
Zach could be taught the code?

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,595
I see something in him.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,717
Why were you going
to kill your father?

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,832
Because he's killing my mother.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,310
She's drinking herself to death
because of him.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,756
You killed because you want to kill.

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,550
- You should just go ahead and kill me.
- Why?

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,911
Because if you don't,
then I will do it again.

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,480
I can't help it.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,354
Am I ready to be a spiritual father?

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,316
Hey, you okay?

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,479
- I don't feel so good.
- Deb?

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,712
Hello, Dexter.

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,272
Remember me?

31
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,709
- Hello?
<i>- Dexter?</i>

32
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,276
<i>I was just about to leave you
another message.</i>

33
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,954
<i>Where have you been all morning?</i>

34
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,476
<i>The last thing I remember is...</i>

35
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,240
<i>...Hannah.</i>

36
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,834
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,390
<i>Not if Hannah got to Deb.</i>

38
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,149
I can't really talk now.

39
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,711
I just thought you should know
that Zach Hamilton called.

40
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,873
I'm so glad you decided
not to kill him, Dexter.

41
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,720
I have to go.

42
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,678
Deb, are you okay?

43
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,240
Dex, where the fuck are you?

44
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,839
Just a sec.

45
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,794
I'm outside of Kendall.
Are you alone?

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,879
Why wouldn't I be?
Why are you on the other side of town?

47
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
I need you to come pick me up.
Are you okay to drive?

48
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,397
I think so.
I mean, who the fuck knows?

49
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,315
I woke up on the floor feeling like shit.
You were gone.

50
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,995
What the fuck is happening?

51
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,153
<i>Just come pick me up.
I'll text you the location.</i>

52
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,471
<i>We'll talk when you get here.</i>

53
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,515
<i>Hannah drugged us...</i>

54
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,070
<i>...left me stranded
in the middle of nowhere.</i>

55
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,432
<i>If she's come back because she wants
one or both of us dead...</i>

56
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,000
<i>...then why are we both still here?</i>

57
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,759
- It was Hannah, wasn't it?
- It was.

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,799
I saw her before I blacked out,
and then I woke up here.

59
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,633
She must have drugged our food.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,356
If Hannah poisoned us,
why didn't she kill us?

61
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,399
Who the fuck knows, Dexter?
Maybe we were supposed to eat more.

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,592
Or she wants to let us know
she's out there.

63
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,116
Maybe this was just the beginning.

64
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,393
If we were normal people, we would go
to the U.S. Marshals Service.

65
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,711
We can't do that.
She knows everything about me.

66
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,315
She didn't talk about you
last time she was arrested.

67
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,836
Because she was in love with me.

68
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,511
Drugging me and leaving me on
the road might suggest that's changed.

69
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,438
So, what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

70
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,479
There are traffic-surveillance
cameras.

71
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,794
She had to have passed them.

72
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,714
I'll put in a request for the footage,
get a licence plate.

73
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,832
I thought this part
of my life was over.

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,798
So did I.

75
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,314
The moment I asked you to kill her...

76
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,517
...was the moment
I started to lose myself...

77
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,036
...and I'm just starting to get back.

78
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,391
I don't wanna deal with this.

79
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,675
I want her gone.

80
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,717
Deb, I'll take care of this. I promise.

81
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,070
<i>Hannah. Just thinking about her
throws me off course.</i>

82
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,350
<i>I have to put in a request
for the traffic footage.</i>

83
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,237
Zach, what are you doing here?

84
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,040
You were supposed to meet me
at 10:00 this morning.

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,954
- You could have been followed.
- By who? Oh, Detective Quinn?

86
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,918
- No, he's pretty easy to lose.
- Yeah.

87
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,955
But one day, he'll be there
when you don't expect him.

88
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,112
Don't ever come to my home again.

89
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,999
- I just wanted to talk to you--
- Ever.

90
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,715
We can't be seen in public together.
Do you understand?

91
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,510
- That's your first lesson.
- Jeez, I'm sorry. It's just....

92
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,880
- I spoke to Dr. Vogel, and she--
- What exactly did she tell you?

93
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,394
That you have this, like,
way of living that...

94
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,239
...allows you to do
what you and I have in common...

95
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,989
...and that might be something
that I can do too.

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,878
I mean, fuck,
I have so many questions.

97
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,269
And I'll answer them as best I can.

98
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,677
Are you gonna help me be like you?

99
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,911
Don't even pretend.

100
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,480
Hi, Dexter.

101
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,634
- Going for a little night swim.
- Enjoy.

102
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,711
- Who's she?
- That's my neighbour.

103
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,554
- She's cute.
- Yes, she's cute.

104
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,949
You need to go home.

105
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,271
- When are we gonna talk about--?
- I'll call you.

106
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,591
Something has come up
that I have to deal with.

107
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,510
It's my day job,
which is something you need to get.

108
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,110
Why? I have money.

109
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,192
You're a weird guy
who lives with his mom.

110
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,033
You might as well be wearing a sign.

111
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,156
Look, all I'm saying is that you need
to have some kind of cover life...

112
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,710
...something that makes you
look ordinary.

113
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,599
Yeah, right, yeah. I get it, yeah.

114
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,837
Zach, I understand
what you're going through.

115
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,480
I will help you with this.

116
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,959
Okay.

117
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,673
Thanks.

118
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,312
Not a single sighting
since she disappeared?

119
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,233
Thank you.

120
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,437
Motherfuck.

121
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,360
- What you doing?
- Nothing.

122
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,472
Why do you look like
you just got caught?

123
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,877
Come on, what are you doing?
Looking at porn?

124
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,474
- No.
- Company computer.

125
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,235
- Will you--?
- And I am the boss.

126
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,358
Hannah McKay.
Wayne Randall's girlfriend, right?

127
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,672
Got arrested a while back
for something, then slipped away?

128
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,036
- Why you looking her up?
- None of your business.

129
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,759
Will you fucking back off?

130
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,235
- Jesus, relax.
- No, I'm ser--

131
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,790
You come in here all the time
and invade my space.

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,595
You stand so close, try to flirt.

133
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,553
You're fucking
making me uncomfortable.

134
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,194
I didn't come in here to flirt.

135
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,513
I just came in here to see if you wanted
me to pick you up something for lunch.

136
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,951
I'm all set.

137
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,916
Are we done?

138
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,560
Yeah.

139
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,992
Yeah, we're done.

140
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,914
You know what?
We're not done, actually.

141
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,232
See, Deb, you came to me
six months ago an emotional wreck...

142
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,676
...saying you quit the force
and you needed a job.

143
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,069
I gave you that job.

144
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,472
I gave you good pay, good benefits.
I didn't ask a lot of questions.

145
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,314
I put up with a lot of weird shit
from you...

146
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,791
...because you're good at your job,
and because I'm a nice guy.

147
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,318
So I'm really, really sorry
if this cramps your style...

148
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,791
...but next time, maybe you wanna try
a little gratitude...

149
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,158
...instead of always being
such a fucking bitch.

150
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,037
Now we're done.

151
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,478
<i>There she is.</i>

152
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,360
<i>"Vista Marina Car Rentals."</i>

153
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,839
<i>Vista Marina Car Rentals.
This is Stacy. How may I help you?</i>

154
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,596
Hi, Stacy. This is Detective Cooper
over at Miami Metro.

155
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,390
My badge number is 143634.

156
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,552
We're investigating a hit-and-run.

157
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,350
We think somebody who rented one of
your vans might have been a witness.

158
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,910
I was hoping to get some information
over the phone.

159
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,596
I can fax you over a copy
of the warrant if you'd like.

160
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,914
<i>Oh, I'll just get it for you.
Do you have the licence plate?</i>

161
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,951
Yes, I do. It's GLV43951.

162
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,520
<i>The name on that account
is Maggie Castner.</i>

163
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,593
<i>The local address is Slip 23,
Vista Marina.</i>

164
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,319
Thank you, Stacy.

165
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,392
<i>Want the phone number?</i>

166
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,511
Yes, that would be helpful.

167
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,036
<i>813-398-2723.</i>

168
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,993
You may have found her.

169
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,112
If so, a little too easily.

170
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,590
You think she wants to be found?

171
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,312
I think she wants to destroy our lives,
mine and Debra's both.

172
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,756
Debra's very fragile right now.

173
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,079
The threat of Hannah coming after her
could derail the progress she's making.

174
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,994
- I won't let that happen.
- So, what's your plan?

175
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,991
- Slip 23.
- You have her number. You could call.

176
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,913
I don't wanna let her know
I've found her yet.

177
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,551
Why do you seem less scared
than excited?

178
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,757
Because Hannah doesn't scare me.

179
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,832
Maybe you need to rethink that.

180
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,954
They look like nice apartments...

181
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,516
...but you should work things out
with your brother.

182
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,036
Angel and I are gonna be fine.
I've just had it...

183
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,318
...with the whole "big brother
ruling over the roost" routine.

184
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,120
And the thing is....

185
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,520
What?

186
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,838
Well, just most of these places,
I have to sign a one-year lease...

187
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,435
...and I wasn't sure about....

188
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,079
About what?

189
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,039
Okay. I'm definitely not pushing you,
okay?

190
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,431
I'm just trying to be practical here.

191
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,991
If our relationship
keeps moving forward...

192
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,517
...we might want to eventually
get a place together.

193
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,357
- Yeah, eventually.
- You don't have to decide now.

194
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,470
- It's just something to think about.
- Yeah, I'll totally think about it.

195
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,714
Okay.

196
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm so sorry.

197
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,992
I blew that whole thing
out of proportion.

198
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,471
I just felt like you were trying to, like,
get rid of me with the cheque.

199
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,554
I was just trying to be a good,
you know, father.

200
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,080
That was really sweet of you.

201
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,517
But it's my problem,
and I wanna take care of it.

202
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,278
Well, I can respect that.

203
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,755
- So we're cool?
- Cool.

204
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,912
How about you and I
do dinner tonight?

205
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,437
I can't.
I have to work right after class.

206
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,672
- You know, pay off the debts.
- Well, good for you.

207
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,593
Where are you working?

208
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,278
It's a sports bar called Lucky Pete's.

209
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,232
I can call you though, when I'm free.
We can get together.

210
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,797
Okay. Sounds great.

211
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,518
<i>The Hannah McKay I know
hated the ocean.</i>

212
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,839
<i>But it does make for an easy escape
into international waters.</i>

213
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,511
<i>Brave of her
to be walking around Miami like that.</i>

214
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,638
<i>Or maybe she's found someone
to protect her.</i>

215
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,311
- May I help you?
- I'm just meeting some friends.

216
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,637
I'm sorry, sir. Members only.

217
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,950
Oh, but I'm a friend of--

218
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,954
Even so, sir,
we have a strict dress code.

219
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,438
Call it a night, Dexter.

220
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,115
- You don't wanna go in there.
- I do wanna go in there.

221
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,876
It's their territory.
You'll be at a disadvantage.

222
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,633
I need to know what she's up to.

223
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,636
Dexter.

224
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,520
Is your father a member
of the Red Coral Club?

225
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,071
Yeah.
It's full of old farts in suits. Why?

226
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,709
Can you get me in there? Tonight?

227
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,555
Yeah. Sure.

228
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,517
Good to see you, Mr. Hamilton.

229
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,960
This way.

230
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,039
- So, what are we doing here?
- Looking for someone.

231
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,716
I thought we weren't supposed
to be seen together.

232
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,837
This is different.

233
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,753
You know her?

234
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,917
That's my ex-girlfriend.

235
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,154
Nice.

236
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,754
Who's the guy?

237
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,036
I'm gonna find out.

238
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,633
All right, you keep an eye on him.

239
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,759
- You text me when he's coming back.
- Got it.

240
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,316
Hannah.

241
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,751
It's Maggie now.

242
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,639
You shouldn't be here, Dexter.

243
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,996
I'm not leaving until you tell me why
you drugged me and left me on the road.

244
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,511
After what you did to me, I'm not sure
that you get to ask questions.

245
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,639
But here I am, asking.
What are you doing back in Miami?

246
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,793
I was about to enjoy a martini.

247
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,232
You should probably leave though,
before my husband returns.

248
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,437
Your husband?

249
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,317
You're married to that guy?

250
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,400
Yes. I'm very lucky.

251
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,992
Yeah. Well, he seems rich.
You were always a pragmatist.

252
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,153
Well, the money's nice,
I have to admit...

253
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,558
...but he has other talents.

254
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,599
Miles is the adventurous type.

255
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,434
- What are you doing here?
- My husband will be back any minute.

256
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,354
It's in your best interest
that he not see us together.

257
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,479
I'm not leaving until you tell me
why you did what you did.

258
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,314
I see you've made a friend.

259
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,110
This is my husband, Miles Castner.

260
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,751
Dexter Morgan.

261
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,639
Maggie has told me about you.

262
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,312
How you were her boyfriend
until you betrayed her...

263
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,159
...turning her in to the police.

264
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,154
Quite a predicament you left her in.

265
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,630
Shall we finish our drinks?

266
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,879
I think it's time for us to go.

267
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,038
Well, that's an excellent idea.

268
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,278
Make sure Mr. Morgan
is given whatever he needs.

269
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,874
Didn't you get my text?
I warned you the guy was coming.

270
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,315
I know.

271
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,513
So why didn't you walk away?

272
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,315
I mean, I watched him.
I stayed on him. I didn't fuck up.

273
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,713
I screwed up, not you.
You did exactly as I asked you to.

274
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,953
- So, what now?
- Nothing.

275
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,592
I'll call you. We'll talk tomorrow.

276
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,594
So that guy, are we go--?

277
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,432
You gonna kill him?

278
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,399
I only kill people who deserve it.

279
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,954
<i>--do you hear?
Because something sure ain't right.</i>

280
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,430
<i>While them orphans was camping
in the woods...</i>

281
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,557
<i>...something gave them
a proper fright.</i>

282
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,590
<i>Miles Castner made his fortune
in international casinos.</i>

283
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,953
<i>He has the power and the reach to
get Hannah a new name, new passport.</i>

284
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,955
<i>But if she's as happy as she seems
in her new life...</i>

285
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,955
<i>...then why is she here,
messing with mine?</i>

286
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,873
<i>Miles Castner.
What kind of name is Miles, anyway?</i>

287
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,360
<i>Don't be a chump, Zoomer.
Ain't no such thing as....</i>

288
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,196
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

289
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,872
Hello?

290
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,275
Harrison, hello?

291
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,513
That's it?

292
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,352
I remember when I used to get a hug.

293
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,910
Hey, even I don't matter
when <i>Rastamouse</i> is on.

294
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,471
I checked in with Marshals, FBI,
fucking Homeland Security.

295
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,195
There hasn't been a single sighting
of Hannah McKay.

296
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,955
- I'm hoping you've had better luck.
- Yeah.

297
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,032
I found her.

298
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,236
She's married.

299
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,637
Well, there's someone for everyone,
I guess.

300
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,073
I hope he's sleeping
with one eye open.

301
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,873
What's her married name?

302
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,350
The guy she's married to
is worth $700 million.

303
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,955
He owns casinos.

304
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,995
The name, Dex.

305
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,710
Castner. Miles Castner.

306
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,640
They're staying on his yacht.

307
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,993
I don't know what they're doing
in Miami. Maybe he has business here.

308
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,992
He seems to know who she is...

309
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,436
...even knows about her and me.

310
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,119
And she seems to like him.

311
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,590
Or maybe she just feels
obligated to him.

312
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,639
I doubt Hannah McKay
feels obligated to anyone.

313
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,395
It's gotta be operational.
She needs a cover life.

314
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,598
It's not like it's a real marriage.

315
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,595
She can't actually love this guy.

316
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,638
Oh, my God.

317
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,276
- You're still in love with her.
- What? No.

318
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,909
She's probably trying to kill me.

319
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,238
Trust me,
no one knows what it's like...

320
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,313
...to fall in love with the wrong person
more than I do.

321
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,158
But you better get
your fucking head on straight.

322
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,276
She is everything that is wrong
with our lives.

323
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,912
She is a vortex. She is a black hole.

324
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,314
She sucks everything into her being,
leaving nothing behind.

325
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,429
We have got to get her
out of our lives.

326
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,717
I'm working on a plan.

327
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,991
Are you sure you can be objective?

328
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,916
One little toss
of Hannah's pretty blond hair...

329
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,231
...and you turn into a fucking moron.

330
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,680
Hannah?

331
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,320
Hannah is here?

332
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,910
Both of you? Jesus. Really?

333
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,673
Deb, I'm on top of it.

334
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,760
I'm gonna figure out
exactly what she's up to.

335
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,759
Are you?

336
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,956
Where is Hannah?

337
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,158
Right now she's on a very big boat
with her husband.

338
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,433
Niki.

339
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,636
Hey. Hey, what are you doing here?

340
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,393
I came here to see you.

341
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,638
I didn't realise
this place was a breastaurant.

342
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,236
I mean, it is a sports bar,
it's just topless.

343
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,514
- And I make really good money here.
- Are you really okay doing this?

344
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,276
Yeah. It's not the best job in the world,
but it's also not forever.

345
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,160
I'm fine with it.
I can tell that you're not.

346
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,720
Me?

347
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,920
Look, I go to places like this
all the time.

348
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,236
- See?
- I've--

349
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,915
Look, I've stared at a million boobs,
but until now...

350
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,390
...I've never considered them to be...

351
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,676
...daughter boobs.

352
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,950
- Daughter boobs?
- Well, come on. You know what I mean.

353
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,999
Guy, hey. Her face is up here, okay?
Come on.

354
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,992
It's so sweet that you care.

355
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,597
I'm just gonna stay here until
something better comes along, okay?

356
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,434
Yeah, I'll....
I'll let you do your thing.

357
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,592
You wanna have dinner
on my next free night?

358
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,955
Yeah.

359
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,677
That's great.

360
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,273
It actually makes sense in a way...

361
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,000
...that Dexter would have been
involved with another killer.

362
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,078
Well, she's back.

363
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,039
And she poisoned us.
Who knows what else she has planned?

364
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,236
What does Dexter say?

365
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,232
He's trying to figure out
what she's up to...

366
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,596
...but he's thinking
with the wrong head.

367
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,434
- You're concerned for your safety.
- And for Dexter's.

368
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,234
Let's take a step back.

369
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,880
From what you've told me...

370
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,509
...if she wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead by now.

371
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,110
Maybe she just wants to prove
that she has control.

372
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,033
She can kill us whenever she wants.

373
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,715
- It's a very unsettling feeling, isn't it?
- Yeah.

374
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,155
What is it you'd like to do?

375
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,836
I'd like to take her to Marshal Services
and have her the fuck arrested.

376
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,276
- But Hannah knows too much.
- Yeah.

377
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,556
But at least I wouldn't have to worry
about what might be in my coffee.

378
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,032
When the Brain Surgeon was out there,
a threat to me, I could hardly sleep.

379
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,195
I trusted Dexter to solve the problem,
and he did.

380
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,596
And if I can't?

381
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,076
Before you take matters
into your own hands...

382
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,358
...be sure to consider
all the consequences of those actions.

383
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,790
<i>The husband is a complication
I don't need.</i>

384
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,876
<i>I have to get Hannah alone,
in a situation I control.</i>

385
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,839
Have you done the blood work
on the triple in Lummus Park?

386
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,640
- Not yet.
- There's the prints on the bottle to run...

387
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,520
...and the decomp over in
Coconut Grove we have to process.

388
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,194
Yep.

389
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,352
We could use an extra set
of hands, right?

390
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,749
Someone lower level...

391
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,839
...an extra warm body to offset
the cold ones, don't you think?

392
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,515
At least to make a dent
in the paperwork.

393
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,230
- Sure, I guess.
- Excellent idea.

394
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,117
<i>Zach. What's he doing here?</i>

395
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,514
Quinn.

396
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,556
Okay.

397
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,599
My client requests
that you cease and desist...

398
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,514
...this 24-hour watch
you have on him.

399
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,071
He requests it.
I'd like you to back the fuck off.

400
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,479
- You took these photos, Zach?
- Yeah.

401
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,678
- Those are just the best ones.
- Quinn, you have anything to say?

402
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,958
- I think the kid's guilty.
- I'll answer for you, Detective Quinn.

403
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,999
On behalf of the entire department,
I can assure you we will--

404
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,795
Well, how did you put it, Zach?
--back the fuck down.

405
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,394
- "Off."
- Yeah, that too.

406
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,752
Right Detective Quinn?
,

407
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,193
- Right.
- That's right.

408
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,750
Gentlemen, let me show you out.

409
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,036
What were you thinking?

410
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,351
That rich asshole
is walking around free.

411
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,354
- We have nothing on this kid.
- That's why I was following him.

412
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,354
If this was any other case,
I would sign off on the overtime.

413
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,552
But this one...

414
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,149
...let it go. That's an order.

415
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,800
By the way,
me and Jamie are moving in together.

416
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,553
You're what? You're doing what?

417
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,837
- Hey, you got a minute?
- Make it fast.

418
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,515
Okay, well, Dexter and I are buried
in that glass box.

419
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,831
- We need an assistant.
- I don't know about that.

420
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,555
We've been under budget
the last three quarters.

421
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,630
- It was Dexter's idea.
- Okay. Part-time.

422
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,360
You're one hell of a lieutenant.

423
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,634
The photos were a nice touch.

424
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,160
Thanks. I thought so.

425
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,592
Well, now he's off my tail,
we can get down to business.

426
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,877
You know, find someone to....

427
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,271
- You know.
- Eventually.

428
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,432
What do you mean, "eventually"?

429
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,353
I mean....

430
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,158
Long before my father taught me
how to do what I do...

431
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,472
...he taught me how not to do it.

432
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,871
Why would I want to not do it?

433
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,475
Timing is everything.

434
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,754
One thing you need to learn,
the first thing that I had to learn...

435
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,673
...is to wait.

436
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,040
Control your urges.
Channel them appropriately.

437
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,960
Dexter, I can't wait.

438
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,116
- I can't control it.
- Yes, you can.

439
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,634
You're gonna get your chance, Zach,
I promise.

440
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,350
But the only way I've survived
as long as I have is by being careful.

441
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,955
I'm gonna teach you how to do that.

442
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,520
And then?

443
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,752
And then you'll be able
to do what I do...

444
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,235
...and get away with it.

445
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,555
- What do you want?
- I saw you with your son.

446
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,715
Maggie never mentioned him.

447
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,678
Hard to picture her
as the family type.

448
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,036
There's nothing going on
between Hannah and me.

449
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,395
Good. Then listen.

450
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,631
I'd sooner see her in prison
than lose her.

451
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,832
Do you understand?

452
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,913
Because I could call a few people
and ruin your life.

453
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,037
And being a family man,
I'm sure that's not what you'd want.

454
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,472
People are so impatient.

455
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,829
Dexter, what are you doing?

456
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,514
This is something
you don't wanna get in the middle of.

457
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,156
He said he'd sooner see her in prison
than lose her.

458
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,631
If that's what he thinks this is about,
she's the one in danger.

459
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,356
I thought you were gonna find out if
Hannah was a threat to you and Debra...

460
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,751
...not if Miles was a threat to Hannah.

461
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,795
Why can't I do both?

462
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,553
Your flowers.

463
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,869
That's the thing about plants.
You don't look after them, they die.

464
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,238
So, what's up?

465
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,157
Miles just confronted me
at a gas station.

466
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,760
God.

467
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,391
- He likes to be dramatic.
- Is he a threat?

468
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,951
A "chop you up and toss you
in the ocean" kind of threat?

469
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,799
No.

470
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,437
But he could make your life miserable,
have people look into you...

471
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,195
...and follow you around 24/7.

472
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,999
He sounds like a great guy.

473
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,517
And you're really in a position
to judge?

474
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,836
Why did you marry him?

475
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,356
Because he was there
when you weren't.

476
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,360
I needed him, Dexter.

477
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,317
I met him a few years ago when I did
some flowers for him at an event...

478
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,154
...and he found
my background intriguing.

479
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,159
I could tell he had a crush on me,
so when I made my escape...

480
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,272
...when I had nothing
and was desperate...

481
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,750
...I knew that he could give me
a whole new life...

482
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,833
...a new identity, money.

483
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,995
Plus, he makes me happy.

484
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,596
Bullshit.

485
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,434
If you're so damn happy,
what are you doing back here?

486
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,759
Why'd you drug Debra and me?

487
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,673
- I think you should go.
- Answer me.

488
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,317
I wanted to make sure
you weren't gonna put me in jail.

489
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,030
- I had to see if you would come to me.
- I did, and you haven't told me why.

490
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,953
Because it doesn't matter why
anymore.

491
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,158
- I changed my mind.
- About what?

492
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,758
I wanted you to kill Miles for me.

493
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,759
You what?

494
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,472
He's possessive and controlling...

495
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,758
...and obsessed with me to the point
where he follows me everywhere.

496
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,310
I might as well be in prison.

497
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,156
If I were to try and leave him,
he would just turn me in.

498
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,630
Why haven't you dealt with this
in your usual way?

499
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,038
His family already thought I was
some gold digger when we got married.

500
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,953
If he was gonna drop dead
suddenly...

501
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,760
...I would be the first person
that they would turn to.

502
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,556
- Once the cops get a good look at me--
- You wanted me to make him disappear.

503
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,071
I thought you might feel like
you owed me.

504
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,550
- Owed you?
- You didn't have to turn me in.

505
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,439
- You ruined my life.
- I did.

506
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,877
It doesn't even matter anymore,
because like I said, I changed my mind.

507
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,350
This is my problem,
and I'm gonna deal with it.

508
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,557
Why did you change your mind?

509
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,829
Because the moment
that I saw you there unconscious...

510
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,839
...I realised that despite
the shitty way that it all ended...

511
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,918
...you were it for me, Dexter.

512
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,597
I've never felt that way about anyone
before or since.

513
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,597
You're the only person
that I can be that honest with.

514
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,520
And I didn't wanna ruin that...

515
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,472
...by manipulating you into doing
something that might be bad for you.

516
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,955
It was the same for me.

517
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,829
No, just leave it at that. I have to go
before Miles finds out where I've gone.

518
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,033
- Hannah.
- Goodbye.

519
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,995
Hey.

520
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,598
Can I borrow that high-tech
GPS tracker thingy that you have?

521
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,473
Please?

522
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,993
Yeah. Being nice
when you need something, huh?

523
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,197
I'm not surprised.

524
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,358
Sorry that I overreacted earlier.

525
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,155
I know that you're interested.

526
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,640
You act like you are.

527
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,998
But, Jake,
you don't wanna get involved with me.

528
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,913
You have no idea who I really am.

529
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,354
I just want a chance to find out.

530
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,196
Can I help you? Is that your car?

531
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,392
It's my brother's car.

532
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,870
I think I left my sunglasses
in the passenger seat.

533
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,675
- He's not answering his phone.
- Your brother is...?

534
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,196
Dexter Morgan.
He lives in the building.

535
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,875
Oh, you're Dexter's sister.
I'm Cassie, his neighbour.

536
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,110
Debra. Oh, fuck.

537
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,237
You're Cassie.
You went out with him, right?

538
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,273
Really? He mentioned me?

539
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,272
- You look surprised.
- I am.

540
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,478
I guess I figured he thought
I was the worst date ever.

541
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,955
He didn't exactly follow up.

542
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,397
But he's nice to me when I see him.
He's kind of impossible to read.

543
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,990
- Yeah, that would be Dexter.
- Oh, okay, good.

544
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,153
- I was starting to think it was me.
- Nope, definitely not you.

545
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,513
Hey, since I've got you here,
what's his deal?

546
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,877
Jamie seems to think
he's not over his ex...

547
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,759
...which makes him more attractive.

548
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,230
Apparently, I have a thing
for unavailable men.

549
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,834
Sorry. That was an overshare.

550
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,356
- That's all right. I get it.
- It's so crazy, right?

551
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,115
I meet this totally nice guy
who's completely into me...

552
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,318
...and I'm still hung up
on the mysterious man next door...

553
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,437
...who hasn't called.

554
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,478
I don't know you...

555
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,316
...at all, actually, but you seem
like a normal girl, you know?

556
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,156
If I were you, I would stick with the guy
that's obviously interested.

557
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,116
Trust me, Dexter is not a mystery
that you wanna solve.

558
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,316
Okay. Yeah. Sorry about all that.

559
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,040
- It's all right. Have a good one.
- See you.

560
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,473
- Hey.
- Hey.

561
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,791
You could've come inside.
I just got your text.

562
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,311
Well, you know, I think I've seen
enough of that place, you know.

563
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,312
So, what brings you by?

564
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,709
I wanted to let you know...

565
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,992
...that a lab-assistant position
just opened up at Miami Metro...

566
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,117
...and it's yours if you want it.

567
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,350
What does it pay?

568
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,194
Thirteen seventy-five an hour,
plus dental.

569
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,718
I make a lot more money
than that here.

570
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,998
You did say that this wasn't
your first choice as a line of work.

571
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,471
I figured you'd jump at the chance for a
future that didn't include pole dancing.

572
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,360
I'm not gonna be a stripper, Dad.

573
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,240
Hey, it just slipped out.

574
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,829
That's okay.
Well, listen, just do me a favour.

575
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,229
Just think about it, okay?

576
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,392
I think it would be good
for the both of us.

577
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,597
Okay. All right.

578
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,549
- Bye.
- Bye.

579
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,514
Well, that's probably best
for all involved.

580
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,514
Two psychopaths together.

581
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,750
- Never a good mix.
- Hannah's not a psychopath.

582
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,874
- She has feelings.
- I'll have to take your word for that.

583
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,829
Anyway, I called you over here tonight
because I'm concerned about Zach.

584
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,754
He came to me today
in a very agitated state.

585
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,755
I didn't let him kill his father and now
he's feeling the urge more than ever.

586
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,912
And how do you plan to handle it?

587
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,434
I was 10 years old when Harry told me
what my future would be.

588
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,399
I didn't kill until I was 19.

589
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,959
Zach can wait.
He just doesn't know he can.

590
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,155
Apples and oranges, Dexter.

591
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,512
- Sorry?
- You thought you had no choice...

592
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,559
...but to wait
because your father told you to.

593
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,393
But you were just a boy
who'd never taken a human life.

594
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,956
- Zach has already killed.
- Don't get me wrong.

595
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,510
I'm glad you took him off your table.

596
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,232
But the moment you did,
Zach became your responsibility.

597
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,116
He's relying on you, Dexter.

598
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,032
You need to take this very seriously.

599
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,318
<i>Hi, you've reached Zach Hamilton.
Please leave a message.</i>

600
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,676
Hey, Zach. It's Dexter.

601
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,710
Let's meet tomorrow afternoon, 2 p.m.
I'll come to your studio.

602
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,832
<i>It's good that Hannah's leaving.</i>

603
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,835
<i>I have enough on my plate
trying to turn a young killer into...</i>

604
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,076
<i>...someone like me.</i>

605
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,831
<i>Miles knows that Hannah and I
saw each other yesterday.</i>

606
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,554
<i>If Miles will do this to me...</i>

607
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,671
<i>...what will he do to her?</i>

608
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,910
So who you tracking?

609
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,679
I'm just kidding, obviously.

610
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,231
I don't wanna invade your privacy.
I just wanna see if you need anything.

611
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,232
- I'm good.
- Okay.

612
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,073
Jake.

613
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,317
I know I can be
kind of a dick sometimes.

614
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,596
You don't deserve that.

615
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,313
It's okay. Most people think
I'm a dick too, so I guess we're even.

616
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,514
This past year hasn't been my best.

617
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,951
The truth is, I wouldn't be surviving it
if it weren't for you, so thank you.

618
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,913
You're welcome.

619
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,393
Dexter?

620
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,274
Come on, what the fuck? Dexter!

621
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,070
It looks like he's not home.

622
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,678
- Can I give him a message?
- Yeah. Fuck him.

623
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,914
Hey, babe.

624
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,639
Good hunting?

625
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,952
Yeah, I found a couple dresses.
I think you'll really like them.

626
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,440
Nice.

627
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,196
I'm guessing today's shopping
went better than yesterday's.

628
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,397
- About the same.
- Really?

629
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,991
That's surprising, considering there
probably isn't much of a selection...

630
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,117
...at your old greenhouse.

631
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,954
What are you talking about?

632
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,840
You were with your friend...

633
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,711
...Dexter Morgan.

634
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,752
Well, he a--
He asked to see me.

635
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,596
He wanted to make sure that I was
all right after you confronted him...

636
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,797
...and I told him
that everything was fine...

637
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,595
...that we were very happy together,
end of story.

638
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,911
Don't lie to me. I know the truth.

639
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,549
No, Miles, I told you,
I don't care about him anymore.

640
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,110
- So you won't be too upset, then.
- About what?

641
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,273
About what yesterday's excursion
is going to cost your friend.

642
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,000
- Miles, that's unnecessary.
- You've made it necessary.

643
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,072
No, please, don't hurt him.

644
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,152
Don't hurt him?
Why, because you love him?

645
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,994
No, I promise you,
I'm not ever gonna see him again.

646
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,834
He's the reason you insisted
on coming with me to Miami...

647
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,515
...returning to a place
where you're a wanted criminal.

648
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,830
Miles.

649
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,072
He's the unfinished business
you mentioned.

650
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,115
I want you to know I forgive you.
We're going to make a new beginning.

651
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,511
I've already told the crew
we're leaving tonight.

652
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,956
We'll sail up the coast
and cross the Atlantic...

653
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,430
...just the two of us,
for the rest of our lives.

654
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,479
- That's how much I care about you.
- No, Miles. Stop it, please.

655
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,520
- You'll never have to leave this boat.
- Stop, please.

656
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,118
I've given you everything.
You belong to me.

657
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,318
No, stop it. Get off.

658
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,520
I.... I tried to run...

659
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,280
...but he just grabbed me.

660
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,035
I didn't mean for it
to happen this way.

661
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,878
Are you hurt?

662
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,872
I'm okay.

663
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,036
We need bleach, bags...

664
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,877
...something to cut with,
an axe or a saw or something like that.

665
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,199
You think you can get me those...

666
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,353
...without letting the crew know
that anything's wrong?

667
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,080
Yeah, I think so. Yes.

668
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,360
Wait, you need to change.

669
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,078
- Right.
- Hannah.

670
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,116
It's gonna be okay.

671
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,276
I'll take care of everything.

672
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,952
I believe you.

673
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,432
So that's how you make
people disappear.

674
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,117
Give or take a plastic room
and a kill table, yeah.

675
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,551
Yeah, I remember that part.

676
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,949
Do you ever wish
that you had followed through?

677
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,112
With killing me?

678
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,193
No.

679
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,554
You ever wish you had?

680
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,717
I was never going to kill you, Dexter.

681
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,433
It's just....

682
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,114
Well, I knew I couldn't live with Miles
for much longer...

683
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,749
...and unlike you,
I don't actually enjoy any of this.

684
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,677
So, what's next?

685
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,550
I told the crew that Miles was going
to New York for a few days...

686
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,719
...so that should buy me some time.

687
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,315
What's wrong?

688
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,275
I have to go to a crime scene...

689
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,273
...at my apartment building.

690
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,115
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

691
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,158
I have to go.

692
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,874
Please don't leave town
before we talk again.

693
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,150
I won't.

694
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,789
<i>This could be my apartment.</i>

695
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,437
<i>Cassie.</i>

696
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,159
Dexter?

697
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,560
What happened?

698
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,196
I don't know. I just got here.

699
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,599
Cassie and I, we were supposed
to have a date tonight.

700
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,834
I'm sorry.

701
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,630
I know you were friends.
You okay to work this?

702
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,110
Yeah. Yeah.

703
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,518
What do you see?

704
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,437
She was bludgeoned.

705
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,920
See those marks on her neck?

706
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,072
Someone held her down
and beat her to death.

707
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,959
God.

708
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,155
<i>Norma Rivera was bludgeoned.</i>

709
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,360
<i>Is it possible Zach did this
when I was with Hannah?</i>

710
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:42,191
<i>Harry was a good teacher to me
because he was normal, human.</i>

711
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,877
<i>But can anything good come
from putting two killers together...</i>

712
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:52,633
<i>...whether it be student and teacher
or whatever Hannah and I have?</i>

713
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,712
<i>Or will it always end the same way...</i>

714
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,912
<i>...like this?</i>
