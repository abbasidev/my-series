1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,760
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,072
If I do happen to find her,
you'll get your reward money.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,680
Ah, shit.
Who's that?

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,876
Federal marshal.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,197
Dexter Morgan, what the hell
are you doing here?

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,476
Arlene's a friend.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,030
We met through Hannah.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,034
It's not safe for you
to go back to the hotel.
You need something private.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,395
What the fuck?

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,029
It's only for a couple of nights.
Couple of nights? That's it.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,634
Sorry I'm not Deb.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,992
She's always accusing me
of comparing you to her.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,196
Welcome back
to Homicide, detective.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,273
I just need some time
to think about it.

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,755
Take all the time you need.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,957
There's no life for me here
in Florida.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,510
I can have a life somewhere else
far away from here--

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,990
In Argentina.
Maybe we all can.

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,040
Yes. Me, you, and Harrison
are gonna move to Argentina.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,393
Zach's killer is related to you.
The Brain Surgeon is related to you.

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,517
I had two sons,
Daniel and Richard.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,798
My older son, Daniel...
He killed Richard.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,957
Then we put Daniel into
a mental health institute.

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,679
That guy Cassie was dating...

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,431
Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,115
Suppose you do find him, Dexter.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,270
What are you going to do?

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,558
He's murdered four innocent people,
and he killed Zach Hamilton.

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,359
He's my son.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,920
He got away.
That's why I'm here, to warn you.

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,914
I think it best, from here on out,
that I handle this myself.

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,118
<i>Vogel is on her own, and so am I.</i>

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,472
<i>I'll kill Saxon
and leave Miami forever.</i>

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,316
So now do you believe me?

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,034
Yes.

36
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,040
Feels good to cook
for you again.

37
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,752
It reminds me of what
it was like to be your mother.

38
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,320
You think fixing breakfast
makes you my mother again?

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,878
No.
You gave up that privilege

40
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,235
a long time ago.

41
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,113
Daniel, whatever mistakes
I've made in the past,

42
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,795
I want to make it up to you.

43
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,236
I can help you.
Help me how?

44
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,915
I can arrange
for the care you need.

45
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,151
The care I need?

46
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,112
I will never be locked up again.

47
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,158
I have contacts
at the best facilities.

48
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,795
Like the last one
you sent me to?

49
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,475
Do you know what
that was like?

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,838
Day after day wondering
when you'd finally come to visit,

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,912
only to realise
that the answer was never.

52
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,631
Daniel, I couldn't.

53
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,589
You'd killed Richard.

54
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,514
That was your fault.

55
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,631
You ignored me.

56
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,030
All you ever cared about
was Richard.

57
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,839
You never tried to help me.

58
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,276
I was young, inexperienced.

59
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,597
I didn't know how to help you.

60
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,276
But you sure as hell knew
how to help Dexter Morgan.

61
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,314
You taught him how to deal
with his condition.

62
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,712
You gave him everything
you denied me.

63
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,590
While I was rotting away,
you gave him a life.

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,116
I know that. I do.

65
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,555
It was a horrible mistake.

66
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,992
I was your son.

67
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,309
I needed you.

68
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,037
Please...
Please what?

69
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,034
Let me help you.

70
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,351
I'm sorry for everything I've done.

71
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,319
I truly, truly am.

72
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,396
I wish I could believe you.

73
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,710
Hannah.

74
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,837
Hey, Harrison.

75
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,600
Oh, I missed you. Aw.

76
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,434
Hey, soon you'll be able to spend
all the time you want with her,

77
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,274
but right now, Hannah and I need
to have a grown-up talk.

78
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,671
Okay, bud?
Okay.

79
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,194
So...

80
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,317
some potentially good news.
Yeah?

81
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,432
Deputy Marshal Clayton
stopped by my place.

82
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,559
It seems like he's backing off
on his search for you.

83
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,359
Oh, that's a huge relief.

84
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,116
Even so, he managed to get
your face all over the news.
You still need to lay low.

85
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,236
So how am I gonna
get out of Miami?

86
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,273
Well, no one's looking for a woman
travelling with her husband and child.

87
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,195
I'm thinking the three of us
could leave together.

88
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,760
I like the sound of that.

89
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,110
There's still so much to do.

90
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,036
I've gotta tell Batista I'm leaving,
get Harrison out of school,

91
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,271
see Astor and Cody
one last time.

92
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,877
I need to list my condo,
sell my boat, my car.

93
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,876
Deb can help out
with all that stuff.

94
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,509
Wow. Heh, heh.

95
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,034
We're really gonna do it.

96
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,550
Yeah.
We're moving to Argentina.

97
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,794
God, that was always
such a fantasy,

98
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,316
I never thought that
it would actually happen.

99
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,234
Otherwise I would have
learned Spanish.

100
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,754
We'll learn together.

101
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,151
We'll be leaving soon.

102
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,198
I have to kill Saxon first.

103
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,232
Oh, so you are gonna
go through with it.

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,476
I have to.

105
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,154
Vogel's not thinking clearly.

106
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,471
She doesn't seem to realise
she's in danger.

107
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,319
I feel like I need to protect her.

108
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,358
You feel like you need to?

109
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,079
Yeah.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,037
What?
Oh, it's just...

111
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,351
when it comes to you
and killing,

112
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,830
feelings never enter
the equation.

113
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,469
She needs me to protect her.

114
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,675
Hey!
Stay off Aunt Deb's treadmill.

115
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,194
But it's fun.

116
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,158
No, it's not for kids.
Hey, come here.

117
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,551
I wanna hear about
what you've been doing
for the last eight months.

118
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,710
Okay.

119
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,029
Hi, Aunt Deb.
Hi.

120
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,320
Come on.

121
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,274
Can we talk?

122
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,920
What the hell is Harrison
doing with Hannah?

123
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,197
Deputy marshal
pulled off the detail.

124
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,596
It's not safe for Harrison
to be at the apartment

125
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,160
as long as Saxon's
still out there.

126
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,070
Okay, then I'll watch him,
but he shouldn't be with her.
That's not fucking fair to him.

127
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,430
I have to tell you something.

128
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,470
What?

129
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,109
Harrison and I are leaving soon.

130
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,876
What do you mean,
you're leaving?

131
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,675
You're leaving where?
Leaving Miami

132
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,360
with Hannah.

133
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,560
What are you talking about?
We're moving to Argentina.

134
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,477
Are you kidding?

135
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,879
You know how stupid
that sounds?

136
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,475
Deb--
You're gonna take your fucking son,

137
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,637
move to another country
with a wanted fugitive?

138
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,553
Have you fucking
thought this through?

139
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,712
Deb, I have.

140
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,193
We wanna have
a life together.

141
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,631
I wish there was a different way,
but there's not.

142
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,872
We need to leave the country
and start someplace new.

143
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,391
You act like this
doesn't even affect me.

144
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,391
I know it does.

145
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,118
Well, then, that's a really
selfish decision on your part.

146
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,600
We'll still see each other.

147
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,438
I'll come up here,
and you can visit.

148
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,951
Okay, I'll look you up
the next time I'm in Argentina.

149
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,839
Deb, I'm sorry.

150
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,794
This is hard for me too.

151
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,669
Hey. How was your day?
Long.

152
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,913
Aww.

153
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,753
Well, I had a really good day.

154
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,631
Not only am I about
to graduate,

155
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,875
but I got a recruitment letter
from Greenwood Academy.

156
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,595
A therapist position.
What's Greenwood Academy?

157
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,391
It's a very well respected
special-needs school in Atlanta.
They want to set up an interview.

158
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,631
That's fucking great.
When you going?

159
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,956
I'm not.

160
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,480
What do you mean? Why not?

161
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,430
Joey, I'm not moving
to Atlanta when you're here.

162
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,915
I'll find something in Miami.

163
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,630
I'm just so flattered
that they're interested.

164
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,395
Jamie, I would feel like shit

165
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,314
if I was the cause of you
missing out on a great opportunity.

166
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,796
You shouldn't.
This is my decision.

167
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,918
All I'm saying is, you know,
you should do what's best
for your career.

168
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,478
What about us?

169
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,430
Don't worry about us,
you know?

170
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,671
We'll make it work.

171
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,234
Be right back.
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

172
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,509
Evelyn.
Tom.

173
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,796
Please.

174
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,710
Everything okay?

175
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,792
Yes, fine.

176
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,633
A little over-worked, so...

177
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,110
Mm. Thanks for coming in
this morning.

178
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,040
As I said, it's kind
of a sensitive matter.

179
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,197
It's about one of your patients.

180
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,476
Zach Hamilton.

181
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,359
As I'm sure you're aware,
he's gone missing.

182
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,160
Yes. I was hoping he'd turned up by now.
He hasn't.

183
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,439
And I promised his parents
that I would look into it personally.

184
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
But I'm afraid I've hit a dead end.

185
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,720
Tom, you know that I'm not at liberty
to discuss my patients.

186
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,758
Come on, Evelyn,

187
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,957
I'm trying to help this kid.

188
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,077
Now, he lived at home.
How was his relationship
with his parents?

189
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,720
Like anyone his age.

190
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,951
Did he say anything
about trying to get away?

191
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,635
He talk about any friends,
maybe a special girl?

192
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,111
Was he into drugs? Gambling?

193
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,516
Was he suicidal?
I don't know.

194
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,593
Look, I know you understand
better than anyone

195
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,035
what it's like to lose a child.

196
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,430
Not knowing is even worse.

197
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,751
Imagine how the Hamiltons
must feel.

198
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,433
I wish I could help,
but I just don't know any more.

199
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,153
I'm sorry, but I have
another appointment.

200
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,039
<i>Saxon killed his brother
when he was only 14.</i>

201
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,591
<i>Killed seven more in the fire
when he was 17.</i>

202
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,035
<i>How many more since then?</i>

203
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,473
<i>He's lived in a dozen cities
across two continents.</i>

204
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,192
<i>Never been arrested.
Never leaves a trace.</i>

205
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,150
<i>Is he the perfect psychopath
I once was?</i>

206
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,230
Dr. Vogel.
Dexter.

207
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,676
Can we talk?

208
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,673
What are you doing here?

209
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,833
Tom wanted to question me
about Zach.

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,593
Well, of course,
I couldn't tell him anything.

211
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,160
But I feel horrid

212
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,277
keeping Zach's death
from the Hamiltons.

213
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,870
And we both know
that Zach's killer is still out there.

214
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,800
Understand, Evelyn,
you are in danger.

215
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,318
Well, you don't have to worry.

216
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,314
My son isn't gonna harm me.

217
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,274
How do you know that?
I just do.

218
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,476
Have you been
in contact with him?

219
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,670
I saw him.

220
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,790
When?

221
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,474
We had breakfast yesterday.

222
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,630
Where is he now?

223
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,440
I have no idea.

224
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,275
Evelyn...
It's the truth.

225
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,114
He-- He was angry and
he stormed out of the house.

226
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,716
I don't know whether
I'll ever see him again.

227
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,910
Why didn't you tell me?

228
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,034
Because you want
to kill him.

229
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,880
And I don't want that
to happen.

230
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,950
I can't turn my back
on him again.

231
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,277
What is there
you can do for him?

232
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,398
Well...

233
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,672
First, I can establish trust.

234
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,918
I wasn't a good mother to him
when he was a child.

235
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,673
I need to win him over.

236
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,073
And then...

237
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,994
Well, eventually, hopefully,

238
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,874
I'll get him back into a facility.

239
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,120
And how many more
innocent people will he kill

240
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,192
before you do that,
before he kills you?

241
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,438
If you won't protect yourself,
I need to do it.

242
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,958
I don't want you
to protect me, Dexter.

243
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,554
I don't want you to be a hero.

244
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,074
Evelyn, I have to--
Please.

245
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,233
Don't use me as an excuse
for killing Daniel.

246
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,437
She doesn't want my help.

247
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,952
So do I just walk away from this?

248
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,918
We could leave
for Argentina tonight.

249
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,958
Dexter, you don't want
to leave this unfinished.

250
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,793
I don't even know
how to find him.

251
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,952
You always find a way.

252
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,751
If you don't kill Saxon,
her life is at risk.

253
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,156
Crime scene.

254
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,230
You can send it back,
you know.

255
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,436
It's not the salad.

256
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,674
So you asked me here
to watch me eat?

257
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,114
You can't tell
anybody this, okay?

258
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,910
Dexter is leaving Miami.

259
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,719
Why? He's quitting?

260
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,315
He and Harrison are gonna take
the rest of the year and travel.

261
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,912
Fucking A. Good for him. Or not.

262
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,551
I don't know if he's ever
coming back, you know.

263
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,598
I mean, I get wanting
a change, but--

264
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,549
Sometimes, you know,
when things don't feel right,

265
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,519
changing it up is better
for everyone involved.

266
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,240
It's not better for me.

267
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,073
He's my brother.
I don't want him to leave.

268
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,280
I understand, but maybe
you should think about
what's best for him.

269
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,714
Look, when I left New York,

270
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,354
it was one of the toughest things
I ever did,

271
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,477
leaving my friends and family.

272
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,911
But as it turns out,
finally being on my own

273
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,719
was the best thing
I ever did for myself.

274
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,633
Batista gave me
my badge back.

275
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,200
Fucking A, that's great.

276
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,310
Or not.

277
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,670
It's good. It's good.

278
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,231
I've wanted to come back
for a long time, so...

279
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,598
You tell Elway?
Not yet.

280
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,400
You know what this means, right?

281
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,517
You and me, side by side.

282
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,191
Just like old times.

283
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,280
Seriously?
Yeah.

284
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,716
It's a crime scene.
Gotta go.

285
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,950
No, I got it, I got it.

286
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,909
Okay.
Next one's on me, partner.

287
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,596
<i>Nothing will change after I'm gone.</i>

288
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,797
<i>Blood will continue to pool.</i>

289
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,520
<i>I just won't be here to photograph it.</i>

290
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,876
The guy was hit
pretty hard.

291
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,152
Major head wounds,
lots of broken bones,

292
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,470
internal injuries.

293
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,676
Road rage.

294
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,678
The guy on the bike wouldn't
get out of the way,

295
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,873
gave him the finger,
so the driver ran him over.

296
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,838
Lieutenant, can I get a word?
Sure.

297
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,230
Hey, Dex.

298
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,150
I didn't know I had to work today.
Why would you think that?

299
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,832
Because it's Saturday.

300
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,156
Are you high?

301
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,397
You're high, aren't you?
I can smell it on you.

302
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,760
Go home.
Dad...

303
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,799
We'll talk about this later. Go.
And stop smoking pot.

304
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,192
You have every right
to tell me what to do at work,

305
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,716
but you have no right
to tell me what to do at home.

306
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,031
Well, that's--
That's a huge shock, Dexter.

307
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,874
I know it seems like
it's out of the blue,

308
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,157
but after Rita's death...

309
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,720
and with the job,

310
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,159
I've just had enough death
in my life for a while.

311
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,997
I need a break, so...
This is my notice.

312
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,479
You need this, don't you?

313
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,031
I wish you nothing but the best.
Thank you.

314
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,357
I'd like to keep this between us.

315
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,878
I'd like to let other people
know myself, Jamie included.

316
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,553
She's gonna take it hard.
You know, she really loves Harrison.

317
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,916
He loves her too.

318
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,000
Anyway,
she's moving on herself.

319
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,674
New job soon.

320
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,479
Maybe this'll make it easier.

321
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,275
I'll miss you, bro.

322
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,915
Hey, listen, and...
If you change your mind,

323
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,072
you always have a home here.

324
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,800
Got it.
Okay.

325
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,235
He said, "I'm too big for a nap,"
and then he went right to sleep.

326
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,156
Heh. Cute.

327
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,874
So are you any closer
in your search for Saxon?

328
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,233
Not really.

329
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,436
I don't know much
about him.

330
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,512
He moves around a lot.

331
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,916
I guess he figures if you stay
in one place too long...

332
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,959
Eventually you get caught.

333
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,231
I wish we could just leave.

334
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,957
Yeah, me too, but I know that
you have to protect Dr. Vogel.

335
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,716
Actually,
she doesn't want me to.

336
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,758
Then why are you doing this?

337
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,677
Because it's what I do.

338
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,958
It's who I am. It's all I know.

339
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,713
Dexter, you're more than that.

340
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,433
Am I?

341
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,876
You think that when
we move to Argentina...

342
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,796
that it's possible for you and me
to have a fresh start?

343
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,714
Yes.

344
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,678
Well, then, the sooner
you kill Saxon,

345
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,355
the sooner
we can get there.

346
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,751
Vogel is the key.
I'm sure he'll go for her.

347
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,515
But I can't just sit
and watch her.

348
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,752
Especially if she figures out
that you're watching her.

349
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,640
That can make things worse.

350
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,157
I need to find him,
but maybe I don't need Vogel.

351
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,471
Just her computer.

352
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,715
I want you to see something.
Get in.

353
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,076
I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom.

354
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,318
Trust me,
if I wanted you dead,

355
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,880
I wouldn't be holding
this door.

356
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,350
Do you recognise this
from the video I sent you?

357
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,238
This is where you kill
your victims.

358
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,400
Why did you bring me here?

359
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,040
To help you understand.

360
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,319
Have a seat.

361
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,232
Don't worry,
I wiped it down after every, uh--

362
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,514
Well...

363
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,353
This room is more than
what you think it is.

364
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,039
It's a reminder.

365
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,673
Of what?

366
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,192
Where you sent me.

367
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,393
I've made it look exactly
like what they called
our treatment room.

368
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,191
When I would refuse
to take my meds,

369
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,513
the doctors would strap me
down into a chair like this...

370
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,600
and they would force
the meds down.

371
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,399
And that was usually
the highlight of my day.

372
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,791
You can see why
I caused that fire.

373
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,800
I can see why
you would do anything

374
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,834
to get out
of a place like this.

375
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,471
You said before
that you wanted to help me.

376
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,554
Yes. I'd like that.

377
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,595
Most facilities aren't
like this, Daniel.

378
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,434
I could put you someplace where

379
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,678
you'd be very comfortable.
I could see you every day.

380
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,877
I want you to help me
like you helped Dexter.

381
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,519
I want you to show me how
to exist free in the world

382
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,080
just the way I am.

383
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,714
As a killer?

384
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,757
Daniel, I can't help you
to murder innocent people.

385
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,555
If you care about me
the way you say you do,

386
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,000
you'll figure out a way
to make this work.

387
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,557
I want to be someone
you can love.

388
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,835
I'm asking you,
as your son...

389
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,355
please help me.

390
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,836
All right, I'll find a way.

391
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,799
What about Dexter?
He's still after me.

392
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,076
I'll talk to Dexter.

393
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,591
Don't make the same mistake
you made with Richard.

394
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,873
Choose right this time.

395
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,394
Choose me.

396
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,274
I'll get Dexter to understand.

397
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,840
Do you think
that's possible?

398
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,957
I'll make it possible.

399
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,600
I want this, Daniel.

400
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,350
I want to be
your mother again.

401
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,834
I'll do whatever it takes.

402
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,837
Vogel told me where
she keeps a spare key

403
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,400
in case of an emergency.

404
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,156
I think protecting her from
her deranged son qualifies.

405
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,474
Saxon installed spyware
on her computer.

406
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,232
Thing is, that can go both ways.

407
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,512
So if Saxon can see
Vogel's computer...

408
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,596
Then I can see Saxon's.

409
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,869
So, what are you looking for?

410
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,670
Something, anything
that can give me an edge.

411
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,599
What's this?

412
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,869
That's the video he sent to Vogel.

413
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,712
And this one's from last week.

414
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,998
<i>No, don't!</i>
Zach.

415
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,640
<i>No, no!
What are you doing? No!</i>

416
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,599
<i>No! No!</i>

417
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,795
Dexter, if something happens
to Evelyn, it will haunt you forever.

418
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,074
You can't just run off to Argentina
and escape who you are.

419
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,072
I'm not trying to escape anything.

420
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,399
So you'll post a job listing
next week?

421
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,315
Great. Listen, I just don't
need any forensic tech.

422
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,200
Hey, I need the best out there.
He's filling some big shoes.

423
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,033
I appreciate it.

424
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,840
Sorry, deputy.
How can I help you?

425
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,391
Just came by to let you know
none of our leads
on Hannah McKay panned out.

426
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,792
You know, when the trail
goes cold at this point,
the subject either was never here,

427
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,874
or skipped town pretty fast.

428
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,794
So, what does that mean?
It means the case is back to low priority.

429
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,519
Okay.
Thanks for the heads up.

430
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,512
Uh-- I couldn't help overhearing.

431
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,831
You said you're looking
for a new forensic tech.

432
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,350
You know someone?
No, I'm just curious--

433
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,273
Who's leaving?
It's not Dexter Morgan, is it?

434
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,272
Close the door.

435
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,190
He hasn't told any of his friends yet,

436
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,239
so this is on the QT,
but, yes, Dexter's moving on.

437
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,073
He got a better job, huh?

438
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,311
No, he's going to travel,
spend time with his son.

439
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,830
Really?
Yeah. I can't say I blame him.

440
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,313
Hey, babe.
How was your day?

441
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,439
It was okay. You working?

442
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,956
Yeah, I'm just
sending out résumés.

443
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,038
I'm almost done though.

444
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,600
Hey, um, can we talk
for a sec?

445
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,239
Okay.

446
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,756
I feel like an asshole,
but I gotta be honest with you.

447
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,150
Okay, so be honest.

448
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,353
It's not working out
between us, is it?

449
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,398
Is that a question?
No.

450
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,632
It's-- I'm sorry.

451
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,198
Then why did you
let me move in here?

452
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,272
I mean, why wait
until now, Joey?

453
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,955
I hoped it would
make things better.

454
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,795
I don't know what else to say.

455
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,357
Ugh, I am so stupid to think
you would ever get over Deb.

456
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,591
It's got nothing to do with Deb.

457
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,513
I thought you wanted
to be honest with me.

458
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,951
I am. This is on me.

459
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,834
She's got nothing
to do with it.

460
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,560
Joey, see, that is
what hurts the most.

461
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,235
That you just keep lying about it.

462
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,634
I'm not lying, Jamie.

463
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,314
Okay, you know what?
Don't worry.

464
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,075
I'm gonna move my stuff
out of here as soon as I can,

465
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,078
so you're free to not go back to Deb.

466
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,150
Jamie--

467
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,879
Bye.

468
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,631
Just give me a sec.

469
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,476
Hey.

470
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,479
I don't want to intrude.
Well, it's your house.

471
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,959
It's your family.

472
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,792
It's your family too.

473
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,237
I want you and Harrison
to be happy.

474
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,957
So how do you feel
about us leaving?

475
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,560
Scared.

476
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,630
My whole family's moving.

477
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,433
Scared?

478
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,032
You've always been there.

479
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,356
I don't know what my life
looks like without you.

480
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,951
Well, maybe it looks better.

481
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,713
Really?

482
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,711
Hanging out
with two serial killers,
does it get better than that?

483
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,473
So you see my point.

484
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,199
I don't know.

485
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,277
Better or worse...

486
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,553
you've always been there.

487
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,232
Moving on without you
feels like jumping off a cliff.

488
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,517
I know what you mean.

489
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,280
Come on.

490
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,276
Will you?

491
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,592
Hey, look who's here.

492
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,157
Hi.
<i>Hi. Just checking in.</i>

493
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,310
All is well here.

494
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,392
Harrison's playing outside
with Deb.

495
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,116
Oh, good.
<i>You doing okay?</i>

496
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,239
Yeah, I just wanted to hear your voice.

497
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,674
I have to go.

498
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,400
Evelyn.
Dexter.

499
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,199
I was hoping
we could talk.

500
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,194
Okay.

501
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,158
I've been rethinking
what I said earlier,

502
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,597
and I fear I was being
too judgemental.

503
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,838
I think it's possible
that you and Hannah
could have a relationship.

504
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,437
Really?
And I think moving far away,

505
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,678
beginning anew might be
the best thing for you.

506
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,356
Moving far away?
Is that the important part?

507
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,520
You mentioned Argentina?
That could be a good place.

508
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,080
Why do you want me to leave?

509
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,359
Dexter, I think
there's hope for Daniel.

510
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,955
I don't think he likes killing.

511
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,753
I could help him,

512
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,480
but I'm not gonna get
that chance if you kill him.

513
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,553
So just leave, please.
Leave Miami.

514
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,315
You don't think he likes killing?
He says he wants my help.

515
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,676
Let me show you how much
he doesn't like killing.

516
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,749
<i>No, don't! No!</i>

517
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,954
No.

518
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,951
That's Zach's head
he's sawing into.

519
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,474
There's no hope for him, Evelyn.

520
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,033
This is the same person
who killed your younger son.

521
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,799
He will never change.

522
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,475
Don't.
I'm sorry.

523
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,079
So, what now?

524
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,598
You know what needs to happen.

525
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,920
Otherwise, he'll go on killing.

526
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,389
Where is he now?

527
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,712
He said he would call me tonight.

528
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,793
Set up a meeting with him tonight.

529
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,317
Someplace public, safe.

530
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,949
Call me and let me know where.

531
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,119
I'll follow him and take it from there.

532
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,473
Just please don't let him suffer.

533
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,000
I won't.

534
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,917
Debra Morgan.

535
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,758
Do I know you?
Deputy U.S. Marshal Max Clayton.

536
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,990
And this is Harrison.

537
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,960
Hey, buddy.
Hi.

538
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,597
You guys have met?
Over at his dad's, yeah.

539
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,797
Harrison,
why don't you go inside?

540
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,719
I'll be there in a minute.

541
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,400
Okay.

542
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,799
Elway gave me your address.
I thought it better we talk in person.

543
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,310
Okay.

544
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,591
Look, I'm worried about your brother.
Dexter? Why?

545
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,711
It's probably nothing,
but it just struck me as odd

546
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,634
that he's leaving town
at the exact time

547
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,951
Hannah McKay is
rumoured to be here.

548
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,397
How do you know he's leaving?
Uh, overheard at the station.

549
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,871
Maybe it's nothing, but

550
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,272
are he and Arlene Shram
a couple?

551
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,352
I don't know. I don't keep up
with his dating life.

552
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,877
Okay, it's just I know
he used to have a relationship
with Hannah McKay.

553
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,398
What if he still does?

554
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,517
Then he's a fucking idiot.
That's what I'm afraid of.

555
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,399
Look, I know I'm going out
on a limb here,

556
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,395
but what if these two
somehow reconnected?

557
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,914
I mean,
his life could be at risk.

558
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,912
His son's too.
Dexter wouldn't do that.

559
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,673
I hope not.

560
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,355
I don't need to tell you
what a dangerous person
Hannah McKay is.

561
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,280
You know more about her than I do.
If Dexter were dating Hannah McKay,

562
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,630
I would fucking know about it.

563
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,280
Maybe he'd keep it from you.
Who knows?

564
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,870
I mean, men do stupid things
for beautiful women.

565
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,997
Logic just flies out the window.

566
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,677
Well, I appreciate your concern,
but that's not what's happening here.

567
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,672
Dexter's burned out,
that's why he's leaving.

568
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,638
Okay. Thank you.

569
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,474
I respect your opinion.
Here's my card.

570
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,997
You call me if you think of anything.
Okay, I will do.

571
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,117
Hey. You guys hungry?

572
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,270
Yea h!

573
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,671
Hey, go clean up, Harrison.

574
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,950
Is everything okay?

575
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,194
Not really.

576
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,800
Something happen?

577
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,599
Deputy Marshal Clayton happened.

578
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,717
He was just questioning me
on the beach.

579
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,395
I thought that Dexter said
that Clayton was backing off.

580
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,155
Somehow he found out
that Dexter's leaving,
and it tweaked him.

581
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,232
He thinks Dexter's helping you hide.

582
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,357
Oh, God.
I covered for both of you,

583
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,352
but you have got
to stay hidden until you leave.

584
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,477
Of course. Yes.

585
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,074
Oh...

586
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,871
Thank you for protecting me,
again.

587
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,636
Who knew I'd be so good at it?

588
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,880
We'll all be out of here soon.
I know.

589
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,032
I have lunch.

590
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,350
No, thanks.

591
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,512
I have someplace I need to be.

592
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,431
Hey.
Hey.

593
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,831
Can we talk?
Nothing to talk about.

594
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,759
I know why you're here.
I'll have your last cheque drawn.

595
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,872
I was gonna give you two weeks.
Don't want your two weeks.

596
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,316
I still have friends in Miami Metro,
they said you were going back.

597
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,960
Well, shouldn't we talk
about this?

598
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,112
I went out of my way
to make this work.

599
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,839
I put up with your bullshit.

600
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,912
The more I gave,
the more you pushed back.

601
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,231
It's quite clear to me that it
was never gonna work out.

602
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,558
Well, I'm sorry.

603
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,234
I really appreciate the job

604
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,920
and everything
that you've done for me.

605
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,400
Don't mention it.

606
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,398
Let's just, uh...

607
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,953
Okay.

608
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,554
I'm gonna go pack up
my office.

609
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,519
I'll have security do that.
They'll deliver it to your house.

610
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,797
And all the case files
are mine, of course.

611
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,320
Including those
on Hannah McKay.

612
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,393
Good luck to you.
Yeah, you too.

613
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,118
Harrison, remember
what your dad said. That's not a toy.

614
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,999
But Aunt Deb does it
all the time.

615
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,599
Harrison, please listen.

616
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,759
I am.

617
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,273
Ow!

618
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,190
Harrison!

619
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,313
Ow! Ow! Ow!
I know. It's gonna be okay.

620
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,474
Ow.
I know it hurts.

621
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,280
I know it hurts.
It's gonna be okay.

622
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,511
Okay.
Ow.

623
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,633
Here, hold that.
Ouch.

624
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,837
Ow.

625
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,080
<i>Dexter Morgan.</i>

626
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,515
Dexter, call me.

627
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,870
We're gonna have to
take you somewhere
and get you patched up.

628
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,998
What happened?
He fell and hit his chin.

629
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,032
It's a pretty deep cut.
It won't stop bleeding.

630
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,998
I'll let the doctor know.
Are you the mother?

631
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,999
Are you the mother?
Uh, yes.

632
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,356
I'm just waiting for his father
to call me back.

633
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,715
Fill this out.
Okay.

634
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,274
And wait for us
to call his name.

635
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,999
Okay. Thank you.

636
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,112
Harrison,
you're being so brave.

637
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,715
I can't wait to tell your dad.

638
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,680
Harrison Morgan?

639
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,919
Uh, yeah.

640
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,434
Here.

641
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,956
Been a while
since we've been here.

642
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,431
Choir director.
Long time ago.

643
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,230
Saxon's first victim.

644
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,189
And his last victims.

645
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,313
It's also been a while since
you've used victims' pictures.

646
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,791
He needs to see
what he's done.

647
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,919
That was always
very important to you.

648
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,993
People get
what they deserve.

649
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,832
At least they should.

650
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,280
Huh. I've come a long way.

651
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,434
It feels like I'm a different person
from the last time I was in this room.

652
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,474
You're still you, Dexter.

653
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,199
I hope you realise that.

654
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,000
Why wouldn't I?

655
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,153
I just don't want you to have
any unrealistic expectations

656
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,879
about whatever happens next.

657
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,150
I know exactly what happens next.

658
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,755
I kill Saxon.

659
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,120
And then Hannah and Harrison and I
get on a plane and start our new lives.

660
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,915
Hey, Jamie.
Go fuck yourself.

661
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,397
What?
Debra, come on in.

662
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,920
I'm ready to come back,
if you'll have me.

663
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,196
If I'll have you?

664
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,876
Are you sure about this?
You're not fooling me?

665
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,350
Uh, I don't think so.

666
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,279
Well, in that case, hallelujah.

667
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,036
Can you start today?

668
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,079
I was thinking more like
a week or two.

669
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,596
Of course. Loose ends.

670
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,035
Yeah, something like that.

671
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,355
Mm-hm. Well, whenever
you're ready, I'm ready.

672
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,116
It's funny, though.
What?

673
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,351
You coming back
as Dexter's leaving.

674
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,520
He told you?
Yeah.

675
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,320
And, yeah, don't worry
about Jamie.

676
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,790
What was that?
Oh, you don't know?

677
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,117
Quinn just ended things with her.
Stupid idiot.

678
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,794
He did?
And so you know,

679
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,360
Jamie kind of blames you.

680
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,309
Yeah, I get that.

681
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,870
Yeah, she thinks Quinn
is still in love with you
or something like that.

682
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,236
I didn't want to know
the details.

683
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,669
I'll let you have at him first.

684
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,075
We need to talk.

685
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,434
I just did what--
Not here.

686
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,399
Did you break up with her
because of me?

687
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,029
No. Yes.

688
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,352
I mean, no and yes.
Don't get all mad.

689
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,920
Your face gets red
when you get mad.

690
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,958
No, it doesn't.
What the fuck happened?

691
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,598
It's not complicated.
I wasn't happy.

692
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,510
I mean, I was okay,
but I kind of knew
I was never gonna marry her.

693
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,518
Probably would have
ended it soon anyway,

694
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,632
even if what happened
between you and I didn't happen.

695
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,757
Nothing happened.
We shared a kiss.

696
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,276
That's not a reason to fucking
break up with somebody.

697
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,470
You're not hearing me.

698
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,036
I probably would have
broke up with Jamie,

699
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,078
but what happened
between you and I

700
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,956
just made it clear that
I shouldn't be with her anymore.

701
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,796
Got it?
Yes.

702
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,556
So, yeah, to be completely honest,

703
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,360
I still have feelings for you,

704
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,876
But I don't expect anything from you.

705
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,554
Why not?

706
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,598
Because I didn't think you wanted--

707
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,315
I still have feelings for you,
stupid.

708
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,037
That didn't change, I just--

709
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,475
I wasn't sure
that I saw a future for us.

710
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,830
What about now?

711
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,915
I don't know.
I mean, I used to...

712
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,952
I used to feel like something
was holding me back, but now--

713
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,113
Now I just-- Shh.

714
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,477
Are you sure it was
Hannah McKay
you saw earlier today?

715
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,359
Yeah. I'd seen her picture
on the news.

716
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,671
She brought in her son.
He had a cut on his chin.

717
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,399
Hannah McKay
doesn't have any children.

718
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,234
Are you sure this is her?
Well, I think so.

719
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,390
What was her boy's name?

720
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,911
His name
was Harrison Morgan,

721
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,436
and she sure acted
like he was her own.

722
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,752
I fell on my chin.

723
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,355
Yeah, how many stitches
are holding that chin together?

724
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,234
Six.
Wow. I bet that hurt.

725
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,399
Yeah, but Harrison
was very brave.

726
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,473
I even got a lollipop.
Can I go play now?

727
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,313
Yeah, sure.

728
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,194
Thanks for taking care of him.

729
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,670
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I feel awful.

730
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,311
I can't believe I wasn't here for you.
You went out in public.

731
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,154
You put yourself in jeopardy
because I was setting up a kill room.

732
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,631
Dex, you didn't know.
It doesn't matter.

733
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,356
I'm trying to save Dr. Vogel
when I should be taking care
of you and Harrison.

734
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,639
We're okay, really. It's fine.

735
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,995
But there is one other thing.
What?

736
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,117
That deputy marshal came by.
Here?

737
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,990
He talked to Deb.
I think she put him off, but still,
we can't stay here for much longer.

738
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,396
I know.

739
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,637
Evelyn?
<i>Dexter, he's here.</i>

740
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,280
Here? Where's here?

741
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,319
At my house. He called me.

742
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,960
Said he was a couple
of blocks away.

743
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,474
No, that wasn't the plan.

744
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,633
You were supposed to meet
him someplace in public.
Someplace safe.

745
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,639
It's the last time
I'm ever going to see him.

746
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,399
I wanted a private goodbye.

747
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,870
<i>It's not a good idea.</i>

748
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,637
That's him now.
<i>Evelyn?</i>

749
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,479
What?

750
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,232
I have to go.

751
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,195
Well, be careful.
I will.

752
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,310
Dexter, go.
What if the marshal comes back?

753
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,756
He's not coming back.
It's Evelyn who needs you right now.

754
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,798
I should stay here with Hannah.

755
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,798
This is exactly
what Vogel warned you about.

756
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,356
You're trying to live
in two different worlds,
and it's got you paralysed.

757
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,160
I'm not paralysed.
I'm making a choice.

758
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,199
Son, you're choosing
to be afraid,

759
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,319
because for the first time
in your life, you think
you've got something to lose.

760
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,870
Is that who you
wanna be?

761
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,194
Oh. That's all right.
I'll do it.

762
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,678
I'm getting old.

763
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,639
My aim isn't as good
as it used to be.

764
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,037
Why'd you want
to see me tonight?

765
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,157
I just thought it would be
nice for us to talk...

766
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,320
about normal things.

767
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,914
Unlike the other couple
of times.

768
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,436
Mm. Of course.

769
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,991
What's wrong?
Wrong?

770
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,879
You seem tense.
No.

771
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,351
No, not at all.
I'm very comfortable.

772
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,551
Maybe a little tired,
under the circumstances.

773
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,840
Is there something
you want to tell me?

774
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,870
I just wanted to see you.

775
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,914
Heh. Guess I'm sounding
like a mother already...

776
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,038
constantly wanting
her son around.

777
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,113
You know...

778
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,395
when you see as many people
die as I have,

779
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,957
you know when they're afraid.

780
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,277
What are you afraid of,
Mother?

781
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,235
<i>He's still here.</i>

782
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,830
<i>Hello, Dexter.</i>
What do you want? Where--

783
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,469
<i>Don't move.
I want to show you something.</i>

784
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,669
Don't touch her.

785
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,594
Mother chose
the wrong son, again.

786
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,552
Evelyn?

787
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,439
Oh, no, no, no.

788
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,114
No...
