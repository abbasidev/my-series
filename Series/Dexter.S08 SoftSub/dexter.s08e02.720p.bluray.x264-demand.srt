00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,914
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,634
How is Deb? She's better?

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,876
Yeah, she's great.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,278
What case is she working on?
Briggs. Andrew Briggs.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,516
Deb, what's going on?

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,360
I'm getting close to Briggs
so I can get the jewellery

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,710
before he fences it.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,759
You haven't talked to me in weeks.
You made me compromise

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,515
everything about myself
that I care about.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,757
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,799
Don't stop. Don't stop.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,356
The chance that someone
might find out our secret

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,960
makes it even more fun.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,040
You're all sweaty.
Yup. Just doing a little cardio.

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,839
Whoa.
Looks like a piece of it

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,198
has been scooped out.
That's the anterior insular cortex,

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,558
the portion of the brain
that processes empathy.

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,878
This is Dr. Evelyn Vogel.
Evelyn is a neuropsychiatrist.

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,551
I hear the FBI calls her
the psychopath whisperer.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,910
What was he like?
Who?

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,389
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,398
I look forward to working with you,
Dexter Morgan.

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,350
Can you look into someone
named El Sapo for me?

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,313
<i>- Who is he?</i>
- He's a fucking fence.

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,239
El Sapo isn't a fence.
He's a hit man.

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,352
He's gonna get the jewels
and kill Briggs.

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,756
I'm trying to keep you from
getting shot along with him.

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,116
Aah!
I came here to save you.

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,835
Deb, look at yourself. You're lost.

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,874
You are lost.

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,478
Dexter. I was hoping
to share something with you.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,670
What is it you want?

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,712
You can't kill me.

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,553
Why?

35
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,998
Because I don't fit Harry's code.

36
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,118
<i>We're recording.</i>

37
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,398
<i>So to review where we are,</i>

38
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,320
<i>two weeks ago, you told me
that your son Dexter</i>

39
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,911
<i>had asked to see the actual scene
of a homicide.</i>

40
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,112
<i>You also said that you opposed
this request.</i>

41
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,630
<i>Yes. Because he's only 10 years old.</i>

42
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,917
<i>So why are you here today?</i>

43
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,351
<i>He kept asking and asking</i>

44
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,035
<i>so I decided to give him
what he wanted.</i>

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,756
<i>I even started to hope it might
shock him out of this...</i>

46
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,759
<i>condition.</i>

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,992
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

48
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,951
<i>I got a call about a homicide
in Coral Gables.</i>

49
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,632
<i>A woman had shot her ex-husband as
he was trying to break into the house.</i>

50
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,991
<i>I waited until the forensic guys
cleared out</i>

51
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,630
<i>and then I snuck Dexter
onto the scene.</i>

52
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,000
<i>The victim had fallen
through a sliding glass door</i>

53
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,714
<i>so there was blood everywhere.</i>

54
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,519
<i>And it didn't seem to faze Dexter.</i>

55
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,160
<i>And he wasn't bothered at all?</i>

56
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,829
<i>If anything, he was fascinated.</i>

57
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,033
<i>He just stood there, staring.</i>

58
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,037
<i>Like he was admiring a painting.</i>

59
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,438
<i>I remember that day.
It was like a painting.</i>

60
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,359
<i>And I wanted to be the artist.</i>

61
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,713
<i>We didn't stay long, and when we were
driving home, I noticed that...</i>

62
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,513
<i>Dexter was holding something
in his hand.</i>

63
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,636
<i>He'd stolen it from the crime scene.</i>

64
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,079
<i>A trophy.</i>

65
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,229
<i>I'm right about Dex, aren't I?</i>

66
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,232
<i>There's something wrong with him.</i>

67
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,234
<i>One could put it that way,
but I do agree</i>

68
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,114
<i>that Dexter is exactly
what you suspect him to be.</i>

69
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,919
<i>Trust me when I say that there's
a place in this world for your son.</i>

70
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,794
<i>I don't know what it is
or what form it will take</i>

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,640
<i>but we're gonna find it together.</i>

72
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,758
You were only 10 years old
when your father first sought my help.

73
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,800
I know almost everything
about you, Dexter.

74
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,429
Not just because I heard it
from your father

75
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,950
but because I helped create you.

76
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,710
Create me?
You sound like Dr. Frankenstein.

77
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,112
Don't mean to.
Don't know how else to put it.

78
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,710
I mean, it was obvious
that you not only showed

79
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,992
all the classic traits
of a psychopath

80
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,352
but that you would eventually
become a killer.

81
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,154
So we were faced with a little dilemma:
what to do with you.

82
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,034
It was me who convinced Harry
that your urges couldn't be stopped

83
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,471
but they could be focused.

84
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,437
Eventually we realised that hunting
animals wasn't going to satiate you

85
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,352
so we decided that you could be
taught to kill other kinds of animals.

86
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,950
People who truly deserve to die.

87
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,755
You're saying you came up
with the code?

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,878
Harry had a big hand in the details.

89
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,552
His law enforcement background
was certainly an asset

90
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,634
but he was operating
under my guidance.

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:02,478
I can't help but think of myself
as your spiritual mother.

92
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,158
I know we've only just met
face to face

93
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,040
but this is kind of like a reunion.
Heh.

94
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,476
I should have chilled
some champagne.

95
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,118
You experimented on me.
That's what mothers do?

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,799
I developed a framework
for your survival.

97
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,679
That's what mothers do.

98
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,916
You made me what I am.
Heh.

99
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,958
You'd have preferred an institution?
Death row?

100
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,437
I could have turned my back on you.
I could have let Harry do the same.

101
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,718
I could have even
notified the authorities.

102
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,990
Why didn't you?

103
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,230
Well, let's just say
you got under my skin.

104
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,193
I came to care for you, Dexter.

105
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,954
I still do.

106
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,031
Why are you telling me this?

107
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,917
I saved your life.

108
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,793
And I'm afraid I need
to call in the favour.

109
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,197
I'm sure you recognise this.

110
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,760
It's a section of the human brain.

111
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,792
Anterior insular cortex.

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,789
A murder victim was missing
the same piece of tissue.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,878
And this is it. In the flesh.

114
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,800
I found it on my doorstep
wrapped in butcher paper.

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,560
Unfortunately,
there was no return address.

116
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,356
Why would the killer send this to you?
A message.

117
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,831
I've come to believe
that the killer could be

118
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,794
one of my former patients.

119
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,120
This would be the perfect
explanation for this little gift.

120
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,996
You think it's a threat.
Hm. A brain on a doorstep.

121
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,471
Hardly a love letter.

122
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,357
Sooner or later,

123
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,071
someone's going to be holding
a piece of my brain in a jar.

124
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,314
I want you to find him, Dexter.

125
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,798
And I want you to do
what Harry and I taught you to do.

126
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,800
I don't take requests.

127
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,754
You have contacts at the FBI.
You're working with Miami Metro.

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,515
Why don't you go to them?
I wish I could.

129
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,791
What's stopping you?

130
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,714
You're not the first psychopath
I've treated.

131
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,077
You taught other people the code?

132
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,431
No. You're special.

133
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,195
But I've used other
unorthodox methods,

134
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,791
some of which might be
considered illegal.

135
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,471
So if the police track down this killer
and it's someone I treated--

136
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,797
Your unorthodox methods
might be exposed

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,878
and your career would be ruined.

138
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,072
You might even go to jail.

139
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,834
You see my problem.

140
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,952
I see that it's your problem.

141
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,917
This will help put things
into perspective.

142
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,559
Don't tell me you're gonna pass up
on another piece of your history.

143
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,880
Think about it,
but don't take too long.

144
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,160
Killer's out there, Dexter,

145
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,320
and I don't mind admitting
I'm afraid of what's coming next.

146
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,555
<i>♪ Make your own kind of music ♪</i>

147
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,555
<i>♪ Sing your own special song ♪</i>

148
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,792
<i>♪ Make your own kind of music ♪♪</i>

149
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,680
You don't deserve this,
but I don't have a choice.

150
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,197
I have to. I'm sorry.

151
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,876
<i>Dexter killed someone else
last night.</i>

152
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,235
<i>Who?</i>

153
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,279
<i>A drug dealer.</i>

154
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,516
<i>Guy robbed and killed two
of his clients. College kids.</i>

155
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,677
<i>At least Dexter is following
the programme.</i>

156
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,430
<i>He told me something new that he did
to the drug dealer before he killed him.</i>

157
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,359
<i>And that was?</i>

158
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,671
<i>He made him look at photos
of his victims.</i>

159
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,073
<i>Interesting.</i>

160
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,600
<i>Did you ask him why?</i>

161
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,638
<i>He said it was something
he felt he needed to do.</i>

162
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,480
<i>What do you think it means?</i>

163
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,396
<i>Humans are born with
an innate sense ofjustice.</i>

164
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,435
<i>Maybe Dexter is discovering this.</i>

165
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,432
<i>The important thing is,
after three kills,</i>

166
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,717
<i>he's embracing the process.</i>

167
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,390
<i>It's gonna work out for him, Harry.</i>

168
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,880
<i>I hope so.</i>

169
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,800
She believed in you
at a time when I was in doubt.

170
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,674
Vogel gave me this DVD to make me
feel as if I owe her something.

171
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,390
Don't you?

172
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,758
If she's responsible for creating me,

173
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,152
she's responsible
for what I've done to Deb.

174
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,310
Maybe Vogel can help you.

175
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,553
Help me how?

176
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,280
With Deb.

177
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,200
You must have told Vogel
a lot about Deb.

178
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,278
She was part of your life.

179
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,034
I wish she still was.

180
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,036
Deb said she hated me,

181
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,358
that she should have killed me
inside that shipping container

182
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,759
instead of LaGuerta. Maybe I should
just listen to you, stay away from her.

183
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,670
All I'm saying is that Vogel
might open up some possibilities.

184
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,156
At the very least, she's a window
to your past that you just can't ignore.

185
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,750
I don't trust Vogel. I can't.

186
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,072
All the more reason
to keep her close.

187
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,477
Okay, just so we're on the same page,
you're supposed to locate Briggs

188
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,440
and take him into custody.
It's that simple, right?

189
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,837
I was also supposed to find
the stolen jewellery, right?

190
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,399
Recover the goods,
collect 20 percent?

191
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,838
Am I supposed to believe that's what
you were doing for two weeks?

192
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,477
Just looking for the jewellery?
Yes, Elway.

193
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,477
He wasn't gonna just give it to me.
It wasn't lying around the apartment.

194
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,319
I had to play him.

195
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,791
What is that shit?
It looks like horse piss.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,037
It's electrolyte replenishment
formula.

197
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,074
You look dehydrated.
It impairs your judgement.

198
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,317
Probably fuelling that bad attitude.

199
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,314
So tell me,

200
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,793
where does it say undercover work
in your job description?

201
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,993
I was improvising.

202
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,078
Well, you put one of my assets
at risk.

203
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,913
Namely yourself.

204
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,274
That's my call.

205
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,551
Well, your asset is just fine.

206
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,911
I wish I could say the same thing
about Briggs.

207
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,436
That again?
I told you I don't know what happened.

208
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,791
I came back to our room
and he was dead.

209
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,554
"Our room"?

210
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,390
So you two were intimate?

211
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,311
First of all, who says "intimate"?

212
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,678
And second, what does it even matter?
What was I supposed to do, say:

213
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,111
"Hey, can I have that jewellery
that you stole

214
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,040
because I'd love to get
the finder's fee on that too"?

215
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,396
I was doing my job.

216
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,434
If you were, we wouldn't be here
with nothing to show for it.

217
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,350
We don't have nothing to show for it.
I found these on Briggs.

218
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,280
This looks like a key
to a storage unit.

219
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,472
I bet that's where
he stashed the jewellery.

220
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,717
Why didn't you tell me that
in the beginning?

221
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,316
Because it's more fun
to watch you eat crow.

222
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,198
Take a bite.
We haven't found the jewellery yet.

223
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,312
You could be wrong.
But what if I'm not?

224
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,480
Then we recover 20 percent.
Right. And you'll love me for that.

225
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,429
<i>Another morning, another body.</i>

226
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,151
<i>Miami makes more corpses
than sunburns.</i>

227
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,272
<i>And I'm thankful.</i>

228
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,557
<i>A crime scene might be
the only place left</i>

229
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,480
<i>where I can still control the chaos.</i>

230
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,876
Fuck me.

231
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,595
What does this guy think,
he's a fucking brain surgeon?

232
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,234
The Brain Surgeon.

233
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,720
Anterior insular cortex is missing,
just like the last one.

234
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,077
So we have a serial?

235
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,872
Vogel was right.

236
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,113
Judging from the lack of blood,

237
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,313
I'd say this one was done
post-mortem too.

238
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,431
No entry wounds.

239
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,797
Ah. Petechial haemorrhaging
around the eyes.

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,798
Bruising around the throat.

241
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,320
Asphyxiation.

242
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,035
So the last time,
the killer left the murder weapon

243
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,714
somewhere near the body.

244
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,272
Maybe he did it again.

245
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,236
So, what are we looking for?
Ropes, nylons, giant pillow.

246
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,318
Okay, everyone spread out.

247
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,632
<i>A plastic bag?</i>

248
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,478
<i>Not the worst way
to asphyxiate someone.</i>

249
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,316
Blood?
I think I've got a murder weapon.

250
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,113
Let's hope he left a print.

251
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,512
I got another delivery today.

252
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,154
Like the other?

253
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,272
Same section of the brain.

254
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,712
If it is one of my patients
who's doing this, I...

255
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,271
I have to wonder
if I could have prevented it.

256
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,675
You never felt guilty
about what I was doing?

257
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,874
No.

258
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,836
All I ever felt was pride.

259
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,954
Pride?
Mm.

260
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,957
You're not evil, Dexter.

261
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,314
You're actually making
the world a better place.

262
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,634
Not for everyone.

263
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,118
What do you mean by that?

264
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,119
I'm going back to the lab.

265
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,712
We might have a print,
which gives us a head start.

266
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,520
So you're going to help me.

267
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,956
You don't seem surprised.

268
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,555
Like I said,
even though I've just met you,

269
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,717
I know you, Dexter.

270
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,671
Better even than I knew Harry.

271
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,632
Why did he come to you

272
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,718
about me?

273
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,072
I was an expert witness
on a series of homicides

274
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,471
that he was working on,

275
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,000
and we became friends.

276
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,239
It's a long way from being friends

277
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,716
to "I think my son
might be a serial killer."

278
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,275
Harry was aware of my work
on young psychopaths.

279
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,917
And he also knew
that I didn't approach the subject

280
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,999
in terms of black and white,

281
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,155
unlike my colleagues at the time.

282
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,955
And so he just told you everything.

283
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,271
You have to understand
that he had no one else to talk to.

284
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,353
Not Doris.
Certainly no one in the force.

285
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,477
And there never was
any judgement on my part.

286
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,676
Unlike you towards me.

287
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,158
I'm not judging you.

288
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,158
But you don't trust me.

289
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,837
Which you should have expected.

290
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,157
Since you know me so well.

291
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,113
You nervous?

292
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,990
About breaking and entering?
Absolutely.

293
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,237
Prison would put a real crimp
in my business model.

294
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,957
See, we're not breaking.

295
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,913
We're just entering.

296
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,072
You really had sex with this guy?

297
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,639
Shit.

298
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,478
What? What is it?

299
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,720
If...

300
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,431
If I hadn't stayed
to try to get the jewellery,

301
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,553
if I just brought him in,
he'd still be alive.

302
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,479
Don't beat yourself up about it.

303
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,752
After all, it's a criminal
we're talking about, right?

304
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,197
He was actually all right
to hang out with.

305
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,711
He made me forget about
my shitty life for five minutes.

306
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,511
And what exactly is so shitty
about your life?

307
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,070
Other than working for you?
Excuse me.

308
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,795
You left Miami Metro
to come and work for me.

309
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,277
Wise career choice, I might add.

310
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,399
If you accepted more cases,
you may get paid what you're worth.

311
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,592
I left Miami Metro
because I was burned out.

312
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,549
Oh. Right.
Look, I know that's a party line.

313
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,150
Everybody knows Maria LaGuerta
was a pain in the ass.

314
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,073
I understand if you wanted
to dip your toes--

315
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,590
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

316
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,910
LaGuerta was a good cop.
She was a good fucking person.

317
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,719
Well, note to self: Never talk about
anyone Debra Morgan knows.

318
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,110
Understood. Got it.

319
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,993
Why don't you just be really grateful
that I work for you?

320
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,795
Because I'm about to make you
a fuck-ton of money.

321
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,349
It's an unopened bill
from a storage facility.

322
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,514
Why didn't F.L.P.D. find this?
Because it just arrived today.

323
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,552
Found a match for our key.

324
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,035
Okay. Buster's Self Storage.

325
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,072
All right.
Let's go.

326
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,710
I can't. I've got a new client
meeting at the office.

327
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,230
All right, then I'll go alone.
Sh...

328
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,554
Okay. Could you hang on?
Just-- Hey.

329
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,474
Hey.

330
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,193
Hey.

331
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,911
Just do me a favour, all right?

332
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,793
Just be careful.

333
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,671
If I fuck up, you can always ply me
with that electro-shite solution.

334
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,717
I'm running the prints from the plastic
bag through AFIS right now.

335
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,956
Any hits?

336
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,669
Not yet, but if the killer's
on the list you gave me,

337
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,396
there's a good chance he's already
in the system. It shouldn't take long.

338
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,152
Why don't I remember you?

339
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,117
According to you, I was 10
when you started seeing Harry.

340
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,118
I should remember you.

341
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,040
You never met me in person.

342
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,751
Harry forbid it.
Why?

343
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,714
He didn't want you to feel
like you were--

344
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,355
Like you were sick.
He was trying to protect you.

345
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,674
And I respected his wishes,
even after he died.

346
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,960
I could have used someone
to talk to after Harry was gone.

347
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,072
Someone who knew
what I was going through.

348
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,516
You wanted to talk about it?

349
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,750
I was young and I was all alone.

350
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,959
Here it is.

351
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,073
Lyle Sussman?
Sussman?

352
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,240
He wasn't on the list I gave you.
I don't know anyone with that name.

353
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,193
That doesn't mean
he doesn't know you.

354
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,357
You're a published author.

355
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,633
But why would he be targeting me?

356
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,675
Maybe he has an issue with something
you said in one of your books.

357
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,038
Arrested for drunk and disorderly
in 1992.

358
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,200
Single. Has a house on Messina.

359
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,994
Doesn't make sense.

360
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,675
Well, Sussman's print's
on the murder weapon.

361
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,270
Forensics don't lie.

362
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,873
Mm. Look on the bright side.

363
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,796
Maybe this means you did a better job
with your patients than you thought.

364
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,480
Oh. Heh.

365
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,474
Two great minds
at work here. Heh, heh.

366
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,194
Am I interrupting?

367
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,550
No. What's up, Vince?

368
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,275
Well, guess who found
a bloody fingerprint

369
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,120
on the duct tape that was
covering the victim's mouth.

370
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,390
You?

371
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,552
And guess who
it might belong to.

372
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,070
The victim?
Our killer.

373
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,636
It's a partial,
so it could take some time.

374
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,560
How about you?
Anything on the murder weapon?

375
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,876
Partial.

376
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,360
Well, okay. I guess the race is on.

377
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,953
Shit.

378
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,237
Why was it strange

379
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,080
that I needed someone
to talk to when Harry died?

380
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,674
People like you don't usually seek
an emotional connection.

381
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,633
Good luck.

382
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,433
<i>It all looks innocent.</i>

383
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,871
<i>Just like my apartment.</i>

384
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,074
<i>Nah.</i>

385
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,632
<i>Either Sussman lost his green thumb
or he hasn't been here in a while.</i>

386
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,193
<i>Could he be hiding out
at his next kill site?</i>

387
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,154
<i>A hunting cabin?</i>

388
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,831
<i>Isolated. The perfect place for a kill.</i>

389
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,997
<i>Lake Nona. It's a large lake,
but at least it's a starting place.</i>

390
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,719
Well, fuck.

391
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,079
You found my jewellery.

392
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,398
Really made my life easier.

393
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,354
Thank you for that.

394
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,634
What the hell's
your problem?

395
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,560
Bitch. Fucking nuts.

396
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,156
Yeah, I'm fucking nuts.

397
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,235
Stay down.

398
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,359
You're lucky I don't kill people
unless I'm paid to.

399
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,635
Ah. Ow!

400
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,477
I hope Sussman does
a better job keeping
in touch with his mother

401
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,796
than I do with mine.

402
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,829
Any reason
why you haven't taken
the sergeant's exam?

403
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,432
Uh-- Just haven't
gotten around to it. Why?

404
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,240
Matthews is riding my ass,
keeps pushing people on me.

405
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,194
Sanchez, Whitney.
I'd rather have you.

406
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,395
I didn't know you cared.

407
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,275
You better start taking
your career more seriously, bro.

408
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,080
Especially if you're gonna be
dating my sister.

409
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,118
How'd you know?
Because I'm a good detective.

410
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,199
Why'd you try to hide it from me?

411
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,634
Uh... I thought
your head would explode.

412
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,551
Just get your act together.

413
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,632
If you want me to be okay
with you and Jamie, earn it.

414
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,873
Man up. Take the test.

415
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,600
Do you have any idea
where your son might be,
Mrs. Sussman?

416
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,076
It's very important
that we speak with him.

417
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,870
I haven't seen him for days.

418
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,514
Is that normal?

419
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,518
Well, it's not out of the ordinary.

420
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,674
He's probably off hunting
for the weekend.

421
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,753
So he likes to hunt?

422
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,713
Oh, he practically lives for it.

423
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,193
He always brings back
something for the quilt.

424
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,674
Isn't this something?

425
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,152
It sure is.

426
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,596
Where does he go
on these hunting trips?

427
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,356
He has a cabin somewhere
outside the city.

428
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,829
Do you know the address?

429
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,960
No. Sorry. That's all I know.

430
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,879
What did you say this was about?

431
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,118
We just want to ask him a few
questions. That's all, Mrs. Sussman.

432
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,279
I wish I could help you,
but I don't know what else to tell you.

433
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,911
Oh, you need some more. Ha, ha.
Oh.

434
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,679
Excuse me.

435
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,240
Can we go? That fucking quilt
is freaking me out.

436
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,909
It's like a nightmare in fur.

437
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,433
It's Dispatch.

438
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,436
Damn.

439
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,596
<i>Lake Nona will have to wait.</i>

440
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,116
<i>Hopefully not for long.</i>

441
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,194
What's the word, Vince?

442
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,797
Borborygmus. The sound of gas
rumbling through your intestines.

443
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,040
As in, seriously regretting
having that super-green
passion fruit smoothie

444
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,471
right about now. Unh.

445
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,274
Gunshot to the head.

446
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,278
I call and raise you
one to the chest.

447
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,915
One in the dash
and one in the headrest.

448
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,640
Either the killer was panicky,

449
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,116
or he really needs some time
at the gun range.

450
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,993
Car's registered
to a Javier Guzman.

451
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,236
You think that's him?

452
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,716
Based on Guzman's rap sheet,
be my guess.

453
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,429
Small-time enforcing, murder.

454
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,192
Went by the street name
of El Sapo.

455
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,474
<i>El Sapo was the hit man
sent to kill Briggs.</i>

456
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,518
<i>If he's been killed...</i>

457
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,711
<i>is Deb in danger?</i>

458
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,352
Dexter Morgan.

459
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,473
Dexter Morgan.
Want to get with the programme?

460
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,160
Dex?

461
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,670
How do you think this went down,
Morgan?

462
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,876
Uh-- Yeah, sorry.

463
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,958
Driver pulls to a stop,
the assailant approaches the car,

464
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,595
most likely gun already drawn.

465
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,038
The vic sees the shooter,
pulls his weapon,

466
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,994
clears the holster,
but it's too late.

467
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,270
The gunman opens fire.

468
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,519
I got a second gun in the glove.

469
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,632
Bag it and tag it.

470
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,400
<i>El Sapo's blood is confined
to the inside of his car.</i>

471
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,193
<i>This can't be his.</i>

472
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,518
<i>The killer might have been reaching
into the car and cut himself.</i>

473
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,313
Dex.

474
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,194
El Sapo. Deb was involved
with these guys.

475
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,599
If someone's taking them out--
I know. I'm on it.

476
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,231
I don't understand, Dexter. You think
you know where Sussman's cabin is

477
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,194
<i>but you're not going after him.</i>
I have to do something.

478
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,199
What's more important
than stopping this killer?

479
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,198
<i>My sister.</i>

480
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,831
Debra's in trouble?
<i>Yes.</i>

481
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,640
Ah. That's what's
been eating at you.

482
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,231
I'm coming up on her house.
I have to hang up.

483
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,833
Jesus, Deb.

484
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,110
What the fuck are you doing here?

485
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,117
Deb.
I don't want you around.

486
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,438
I thought I made that
really fucking clear.

487
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,671
El Sapo is dead.

488
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,070
El Sapo?

489
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,112
The man who was sent
to take out Briggs.

490
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,277
I know who the fuck that is.

491
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,917
Well, someone shot him in his car.
It looked like an execution.

492
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,077
Do you know anything
about this?

493
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,716
All I know is what my head
feels like right now.

494
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,873
I tried calling.
I was worried about you.

495
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,912
That's touching.

496
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,392
I'm fine.

497
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,638
Fine isn't the first word
that comes to mind.

498
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,876
And anybody could have
walked in here.

499
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,314
The door wouldn't close
so I had to get creative.

500
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,360
What happened?

501
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,957
Deb, what happened
to your side?

502
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,316
El Sapo followed me
to the storage unit,

503
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,352
where Briggs kept his stash,
you know.

504
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,079
We tussled, he got the stuff,
end of story.

505
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,438
Except it's not the end of the story.
El Sapo's dead.

506
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,712
It's a better fucking ending.
He deserved it.

507
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,355
And if whoever killed El Sapo
comes after you?

508
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,677
Nobody's coming after me, Dexter.

509
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,075
How do you know that?

510
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,916
Will you not do this, please?

511
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,840
What?

512
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,559
Give a shit.

513
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,835
Deb, I'm your brother.
You can hate me if you want,

514
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,760
but it doesn't change the fact
that I care about you.

515
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,910
I didn't want to hate you.

516
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,190
I wanted the opposite.

517
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,393
But it didn't work out that way.

518
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,877
I can't change the way I feel, so...

519
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,072
Will you go, please?

520
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,078
I'm not leaving you.

521
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,677
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter,
get the fuck out.

522
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,799
Go.

523
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,476
<i>Deb doesn't want my help,
and Vogel is demanding it.</i>

524
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,038
<i>This is it. Sussman's cabin.</i>

525
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,598
<i>At least I'm staying ahead
of Miami Metro.</i>

526
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,195
<i>Sussman's no stranger
to blood and death.</i>

527
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,313
<i>Vogel is wrong.
Everything points to him as the killer.</i>

528
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,673
<i>Except this.</i>

529
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,634
Maybe Sussman had an accomplice
who decided to take him out.

530
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,639
A killer like Sussman
doesn't use an accomplice.

531
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,877
They're rogues.
He could be the exception.

532
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,470
Yeah, or just the innocent victim
like the first two.

533
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,639
Sussman's prints were on the weapon.
He must have been involved.

534
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,200
Sit down, Dexter.

535
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,473
You're getting agitated.

536
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,435
I'm just trying to figure this out.

537
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,478
You have a hard time admitting
that you're wrong, but it's all right.

538
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,276
People like you have
an inherent need to be right,

539
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,796
to feel superior.

540
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,994
You keep talking about me like
I'm some kind of alternate species.

541
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,278
Like I'm less than human.

542
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,233
On the contrary.

543
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,392
Have you read any of my books?

544
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,672
I haven't gotten around to it.

545
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,076
Well, if you had,
you'd know that I believe

546
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,877
that psychopaths are not
a mistake of nature.

547
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,639
They're a gift.

548
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,799
A gift?

549
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,878
They're alpha wolves

550
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:37,030
who helped the human race survive
long enough to become civilised.

551
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,071
An indispensable demographic.

552
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,313
You believe that?

553
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,520
Did you know that
psychopathic traits

554
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,474
can be found
in the most successful CEOs?

555
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,354
In the most effective politicians?

556
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,080
Without psychopaths,
mankind wouldn't exist today.

557
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,431
Well, there's a lot of mankind
that doesn't exist because of them.

558
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,191
Every silver lining...

559
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,115
Well, one of your indispensable
demographics is still out there, killing.

560
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,991
And we're back to zero.

561
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,391
You'll find him, Dexter.

562
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,677
I have faith in you.

563
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,513
So, um,
what's going on with Debra?

564
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,958
That's between me and her.

565
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,879
It's affecting you.

566
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,232
So it makes it a problem for me too.

567
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,238
We're not going to talk about Deb.

568
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,438
Whatever you want.

569
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,639
Should I come back later?
Sorry.

570
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,629
I was just checking
to see if Dexter called.

571
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,520
He was looking in on Deb.

572
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,194
Deb?

573
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,436
Yeah.

574
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,474
Wow, we're a whole 10 seconds
into the date.

575
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,871
I thought we were gonna
make it to one minute

576
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,390
before you mentioned
your old fiancée.

577
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,393
What are you talking about?

578
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,350
Joey, you're always checking in on her
or talking about her.

579
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,956
Since we've been together,
you're on Deb patrol.

580
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,992
No, I'm not.

581
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,035
Okay. We'll do an experiment.
Let's see if you can go one whole day

582
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,999
without mentioning Debra Morgan.

583
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,399
What is it with you people? I mean--

584
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,716
What people?

585
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,754
I got your brother on my ass
about taking the sergeant's test.

586
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,400
You're on my ass about Deb.

587
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,512
Like, what is this,
a fucking Cuban thing?

588
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,633
What does Angel have to do with this?
He knows we're seeing each other.

589
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,475
He's on my ass about
making something out of my life.

590
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,316
"Man up. Take the sergeant's test."
You know what? Maybe I don't want to.

591
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,035
Wait, how does Angel know
that we're seeing each other?

592
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,197
And what's wrong about
trying to better yourself?

593
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,756
See? That's what I'm talking about.

594
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,189
You know what? Screw this, okay?

595
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,558
I did not get dressed up
to argue with you.

596
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,353
Go drink by yourself.

597
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,914
Ja--

598
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,074
Why the hell can't you stay
out of my personal life?

599
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,920
What'd I do?
Angel, you know exactly what you did.

600
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,157
Okay, you're putting pressure
on Quinn.

601
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,352
We just had a giant argument
because of you.

602
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,950
Wait a second.
You know what, I hope you're happy.

603
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,392
It's like, mind your own
fucking business, Angel.

604
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,000
<i>If this finds El Sapo's killer,
it'll keep Deb safe.</i>

605
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,277
<i>It's Deb's blood.</i>

606
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,235
<i>She killed El Sapo.</i>

607
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,876
<i>Shot him in his car.</i>

608
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,159
Deb.

609
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,559
Deb.

610
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,833
<i>What is she doing here?</i>

611
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,959
Morgan.

612
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,916
Sir.

613
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,754
I never got a chance to tell you
how disappointed I was

614
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,235
that you left the force.

615
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,194
From running Homicide
to chasing down bail jumpers.

616
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,631
It's a hell of a career trajectory.

617
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,752
It's not what you think.

618
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,231
Well, I hope it was worth it.

619
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,309
Debra Morgan?

620
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,910
As I live and breathe.

621
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,952
If I were to cop a feel now, it wouldn't
be sexual harassment anymore.

622
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,199
Hey, stranger.
Hey.

623
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,079
What brings you around?

624
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,359
Um, Quinn had some questions
about a case, so...

625
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,678
<i>Is this about El Sapo?</i>

626
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,190
Well, he's probably
grabbing some coffee.

627
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,555
Every morning when I come in,
I walk past it.

628
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,277
I have to turn around, because
I still think of it as Deb's office.

629
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,393
No, you probably should have
gotten it first, you know.

630
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,956
I never really belonged there.

631
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,359
You know that's BS.

632
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,836
This place ain't the same without you.

633
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,278
We're having some drinks
at Papa's tonight.

634
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,556
You should come.

635
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,956
Yeah, I'll try to make it.

636
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,274
Hey.

637
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,154
Thanks for coming in.

638
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,800
Come on.

639
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,111
I would have used
the briefing room, but it's taken.

640
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,959
I mean, this is fine though, right?

641
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,595
Otherwise fucking everybody'd
still be hugging you.

642
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,114
Um...

643
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,398
Do you wanna go to the coffee truck?
No, let's just-- Let's do this.

644
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,159
Okay.

645
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,152
El Sapo and Briggs.

646
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,439
What do you want to know?

647
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,431
Basically, we've hit a wall.

648
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,109
I was hoping you could open up
some leads for us.

649
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,510
What can you tell me?

650
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,193
Um...

651
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,751
I was doing a skip-trace on Briggs.
He robbed a jewellery store

652
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,953
and made off with like
a half-million dollars in merchandise.

653
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,237
I got a tip that he was
in Fort Lauderdale,

654
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,274
and I was staking him out
and overheard

655
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,631
that he was gonna fence
the stuff to El Sapo.

656
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,439
Isn't a skip-trace one of those

657
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,075
locate-and-bring-them-back
type of things?

658
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,194
Yeah, I was also trying
to get a fix on the goods.

659
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,790
What happened the night
Briggs was killed?

660
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,520
Um...

661
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,633
He was supposed to meet El Sapo
that same night.

662
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,597
I thought they were gonna
be a few hours

663
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,316
so I went to get a sandwich,
and when I came back,

664
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,833
F.L.P.D. was on the scene,
and, uh,

665
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,159
Briggs had a fucking hole
in his chest.

666
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,750
<i>Is she lying to protect me
or to protect herself?</i>

667
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,559
<i>I can't tell anymore.</i>

668
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,119
I was just wondering if you could
take a look at what we've got.

669
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,152
Maybe we could
put our heads together,

670
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,432
push this thing down the field,
you know? Like old times.

671
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,151
Heh. Um...

672
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,398
So, what we think is

673
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,554
the shooter approached
the vehicle from behind,

674
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,040
and then El Sapo drew his gun.

675
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,193
And then the shooter...

676
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,716
Hey, are you all right?

677
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,231
Sorry. Family emergency.
I gotta borrow my sister.

678
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,794
Sure.

679
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,834
Thanks.

680
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,517
What, Dexter?

681
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,795
I know you killed El Sapo.

682
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,600
I found your blood
at the crime scene.

683
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,359
Fuck.

684
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,358
Tell me what happened.

685
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,556
Talk to me, Deb.

686
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,714
I don't know what happened, all right?
I'm a little fucking fuzzy on it.

687
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,117
I was angry.
I wanted the jewels back.

688
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,110
And the next thing I know,
I'm standing over a dead body.

689
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,592
You shot at him four times.
You don't remember any of it?

690
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,396
He'd just beaten the shit out of me.
I was a little fucked up.

691
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,356
Why didn't you call the police?

692
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,559
I didn't know what I could tell them.

693
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,552
You could have called me.

694
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,512
You get me into trouble, not out of it.
Is that why you lied to me?

695
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,400
All of a sudden we have
a problem with lying?

696
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,199
We found a gun in El Sapo's
glove box. Is it yours?

697
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,631
Shit, it might be, yeah.

698
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,357
He took it off of me
before he beat me up.

699
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,317
It'll be traced to you.
How will you explain that?

700
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,312
You could switch it out.

701
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,758
Get rid of it.

702
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,235
What if I weren't here
to cover your ass?

703
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,230
You really want to play
the "what if" game?

704
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,509
What if you weren't a serial killer?

705
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,795
What if Harry had left you
in that shipping container?

706
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,072
That's enough.
El Sapo's not the first person I shot.

707
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,277
And he may not be the fucking last.

708
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,278
What's that supposed to mean?

709
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,030
Anything can happen in this hellhole
that is now my life.

710
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,550
Your gift to me, Dexter.

711
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,037
<i>She's right. Whoever Deb was
before killing LaGuerta,</i>

712
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,391
<i>that person is dead.</i>

713
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,959
<i>I just wish I knew
what's taken her place.</i>

714
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,639
Busy day?

715
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,910
Crazy busy.

716
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,316
<i>Then maybe they haven't
tested Deb's gun yet.</i>

717
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,594
<i>I've covered evidence for myself
more times than I can remember.</i>

718
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,950
<i>But I'll never get used to
doing this for Deb.</i>

719
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,672
You and Jamie patch things up?
How did you know we were fighting?

720
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,997
Because I'm a good--
Detective, right.

721
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,877
Yeah. Uh, the sergeant's test?

722
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,954
Yeah?
I'm gonna start studying for it.

723
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,755
Damn. Eh,

724
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,758
you gonna make an okay sergeant.

725
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,276
If not, I'll demote your ass.

726
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,231
<i>Dr. Vogel says that psychopaths
are not a mistake of nature.</i>

727
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,318
<i>They're a gift.</i>

728
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,149
<i>But what kind of gift
destroys everything it cares about?</i>

729
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,316
Hello?

730
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,314
Dexter, I think there's someone
inside my house.

731
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,920
<i>How do you know?</i>

732
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,000
Well, I just walked up,
and the front door is open.

733
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,675
Get in your car and stay there.

734
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,198
If someone was inside
when I called, he's still in there.

735
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,232
I haven't seen anyone leave.

736
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,280
Wait here.

737
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,954
Thank you, Dexter.

738
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,596
Are you sure
there's no one inside?

739
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,071
I checked the entire house.
I'm sure.

740
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,633
That DVD, it's not mine.

741
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,996
Put it in.

742
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,319
He was coerced.

743
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,518
And now he's dead.

744
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,799
I was wrong all along.

745
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,999
You were right.

746
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,280
Sussman was never a real killer.
He's just another victim.

747
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,232
I should have listened to you.

748
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,512
You were only doing
what you thought was right.

749
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,274
We had no idea that--

750
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,274
You should have no idea.
You've never done this before.

751
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,193
Me, it's what I do.

752
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,595
The one thing
I've always been good at.

753
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,478
Vetting, stalking, and killing people.

754
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,629
I can't even do that anymore.

755
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,435
What you're feeling now,
it's not because of the killer.

756
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,113
I've...

757
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,914
destroyed Deb.

758
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,073
She's gone.

759
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,470
You were wrong about me.

760
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,600
I'm a mistake.

761
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,193
You're exactly what you
need to be, Dexter.

762
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,037
You're perfect.
