<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,039
<i>I should be focused on
who bludgeoned Cassie and why.</i>

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,832
<i>But instead, since Hannah came back
into my orbit, she's all I can think about.</i>

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,037
Have you seen that kid
around Cassie?

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,916
I don't know him. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,276
Joey, my friend was murdered.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,917
Once I catch the killer, you won't
have to be scared anymore.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,238
If Deb were asking you to stay,
you wouldn't put up a fight.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,511
She'd want to catch
the killer as bad as I do.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,319
Sorry I'm not Deb.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,598
I think Hannah McKay
is back in Miami.
Are you interested?

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,150
Very.
What are you doing here?

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,158
I came here for her.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,078
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,789
I don't wanna know. I don't want
to know anything else ever.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,556
She's your problem now.
I can't go to jail, Hannah.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,154
Lose my kids again? I couldn't take it.
We've always stuck together.

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,877
That's not gonna change now,
is it?

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,151
I found your blood
underneath Cassie's fingernails.

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,352
Zach had nothing to do
with Cassie's murder.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,638
How did my blood end up there?
Your plane leaves at 8:00.

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,400
Twenty-seven minutes later,
you'll land in Nassau.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,597
From there,
where you go is up to you.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,111
Where do you think you'll go?
I haven't decided.

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,073
Argentina?

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,271
<i>Every contact leaves a trace.</i>

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,951
<i>But the changes,
they're never what we anticipate.</i>

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,240
I believe Hannah McKay
was just in Miami under
the alias of Maggie Castner.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,113
Stay with me.

30
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,120
I just want to stay here with you.

31
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,397
I know, but you can't.

32
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,317
Dexter, I'm so sorry about Zach.
I know how much he meant to you.

33
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,760
I need to see Dr. Vogel
and figure out our next move.

34
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,319
You should stay here,
inside, out of view.

35
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,274
I have to see Arlene
this afternoon after her shift.

36
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,955
Why?
It's not safe for me to draw money

37
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,476
out of Maggie Castner's
account anymore.

38
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,919
The only money I have is what I've been
sending away to Arlene to hold for me.

39
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,677
And I'm gonna need that money
to start a new life.

40
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,192
Okay.

41
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,557
"Be careful." I know.

42
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,519
Actually, I was gonna say,
"I love you."

43
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,152
I love you too.

44
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,194
Poor child.

45
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,074
I'm gonna have to find a way
to let the family know.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,119
Just give me a little time
before Miami Metro
gets brought in.

47
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,720
I will.

48
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,316
This is the song that was playing
when I found Zach's body.

49
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,753
[MAMA CASS ELLIOT'S "MAKE YOUR
OWN KIND OF MUSIC" PLAYING

Do you know it?
Of course.

51
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,434
I used to play it all the time.
Still do.

52
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,119
Does it mean anything?
It was just a pleasant song.

53
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,556
Possibly my patients
heard me playing it.

<i>♪ They may try and tell ya ♪♪</i>

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,799
There are some signs of a struggle.

56
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,717
They fought here.
This table is out of place.

57
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,556
But whoever did this cleaned up
after himself. There's no blood.

58
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,955
I wish I could understand
what this is all about.

59
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,073
Why he's doing this.

60
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,989
I mean, it's clearly not simply
to frighten me.

61
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,470
He's trying to send a message.
But what is it?

62
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,950
I don't care what his message is.
He killed Zach.

63
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,510
He broke into my apartment
and dumped his body there.

64
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,717
What if Harrison
had been home?

65
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,237
I will find who did this,
and I will kill him.

66
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,318
I'm sure you will, Dexter.

67
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,837
But you need to remain focused.

68
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,553
I am focused.

69
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,232
Blood. He missed it.

70
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,952
And a few hairs pulled out
by the roots.

71
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,119
There's a big fingerprint
in the middle of it all.

72
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,397
Zach's, most likely.

73
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,157
Almost like
it was put there deliberately.

74
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,832
Zach learned from me.

75
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,155
He knew the importance of DNA. It's
possible that he ripped these hairs

76
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,597
from whoever attacked him
and stuck them there for me to find.

77
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,872
If this is a clue, as you said,

78
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,478
then Zach acted with
extraordinary calm, rational thought.

79
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,236
Yes.

80
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,794
Something I'm not sure
you're doing right now,
Dexter.

81
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,749
What?
Your desire to avenge Zach's death,

82
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,279
that's an emotional response,

83
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,960
possibly fuelled by having
to say goodbye to Hannah.

84
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,676
I didn't say goodbye to her.

85
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,712
How do you mean?

86
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,151
We're going to make a life together.

87
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,913
Dexter, how?

88
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,115
I don't know. We'll figure it out.

89
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,317
Over the time I've spent with you,

90
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,716
I've come to realise
that you're not

91
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,600
the perfect psychopath
I thought you were.

92
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,512
You have a depth of emotion
I never thought possible.

93
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,634
It's true.

94
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,710
I'll find the Brain Surgeon
and I'll kill him.

95
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,514
But once I do, I'm gonna focus
on a life with Hannah.

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,390
I think you misunderstood my point.

97
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,276
Straddling two worlds as you are,
it's dangerous.

98
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,678
Killers cannot have
a full emotional life.

99
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,830
I think you underestimate me.

100
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,678
So this is Maggie Castner's
passport photo.

101
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,829
That's Hannah McKay's.
I won't ask how you got those.

102
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,719
Good. Please don't.

103
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,752
They look pretty much
the same.

104
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,156
Have you had contact?
I have not.

105
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,109
Her boat left for St. Kitt's yesterday,
but I don't think she was on it.

106
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,990
What makes you think that?
Just a hunch.

107
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,992
A lot of good that does me.
Her husband?

108
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,119
Supposedly in New York City,
but no record of his jet landing

109
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,911
or taking off from here. Don't know.
All right, then. I'll look into this.

110
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,120
There's one more thing.
I'd actually like to be
a part of the team on this.

111
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,280
Heh. Thanks, but the marshal service
doesn't take on partners.

112
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,352
I understand--
If I do find her,

113
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,398
you'll get your reward money.

114
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,797
Fair enough.
All right.

115
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,760
Deb.

116
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,520
Hey.

117
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,438
I saw you from my car
and I had this moment

118
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,637
where it was just like old times.

119
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,397
Tell me you're here to see me.

120
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,839
Quinn, actually.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,753
I meant what I said the other day.

122
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,676
We'd love you to come back with us.
I don't think Matthews would go for it.

123
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,038
He was pissed that I left so abruptly.
You never know, Deb.

124
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,078
I'll leave you two be.

125
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,991
Thanks for coming.
I need to ask you for a favour.

126
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,198
Yeah. Anything.
I think I know who Cassie's killer is,

127
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,797
but Matthews asked me to lay off.
The guy's from this rich family.

128
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,192
Could you look into him for me?
Sure. This all you have?

129
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,352
Yup. His info.

130
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,237
Social, address,
his name's Zach Hamilton.

131
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,597
Kid's a serial killer
in the making.

132
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,235
I think Cassie's
the second person he killed.

133
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,996
Yeah, I'll get right on it.

134
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,633

137
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,398

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,193
Hey, hey, hold it.

139
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,558

140
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,071
Niki, this is former lieutenant

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,876
Oh, shit. Sorry.

142
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,073
My dad says you're a total rock star.
Why'd you leave?

143
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,031
She's a curious one.

144
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,272
Let's go see some files over here.
Nice to meet you!

145
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,755
What the fuck are you doing
with Zach Hamilton?

146
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,640
Quinn called.
He thinks Zach killed Cassie.

147
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,319
I thought so too,
but I checked it out.

148
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,394
Zach didn't.

149
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,720
What was Zach doing
with you and Hannah in the Keys?

150
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,389
Serial killers convention?

151
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,551
I was helping Dr. Vogel out.

152
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,760
I don't know why I even
ask you these questions.

153
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,072
No one else knows.

154
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,992
Zach's dead.

155
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,632
Now I know.

156
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,637
I don't want to know, because now
I have to explain how I know.

157
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,593
Kind of, yes.

158
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,275
I was thinking
about coming back here.

159
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,309
About being a detective again,
doing something good for a change.

160
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,480
But...

161
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,272
It'll just lead me into another
fucked up situation, won't it?

162
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,157
<i>A familial match...</i>

163
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,076
<i>to Dr. Evelyn Vogel?</i>

164
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,717
What?
The hairs we found in Zach's studio.

165
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,271
I ran a mitochondrial DNA match on
them. It tests a person's mother line.

166
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,116
Yeah, I'm aware of those tests.
Well, it's a direct match to you.

167
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,558
Zach's killer is related to you.

168
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,832
The Brain Surgeon is related to you.

169
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,916
How is that possible?
I have no family.

170
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,440
Well, not anymore.
Anymore.

171
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,195
Well, I was married
and I had two sons.

172
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,031
Daniel and Richard.
And now?

173
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,479
They're gone.
What happened to them?

174
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,998
One day, I found Richard,
he was my youngest,

175
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,755
at the bottom
of our swimming pool, dead.

176
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,952
At first I thought it was
an accident.

177
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,879
He wasn't a strong swimmer.

178
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,271
But then I realised the truth.

179
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,359
My older son, Daniel...

180
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,154
he...

181
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,518
He killed Richard.
Yes.

182
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,353
Daniel was--
Daniel was highly intelligent.

183
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,119
But he was also very troubled.

184
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,875
No, it was much more than that.

185
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,110
He was devoid of empathy,

186
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,390
had a complete lack of fear
or the sense of right and wrong.

187
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,992
He was a psychopath.

188
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,153
Realising this and wanting to...

189
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,600
find a way to help Daniel
led me into this field.

190
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,590
I failed Daniel. I...

191
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,635
I was never able to treat him.

192
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,833
Maybe that's one reason
I was so determined to help you.

193
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,513
This is Daniel.

194
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,997
My husband and I covered up
his involvement in Richard's death.

195
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,550
Said it was an accident

196
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,551
and then we put Daniel
into a mental health institute.

197
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,439
He was only 14.

198
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,913
Here in Miami?
No.

199
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,992
No, I sent him back to England.

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,117
Three years later, he was dead.

201
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,880
How?

202
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,597
A fire broke out in the wing
where Daniel was living.

203
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,515
Some idiot nurse had left
the door locked to take
a coffee break.

204
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,713
The children couldn't get out.

205
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,280
Seven of them perished.

206
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,631
One of them was Daniel.

207
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,959
Did you see the body?

208
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,080
No. My husband did.

209
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,672
He was horribly burned.

210
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,598
If it was his body.

211
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,350
That's preposterous, Dexter.
He can't be alive.

212
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,236
You said yourself
he's highly intelligent.
Could've faked his death.

213
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,312
But after all these years,

214
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,319
why would he do
these terrible things now?

215
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,792
The brain cores.

216
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,320
Do they mean anything to you?

217
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,879
Well...

218
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,240
Well, even as a child, Daniel was

219
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,875
aware that he lacked empathy

220
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,155
and how I felt about it.

221
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,198
It's possible he boxed some up...

222
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,393
and left it at my door.

223
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,120
<i>Daniel Vogel would be in his mid-40s.</i>

224
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,154
Anybody. Nobody.

225
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,560
<i>That guy Cassie was dating.
He was interviewed that night.</i>

226
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,239
<i>Oliver Saxon.</i>

227
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,914
<i>Is it possible this is Vogel's son?</i>

228
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,476
<i>Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.</i>

229
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,037
You created half a dozen fake IDs.
He could've done the same.

230
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,031
The easiest way is to assume
the identity of a dead person.

231
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,240
Oliver Saxon,
death certificate.

232
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,831
The guy's a fake. Doesn't mean
he's your brain surgeon.

233
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,834
I need to get a DNA sample
from him.

234
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,639
Dexter, this is
Deputy Marshal Clayton.

235
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,277
He's here on a tip that
Hannah McKay is back in Miami.

236
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,516
Uh, sorry if I don't
seem glad to meet you,
this is kind of a shock.

237
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,598
I guess you haven't talked to her.

238
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,952
Why would I?
I told him that you dated Hannah

239
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,073
before you turned her in
for the Sal Price murders.

240
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,000
Wasn't the smoothest breakup.
I guess not.

241
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,674
And that makes you a target.

242
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,239
Frankly, the Hannah McKay I knew

243
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,400
would be too smart to risk
coming back to Miami.

244
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,156
Could be. Look, I got no
definite information she's here.

245
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,597
I'm just following up on a tip.
But until we know for sure,

246
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,434
we should put unis
on you till this plays out.

247
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,593
<i>That's the last thing I need
trying to help Hannah hide.</i>

248
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,953
<i>On the other hand, the Brain Surgeon's
still out there. He knows where I live.</i>

249
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,918
I don't need unis to watch me,

250
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,800
just my apartment
and my son when he goes to school.

251
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,316
Don't worry,
we'll watch Harrison like a hawk.

252
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,390
Deputy Marshal Clayton,
how do you plan to find Hannah
even if she is here?

253
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,071
Getting her picture out
with local media, asking anyone
to call if they spot her.

254
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,680
Okay.

255
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,073
But if by some chance she decides
you two need to talk things over,

256
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,792
be sure and give me a call,
won't you?

257
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,794
Of course. I want her behind bars
as much as you do.

258
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,793
Okay.

259
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,355
This is exactly
what Vogel warned you about.

260
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,591
Trying to straddle both worlds.

261
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,713
You should be following up
on Saxon right now.

262
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,039
Let Hannah handle her own problems.
I can do both.

263
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,077
Hey.
<i>Have you gone to see Arlene yet?</i>

264
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,833
No, I was just about to leave.

265
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,600
Don't. I just had
a federal marshal in my office.

266
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,918
<i>They know you're here.</i>
Oh, God.

267
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,311
You can't go to Arlene's. Lay low.

268
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,796
I can't start a new life
without that money.

269
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,674
<i>I can give you money.</i>
Half a million dollars?

270
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,280
Well, no.

271
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,435
I'll drive you.
I'm not letting you go by yourself.

272
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,074
Okay, but hurry.

273
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,716
This marshal changes everything.
We can never be together here.

274
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,479
I know.

275
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,194
What are we gonna do?

276
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,397
Let's get your money,
figure it out later.

277
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,514
You were right, the hotel manager
in Key West positively ID'd Zach.

278
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,071
He was down there
when she was killed. Where do
you get your information?

279
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,911
I have my sources.

280
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,597
Wish I had your sources.
Thought I had this one nailed.

281
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,671
Well, you're at square one. You've
been there before. You'll close it.

282
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,356
Just after the whole
sergeant dick dance, you know,

283
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,029
I got something to prove.
You're a good cop.

284
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,913
You don't have to prove anything.

285
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,199
Then there's Jamie, you know,
I'd kind of like to solve it for her.

286
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,839
She was really close to Cassie.
Yeah.

287
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,271
I just haven't
been there for her lately.

288
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,759
I thought she moved in.
I mean, like, emotionally.

289
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,038
Heh. Since when are you Mr. Sensitive?
Fuck you.

290
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,113
It pours right out of you.

291
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,029
You know, she's always accusing me
of comparing you to her.

292
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,517
Oh. Um...

293
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,080
Well, I mean, I can't really
advise you on that.

294
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,757
Puts me in an awkward position.
Why?

295
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,000
Because of our history, asshole.
I mean, history is history, right?

296
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,675
Jamie knew Cassie
better than anyone.

297
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,669
Question her again
.
Maybe something'll turn up.

298
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,551
She's been a wreck, it's hard walking
the line between boyfriend and cop.

299
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,234
I'll talk to her.

300
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,274
Really?
Yeah. Be fun to play cop again.

301
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,073
That'd be great. Thanks.

302
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,671
You can buy me lunch.
And two fucking desserts.

303
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,510
Nice place.
Found that when you're a fugitive,

304
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,230
asking somebody to hold half
a million dollars, incentives help.

305
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,840
So Arlene gets a cut?

306
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,680
She gets what she needs
to keep the kids off welfare,
I get--

307
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,997
The bank of Arlene.
Exactly.

308
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,352
Hey, babe.
Hey, Arlene.

309
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,750
Huh.

310
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,078
You're the asshole who turned her in.
That would be me.

311
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,640
Long story.

312
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,193
Can we come in?
Yeah.

313
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,189
So now we're
back together, huh?

314
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,153
How's that gonna work out?

315
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,754
We're figuring it out.

316
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,756
I told the kids
there's snakes in here
so they wouldn't go near it.

317
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,554
There you go.

318
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,473
Ah, shit.

319
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,919
Who's that?
Federal marshal.

320
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,717
Stay here. I'll handle this.

321
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,792
You answer the door.
Come with me.

322
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,998
Like you've got nothing
to hide.

323
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,158
Can I help you?
I'm Deputy Marshal Clayton.

324
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,397
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

325
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,674
- Uh, Yeah.
- Yeah.

326
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,073
Dexter Morgan.

327
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,719
What are you doing here?

328
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,951
Arlene's a friend.
We met through Hannah.

329
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,712
Really now?
Yeah, I stopped by

330
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,640
to tell her what you said,
Hannah might be in Miami.

331
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,714
Yeah, I gotta keep
an extra eye on the kids.

332
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,236
Looks like you recently
changed your address.

333
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,313
Seems like a step up.
Better school district.

334
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,593
Says here you work part-time
waiting tables at Denny's.

335
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,400
That's right.
That won't buy you a doll's house,

336
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,791
let alone pay rent on this.

337
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,350
You sure
you haven't gotten help
from Hannah McKay,

338
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,070
who just happened
to have married a man worth
over half a billion dollars?

339
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,631
Didn't even know she was married.
Says here you got a record.

340
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,996
Do you have any idea
how many years

341
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,876
aiding and abetting a fugitive buys?
I'm the one who's been...

342
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,592
helping out Arlene.

343
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,472
Heh. Now I see what you two
really bonded over.

344
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,634
You sure can pick them.

345
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,394
Listen, do me a favour.

346
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,394
Either of you hear from
your old friend, Hannah McKay,

347
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,358
you give me a call.

348
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,000
Of course.
Yeah, we will.

349
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,599
Hey, Deb. Dexter's not here.
I know, I was driving by.

350
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,752
Wanted to say hello
to the little man.

351
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,351
Oh.
Look, Aunt Deb, I can write my name.

352
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,920
That's awesome.

353
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,712
I am so sorry about Cassie.

354
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,120
You doing okay working here
and everything?

355
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,554
Honestly, no. Not really.

356
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,430
The cops are watching
the place, which helps.

357
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,239
She have a lot of friends?

358
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,030
Yeah. She's pretty popular.

359
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,029
Everyone's just in shock,
you know? Especially Oliver.

360
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,359
Who's that?
This guy Cassie was dating.

361
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,158
Were they dating for a long time?

362
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,391
Just a couple weeks.

363
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,479
I guess it was love at first sight.
At least for him.

364
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,430
What do you mean "for him"?
Between us,

365
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,195
I think Cassie was gonna
break it off with Oliver.

366
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,194
Then he was all,
"Let's go to the Bahamas for a week."

367
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,637
After two weeks of dating?
He kept pushing her into it.

368
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,589
He wouldn't take "no" for an answer.
You weren't a fan, I take it.

369
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,797
I thought he could be
a little clingy.

370
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,437
But he was great to Cassie.

371
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,157
Hey, we should all have someone
who worships us like that, right?

372
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,514
Hm.

373
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,916
When was the trip
supposed to happen?

374
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,440
This week, I think.

375
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,200
Hey.

376
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,474
Quinn, it's me. I just talked
to Jamie. We need
to revisit the boyfriend.

377
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,438
Oliver Saxon.

378
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,309
So you think Clayton
bought your little story?

379
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,880
I'm not sure.

380
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,313
Either way, he's got your
photo all over Miami.
It's not safe to go to the hotel.

381
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,279
You need something private.
Yeah, but where?

382
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,917
I do know of one place.

383
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,796
Something tells me it's
the last place I'll want to go.

384
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,037
Debra's, if I can talk her into it.

385
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,274
I was right.

386
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,069
I can't think of a better option,
can you?

387
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,636
Unfortunately, I can't.

388
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,394
Answering more questions?
Anything I can do to help find

389
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,075
who did this to Cassie.
This must be hard on you.

390
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,755
The last few days
have been a nightmare.

391
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,991
I still can't even believe it.

392
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,799
I just wish I had time to breathe,
I'm so busy at work.

393
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,993
I'm already late for an appointment.
Won't take long.

394
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,039
What is it you do, exactly?
Building inspections.

395
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,760
Where you were when Cassie died?
Yes.

396
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,038
You're welcome to look
at my workbook,
I was in Sunny Isles

397
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,193
inspecting a new condo.
- Just a few minutes from here
.

398
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,239
Yes.
You must be pretty busy, huh?

399
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm booked wall-to-wall
for the next few weeks.

400
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,598
Oh, really? I thought you and Cassie
were planning a trip to the Bahamas.

401
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,273
How were you gonna
work that in?

402
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,111
I guess that was a little crazy.

403
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,759
Cassie kept pushing,
I didn't want to disappoint her.

404
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,357
Oh, it was her idea?
Yeah. She wanted a romantic getaway.

405
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,432
Seems a little fast, don't you think?

406
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,671
After a few weeks of dating.

407
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,034
I know it's hard
for most people to understand,

408
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,193
but we had something special.
And we both knew it.

409
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,633
Look, I'm really sorry, you guys.
I've got to get going.

410
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,190
Maybe we can pick this up later?
Yeah, no.

411
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,155
We'll come back another time.
That would be great. Thanks.

412
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,075
He lied to us.
About what?

413
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,795
Jamie said
that whole Bahamas
thing was his idea.

414
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,071
A way for Cassie
not to dump him.

415
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,391
That doesn't mean he's a killer,
you know.

416
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,916
He just could be
fucking obsessed with her.

417
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,833
It wouldn't hurt to look
into it.

418
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,993
Look a little deeper into his alibi.
I'll get on that.

419
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,160
Feel that?

420
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,917
What?
Us, you know,

421
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,118
working together again.
It's nice, you know?

422
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,230
Yeah, it's a lot better than
doing background checks for Elway.

423
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,274
Yeah.
I forgot how much I like it.

424
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,151
Shit. Uh... I'm sorry.

425
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,352
I don't know why I did that.

426
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,191
Let's just pretend you didn't.

427
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,270
Okay.
Okay.

428
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,199
What the fuck?
Sorry, we let ourselves in.

429
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,512
You two should talk alone.

430
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,875
I need a place
where Hannah can stay.

431
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,470
And you want that to be my place?

432
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,433
There's a federal marshal
after her.

433
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,792
He knows she's in Miami.

434
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,839
He's gonna do everything
he can to find her.

435
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,957
It's the only move I could think of.

436
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,120
To bring Hannah to my house?
I know.

437
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,234
It's only for a couple of nights.

438
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,876
Just until I can get her out of Miami.

439
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,354
Please?

440
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,037
A couple of nights, that's it.

441
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,514
Thank you.

442
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,798
You could also thank me
for getting Quinn off Zach's trail.

443
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,234
How?

444
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,634
Simple. Get him
to focus on the boyfriend.

445
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,711
Oliver Saxon.

446
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,754
Saxon? You think he did it?
Well, he's a damn good suspect.

447
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,559
Quinn and I talked to him today.

448
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,396
<i>If Saxon thinks the police are onto him,
he'll know that I'm onto him.</i>

449
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,472
You should stay away
from Saxon, Deb.

450
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,916
He could be more dangerous
than you think.

451
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,317
What are you talking about?
I can't go into it right now,

452
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,110
but please, just do as I ask.

453
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,030
I knew going back
to the force would put me
in a fucked up situation.

454
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,880
Here it is, ahead of schedule.

455
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,953
He's all yours.

456
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,718
You'll be okay here?

457
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,919
Sure.

458
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,558
We'll just hang.

459
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,034
Heh.

460
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,679
<i>If Deb and Quinn did anything
to spook Saxon, I have to act fast.</i>

461
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,317
<i>I'm too late.
He's already moved out.</i>

462
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,951
<i>But if this has his DNA</i>

463
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,591
<i>I can check it against the hairs
I found at Zach's studio.</i>

464
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,074
Here you go.

465
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,910
Are we going to see Hannah?

466
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,076
Hannah? Why?
I saw her on TV.

467
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,312
They said people are looking
for her. Is she in trouble?

468
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,560
No, she's fine.
Hannah's just popular.

469
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,676
You miss her?
Yeah. I liked playing with her.

470
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,593
She was nice.

471
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,717
I wish she could be my mom.

472
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,150
<i>It's a match. Saxon is Vogel's son.</i>

473
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,191
Daniel.
He's going by the name Oliver Saxon.

474
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,631
He dated my neighbour
until he killed her

475
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,156
in her apartment
two doors down from mine.

476
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,039
Do you have any idea where he is?

477
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,157
No, he cleared out
of his place.

478
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,070
He could be anywhere
right now.

479
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,516
Suppose you do find him,
Dexter.

480
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,111
What are you going to do?
What do you think?

481
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,516
I don't know how I feel about that.

482
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,672
He's murdered
four innocent people

483
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,832
and he killed Zach Hamilton.

484
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,794
He's my son.
There's nothing you can do for him.

485
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,000
I can try putting him
back into a safe facility

486
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,396
where he can't hurt himself
or anyone else.

487
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,234
I'm not going to let you kill him.
I'm sorry.

488
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,116
You brought me into this.
I didn't know who he was then.

489
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,159
Try and understand,
my youngest son is gone forever.

490
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,759
Maybe I have a second chance
with Daniel.

491
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,677
You really believe that?
You have a son.

492
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,718
Wouldn't you believe it?

493
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,399
<i>This second chance she wants
could get us both killed.</i>

494
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,718
<i>For her own sake, I have to tell her
what she wants to hear.</i>

495
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,156
Fine, we'll do it your way. Just...

496
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,312
Help me find him.
Is there a way to reach out to him?

497
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,639
I don't know.

498
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,034
Think.

499
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,918
The Mama Cass song that he left
playing in your apartment...

500
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,879
What about it?
One of the few

501
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,596
happy memories I have with Daniel
as a boy was, every Saturday,

502
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,559
I'd take him to
the King's Bay Cafe in the marina.

503
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,151
There was a juke box there.

504
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,039
And Daniel would
always play that song.

505
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,960
Maybe it's more than a happy memory.
Maybe it's an invitation.

506
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,036
King's Bay Cafe. It's still there.

507
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,594
Saxon's been one step
ahead of us this whole time.

508
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,958
We know he stole
your computer files.

509
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,794
But how could he have known about
Zach Hamilton? We met him after that.

510
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,751
The detailed notes
you keep on your computer...

511
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,354
Yes?

512
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,638
I think Saxon's
been monitoring your laptop.

513
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,274
It wouldn't be hard.

514
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,713
You just need the right spyware.

515
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,436
We can use this. Write an entry
in your journal saying you're going

516
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,560
to King's Bay Cafe tomorrow morning.
You think he'll read it and go?

517
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,753
You said yourself he's been
trying to send you a message.

518
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,877
He wants to see you.

519
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,277
<i>I don't like deceiving Vogel,
but if it's the only way to get to Saxon...</i>

520
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,792
You had no choice, Dex.
You had to lie to her.

521
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,435
I just can't believe Vogel
still thinks her son can be helped.

522
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,115
Well, it's not that crazy.

523
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,872
After everything he's done.

524
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,990
You would
want to help Harrison,
wouldn't you?

525
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,756
Vogel pretty much
made the same point.

526
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,755
She's right. I mean, look at what
your own father did to protect you.

527
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,280
Right or not,
Saxon needs to be stopped.

528
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,477
I'm putting him on my table.

529
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,750
And how is Vogel
going to feel about that?

530
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,190
I can't worry about it now.
At least she'll be alive.

531
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,316
Well, you'll figure it out.

532
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,317
I'm glad you're here.

533
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,514
I wanna be able to keep
being here for you, Dex.

534
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,199
But?

535
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,630
But there's no life for me here
in Florida, we both know it.

536
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,477
I can have a life somewhere else
far away from here.

537
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,072
In Argentina.

538
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,671
Maybe we all can.

539
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,075
You and Harrison could
meet me there.
We can start over.

540
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,120
It would be hard on Harrison,
uproot his whole life.

541
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,398
At first, it might be,
but sometimes change
is a good thing.

542
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,831
Sometimes it can--
Yes.

543
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,798
Me, you, and Harrison.

544
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,676
We're gonna move to Argentina.

545
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,718
We'll make it work, Dex.

546
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,271
I can give my notice
at Miami Metro,
say I'm burnt out.

547
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,079
I'm taking Harrison
to travel for a while.

548
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,239
Only Debra will know the truth.

549
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,954
Lieutenant.

550
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,551
Have you heard anything on
the whereabouts
of Zach Hamilton?

551
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,800
Zach Hamilton? You made it pretty
clear that we back away from him.

552
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,880
I just got a call from his parents.
They haven't heard from him in days.

553
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,632
Did they file
a missing persons report?

554
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,439
They just did.

555
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,471
Look, in case he does turn up,

556
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,153
I wanna be the first to know.
I'll make sure of it.

557
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,555
Deb, thanks for coming in.
Yeah. What's up?

558
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,600
Welcome back
to Homicide, detective.

559
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,677
You'll earn your way back up.

560
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,312
You don't know how happy
this makes me. Like the family
coming together again.

561
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,558
We gotta celebrate.

562
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,920
Yeah.

563
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,560
What?

564
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,709
It's all happening so fast.

565
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,318
And? Would you rather
it happened slow?

566
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,793
I just need some time
to think about it.

567
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,794
What's to think about?
Thought this is what you wanted?

568
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,360
It is.

569
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,757
I mean, I thought it was.

570
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,914
I don't get it.

571
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,239
I just need a little time, you know?

572
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,239
Take all the time you need.

573
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,080
Hey.

574
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,233
Hold on to this.

575
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,556
Hey.
Heh.

576
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,913
I, uh, tried getting in touch
with Saxon,

577
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,356
but he's not answering his phone.

578
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,838
Went by his place. He cleared out.

579
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,790
Shit.
Yeah.

580
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,398
At least we're on the right track.

581
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,358
Yeah.

582
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,193
Good luck with that.

583
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,999
Deb.

584
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,078
I, uh, wouldn't have
gotten this far without you.

585
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,511
I'm glad I could help.

586
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,317
You cleaned.
A little.

587
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,314
Well, I hope I can still find shit.

588
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,878
I used to know where everything was.

589
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,274
Hungry?
Are you kidding?

590
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,799
Totally fair.

591
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,190
Well, I am gonna eat,
and I made enough for you too.

592
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,960
You going back?

593
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,952
How the fuck can I go back?

594
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,998
My brother's a serial killer.

595
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,796
And I have another one
hiding out in my house, eating salad.

596
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,993
Sorry.

597
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,155
It was stupid to think
that I could go back.

598
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,350
Well, I know a lot about
wanting things that you can't have.

599
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,752
I wish somewhere I'd learned
to take "no" for an answer.

600
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,118
Would have made my life
a lot easier.

601
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,953
But you didn't.

602
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,998
I'll take that one.

603
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,433
Right.

604
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,274
Well, it's just who I am.
And, uh...

605
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,909
Something tells me
you might be the same way.

606
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,037
Maybe that's the one thing
we have in common.

607
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,076
Heh. I can't believe
I'm eating food you made.

608
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,312
It's not bad, though, right?

609
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,474
No.

610
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,391
All right,
two-minute warning, Harrison.
Swim lessons are calling.

611
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,960
Almost done.

612
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,674
Sorry about this
police-protection business.

613
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,710
No, it's good.

614
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,718
I'm actually glad
that they're here.

615
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,709
If Hannah were to stop by,
poor Harrison would probably
run right to her.

616
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,434
<i>He's not the only one.</i>

617
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,476
Dexter,
hope I'm not intruding.

618
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,071
No, not at all. Come in.
All right.

619
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,120
What can I do for you?

620
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,670
Checking in,
making sure
everything's okay.

621
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,515
Yeah, everything's fine.
Well, good to hear.

622
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,596
I'm thinking the Hannah McKay threat
has pretty much died down.

623
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,837
Oh, yeah?
I mean, if she was here

624
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,960
I'm sure she's gone.
I'll recommend we pull off
your protective detail.

625
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,316
Okay.
All right.

626
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,599
And what's your name?

627
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,991
Harrison.
Harrison.

628
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,030
Huh. Is this your family?
Mm-hm.

629
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,473
Is this your daddy?

630
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,273
That's you, right?
Mm-hm.

631
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,551
Now, who's the pretty lady?

632
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,352
That's my mom.
Your mom?

633
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,673
Hey, why don't you go
grab your towel, bud.
Swim time.

634
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,957
Come on, let's go,
little shark man.

635
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,199
He lost his mother when he was a baby,
drawing her helps him feel closer to her.

636
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,272
Sure.

637
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,558
Well, we really do need
to get going.

638
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,798
Thanks for checking in.
All right, take care.

639
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,759
Hey, you got a sec?
Sure.

640
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,675
Closing the door.
That's never a good sign.

641
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,159
Hannah McKay dated your brother?

642
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,435
You didn't think to mention
that to me at all?

643
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,399
Never crossed your mind?
I didn't think it was important.

644
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,959
What else are you not telling me?

645
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,040
I don't know, but if I told you--
Drop the bullshit, Morgan.

646
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,759
What happened in the Keys?

647
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,440
You see her?

648
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,913
No.

649
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,196
I don't believe you.
You either saw her or your
brother told you to lay off.

650
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,033
What if he did?
What does it matter?

651
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,716
I'll give you 250,000 reasons why. But
clearly we have different priorities.

652
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,679
My brother? We do.
After all I've done for you,

653
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,116
I find it hard to believe
you could do this.

654
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,190
And maybe you need
to ask yourself if this is
the right job for you.

655
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,996
And if not, why don't you
get the fuck out.

656
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,710
Because I could use the office space
for somebody that gives a shit.

657
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,474
Oh, Dexter.

658
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,350
Sorry, I know I'm early.

659
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,437
I'd make you coffee,
but I only have tea.

660
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,193
That'll do.

661
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,995
I warn you,
it's strong.

662
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,677
I need all the help
I can get this morning.

663
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,559
Thanks.

664
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,312
Just so we're clear,
I'm meeting up with Daniel

665
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,235
and I'll lead him out of the cafe,
where you will sedate him.

666
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,552
And then we'll take him to a facility.

667
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,713
Every time I close my eyes,
I still see his face.

668
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,593
Daniel.
Yes.

669
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,754
Now to learn that he's alive
is so difficult to accept.

670
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,199
It is hard to believe.

671
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,871
But another part of me
knows it's true.

672
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,438
And I'm going to see him.

673
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,314
My son.

674
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,713

Where's Daniel?

He got away. That's why

Well, I consider myself warned.

I'm on my way with Hannah.

On your way?
Leaving Miami with her.
