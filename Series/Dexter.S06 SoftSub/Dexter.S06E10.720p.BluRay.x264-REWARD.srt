1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,384
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,593
James Gellar.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,387
The professor,
from the University of Tallahassee?

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,931
Gellar disappeared
three years ago after he got fired.

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,101
You can't get in touch with him,
because he went underground.

6
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,561
You're saying Gellar does the killing?

7
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,271
He's so much stronger than me.

8
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,481
Gellar is pulling you
toward the darkness, Travis,

9
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,649
not the light.

10
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:26,900
What you said to me

11
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,777
- made me think.
- Think what?

12
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,654
That I don't have to do what he says.

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,780
You're free.

14
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,490
So when Jessica Morris OD'd,

15
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,659
there was definitely someone
in that hotel room with her.

16
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,785
No doubt.

17
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,079
Then why is LaGuerta on my ass
to close this thing?

18
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,958
Oh, my God!

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,918
What the fuck?

20
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,963
Gellar hasn't seen wrath
until he's seen mine.

21
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,257
Travis.

22
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,266
Gellar.

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,143
He's been dead all along.

24
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,645
Travis acted alone.

25
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,981
He killed all those people.

26
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,602
Travis is the only Doomsday Killer,

27
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,063
and I've made a terrible mistake.

28
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,967
Same kill wound as the other victims,

29
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,469
which means...

30
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,765
Travis,

31
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,642
you killed Gellar?

32
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,839
Professor Gellar.

33
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,842
It is not true.

34
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,679
I did not kill you.

35
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,641
No! No.

36
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,977
You did, Travis.

37
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,355
It's time you faced
the truth about yourself.

38
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,983
He thinks Gellar is still alive.

39
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,735
Talking to someone
who isn't there, huh?

40
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,365
I remember, I came to your office.

41
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,368
I brought you
the John the Revelator sword.

42
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,537
Yeah, you'd stolen it.

43
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,373
University blamed me,
and they fired me.

44
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,583
I told you we needed it

45
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:59,214
because we are the two witnesses
from Revelation 11.

46
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,427
And I told you,
you were delusional and needed help.

47
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,388
I convinced you, I made you see

48
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,726
that we are the chosen ones.

49
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,439
I proved it to you
that you couldn't be hurt.

50
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,026
You stabbed me with the sword
three years ago.

51
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,695
And it couldn't pierce your flesh.

52
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,036
No.

53
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,623
I didn't do that.

54
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:41,089
You killed me, Travis,
and then you stuck me in the freezer.

55
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,469
That didn't happen.

56
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:55,479
It was him, the false prophet.
He killed you.

57
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,609
He's trying to stop
what God has commanded us to do!

58
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,446
And I will carry on without you.

59
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,574
I will finish what we started.

60
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,162
You were wrong, old man.

61
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,831
I'm in control now.

62
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:21,421
I will make new disciples
that will help me.

63
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,636
I don't need you any more.

64
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,474
Travis!

65
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,980
I have to stop him.

66
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,486
What happened to saving him?

67
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,531
Travis' dark passenger
is a part of him.

68
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,367
He can't be saved from it
any more than I can from mine.

69
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,373
I should've never listened
to Brother Sam.

70
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,874
He was right about one thing.

71
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,960
If you put your faith
in the wrong thing...

72
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,840
It can really fuck you up.

73
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,218
It was a mistake
to put my faith in Travis.

74
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,514
From now on,
I'm only putting my faith in myself.

75
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,522
It's Deb.

76
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,983
The cops are canvassing
a one-mile radius

77
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,193
around the IP address
from Gellar's blog.

78
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,361
They're closing in.

79
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,363
Maybe it's time to let this one go.

80
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,906
No.

81
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,326
The only way to kill a dark passenger
is to take out the driver.

82
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,247
After everything Travis
put me through, he's mine.

83
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,881
What are you doing?

84
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,341
If the cops find Gellar,
they'll focus the hunt on Travis,

85
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,427
it'll make it that much harder
for me to get to him.

86
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,931
I have to keep Gellar alive.

87
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,520
This is ghoulish, even for you.

88
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,232
Well, if the cops found
only Travis' prints,

89
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,942
they'd get suspicious.

90
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,362
This way, they'll find
Gellar's fingerprints, too.

91
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:20,040
Once I'm done here,
I just have to strike the kill room,

92
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:25,253
dump Gellar's body in the swamp
and head to Travis' motel.

93
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,130
You really think he's there?

94
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,966
No, but it might help me
get in touch with him.

95
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,927
What about that?

96
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:37,265
Well, it's helped me once.
Maybe I could use it again.

97
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,894
I'll stash it in the morgue
for a rainy day.

98
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,289
Gellar's blog.

99
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,291
You mean Travis' blog.

100
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,421
And now that I have Travis' laptop,
I can post as Gellar, too.

101
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,801
Batting the beehive?
You sure that's a good idea?

102
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,929
- Travis is unstable.
- I need him to engage.

103
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,976
This should get his attention.

104
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,498
I'll do anything for you, Dr Gellar.

105
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,419
It's cool what you're doing,
killing all those people.

106
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,587
That's creepy.

107
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,465
Hey, Gellar. It's the end times, huh?

108
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,844
Time for God's wrath?
Well, I got some God's wrath...

109
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,679
Right here!

110
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,434
Oh, yeah! End times! God's wrath.

111
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,193
Dr Gellar, I've read all your stuff.

112
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,196
But I felt like
you were just cracking the surface.

113
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,159
Glad to see you man up,
take the next step.

114
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,037
People are always being killed
in the bible,

115
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,875
but I'm with you till the end of days.

116
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,046
Doomsday Killers
in an abandoned church.

117
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,048
It's too fucking perfect.

118
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,517
Holy fucking shit. Is this it?

119
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,949
Are these Gellar's paintings?

120
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,118
It looks that way.

121
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,287
And this has to be

122
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,456
where Gellar and Travis
prepared their tableaus.

123
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,377
And held their victims.

124
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,631
Holy Christ on a stick.

125
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,426
Sorry.

126
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,401
Deb. You OK?

127
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,160
I'm fine. I just need to...
I gotta get some air.

128
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,429
What? What?

129
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,682
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.

130
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,442
Fuck!

131
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,623
The cops may have found his hideout,
but that won't stop Travis.

132
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,374
That's up to me.

133
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,628
I can't wait for him to
respond to the blog.

134
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,172
I have to figure out his next kill.

135
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,632
Dex, thank God you're here.

136
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,720
You OK? You look kind of sweaty.

137
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,556
I was fine until
I went into the church,

138
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,308
and all of a sudden

139
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,811
my heart started racing
and I couldn't breathe.

140
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,730
What the fuck?
I've been to a million crime scenes.

141
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,193
You remember that
Ice Truck Killer crime scene,

142
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,362
when he filled the motel room
with blood?

143
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,488
Yeah.

144
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,323
I had a panic attack.

145
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,033
Is that what this is? A panic attack?

146
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,410
I don't know. Maybe.

147
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,871
Well, what was yours about?

148
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,667
Reminded me of when my mom died.

149
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,712
Right. Fuck, obviously. I'm sorry.

150
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,089
It's OK.

151
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,675
But that makes sense,
you freaking out about your mom.

152
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,885
Me, panicking at a crime scene?

153
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,513
I'm the fucking lieutenant,
for Christ's sake.

154
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,391
I can't get all woozy
every time I go to a crime scene.

155
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,851
Maybe you're pregnant.

156
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,354
First of all, fuck you,
and second of all,

157
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,273
that would be
the immaculate fucking conception,

158
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,859
since I haven't been with anyone
since Quinn.

159
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,319
And lastly, fuck you.

160
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,822
Sounds like you're feeling better.

161
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,075
Let's go.

162
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,708
Travis and Gellar were
busy fucking bees, huh?

163
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,379
Makes you wonder where God was
when they were up to all this.

164
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,299
It was a mistake to think
that any of this religious garbage

165
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,342
could be an answer
to my dark passenger.

166
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:50,430
There's no solution here,
only clues to finding Travis.

167
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,682
The paintings...

168
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,519
We got the seven-headed serpent,
the four horsemen,

169
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,229
the angel.

170
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,981
Quinn, nice of you to join us.

171
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,319
The whore of Babylon,
the bowls of wrath

172
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,945
and the sixth one...

173
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,950
"Wormwood."

174
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,410
What the fuck's a wormwood?

175
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,120
Perhaps how I find Travis.

176
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,955
It's the next sacrifice.

177
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,125
Something about a star
that crashes down to the Earth

178
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,044
and poisons mankind.

179
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,380
Mankind?
Think this one will be bigger?

180
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,799
Well, they used one body
for the four horsemen,

181
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,468
they're not exactly going for literal.

182
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:32,639
All right, we need to find the who,
the what and the where of this ASAP.

183
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,225
Lieutenant Morgan.

184
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,227
Who are you going to poison, Travis?

185
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,438
Hey, Dex, there's blood.

186
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,945
Think these could be
from the bowls of wrath?

187
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,781
Could be. Let's test it against the
samples we took from the crime scene.

188
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:50,907
Thank you, sir.

189
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,124
Everything OK?

190
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,629
Matthews wants to set up a dinner
sometime this week.

191
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,381
Some place fancy.

192
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,511
It sounds like he's inviting you
into his inner circle.

193
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,055
Congratulations. You're big-time.

194
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,725
Yeah, right.

195
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,732
Now that I've done my job,
I can get on with my work.

196
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,735
That looks promising.

197
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,862
There's some more jars over there.

198
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,156
I'll get it.

199
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,709
"Travis Marshall."

200
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,012
Dr Benjamin Carlson, from Miami.

201
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,598
- What have you got?
- Just some paint thinner.

202
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,059
What the fuck is chlorpromazine?

203
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,228
Hey, Anderson.

204
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,522
OK, I'll get back at you.

205
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,441
Get a line on Dr Benjamin Carlson.

206
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,611
- I think Travis was a patient of his.
- Got it.

207
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,199
At least I still have Gellar's blog.

208
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,619
The prodigal son has returned.

209
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,706
"False prophet." He's talking to me.

210
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,626
"I listened to you once and
I made a mistake, but never again.

211
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,961
"I'm going to fix it."

212
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,297
What's his mistake?

213
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,302
Was it straying from Gellar
and listening to me?

214
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,061
- I'm psyched you could do breakfast.
- One of the perks of being a nanny.

215
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,813
Two hours off
while Harrison's in preschool.

216
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,273
I need a little advice.

217
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,817
I really want to show Dexter
my video game.

218
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,445
You know, find out what a real
blood spatter analyst thinks of it.

219
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,654
Good idea.

220
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,991
I have never seen
the guy make a mistake, like, ever.

221
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,286
- So you want to impress him.
- Yeah. I mean, he's...

222
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,121
He's kind of intense.

223
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,123
Babe, I don't know
what he's like at work,

224
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,585
but once you've seen him reading
Everybody Poops to Harrison,

225
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,962
you realise he's a big softie.

226
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,299
Just talk to him.

227
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,845
Lieutenant?

228
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,556
I have the personal effects
of Jessica Morris.

229
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,559
- You asked for them.
- Oh, right, fuck. The dead call girl.

230
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,689
Just put them in my office.
I'll look at it later.

231
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,857
OK.

232
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,319
Still looking into that case.

233
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,696
We've been through this.
I'm just doing my job.

234
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,199
You're not. That's the problem.

235
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,496
I need to figure out
what Travis needs to fix,

236
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,834
what exactly is wormwood
and who will his victim be?

237
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,587
OK, people, big day,
so let's get started.

238
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,713
Are you running the briefing?

239
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,008
Doomsday is our most
important investigation,

240
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,510
and the more I help out,

241
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,388
the more time you'll have
to focus on other cases.

242
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,764
You're the boss.

243
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,602
- You OK?
- Peachy fucking keen.

244
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:10,940
So I understand that we found
Doomsday's hideout. Where was it?

245
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,276
- In an abandoned church.
- Great.

246
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,069
Bring me up to speed.

247
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,405
I found a hidden cellar.

248
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,740
I was sure it was gonna be
filled with body parts,

249
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,702
but there was just some church crap
and an old freezer.

250
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,245
Sorry to disappoint you.

251
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,038
Dexter? Masuka?

252
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,918
The place was covered in prints
from Travis and Gellar.

253
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,129
- What about the blood in the jars?
- What jars?

254
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,964
We found bloody jars
in the trash. Dex?

255
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,924
Same type as Travis',

256
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,303
and it matched some of the samples
we took from the bowls of wrath.

257
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,764
I was thinking Holly Benson,
the girl who escaped.

258
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,224
She thought they made her drink blood.

259
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,435
Maybe it was from those jars.

260
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,105
Holly Benson didn't escape.
Travis let her go because of me.

261
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,816
Anderson, what do you got?
Anything else?

262
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,278
Could she be the mistake
Travis was talking about?

263
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,283
The mistake he needs to fix.

264
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,121
Travis is already
back on Gellar's path.

265
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,666
Will Holly be his victim
in the wormwood tableau?

266
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,255
If I find Holly,
hopefully I'll find Travis.

267
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,469
Dexter. Hey!

268
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,638
Jamie and I went to
your doughnut shop this morning...

269
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,306
Not now, Louis.

270
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,701
It's... It's you.

271
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,328
And you're Doomsday Adam.

272
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:53,000
It's just I... I never imagined...
Steve Dorsey.

273
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,502
This is such an honour.

274
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,922
It's nice to meet you, too, Steve.

275
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,716
Do you mind if I come in?
I'm kind of being hunted.

276
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,219
Oh, right! Yep, please. Come on in.

277
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,891
Beth, get in here and meet our guest.

278
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:13,437
Well, I hope he's hungry.
I have snacks.

279
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,190
Oh, my...

280
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,608
How about that?

281
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,862
Travis Marshall.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Beth.

282
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,199
Oh, I know who you are.
I've seen you on the news.

283
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,411
Is Professor Gellar coming, too?

284
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,204
No. Not today.

285
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,125
We were just so confused by...
by his blog.

286
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,127
He said
this was all the devil's errand.

287
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,087
Professor Gellar didn't write that.

288
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,215
It was a false prophet trying to
throw a monkey wrench into God's plan.

289
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,425
I knew it.

290
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,552
Well, please sit down.

291
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:51,058
Sorry I just have
Velveeta and crackers.

292
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,978
Steve's been out of work lately and...

293
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,065
I know how it is.

294
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,610
Sometimes it feels
as if God has forgotten us.

295
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,156
But I'm here to tell you
that your time has come.

296
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:11,620
The faithful will be given
untold riches in God's new kingdom,

297
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,958
if you trust and obey.

298
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,255
We're ready, Mr Marshall.
We'll do whatever you say.

299
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,591
Good.

300
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,303
But first, I need to know
that you're fully committed.

301
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,852
Holly Benson's apartment,
the victim who would've been.

302
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,481
I can stake the place out,
wait and see if Travis shows up.

303
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,614
Aren't you putting a lot of eggs
in the Holly basket?

304
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,116
I'm trusting my instincts.

305
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,036
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

306
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,044
Doesn't look like she's here.

307
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,881
What if Travis got to her first?

308
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,967
There's no signs
of a struggle or a break-in.

309
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:13,140
Not an ounce of makeup.
No hairbrush, no toothbrush.

310
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,519
She could've packed a bag,
gone out of town.

311
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,645
She still won't be safe.

312
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,106
Travis is determined to find her
wherever she is.

313
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,859
Which is why I have to make sure
I find her first.

314
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,321
Come on, Holly.
Give me something I can use.

315
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,033
Something else.

316
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,328
Who would she be with?
Family? Friends?

317
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:35,871
Boyfriend.

318
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,042
I bet he knows where she is.

319
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,962
Peter Grant.

320
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,256
I'm guessing this is him.

321
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,532
Hi, I'm looking for Peter Grant.

322
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,783
Oh, my dad.

323
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,160
Is he at home?

324
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,537
Does it look like
I have parental supervision?

325
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,250
He's off in Spain. Or Portugal maybe.

326
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,004
Can you tell me if he knows
a woman named Holly Benson?

327
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,257
She's my dad's "sex-retary". Why?

328
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,095
I'm a friend.
Can't seem to get in touch with her.

329
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,390
Yeah, well, no offence,
but your friend is a total slam pig.

330
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,310
Right. Slam pig.

331
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,687
Any idea where I can find her?

332
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,856
- I don't know. The yacht maybe?
- Yacht?

333
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,233
My dad has this boat
that he refuses to get rid of.

334
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,527
Probably some kind of fuck pad.

335
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,863
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

336
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,198
On the water somewhere.

337
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,450
Thanks.

338
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,036
If you do find her, though,
will you give her a message for me?

339
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,586
Nice kid.

340
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,506
But if she's right and
Holly's out on a boat alone,

341
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,633
she's a sitting duck for Travis.

342
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,385
Time to play "find the fuck pad".

343
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,721
He's in Spain with his wife.

344
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,767
If he was lying, would he let me
crash on his boat while he's away?

345
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,104
Who asked you anyway? I got to go.

346
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,019
Hello?

347
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,320
Who's there?

348
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,031
Hello, whore.

349
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,506
We're going for a little cruise.

350
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,072
What the fuck?

351
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,200
- You're a fucking asshole.
- I'm an asshole?

352
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,287
Doomsday's out there
searching for his next victim

353
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,080
and you're asleep on the job.

354
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,917
- What are you, fucking super cop?
- No. I give a shit.

355
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,295
Maybe you should try it for once,

356
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,005
instead of going out drinking
every night

357
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,590
and coming to work while messed up.

358
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,217
- Give it a fucking rest, man.
- So what?

359
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,345
Your girlfriend broke up with you.
Get over it.

360
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,847
Fuck that. I'm just being
a single guy having fun.

361
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,515
- You should try it for once.
- Hey.

362
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,060
Any leads on a wormwood victim?

363
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,354
We're going over Gellar's and Travis'

364
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,980
friends, relatives and acquaintances.

365
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,483
Figure the last two victims
were personal.

366
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,776
Good thinking. Keep at it.

367
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,569
Any luck on the Dr Carlson front?

368
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,446
Turns out he passed away
a couple years ago,

369
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,741
but I got a court order releasing
Travis Marshall's psych eval.

370
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,701
Drugs were anti-psychotics.

371
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,287
Apparently he had
some breaks with reality.

372
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,999
Jesus. Violent tendencies
since childhood, a lack of empathy,

373
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,460
master manipulator,
delusions of grandeur.

374
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,129
It makes sense.
Fucker wants to end the world.

375
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,298
- What's that?
- Travis' psych file.

376
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,217
More like psycho file.

377
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,511
The guy was a complete sociopath.

378
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,097
Shit, it says here the shrink thought
he killed his parents.

379
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,640
I thought it was a car accident.

380
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:09,061
Or not. Apparently Travis attacked
his father and grabbed the wheel,

381
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,105
turned it right into a tree.

382
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,941
Any signs of parental abuse?

383
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,445
It's so weird, his sister seemed
so convinced he was a good guy.

384
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,572
Maybe she didn't know.

385
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,409
Anything's possible.

386
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,996
He's been a monster from the start.

387
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,960
He's using Gellar
to justify his kills.

388
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,921
A lot of people justify their kills.

389
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,173
You mean me?

390
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,510
You justified my kills.
You taught me the code.

391
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,012
I kept you from becoming your brother.

392
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,765
Making me a killer
was the best you could do.

393
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,642
You were already gonna be a killer.

394
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,561
I guess we'll never know.

395
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,773
There it is.

396
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,942
The fuck pad.

397
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,777
The Ricochet Rabbit.

398
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,660
- Where you going?
- I know this marina.

399
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,792
I had a freak-out
at a crime scene today.

400
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,252
Is that unusual?

401
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,921
Yes, that's unusual.

402
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,010
Seen a lot of fucked-up shit,
and it usually just rolls right off.

403
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,136
But not today.

404
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,015
You know what's even weirder
is the stuff that usually fucks me up

405
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,434
- didn't even faze me today.
- Like what?

406
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,812
Like LaGuerta trying to swing
her dick around in the briefing room.

407
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,980
I handled that like a champ.

408
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,190
Well, that's fantastic.

409
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,028
So why did I lose my shit
when I walked into that church?

410
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,449
Did the church have
some kind of significance for you?

411
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,117
I don't know.
The only time I go to church

412
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,161
is to go to a funeral, you know?

413
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,999
My mom, my dad,
boyfriends, my sister-in-law.

414
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,336
So you associate church with loss.

415
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,048
I guess.

416
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,052
Whatever. Doesn't matter.

417
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,929
My brother showed up,
he calmed me down.

418
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,138
Dexter?

419
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,682
Was it something that he said?

420
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,269
I guess.

421
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,359
Not really.
It was more just him being there.

422
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,364
Come to think of it,

423
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:29,701
every time the shit hits the fan,
I go to him.

424
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,871
I've even moved in with him
a few times.

425
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,540
- He's your safe place.
- Yeah.

426
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,917
Since we were kids.

427
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,296
I used to have these nightmares,

428
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,885
and I would sneak into his room
and I'd curl up on the floor.

429
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,223
He wouldn't even know I was there.

430
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,894
Is that weird?

431
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,481
I don't know. Do you think it's weird?

432
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,071
Not really. He's my brother.

433
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,950
I think it's sweet.

434
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,459
What are you gonna do?

435
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,088
You mean, what are we going to do?

436
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,548
We're going to kill her, Beth.

437
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,968
He's testing our faith.

438
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,095
Like Abraham.

439
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,099
You've got it easy.
He was asked to sacrifice his son.

440
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,226
You just have to pitch in
and help kill a whore.

441
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,561
I don't think I can do that.

442
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,276
I understand, Beth.

443
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,238
But you'll be purifying her sins.

444
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,868
Her soul will know paradise
because of your strength, your love.

445
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,040
Come on. Let's show her some love.

446
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,574
Hey, Dexter!

447
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,702
Louis got here a little early
to pick me up for our date.

448
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,872
You have a date?
I was hoping you could stay.

449
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,415
Sorry.

450
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,876
I don't supposed
you'd wanna have your date here?

451
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,504
We can't.

452
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,382
Louis bought us tickets
to go see The Avett Brothers.

453
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,801
Can't go another time?

454
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,177
They're only playing tonight.

455
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,184
Hey, Dexter,

456
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,689
I was wondering if maybe you could
take a look at my game before we go.

457
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,190
I mean, if it's not a bad time.

458
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:09,194
- I should probably put Harrison down.
- I got him. You take it easy.

459
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,114
Looks like you had a long day at work.

460
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,618
Daddy.

461
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,665
So...

462
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,792
Looks like you have a minute.

463
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,043
Looks like I do.

464
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,462
Awesome.

465
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,674
I'll just...
I'll bring the game up on my laptop.

466
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,346
So, the game is about homicide.

467
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,516
And I know there's, like, a million
video games out there about that.

468
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,476
But the secret to this game is,

469
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,145
and I haven't even
told Jamie this yet,

470
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,938
but in my game,

471
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,859
you can be the serial killer.

472
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,070
What?

473
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,575
See, you have these character choices.
You can be

474
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,455
Dahmer, Jack the Ripper,
the Bay Harbour Butcher.

475
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,291
I am the Bay Harbour Butcher.

476
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,500
So,

477
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,628
what do you think?

478
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,549
I think this is offensive.

479
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,971
Who would choose to be
a serial killer?

480
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,352
Well, I mean,
it's like a vicarious thrill.

481
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,897
"Vicarious thrill"?

482
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,943
How could you possibly know
what it's like to take a life?

483
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,737
Why would you even want to?

484
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,659
It's a bad idea. Do something else.

485
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,293
So?

486
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:56,093
I'm not... I'm not feeling well.
I think I should go home.

487
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,178
And miss the show?

488
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,472
I'm sorry. I'm not...

489
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,058
I'm not up to it.

490
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,689
Still need a sitter?

491
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:21,284
This is the spot, but no boat.
Which means Holly is probably on it.

492
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,162
Unfortunately, Travis may be with her.

493
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:30,001
Only one way to know for sure,
check the security camera footage.

494
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,539
I guess we all tell lies
about ourselves.

495
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,251
Security video archives.

496
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,235
Travis.

497
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,998
It's got sea tracker
and the password is...

498
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,250
Neptune.

499
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,252
Thank you, Mr Grant.
How can I help you tonight?

500
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,630
Yeah, I kind of have a problem.

501
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,798
My girlfriend and I got into a fight

502
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,218
and she took off with my boat,
and I don't know where she went.

503
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,012
I have the coordinates right here.
I'll notify the police.

504
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,431
Any way around that?

505
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,475
Sorry, sir, it's protocol.

506
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:12,187
I know. It's just, I don't think
my wife would be too thrilled

507
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,772
to find out about my girlfriend.

508
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,442
I understand.

509
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,738
She's got a bit of a jump on you.
I've got her location right here.

510
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,281
This is wormwood.

511
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,619
I thought it would be bigger.

512
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,746
- So we're ready?
- Not yet.

513
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,541
We have to cover our tracks.
Police will find this place.

514
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,584
What difference does it make?

515
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,253
The world's ending in four days.
It doesn't...

516
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:22,299
It will only end
if we complete our work.

517
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,426
That can't happen if we're in jail.

518
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,469
God never said this would be easy.

519
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,036
Jessica Morris.

520
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,123
Guilt trip from beyond the grave.

521
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,849
Sal's flowers. Sal speaking.

522
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,061
Hi, this is Lieutenant Debra Morgan
from Miami Metro Homicide.

523
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,230
I need to know if you recently
delivered flowers to a Jessica Morris,

524
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,566
sent by someone with the initial "T".

525
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,234
Jessica Morris.

526
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,613
Here it is, dozen red,
delivered morning of the 18th.

527
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,199
That was the day she died.
Who sent them?

528
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,452
Oh, my God. It was Thomas Matthews.

529
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,997
I'm sorry,
did you say Thomas Matthews?

530
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,084
What's his phone number?

531
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,922
305-454-8537?

532
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,259
Jesus Christ. Thank you.

533
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,815
Hey, Deb, what's up?

534
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,775
I have a situation. Can we talk?

535
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:04,943
What is it?

536
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,569
Not on the phone.
When are you coming in?

537
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,991
Not for a while. I have some
personal stuff to take care of.

538
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,743
- Before you get mad...
- It's OK.

539
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,578
- It is?
- Yes.

540
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,622
You have your own life to deal with.

541
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,668
It seems to be filled with a fuck load
of mysterious personal stuff,

542
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,670
but whatever.

543
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,506
Well, thanks for being
so understanding.

544
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,049
Well, I'm sorry I wasn't before.

545
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,926
You've got my back when it counts.
I know that.

546
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,052
OK.

547
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,806
By the way, you were right about
that whole panic attack thing,

548
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,932
so thank you.

549
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,937
I'm gonna get off the phone now
so that I can have another one.

550
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,564
I'll see you when you get in, OK?

551
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,541
Louis. You're here early.

552
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:05,003
I couldn't sleep.
I got a lot on my mind.

553
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,964
I think I found a new lead.

554
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:13,094
This guy, Doomsday Adam.
He keeps posting on Gellar's blog.

555
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,930
To all of professor Gellar's
faithful followers,

556
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,143
I can now tell you without a doubt
that his prophecies are real.

557
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:23,646
My wife Beth and I have been chosen
to be soldiers in the final battle,

558
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,901
and with God's help,
we will prove worthy.

559
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,110
This will be our last post.

560
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,988
See you in paradise.

561
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:37,076
You think maybe Gellar and Travis
got to this guy and enlisted his help?

562
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,830
- I know it's a long shot, but...
- It's worth checking out.

563
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,625
You think you could track down

564
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,793
Doomsday Adam's
real name and address?

565
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,796
His name is Steve Dorsey.

566
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,924
Here's his address.

567
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,596
Good work.
I'll call Quinn, go check it out.

568
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,936
At least someone around here
appreciates me.

569
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,191
Hey, it's Quinn.

570
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,945
For the fourth fucking time,
answer your phone.

571
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,657
I'm not calling again. Just get here.

572
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,972
Sergeant Batista,
Miami Metro Homicide.

573
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,140
Are you Mrs Beth Dorsey?

574
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,143
- Yes, that's right.
- Is your husband home?

575
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,980
No, he's not.
Is there something wrong?

576
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,232
I'd like to ask you a few questions
if you don't mind.

577
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,403
Are you aware that your husband
has been posting on a blog

578
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,154
by a Professor Gellar?

579
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,576
Gosh, maybe you should talk to him
when he gets back.

580
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,661
How about we start with you
and we take it from there?

581
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,850
Found the fuck pad.

582
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,936
Travis.

583
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,356
Why is he in a hazmat suit?

584
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,606
You're too late.

585
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,651
Wormwood can't be stopped.

586
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,444
No!

587
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,409
This was supposed to set things right.

588
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,415
So you're telling me
that this was all a joke?

589
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,126
The videos your husband posted
as Doomsday Adam,

590
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,253
the whole "chosen" thing?

591
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,798
My husband has kind of
a strange sense of humour.

592
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,341
Yeah, I would say so.

593
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,134
Steve's been out of work lately.

594
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,304
He was hoping
the videos might go viral

595
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,182
and get him some attention,
and I just wanted to be supportive.

596
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,811
Mrs Dorsey, these murders are
nothing to be joking around about.

597
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,981
Your husband wasted
valuable police time and resources

598
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,359
that could've been spent
catching the Doomsday Killers.

599
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,277
I am so sorry.

600
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:02,198
I will talk to Steve,
tell him to get those videos down.

601
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,783
This will not happen again.

602
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,618
I'd appreciate that.

603
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,885
If this was all a joke,

604
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,180
why do you have all these books
by Professor James Gellar?

605
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,312
What are we gonna do? He's a cop.

606
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,899
He doesn't enforce God's law, we do.

607
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,028
It's a sign.

608
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,242
"Miami Metro Homicide."

609
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,870
That's where
God wants us to stage wormwood.

610
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,001
Nothing to tell you
what wormwood is going to be.

611
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,838
I don't care what it's gonna be,
I wanna know where it's gonna be.

612
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,424
I have to fix this.

613
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,878
Holly.

614
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:42,590
But this doesn't look like wormwood.
She was stabbed, not poisoned.

615
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,550
You're still too late.
She's already dead.

616
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,053
Travis is gone
and you killed the wrong guy.

617
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,262
When you gonna let this go?

618
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,640
When I kill Travis.

619
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,433
Are you sure you can make that happen?

620
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,143
Isn't that what you taught me to do?

621
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,478
I didn't have a choice.

622
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,147
According to you,
I don't have one either.

623
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,900
Well, you have a choice to make
right now.

624
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:04,987
- Maybe you should call the police.
- I told you, I don't call the police.

625
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,739
Travis is mine.

626
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,283
Dexter, don't make this personal.

627
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,085
Methylphosphonyl difluoride?

628
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,586
And isopropyl alcohol.

629
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,964
Mix them together, they're lethal.

630
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,467
Poison gas. This is wormwood.

631
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,680
This could kill
who knows how many people.

632
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,932
Dexter, you have to call the police.

633
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,768
Why would I listen to you?
I'm only here because of you,

634
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,937
now I'm supposed to
trust your judgement?

635
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,772
- I'll make my own decision.
- Dex.

636
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,190
Leave me alone!

637
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,616
Brother Sam said it.

638
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:54,787
Sometimes you have to surrender
to something greater than yourself.

639
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,875
911. What's your emergency?

640
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:03,296
The Doomsday Killers are hiding out
on a yacht at 114 Bleaker Canal Road.

641
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,672
And who's calling, please?

642
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:08,551
I'd rather not leave my name.
Hurry. They have poison gas.
