1
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:10,843
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,052
Travis,

3
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,804
you killed Gellar?

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,307
If the cops find Gellar,
they'll focus the hunt on Travis.

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,601
This way, they'll find
Gellar's fingerprints, too.

6
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,521
He recently delivered
flowers to a Jessica Morris.

7
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,815
- Who sent them?
- Thomas Matthews.

8
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,400
Jesus Christ.

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,111
Every time the shit hits the fan,
I go to him.

10
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,446
- Dexter?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,864
He's your safe place.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,035
- "Wormwood."
- What the fuck's a wormwood?

13
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,204
This is wormwood.

14
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,373
I think I found a new lead.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,501
My wife Beth and I have been chosen
to be soldiers in the final battle.

16
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,336
I'll call Quinn, go check it out.

17
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,133
You're too late.
Wormwood can't be stopped.

18
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,343
Dexter, you have to call the police.

19
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,596
Hurry. They have poison gas.

20
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,600
"Miami Metro Homicide."

21
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,561
That's where
God wants us to stage wormwood.

22
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,557
What are we waiting for?

23
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,850
Those guys.

24
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,312
That doesn't look good.

25
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,607
We got an anonymous tip
that DDK is using this boat.

26
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,651
- Plus, there's poison gas.
- Poison gas?

27
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,029
I know, right? That's all we need.

28
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,906
Part of me was hoping that
this tip was bogus,

29
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,658
but the uni that we sent down found
a body floating near the boat,

30
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,160
so here we are.

31
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,953
All clear!

32
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,998
What do you got?

33
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,834
Chemical traces
of two toxic substances.

34
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,462
Put 'em together,
you got something a lot worse.

35
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,630
Poison gas?

36
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,923
Release it in the right place,

37
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,967
say, a closed environment,
like a bus or a building,

38
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,677
you could kill a lot of people.

39
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,095
Fuck me.

40
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,268
That's Holly Benson.

41
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,104
That's the girl DDK kidnapped
and let go.

42
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,567
Multiple stab wounds...
Looks like they weren't done with her.

43
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,027
There's more inside.

44
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,032
This is where
they were handling the stuff.

45
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,992
From the looks of it,
they knew what they were doing.

46
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,745
Wormwood, the next tableau,

47
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,914
is supposed to represent
a meteor falling to Earth.

48
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,249
And poisoning mankind.

49
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,377
- Could this be wormwood, right here?
- I doubt it.

50
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,921
These people weren't killed by gas.

51
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,966
This looks like where
wormwood is being prepared.

52
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,219
So what's DDK planning to do?
Release poison gas on people?

53
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,139
We can't just sit on this.
We have to alert Homeland Security.

54
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,809
- Should I notify LaGuerta?
- Do it.

55
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,687
What's his story?

56
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,356
Upper abdominal stab wound.

57
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,609
Looks like it happened right here...

58
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,863
Bled out, fell to this position.

59
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,326
Expired.
There are fingerprints on the knife.

60
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,412
Travis' fingerprints,

61
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,872
since it's the knife Travis used
to kill Holly.

62
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,877
Holy shit, Steve Dorsey.
It's Doomsday Adam.

63
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,046
- Oh, wow.
- What?

64
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,799
I found a video blog post
by him yesterday.

65
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,718
He was going on about how he'd been

66
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,845
chosen to be a soldier
in the final battle.

67
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,597
- Why didn't you tell anyone?
- I did. I told Sergeant Batista.

68
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,975
He was going to Dorsey's apartment
to check it out.

69
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,811
Where is Angel?

70
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,861
You don't understand, but you will.

71
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,448
When this is over
and the new world begins,

72
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,782
you will wish you had faith.

73
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,077
I do have faith. I believe in God.

74
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,497
Well, then you better start
praying to him and fast.

75
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,223
Look at me.

76
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,394
There must be something
very special about you, Beth,

77
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,230
because it is no accident
that you are here.

78
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,609
Out of all the people in the world,

79
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,571
God chose you to carry out his will.

80
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,825
God reserves a place for those
that sacrifice themselves

81
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,370
in his name, and it is a place

82
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,832
too beautiful to describe.

83
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,336
And I envy you,

84
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,797
because you get to see it
before I can.

85
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,843
- Now, did you pray?
- Oh, yes.

86
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,764
Then we're ready.

87
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,979
Everything is in place.

88
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,441
After I do the switch,
how long before it goes off?

89
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,985
A couple of seconds
to let the chemicals mix.

90
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,988
Now, remember,
when you enter the building,

91
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,117
you'll see a door with a card reader.

92
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,828
You will take the sergeant's keycard
and buzz open the door.

93
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,330
It's the only way
to bypass the metal detector.

94
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,834
All right, OK. I understand.

95
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,796
This is a great day.

96
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,259
It's the beginning of the end.

97
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,642
Yeah?

98
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,144
It's me. I've been calling you
for five minutes.

99
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,728
Yeah, I just heard it ring.

100
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,272
- Is Batista with you?
- No.

101
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,149
Why the fuck not?

102
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,192
I figured I'd meet him
at the crime scene, OK?

103
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,111
- What, he isn't there?
- No.

104
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,071
Louis said that
he went to Steve Dorsey's

105
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,449
to check out a Doomsday suspect.

106
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,826
You're his partner,
you should know that.

107
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,162
Yeah, I missed a few calls
from him this morning.

108
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,830
Jesus Christ, Quinn!

109
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,707
What the fuck's going on, Deb?

110
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,502
Doomsday Adam, the guy
that he was going to check out,

111
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,670
just turned up dead.

112
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,299
OK, I got the address.
I'm turning around.

113
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,717
Send backup.

114
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,637
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

115
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,140
Fuck!

116
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,976
Dispatch,
this is Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

117
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,227
I need all available units

118
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,939
at 1203 North Gordon
for a probable Code 40.

119
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,317
Copy that.

120
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,279
You think Angel ran into Travis?

121
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,491
Well, it sure as fuck
wasn't Steve Dorsey.

122
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,118
I'm sure he's OK.

123
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,162
If Travis is there,
we've gotta catch him

124
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,456
before he does God knows what
to how many people.

125
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,209
- Hello?
- It's me.

126
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,335
I made it.

127
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:09,297
- Are you in Homicide yet?
- I'm on my way right now.

128
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,841
Remember, it's Lieutenant Morgan

129
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,677
that is leading
this attack against us.

130
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,762
You must get to her.

131
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,097
I will.

132
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,431
God bless you, Beth.

133
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,851
I'll see you on the other side.

134
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,279
Can I help you?

135
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,365
I have information regarding
the Doomsday Killer case.

136
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,993
Fill this out, and we'll send
an officer out to interview you...

137
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,454
No! I have to speak
to Lieutenant Morgan in person.

138
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,999
Tell her it's wormwood,
the next tableau.

139
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,419
- "Wormwood"?
- Tell Lieutenant Morgan that.

140
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,546
Lieutenant Morgan's
out in the field right now,

141
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,673
- I'm not sure when she'll be...
- I'll wait.

142
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,176
Take a seat.

143
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,246
I've kept you alive
in case we ran into problems.

144
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,249
Everything's going perfectly.

145
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,419
So you don't need me any more.

146
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,004
No.

147
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,342
I'd still like to get that prayer.

148
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,137
Go ahead. Pray.

149
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,398
Your time is up.

150
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,856
I'm all right. It's Travis Marshall.
He went out the window.

151
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,191
All units, we got Travis Marshall

152
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,568
heading west on foot on McNulty,
he's armed.

153
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,029
- I'm OK, go after him.
- Fuck you.

154
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,325
We have a tentative match
on the knife fingerprints.

155
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,743
- They're Travis'.
- I don't get it.

156
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,870
If Doomsday Adam was working
with Travis and Gellar,

157
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,038
then why kill him?

158
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,124
Maybe he was done with him,

159
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,209
and the knife was
his severance package.

160
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,920
Tough gig.

161
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,384
Homeland is putting
their regional teams on alert,

162
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,885
and they're sending
agents to the station.

163
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,721
Sounds like
they want to take over the case.

164
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,348
Well, it wouldn't fucking surprise me.
It's what the Feds do best.

165
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,729
Morgan.

166
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,980
Angel's OK.

167
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,400
- Thank God. What happened?
- Travis Marshall had him.

168
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,902
He took off on foot.

169
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,280
Got a head start,
but I got unis setting up a perimeter.

170
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,031
Order up as many men as you need.

171
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,952
- Angel?
- He's fine.

172
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,830
Did we find Travis?

173
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,000
No, he got away, but there's
still a chance we might catch him.

174
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,753
At least Angel's OK.

175
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,338
Thank God we got that anonymous tip.

176
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,465
She's right.

177
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,843
If I hadn't brought in the police,
Angel would most likely be dead.

178
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,681
You know that dead call girl,
Jessica Morris?

179
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,641
What about her?

180
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,852
I think I know who the john was.

181
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,354
- Who?
- Matthews.

182
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,940
- Matthews?
- The fucking Deputy Chief.

183
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,193
I don't know what the fuck to do.

184
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,530
He was one of Dad's best friends,
he was practically my mentor.

185
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,532
I can't just bust him.
I owe him more than that.

186
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,118
- You want to know my opinion?
- Yes! That's why I'm talking to you.

187
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,871
Put this on the backburner
until Travis is in custody.

188
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,498
You need to focus on DDK.

189
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,541
I'm having dinner
with Matthews tonight.

190
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,002
I can't just sit there
and talk about the salad.

191
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,712
OK, so bring it up,

192
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,632
but maybe Matthews has a reason
for what he did.

193
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,217
Yeah, ass.

194
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,053
No, I mean about leaving the scene.

195
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,015
There are worse secrets
you can have, Deb.

196
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,311
I'm just saying, maybe
you should keep an open mind.

197
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,563
Yes, I get what you're saying.

198
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,905
The hunt for Travis has hit a wall,
but maybe there's a way around it.

199
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:54,666
Steve Dorsey, a.k.a. Doomsday Adam,
Travis' recently deceased acolyte.

200
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,835
There might be something
in your history

201
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,670
that can lead me to Travis.

202
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,338
Or lead us to Travis,

203
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,715
since anything I find,
I'll report to Deb.

204
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,594
Unfortunately, Dorsey has led
a squeaky clean life.

205
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,432
Mostly.

206
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,853
He's a potential mass murderer with
eight outstanding parking tickets.

207
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,279
Hey, any update?

208
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,780
No, nothing yet,

209
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,241
but search teams
are expanding the perimeter.

210
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,953
Which means Travis Marshall
most likely got away.

211
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,789
- We don't know that.
- I'm not trying to be critical,

212
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,457
I'm just trying to get
a lay of the land.

213
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,294
Homeland Security
will be here within the hour.

214
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,628
They'll need an update,

215
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,923
and they've requested
all relevant materials on DDK.

216
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,551
Which means Travis probably isn't
the only thing I've lost today.

217
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,556
However it shakes out,
we'll handle it.

218
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,148
- Excuse me, Lieutenant?
- What is it?

219
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,484
There's a woman here who says she has
important information about DDK.

220
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,278
Which is?

221
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,738
She insists on speaking
to you personally.

222
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,073
She says it has to do
with something called wormwood.

223
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,744
- Wormwood?
- Yeah.

224
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,997
How the fuck
would she know about that?

225
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,999
- Send her in.
- Yes, ma'am.

226
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,011
What did stalkers do
before the Internet?

227
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Is this wormwood?

228
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,543
Thank you, again, for coming.

229
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,131
Get everyone out of here!

230
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,347
Evacuate the building! Go! Now!

231
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,537
Dex, she's gone. Let's go.

232
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,332
I'll give you everything you need.

233
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,585
I just need to go check on my brother.
I'll be right back, OK?

234
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,467
Homeland Security?

235
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,595
Yeah, you were right.
They want everything we have on DDK.

236
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,764
It'll slow us down to a crawl.
Is he all right?

237
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,057
I'm fine.

238
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,434
I love you,
but I wasn't talking to you.

239
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,645
I mean, he was lucky.
The exposure was very mild.

240
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,481
But this gas attacks
the upper respiratory tract.

241
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,609
You could get nosebleeds
followed by extreme dizziness,

242
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,611
especially after physical exertion.

243
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,905
- You need to get to the hospital.
- Got it.

244
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,492
- You gonna go to the ER?
- On my honour.

245
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,661
Stop with the sarcastic bullshit,
all right?

246
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,289
No bullshit, I will. Really.

247
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,124
OK.

248
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,628
How did you know
that crazy bitch was a threat?

249
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,298
Just luck, I guess.

250
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,675
Fuck luck, I'll take you.

251
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:39,432
Dex, you saved a lot of lives today.
You saved my life.

252
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,978
I'd never let anything happen to you.

253
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,982
Come here.

254
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,626
It's just for a little while, OK?

255
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,004
Daddy's gonna miss you
every second of those 48 hours.

256
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,344
If Travis can attack Miami Metro,
he can find his way to me.

257
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,678
I can't take that risk.

258
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,306
I've always known
something could happen to me,

259
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,017
but now it's more than my life
I have to worry about.

260
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,854
Hey, thanks for coming back.

261
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,650
I knew I shouldn't have left.

262
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,904
Sorry to ruin your date
and your weekend.

263
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,531
It's OK.

264
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,200
It's not every day
your boss becomes a bona fide hero.

265
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,078
Yeah, well,
I'm not feeling too heroic right now.

266
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,373
I'm starting to feel the side effects
that that doctor was talking about.

267
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,000
I realised
I'm probably not best person

268
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,836
to be in charge of this little guy.

269
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,380
Well, it's no problem.
You just get some rest.

270
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,382
I'll keep him out of your hair.

271
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:58,177
Better idea, I booked you guys a room
at The Ritz, in Coconut Grove.

272
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,387
Sweet!

273
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,347
Have you picked your animal yet?

274
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,684
Must've slipped my mind.

275
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,270
At the pageant,
every child is paired with a parent

276
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,063
to bring
the story of Noah's Ark to life.

277
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,733
I think Harrison's a little scared
of the whole thing.

278
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:18,114
Don't worry, buddy.
Daddy will be there. I promise.

279
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,116
And you should pick
one of the good animals soon,

280
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,910
or you'll end up being
rats or turtles or something.

281
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,540
King of the beasts.

282
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,917
Something feels right about that.

283
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,760
Travis has one tableau left,

284
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,430
who knows how many people
he'll try to kill next.

285
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,226
And he might go after Debra again,
just like he did with Holly.

286
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,938
So you're changing your plan
about working with Miami Metro?

287
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,275
Miami Metro has been sidelined
by Homeland Security.

288
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,945
It's time for my dark passenger
to take the wheel again.

289
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,949
According to the seven keys,

290
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,785
the next tableau will be
the lake of fire.

291
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,665
"And Satan, who is the beast,

292
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:15,129
"was thrown into the lake of fire,
which is the second death."

293
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:20,343
It says, the beast gathers the kings
of the Earth and their armies,

294
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,970
to prepare for war against God.

295
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,474
And he's responsible
for killing the two witnesses.

296
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,775
Gosh...

297
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,035
You really should have
gone to the ER, Dex.

298
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,955
I don't have time.
I have to find Travis.

299
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,999
You have no leads.
He could be anywhere.

300
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,550
It's time for a Hail Mary.
I'm gonna make Travis come to me.

301
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:07,515
Maybe it takes a beast
to catch a beast.

302
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,395
That's for you.

303
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,692
Pick up an OpenX today, and never...

304
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,943
You don't need help operating...

305
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,904
I'm standing outside
the Miami Metro headquarters,

306
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,949
where earlier today,
a local woman, Beth Dorsey,

307
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,577
attempted a poison gas assault
on the station's Homicide Department.

308
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,914
Channel 9 has learnt no officers
were hurt in the brazen attack.

309
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,083
The only casualty was Miss Dorsey.

310
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,303
It's OK. It's... It's OK.

311
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,388
It's gonna be OK.

312
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,310
Her sacrifice will be enough.

313
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,230
It must be what God wanted.

314
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,237
It's up to me now.

315
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,576
My time has come.
I must pass the test.

316
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,938
Half the stuff on here
costs more than my rent.

317
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,316
My treat.

318
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,612
For a job well done
despite some enormous challenges.

319
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,530
Yeah, it would be a lot easier

320
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,532
if Homeland Security
wasn't breathing down my neck.

321
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,451
Well, just don't let them
become a distraction.

322
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,704
I know only too well how easy it is
to get bogged down in your job.

323
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,295
That call girl from the hotel

324
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,631
is a perfect example
of what I'm talking about.

325
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,218
I think I'm gonna have the duck.

326
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,639
I have to admit, I was a bit puzzled

327
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,349
when I heard
you were still looking into that.

328
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,226
What kind of wine goes with that?

329
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,729
You know,
some cases are better left alone...

330
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,855
Fuck.

331
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,400
I can't do this.

332
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,196
- I know you were one of her clients.
- Excuse me?

333
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,823
Jessica Morris.

334
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,325
I found a card for flowers

335
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:35,162
sent to her the morning that she died,
from Thomas Matthews.

336
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,418
Were you the one in her hotel room
the night she died?

337
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,675
White.
You should order the white wine.

338
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,051
Sir...

339
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,431
You can talk to me.

340
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,187
You don't know what it's like, Debra.

341
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,608
Since Maggie died...

342
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,530
I've been alone for a very long time.

343
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,205
I went to the hotel. We...

344
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,043
And when I came back into the bedroom,

345
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,088
I found her lying on the floor.

346
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,468
I saw the drugs.

347
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,472
I tried to revive her,

348
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,558
but...

349
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:45,399
she just wouldn't breathe.

350
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,444
911 wouldn't have helped.

351
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,404
She was dead.

352
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,075
And I couldn't change what happened.

353
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,917
So...

354
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,420
What do you intend to do?

355
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,593
I don't know.

356
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,473
Debra, I've known you
since the day you were born.

357
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,602
You cried in my arms
the night your father died.

358
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:26,607
I've always looked out for you,
and I made you lieutenant,

359
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,651
and now I'm the one
who needs a favour.

360
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,696
I want to help you,

361
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,033
but what do I tell that girl's father?

362
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,536
You tell him you found nothing.

363
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,499
She overdosed.
No one needs to know any more.

364
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,835
It's not gonna help anyone.

365
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,798
It'll only hurt me.

366
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,472
I'll call Mr Morris in the morning.

367
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,727
Good.

368
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,986
Jeez.

369
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,821
You sure it's safe to be here?

370
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,657
Relax, sidekick.
Hazmat gave brass the all-clear.

371
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,325
I think I prefer "intern".

372
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,536
Bukkakee, bukkake.

373
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,914
The point is, me as boss needs you
in Evidence for the next few days.

374
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,584
We're suffering
from a serious case of backlog.

375
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,002
I'm on it.

376
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,170
Whoa, Amazon, 9 o'clock.

377
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,173
OK, everyone, listen up.

378
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,010
This is agent Hubbard
from Homeland Security.

379
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,178
They'll be taking over
our DDK investigation.

380
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,847
Temporarily.

381
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,350
Until my team and I can assess
all known associates of the Dorseys.

382
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,852
So what,
we're just supposed to sit on our ass

383
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,687
for the next four days
until the world ends?

384
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,855
You want to take that one?

385
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,733
I understand your frustration,

386
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,068
but this police station
came under a gas attack yesterday.

387
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,238
In the government's eyes, that poses
a potential on-going terrorist threat.

388
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,199
Steve and Beth Dorsey
weren't terrorists.

389
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,744
They were nut-jobs
following a bigger nut-job.

390
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,204
Let me and my team
be the judge of that.

391
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,416
I promise, this will go faster
if everyone cooperates.

392
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,752
They all hate this.
Can't say that I blame them.

393
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,212
Please make yourself available
for interviews.

394
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,589
I'd like to start
with Sergeant Batista,

395
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,133
since he was the last one
in contact with the suspects.

396
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,259
Can I set up in your office?

397
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,137
Right this way.

398
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,643
This whole thing's fucking bullshit.

399
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,898
They have one hand tied behind
their backs, but I don't.

400
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,566
Not when I have Gellar's.

401
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,115
- Hey.
- Not a good time, Quinn.

402
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,410
Yeah, I know you got that interview,
but this'll just take a sec.

403
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,080
Not now.

404
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,541
Look, I'm so, so sorry.

405
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,212
Look, you saved my life,

406
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,755
and for that
I will always be grateful.

407
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,883
But this is a job of trust.

408
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,429
And I can't have
a partner I can't trust.

409
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,438
You've been talking a lot
about your department this morning,

410
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,107
but how are you doing
since the attack?

411
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,276
I'm fine.

412
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,571
Pretty much, I mean...

413
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,118
I'm worried about Dexter.
He wouldn't go to the hospital.

414
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,786
He keeps saying he's OK.

415
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,122
You must be very proud of him.

416
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,791
He saved everyone's life.

417
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,627
Including mine.

418
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,258
It all happened so fast, you know?

419
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,301
If that canister
had gone off any sooner...

420
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,349
Your brother holds a very
important place in your life.

421
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,644
He's really all I have.

422
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,774
You think I'm crazy now,

423
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,484
I can't even imagine

424
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,653
what a fucking mess my life would be
without him.

425
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,321
I don't think you're crazy.

426
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,490
Can I get that in writing?

427
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:09,163
From what I do know about you,
you feel things very deeply.

428
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,165
Like your bond with Dexter.

429
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,208
Where do you think that stems from?

430
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,714
Maybe because
he's the only guy in my life

431
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,342
that I haven't dumped, or cheated on,
or...

432
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,553
...isn't dead.

433
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,972
Is it possible
that your feelings for Dexter

434
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,141
are the reason that
you've chosen men in the past

435
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:33,854
who have been
either inappropriate or unavailable?

436
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,649
Because they're what? Not Dexter?

437
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,696
That's insane.

438
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,072
Is it?

439
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,869
He's my brother.

440
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,038
Yet you're not biologically related.

441
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,545
- So?
- It would be understandable,

442
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,715
given the past traumas
the two of you have shared,

443
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,344
for you to develop
complex feelings for him.

444
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,389
Why the fuck are we
even talking about this?

445
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,725
You mentioned Dexter.

446
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,771
He comes up in these sessions a lot.
Aren't you curious as to why that is?

447
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,398
He's a huge part of my life.

448
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,858
That's it.

449
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,944
End of story.

450
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,070
You getting upset?

451
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,863
Fuck, yes, I'm becoming upset,

452
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,074
because you're making it sound like
I want to...

453
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,411
...be with him or something.

454
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,622
Well, do you?

455
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,927
Look...

456
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,430
I love my brother,

457
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,060
but I am sure as shit
not in love with my brother,

458
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,603
if that's what you're getting at.

459
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,108
We're done here.

460
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:06,113
Travis got everyone's attention
by staging his tableaus.

461
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,782
It's time I got his
by staging one of my own.

462
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:15,163
I stashed Gellar's hand in the morgue,
now I need it back.

463
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,249
Hey, Dexter!

464
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,626
I was looking for you in your lab.

465
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,086
Heading home.

466
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,340
Looks like you got a minute.

467
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,260
Haven't we done this before?

468
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,014
I just wanted to thank you

469
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,350
for being so honest with me
the other day about my video game.

470
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,102
Glad I could help.

471
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,521
You just made me realise that
I have spent my whole life

472
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,940
on the sidelines,
playing make-believe games,

473
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,819
and now I want to get out there
and make my life count for something.

474
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,030
- OK, I really should...
- Yeah, go. Go.

475
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,034
All right.
I hope you're feeling better.

476
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,982
I have no idea where Travis is hiding
or what he's up to.

477
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,998
The lake of fire is his next tableau,

478
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:25,252
but mine doesn't require a name,
just the right message.

479
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,727
And the best way to get Travis
to pay attention to that message

480
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,520
is if it comes from me.

481
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,605
Sorry about this.

482
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,375
The hand is bad.

483
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,628
I've had my tongue in places
that smelled better.

484
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,757
It was on ice for three years
along with the rest of Gellar.

485
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:15,594
Decomposition will accelerate faster
the longer it's in the sun.

486
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,889
Looks like the cut was made just above
the palmar carpal ligament.

487
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,601
666, the sign of the beast.
What's up with that?

488
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,311
Travis will know.

489
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,273
- What do we know?
- Street cleaner called it in.

490
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,983
I checked security footage.

491
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,319
If Travis and Gellar did this,
they were out of view.

492
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,904
Well, Travis worked in the museum,

493
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,655
so he would know
every inch of the square.

494
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,158
- Hey, guys.
- What is it?

495
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,329
All right, cue the music,
hold the applause.

496
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,789
Shoot him.

497
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,290
The hand belongs to Gellar.

498
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,917
What?

499
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,169
It's a positive match.

500
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,338
Why the fuck would Gellar
cut off his own hand?

501
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,507
Well, the cut looks
to have been made post-mortem.

502
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,258
Gellar's most likely dead.

503
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,595
So student offs professor? Why?

504
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,639
Good way to get rid of an accomplice.

505
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,434
- I mean, look at Steve Dorsey.
- Travis is a psycho.

506
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,521
He may not even be sticking
to the Enesserette game plan,

507
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,692
cos if this is supposed to be
the lake of fire, I don't get it.

508
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,030
Let's have the unis sweep the area,
maybe we can turn up Gellar's body.

509
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,491
It might lead us to Travis.

510
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,036
Not likely.
I left Gellar in pieces in the swamp.

511
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,544
Right on time.

512
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,879
My tableau should send Travis
right to me.

513
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,719
Now he just needs to know where to go.

514
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,138
...if they have any leads at all.

515
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,557
And now we go to Museum Square
for this breaking news.

516
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,058
Authorities are still baffled

517
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,728
by what appears to be yet another
bizarre end of days tableau

518
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,147
plaguing the city of Miami.

519
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,150
We warn you,
these images are very graphic.

520
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,402
Investigators made
a gruesome discovery

521
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,404
early this morning in Museum Square.

522
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,740
Blood covered the angel statue
in the square's fountain,

523
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,493
and also contaminated
the fountain's water.

524
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,204
A human hand was found
nailed to the angel's chest.

525
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,707
On the forehead, the numbers 666...

526
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,750
- The beast.
...were also written in blood.

527
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,087
Channel 9 has learnt that the hand
depicted in these startling images

528
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,257
may in fact belong to
one of the suspected Doomsday Killers,

529
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,550
Professor James Gellar.

530
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,387
No. No. No!

531
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:30,061
Mark this day, witness.

532
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,522
The end is not upon the world,
it's upon you.

533
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,276
You know who I am. You know what I am.

534
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,906
The beast is coming for you.

535
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,786
"Slice of Life."

536
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,293
Close the door.

537
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,341
- Everything...
- God damn it, Debra.

538
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,969
I thought we had an understanding.

539
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,805
- I'm a little confused here.
- Don't get cute.

540
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:50,308
Chief Lane has somehow come
to learn about my indiscretions.

541
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,435
He's asking me to retire!

542
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:57,315
Is this how you repay me
after all I've done for you?

543
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,359
I was at a crime scene all day.
I haven't talked to anyone.

544
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,819
It doesn't matter.

545
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,988
You just wouldn't let this thing go!

546
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,204
Your father would be so disappointed.

547
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,875
So would your late wife.

548
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,548
All due respect,
I didn't do anything wrong here.

549
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,174
No?

550
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,053
What you did was screw over
the only person that can protect you

551
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,140
from a job
that you are clearly not ready for.

552
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,686
Good luck.

553
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,522
You're gonna need it.

554
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,158
You wanted to see us?

555
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,748
- Is everything OK?
- Agent Hubbard just called.

556
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,000
Homeland Security has concluded

557
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,085
that the Dorseys
have no ties to terrorists.

558
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,754
No shit.

559
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,256
They want to be kept in the loop,
as does the FBI,

560
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,592
- but we're back in control.
- That's good news.

561
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,594
It would be
if I hadn't just read your reports

562
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,596
on what happened
at Steve Dorsey's apartment.

563
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,266
What the fuck?

564
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,769
Seriously, I should
write both of you up.

565
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,062
That was all my fault, Deb.

566
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,855
It's Lieutenant.

567
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,774
And I got that.

568
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,113
You guys, we have two fucking days
to catch Travis Marshall

569
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,200
before he does God knows what
in something called the lake of fire.

570
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,078
We just got this case back.

571
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,913
I cannot afford
to have this department

572
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,290
falling down around me right now, OK?

573
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,459
No more fuck-ups.

574
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,296
We get Travis Marshall, you got it?

575
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,304
I made sure the Slice of Life
was in the video I sent Travis.

576
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,807
He'll be expecting
to find me on my boat.

577
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,643
Not this one.

578
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:01,481
The owners use it twice a year,
but I only need it once.

579
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,567
For Travis' final tableau.

580
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,492
Captain!

581
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,662
Morgan.

582
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,331
You going to pick out blinds
for Matthews' office?

583
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,584
- You heard the news.
- From Matthews.

584
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,961
Because he thought
that I ratted him out,

585
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,587
but we both know that
it was you, right?

586
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,132
Rumours do have a way of spreading.

587
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,259
So Matthews comes to you
and asks for help,

588
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,510
and you go along with it,

589
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,679
until Jessica Morris' father shows up.

590
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,347
Now, is that about the time
that you realised

591
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,765
you could stab him in the back?

592
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,600
Interesting theory,

593
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,937
but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

594
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:44,858
Fucking used me to take him out
and help yourself.

595
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,277
Don't be so naive, Morgan.

596
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,946
This is how the game is played.

597
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,032
Did you really think that
Matthews made you lieutenant

598
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,159
because you were ready?

599
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,536
It was all politics to get back at me.

600
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,372
And that was his last mistake.

601
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,375
How do you sleep?

602
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:08,673
Very well, knowing that from now on,
you'll do what I say when I say it,

603
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,550
or I'll find a lieutenant who will.

604
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,893
So LaGuerta's going on and on, and...

605
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,229
I'm dying inside.

606
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,399
And all of the sudden,
I have one of those...

607
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,819
those moments where
everything sort of comes together.

608
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,906
- An epiphany.
- Exactly.

609
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:39,704
And I realise that I have completely
fucked myself into a corner.

610
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,832
What would you have done differently?

611
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,376
Ignored a grieving father?

612
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,254
Kept a case closed
that didn't sit right with you?

613
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,425
No. And fuck no.

614
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,270
And I was trying
to give you a compliment.

615
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,272
You've grown so much.

616
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,024
You made the best
out of a bad situation,

617
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,108
because now you see...

618
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,279
Everything isn't always
so black and white.

619
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,786
Did you try the noodles?

620
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,088
You have always blown at that.

621
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,802
And you're so good? Show me.

622
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,139
It's this finger, dumbass.

623
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,562
- Like this?
- Yeah.

624
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,814
Your hand's shaking, what is it?

625
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,944
This.

626
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,118
One minute, everything's perfect.

627
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,998
And the next minute...

628
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,335
The next minute what?

629
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,462
You're rushing off.

630
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,507
Deb...

631
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,012
I am always with you.

632
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,938
Right here.

633
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,653
Oh, fuck.

634
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,673
It worked.

635
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,893
Oh, no. Not now.

636
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,410
You didn't really think
you could foil God's plan, did you?

637
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,208
This was how
it was always meant to be.

638
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,546
I will wait on a pillar of light
for God's return.

639
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,967
And you'll burn in eternal hellfire.

640
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,305
It is finished.

641
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,823
I thought
I was headed in the right direction.

642
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,534
My dark passenger
back behind the wheel.

643
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,662
But if I was so sure
I knew where I was going,

644
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,208
how did I get so lost?
