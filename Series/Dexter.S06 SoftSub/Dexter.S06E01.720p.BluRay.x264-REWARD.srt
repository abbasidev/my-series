1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,135
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,763
People think it's fun
to pretend you're a monster.

3
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,099
Me, I spend my life
pretending I'm not.

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:20,269
What made me the way I am
left a hollow place inside.

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,106
So I've become an expert
at blending in,

6
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,983
camouflaging myself.

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,360
They make it look so easy,

8
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,612
connecting with another human being.

9
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,322
I love you.

10
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,367
But if I could have feelings at all,
I'd have them for Deb.

11
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,786
Why is it we never
talk brother-sister stuff?

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,664
To be a brother, to have a friend...

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,666
I only have one person
I can trust any more.

14
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,876
You.

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,335
To have a family...

16
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,296
- Rita's pregnant.
- That's so great!

17
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:51,133
If you play a role long enough,
really commit,

18
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,385
does it ever become real?

19
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,139
Any time you let someone get close,
it ends badly.

20
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,974
I will fuck you back!

21
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,184
Harry was right.

22
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,147
- I've never felt this.
- You've never had a son before.

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,857
You wanna see him come into the world.

24
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,860
Yes. I've never wanted
anything so much in my life.

25
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,155
Sure, I'm still who I was, who I am.

26
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,074
Question is, what do I become?

27
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,035
Camouflage is
nature's craftiest trick.

28
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,996
Arthur's terrorised them
into maintaining his cover.

29
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,165
They're nothing but human shields.

30
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,167
That's what happens to people
who live with a monster.

31
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,335
I'm nothing like him!

32
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,337
My family is nothing like that.

33
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,340
I have to be the one to kill him.

34
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,383
I have a family, too, Arthur.

35
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,349
I thought I could change what I am,
keep my family safe.

36
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,559
But it doesn't matter what I do.

37
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,895
I'm what's wrong.

38
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,565
So what's your plan here?

39
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,860
I can't get revenge for Rita's death.

40
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,863
But I can help Lumen
avenge what was done to her.

41
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,079
In her eyes, I'm not a monster at all.

42
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,415
I don't feel it any more.

43
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,917
I'm so sorry.

44
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,877
Don't be sorry your darkness is gone.

45
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,047
I'll carry it for you. Always.

46
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,050
She made me think,
for the briefest moment,

47
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,219
that I might even
have a chance to be human.

48
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,723
But wishes, of course,
are for children.

49
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,720
There are times in our lives
when everything seems to go wrong.

50
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,183
When, despite our best efforts,
and for no apparent rhyme or reason,

51
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,893
tragedy strikes.

52
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,272
911, what's your emergency?

53
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,858
- I've been stabbed.
- I understand, sir.

54
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,860
Can you tell me your location?

55
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,529
Please, I need help.

56
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,533
Team 42, we have a possible stabbing
in the warehouse district.

57
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,535
Please stand by
for approximate address.

58
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,556
And there are other times
when everything goes

59
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,890
just perfectly.

60
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,893
That's how the last year
has been for me.

61
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,610
Hello, Ben.

62
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,738
Roger.

63
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,491
You know it's wrong
what you've been doing.

64
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,076
What's going on?

65
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,495
How do you know our names?

66
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:36,126
Helping some of your patients live
and letting others die.

67
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,421
Making them die

68
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,466
so you could harvest their body parts.

69
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,926
The police arrested
the emergency room doctor

70
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,930
who was selling them,
and that closed the case.

71
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:53,477
But I knew they must've had
a regular supplier.

72
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,438
So I did my research,
and here you are.

73
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,942
- We were just trying to...
- No!

74
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,987
You were just trying to
help yourselves make some money.

75
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,869
That's all.

76
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:31,807
I've learned that periods of darkness
can overcome us at any time.

77
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,519
But I've also found
that I'm able to endure,

78
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,146
overcome,

79
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,983
and in the process, grown stronger,

80
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,152
smarter,

81
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,487
better.

82
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,827
All is well in my little corner
of the world.

83
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,031
- Dexter!
- Hey, Jamie.

84
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,700
It's not what you're thinking.

85
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,201
Hey, Dex.

86
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,078
It's really not what you're thinking.

87
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,789
Angel kept an eye on Harrison
while I took a really quick swim.

88
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,875
Thank you.

89
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,752
This was a great idea.

90
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,131
Buying the apartment next to yours?

91
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,550
Because now you can slip in and out
of your place, day or night,

92
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,718
without anyone knowing.

93
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,387
I never really thought about that.
We just needed the extra space.

94
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,764
How's my sister working out for you?

95
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,433
Great. Harrison loves her.

96
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,893
And I love him.

97
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,812
- He get to sleep OK?
- Oh, yeah. He's sleeping like,

98
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,606
you know, a baby.

99
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,899
Except he's not a baby any more.

100
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,234
He's got his first preschool
interview in the morning.

101
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,111
They grow up fast.

102
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,155
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Thanks.

103
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,990
- I guess we should be leaving.
- Yeah.

104
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,408
Unless you need me to stay.

105
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,119
I'm gonna be up studying all night,
so I can do that here just as easily.

106
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,746
No, no. You should go, I'm good.

107
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,081
- OK.
- But I will need you

108
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,291
to stay late tomorrow night.

109
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,336
Your high school reunion,
already on my calendar.

110
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,755
- Thanks.
- Bye.

111
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,758
- But leave the shirt on.
- Angel.

112
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,144
Hey, buddy.

113
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,314
Big day for you tomorrow.

114
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,652
We're all moving forward.

115
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,701
At Our Lady of the Gulf,

116
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,620
we like to create enough structure
for our children,

117
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,832
so that they feel safe, and enough
freedom so that they feel challenged.

118
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,961
- OK.
- Attendance in our preschool

119
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,463
guarantees your child admission
to our secondary school,

120
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,841
which, as I'm sure you know,
is a highly esteemed feeder school

121
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,636
to some of the finest Ivy League
universities in the country.

122
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,137
Harvard, here we come.

123
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,891
And, as I'm sure you know, we have
a very rigorous admission process.

124
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,562
Not everyone that applies
to Our Lady of the Gulf gets in.

125
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,064
Mr Morgan,
you were referred to us by...

126
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,067
- Angel Batista.
- Sergeant Batista,

127
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,860
at the police station, where we work.

128
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:37,200
We being the people that protect you
in case something bad happens.

129
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,079
Sergeant Batista's daughter went here,
and he recommended the school.

130
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,833
I remember Angel.
His daughter did very well here.

131
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:50,088
So you are Catholic as well,
Mr Morgan?

132
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,257
Actually, I'm not.

133
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,175
And though it does
have a certain appeal,

134
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,720
I'm not sure it's right for everyone.

135
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,099
- So, Protestant?
- No.

136
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,684
- Jewish?
- No.

137
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,687
- Muslim?
- Nope.

138
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,773
Any religious affiliation?

139
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,191
No.

140
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,694
What do you believe in, Mr Morgan?

141
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,742
Nothing. I don't believe in anything.

142
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,877
Harrison really seemed to like it
in there. He didn't wanna leave.

143
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,837
I think he just liked the cookies.

144
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,756
And he already made some friends.

145
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,721
You're not really sold on this place,
are you?

146
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,890
Not completely.

147
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,016
Is it because of the religious thing?

148
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,684
- Partly.
- What you said in there,

149
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,853
do you really believe that?
You really believe in nothing?

150
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,191
Yeah, I suppose I believe
in a certain set of principles.

151
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,068
What kind of principles?

152
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,404
A set of rules on how to
conduct myself in the world,

153
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,907
so that I don't get into trouble.

154
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,413
I'm not the most religious person
in the world, I mean,

155
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,376
Mom practically had to drag me
to church, but seriously?

156
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,169
- What?
- A set of rules to follow,

157
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,962
so you don't get in trouble?

158
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,714
Sounds like something
I might teach a puppy.

159
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,466
Is that so bad?

160
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,760
Just sounds kind of cold and empty.

161
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,223
Does it?

162
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,557
Yeah.

163
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,560
I don't know, you can believe
whatever you wanna believe.

164
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,604
Or not believe
whatever you wanna believe.

165
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,524
But it's not just about you any more.

166
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,485
You're a father. What about Harrison?

167
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,570
You have to think about
what you want him to believe.

168
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,114
Right.

169
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,879
Anyway, I'll see you
back at the station

170
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,006
for LaGuerta's little costume party.

171
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,550
OK.

172
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,637
To be honest,
I've given a lot of thought

173
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,806
to what I don't wanna
pass on to Harrison,

174
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,474
namely my dark passenger,

175
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,893
but very little about
what I do want to pass on.

176
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,566
Good afternoon to my colleagues

177
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,029
at Miami Metro Homicide,
family, friends,

178
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,948
ladies and gentlemen of the press.

179
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,951
Today we join
in witnessing the promotion

180
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,371
of one of Miami Metro's finest,
Maria LaGuerta.

181
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,708
- The fuck have you been?
- I had to run some errands.

182
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,960
- What errands?
- When she joined our ranks,

183
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,338
she was appointed to the department
12 years ago in June.

184
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,923
Why do you smell like old lady?

185
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,718
I was at the mall.
They sprayed me with cologne.

186
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,511
The mall?
The only thing you smell like

187
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,263
when you leave the mall is a corn dog.

188
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,766
It was too early for a corn dog.

189
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,104
Not always an easy task for a uniform.

190
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,276
They're looking
awfully lovey-dovey up there.

191
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,445
- You think the two of them are...
- Gross, no way.

192
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,030
Matthews and LaGuerta hate each other.

193
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,240
Oh, yeah, just like you and Quinn
used to hate each other?

194
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,366
And now you've been
living together for...

195
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,078
...I'm proud to also consider
my amiga cubana.

196
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,373
See what I mean?

197
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,335
They do seem a little too friendly.

198
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,506
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Captain LaGuerta.

199
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,260
One more person moving forward.

200
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,104
Thank you, thank you.

201
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,497
- Captain LaGuerta.
- Deputy Chief.

202
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,960
That was a beautiful speech.

203
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,546
I was touched. It was almost as if...

204
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,464
Almost as if
you'd written it yourself?

205
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,841
Yeah.

206
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,011
Well, I couldn't
leave anything to chance.

207
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,763
But you were very convincing...

208
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,640
OK, cut the crap, Maria.
Give me the book.

209
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,310
You know,
you're lucky I'm the one who found it.

210
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,355
Anybody else would've
thrown you to the wolves.

211
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,566
Can you imagine the headlines?

212
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,319
"Deputy Chief Matthews
featured prominently

213
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,114
"in Miami madam's little black book."

214
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,700
Please, don't talk
about integrity to me.

215
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,952
You divorced that husband of yours

216
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,912
as soon as you realised
he was no career asset.

217
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,497
That is not true.

218
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,874
- And you know that.
- Save it.

219
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,003
I'm not interested.

220
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,426
Watch your step, Maria.

221
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,761
You're playing with the big boys now.

222
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,229
All right, keep it tight, everybody.
Come on, come on, come on.

223
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,231
Stay with me, everyone. Stay with me.

224
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,900
Take a very reverent look around.

225
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,737
This is the home
of Miami Metro Homicide.

226
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,157
And this is the heart of it all,
my lab.

227
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,910
Who are you,
and why are you in my way?

228
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,246
I'm Peter, I'm one of
Professor Masuka's students.

229
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,206
- Professor Masuka?
- I'm teaching

230
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,499
both the extension and online classes

231
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,460
in forensic pathology
at the university.

232
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,756
Class, this is Detective Morgan
and Detective Quinn.

233
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,508
And that is Sergeant Batista.

234
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,887
And this is the future
of forensic science.

235
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,307
Well, the future looks very bright.

236
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,650
All right, let's go, let's go.
Right this way, right this way.

237
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,652
Next stop is my lab,
and then the spatter room,

238
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,780
and then what's always
the last stop, the morgue.

239
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,160
Maybe I should teach a class.

240
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,995
Yeah, on how to rob a cradle.

241
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,455
Hey, I'm twice divorced.
Leave me alone.

242
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,169
- Who are all those people?
- The future of boring.

243
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,880
Nice jacket.

244
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,716
You getting all duded up
for the big high school reunion?

245
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,511
- Twenty years.
- Speaking of schools,

246
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,763
have you heard from
Harrison's preschool yet?

247
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,556
- Not yet.
- Tick-tock, Dex.

248
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,933
OK, OK.

249
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,852
I can't believe
you're going to your reunion.

250
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,230
You're, like, the only person
that hated high school more than me.

251
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,067
It'll be good to catch up
with some of the old friends.

252
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,445
You're hoping to get laid.

253
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,324
You got me.

254
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,872
Janet Walker.

255
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,125
But I knew her as Janet McKellen.

256
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,884
I didn't exactly
have friends in high school,

257
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,803
but she was always nice to me.

258
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,015
She and Joe Walker were voted

259
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,350
"most beautiful couple"
our senior year.

260
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,395
Unlike Janet,
Joe hardly knew I existed.

261
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,190
Joe was captain of the football team.

262
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,067
A real bruiser on the field.

263
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,987
But I remember him
for the bruises he left on Janet.

264
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,990
They got married
straight out of high school

265
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,283
and moved to Virginia.

266
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,494
I'd almost forgotten about her

267
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,372
until I noticed her obituary
in the alumni newsletter.

268
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,251
She was found dead three years ago,
an apparent suicide.

269
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,503
But there was blood
underneath her fingernails.

270
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,757
How could it get there

271
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,633
if her fingers were
wrapped around the grip,

272
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,093
pointing away from her body?

273
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,636
It must belong to someone else.

274
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,347
Perhaps someone she scratched
while putting up a fight.

275
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,775
Perhaps someone who
will be at the reunion tonight.

276
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,440
Take us closer to the edge.
They like shallow water.

277
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,446
You know, Florida water snakes

278
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,116
don't lay eggs.

279
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,204
They give birth to live young.

280
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,915
Around 20 or 30,

281
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,084
sometimes even more.

282
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,549
There.

283
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,634
And she's pregnant.

284
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,887
Makes her fat and slow.

285
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,441
Well done.

286
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,865
There's a lot of them inside.

287
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,326
All you're gonna need is seven.

288
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,175
High school,
a small world unto itself,

289
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,094
combining all the warmest elements
of a federal work camp

290
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,430
with those of
a third-world poultry farm.

291
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,141
It's a miracle I graduated
without killing anyone.

292
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,155
I was invisible in high school.

293
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,450
Just a shadow
passing through the hallway.

294
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,539
- Dexter!
- Alan.

295
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,209
Best biology lab partners ever,
right, dude?

296
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,127
Oh, you bet, dude.

297
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,505
Man, I never saw anyone
dissect a foetal pig as fast as you.

298
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,217
You're, like, the first student
ever to ask for seconds.

299
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,885
That was a great learning experience.

300
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,220
Obviously.

301
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:26,140
Now you're some
hotshot blood spatter guy.

302
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,808
- It's awesome!
- Thanks.

303
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,561
Hey, we should check out
all these activities

304
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,147
- they've got planned for us.
- Yeah, you go on ahead.

305
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,194
I'm only here for one activity.

306
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,657
Hey, there he is.

307
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,991
And there he is.

308
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,162
Still the centre of attention.

309
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,916
I'm finally gonna get some use
out of my class ring.

310
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,502
I sharpened part of it,
so that I can prick Joe's hand

311
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,088
when we shake
and draw a small drop of blood.

312
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,009
- Dexter!
- Mindy.

313
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,928
Hey, my date to the spring formal.

314
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,347
- Which was held right here.
- What a night that was.

315
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,183
Hey, I'm so sorry
to hear about your wife.

316
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,185
Oh, thanks.

317
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,022
Yeah, that was a horrible thing,
but... You know.

318
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,524
Right, of course.

319
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,401
What about you?
Did you ever get married?

320
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,612
I did. Honey...

321
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,197
This is my wife Heather.

322
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,576
You're the last man that I ever dated.

323
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,955
Well, I'm glad if I was of any help.

324
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,291
Dexter, hey, Mr Blood Spatter guy.

325
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,251
I read about you in the paper.
Lookin' good.

326
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,877
- Thanks.
- Dexter?

327
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,300
- Trisha.
- You look fantastic.

328
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,302
I can't wait to sit down and catch up.

329
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,721
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Right now?

330
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,640
There's some people
I need to say hello to first.

331
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,060
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, good to see you.

332
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,396
Dexter Morgan. Wow!

333
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,273
Looks like someone's been working out.

334
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,108
Yeah, doing my best.

335
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,573
Dexter! So sorry about your wife.

336
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,825
- We read all about it.
- Yeah.

337
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,618
Thank you.

338
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,375
You've had a personal tragedy.

339
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,754
Unlike everyone else, you look better
than you did 20 years ago,

340
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,963
and you've got a cool job.

341
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,052
Put all those things together,
and it makes you...

342
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,763
- Popular.
- How's it feel?

343
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,560
- I hate it.
- Come on, it's great.

344
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,729
Most of the people here
would love to be popular.

345
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,482
Most of the people here don't
have two rolls of duct tape,

346
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,943
80 yards of plastic sheeting,
and a surgical saw in their trunk.

347
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,279
It's not the end of the world, Dex.

348
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,281
No, but it definitely
makes things more difficult.

349
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,283
I'm used to flying under the radar.

350
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,910
So you're flying a little higher.

351
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,080
That's a good thing.

352
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,290
So what am I supposed to do?

353
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,084
Enjoy it, son.

354
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,683
Being a blood spatter analyst really
isn't so much of a job

355
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,018
as it's a calling.

356
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,980
You guys are the modern
American cowboys.

357
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,982
Yes.

358
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,527
Yee-haw!

359
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm gonna go grab a refill.

360
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,868
All right.

361
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,002
Joe. Hey.

362
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,298
Dexter. What's going on, man?

363
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,468
Nice, a sample of my own blood.

364
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,848
- You know, life.
- I know, man.

365
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,851
I know.

366
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,395
Looks like you've done pretty well
for yourself over the past 20 years.

367
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,356
I have. I moved to Virginia,

368
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,067
bought a couple sporting goods stores.

369
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,819
It's good business.

370
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,487
How about you?

371
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,739
I work for Miami Metro Homicide.

372
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:14,034
- You're a cop?
- No, no, I'm a lab geek.

373
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,078
I work in the forensics department.

374
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,663
Lab geek! That's who you are!

375
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,207
Now I remember, the science brainiac.

376
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,418
Yep, that would be me.

377
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,006
Hey, I was sorry to hear about Janet.

378
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,383
Yeah.

379
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,886
That was tough.

380
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,222
But I understand you kind of
went through the same thing?

381
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,516
Yeah. It's true,

382
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,685
we both lost our wives way too early.

383
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,063
Sometimes life sucks.

384
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,356
What do you do?

385
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,025
You know, it's been three years now,

386
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,904
and still sometimes
I get so angry with Janet

387
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,906
doing what she did,
leaving me like that.

388
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,741
Yeah, it must be hard on you.

389
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,996
Yeah.

390
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,998
Wow.

391
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,046
Get a look at that. Trisha Billings.

392
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,590
Right. Right, I spoke to her
a little while ago.

393
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:13,010
Yes, little Miss Prom Queen
still hot as ever.

394
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,014
You know, my one regret in high school

395
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,266
was that I never tapped
that sweet ass.

396
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,061
Well, you were dating Janet then.

397
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,105
Right.

398
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,441
Of course.

399
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,443
But...

400
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,404
I should at least go say hello.

401
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,080
I need to find another way
to get a drop of Joe's blood.

402
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,380
And I think I just found it.

403
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:53,634
Come on, Dexter. It's Hammertime.

404
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,472
I have no idea what "Hammertime" is.

405
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,977
Or how it differs from regular time.

406
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,800
Patience.

407
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,918
"In the midst of the street
was the tree of life,

408
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,046
"which bears 12 manner of fruit

409
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,131
"and yielded her fruit every month."

410
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,425
Do you want something?

411
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,303
I'd like some oranges, please.

412
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,827
Seems small without your stuff.

413
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,537
Had to make room for you.

414
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,081
I'm acting LT only.

415
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,333
Not if I recommend you
for the position full-time.

416
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,542
You don't owe me anything.
You know that.

417
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,921
- Yes, I know that.
- I mean, that was the deal.

418
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,964
We divorce, things go back
the way they were

419
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,509
- when we were still friends.
- That's exactly what this is.

420
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,345
I'm choosing you to run Homicide,

421
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,097
because you're the best there is.

422
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,265
- There's no other reason.
- You sure?

423
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,146
Honestly.

424
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,028
OK, my motives are not unselfish.

425
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,656
I need someone in here
who I can trust,

426
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,659
- someone who will have my back.
- I don't know.

427
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,245
I'm someone who needs to
be on the streets.

428
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,956
The street can be exciting,
but it's also hard.

429
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,792
And none of us
are getting any younger.

430
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,420
You need to start
thinking about your future here.

431
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,383
Besides, the prestige
and salary bump can't hurt.

432
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,553
I know what you're saying, but...
How much of a salary bump?

433
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,971
20% the first year.

434
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,974
Think about it.

435
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,059
Fine. But no promises.

436
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,812
OK, Lieutenant Batista.

437
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,574
Wishbone, Hail Mary, buttonhook...

438
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,492
Nothing is what it seems.

439
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,120
If I have any hope of blending in
I need to learn this.

440
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,748
Just enough so that
I can get close to Joe

441
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,833
and draw a bit of blood.

442
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,337
Even the coffin corner
isn't as fun as you'd think.

443
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,466
We've got a situation. Grab your kit.

444
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,813
Pros only.

445
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,690
Everybody stay behind the yellow tape

446
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,358
and watch me work my magic.

447
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,154
Watch well, and one of you will be
lucky enough to become my intern.

448
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,198
A prize opportunity...

449
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,950
that will have to be earned.

450
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,370
Ten bucks the hot chick earns it.

451
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,706
I can't take that bet.
It's too obvious.

452
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,793
- So what have we got?
- About 3 pounds of meat.

453
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,836
- Any body?
- Not yet.

454
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,005
An early morning customer
called it in.

455
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,221
Intestines.

456
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,681
- We've covered that, Sherlock.
- They're human.

457
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:14,728
These tissue tears indicate they
were removed in a very crude manner.

458
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,063
Yeah, but where's the body?

459
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,732
Where was the vic disembowelled?

460
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:23,570
This spatter suggests the initial blow
was to the head from behind.

461
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,031
Probably in the process of unloading.

462
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,075
The victim went down

463
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,410
and he was dragged

464
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,205
down to here.

465
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,584
Watch the blood.

466
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,674
This spray comes from a stab wound,

467
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,883
that's likely what killed him.

468
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,760
And this pool of blood in the dirt

469
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,345
suggests he was disembowelled here.

470
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,721
No signs of a struggle,

471
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,015
judging from
the undisturbed blood pool.

472
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,433
Yeah, he was either
dead or unconscious

473
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,269
when his intestines were removed.

474
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,104
No usable footprints
through the blood?

475
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,605
What do you think we're up against?

476
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,567
I mean, leaving the intestines on
the scale wasn't done by accident.

477
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,610
Well, body part removal
could be drug-related.

478
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,363
It could be Santería, voodoo.

479
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,781
Let's hold on a second, folks.

480
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,784
Could you guys set up
a larger perimeter, search the area?

481
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,578
The body might've been dumped nearby.

482
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,582
Hey. Can we talk in private?

483
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,459
- Yeah, go ahead.
- No, I mean, like, later.

484
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,253
- Over dinner.
- Why?

485
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,548
What's the big deal?

486
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,300
That's what I'm asking you.
You're being weird.

487
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,467
You're being weird.

488
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,303
OK, now you're being weird and stupid.

489
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,223
Did you buy another big-screen TV
for the apartment?

490
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,058
If you bought another big-screen
for the apartment

491
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,476
and you're expecting me
to pay for half of it,

492
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,728
- there's no way...
- I didn't buy anything.

493
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,397
- Jesus Christ, leave me alone.
- I'd return it.

494
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,984
I got all I need.

495
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,652
I'm gonna sneak back to my reunion.

496
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,405
I got a big flag football game
to suit up for.

497
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,076
Did I just hear him right?

498
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,499
You run the post corner.
Everyone else know what they're doing?

499
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,959
- Ready!
- Ready.

500
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,754
- Let's go.
- Yep, you got your man, right?

501
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,507
This time, the plan is when Joe is
at the bottom of a pile,

502
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,676
I'll give him a quick jab
and get my sample.

503
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,638
Eighteen! Five!

504
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,806
Red, yellow, hike!

505
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,481
Unfortunately,
Joe never seems to go down.

506
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,524
Block that shit!

507
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,445
Unlike me.

508
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,367
Come on, Dexter! Stay low, block high.

509
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,786
You gotta block that shit, Morgan.

510
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,540
My lancet.

511
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,834
No lancet means no blood sample.

512
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,127
Huddle up, girls.

513
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,344
So I want you
to break outside and go deep.

514
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,596
Dexter, you're an offensive lineman,

515
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,890
and it's your job to
stay close to the quarterback

516
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,392
to protect him from the rushers.

517
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,227
And while you're there,
stick in close,

518
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,271
give the little prick a hard jab
in the nose with your elbow.

519
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,107
Make him bleed, Dexter.

520
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,074
Blue 46, hike!

521
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,704
Shit!

522
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,247
- Sorry, Joe.
- What the fuck was that?

523
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,915
Sorry.

524
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,626
Who taught you how to play football?

525
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,420
My dad.

526
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,444
And we've got a blood match.

527
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,488
Tomorrow night, Joe is all mine.

528
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,412
- Dexter.
- Night, Angel.

529
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,082
Did you take Harrison
for his preschool interview?

530
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,753
Yeah, I did.

531
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,796
Good, cos Auri really liked it there.

532
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,799
She didn't find it scary?

533
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,677
The statues, and the... You know.

534
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,095
The crucifix.

535
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,807
That's a very powerful image of
the sacrifice that was made for us.

536
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,851
All kids have to learn
those kind of things.

537
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,144
Those kinds of things.

538
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,105
Sorry, but why?

539
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,525
I only ask, because I wasn't brought
up with much church experience.

540
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,527
No, that's OK.
These are good questions.

541
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,657
It's the catechism.

542
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,993
And they need to learn that,
because...

543
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,334
God has put a desire
for himself in every person.

544
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,170
Look, I know this is a little basic,

545
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,671
but how do we even know
there is a God?

546
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,550
You know,
just so I can explain it to Harrison.

547
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,385
Oh, well...

548
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,847
Well, there is a God,

549
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,683
because in...

550
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,230
In every one of us,

551
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,692
there is a powerful sense
of moral goodness.

552
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,361
OK.

553
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,405
But honestly,
when you really get down to it,

554
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,699
it's all about faith.

555
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:25,205
It's something you feel,
not something you can explain.

556
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,708
This is very hard to put into words.

557
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,920
Because it makes no sense.

558
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,714
Thanks, Angel, you've really
made it all much more clear.

559
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,716
Sure. Always happy to help.

560
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,890
This place is kind of fancy, isn't it?

561
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,433
It's OK, I'm buying.

562
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,394
And I'm eating.

563
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,736
That was nice of Dexter
to let you out early tonight.

564
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,281
Yeah, he's such a good boss.

565
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:03,076
He works around my school schedule,
whatever I need.

566
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,744
He's a good guy.

567
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,415
With all he went through last year,
you know, losing his wife...

568
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,958
I'm glad he's got you helping him out.

569
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,294
Yeah, so sad.

570
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,880
Well, I think he's putting it
all behind him at least.

571
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,966
Well, I don't know. Some nights...

572
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,260
What?

573
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:24,472
It just seems like some nights,
the pain, the loneliness,

574
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,766
whatever it is he's feeling,
gets to be too much

575
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,227
and he's gotta
just disappear for a while,

576
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,229
go out on his boat.

577
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,440
I think he's trying
to keep it away from Harrison.

578
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,609
Yeah. He really loves his son.

579
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,611
Poor guy needs a hobby or something.

580
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,446
Totally. Thank you.

581
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,991
Thanks. Can I get a nice
bottle of champagne, please?

582
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,451
Thanks.

583
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,954
Champagne? What is up with you?

584
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,165
We're celebrating.

585
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,792
You're looking at
the next lieutenant of Homicide.

586
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,629
You? Angel!

587
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,339
That is so fantastic!

588
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,507
- Wait, when did this happen?
- It's not official yet.

589
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,718
I'm only acting LT, but, you know,

590
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,345
it should come through any day now.

591
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,804
I am so happy for you.

592
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,181
It comes with a nice salary bump.

593
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,642
We can finally get out
of that little apartment

594
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,186
- and into a nice house.
- Wouldn't that be so great?

595
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,647
I could put Auri
back in ballet lessons.

596
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,232
How's she doing?

597
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,400
You know, a teenager.

598
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,654
She doesn't need her daddy any more.

599
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,906
It's a phase, I'm sure.

600
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,407
I'm sure.

601
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,993
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

602
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,251
What?

603
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,880
You're kind of almost
naked on top there.

604
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,676
You sound just like Pop.

605
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,594
Por favor, don't say that.

606
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,055
It's true. He used to follow me
when I walked to school

607
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,556
to make sure
I didn't talk to any boys.

608
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,226
I just don't want people thinking
that you're my girlfriend.

609
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,019
Why would they think that?

610
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,437
Because you just took off your top.

611
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,940
- You're all sexualised.
- Oh, my God!

612
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,025
You're serious!

613
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,027
I know we didn't grow up together,

614
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,863
- but I'm your sister, Angel.
- I know, I know.

615
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,574
She's not my girlfriend.

616
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,870
What?

617
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,540
I just told her
that you're not my girlfriend.

618
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,583
She probably thinks
you're a prostitute.

619
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,962
Oh, my God. I was wrong.

620
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,381
You're not like Pop, you are Pop.

621
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,217
I should beat you for that.

622
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,261
Exactly like Pop.

623
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,763
Man!

624
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,614
- Sister?
- Mr Morgan.

625
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,241
- Good morning.
- Hi.

626
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,328
I just wanted to apologise
for the other day.

627
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,622
I didn't mean to
come across as indifferent.

628
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,458
Of course not.

629
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:02,339
The fact is, I'm pretty ignorant
in spiritual matters.

630
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,300
I had a rather
unconventional childhood.

631
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,846
My father taught me
what he thought was important.

632
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:15,143
But I guess we had some concerns
that seemed more pressing

633
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,188
- than learning about God.
- I see.

634
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,774
But I want Harrison
to have a normal childhood,

635
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,817
a good childhood.

636
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,695
I would like for him to go here.

637
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,199
And you came all the way out here
this morning just to tell me this?

638
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,119
It seemed important.

639
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,334
I'll see if we can find
a place for your son.

640
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,878
Thank you.

641
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,151
Hey.

642
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,029
I've got my intern
photographing the scene.

643
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,032
- That's your intern?
- What happened to the little hottie?

644
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,993
What are you suggesting?
That I would pick Ryan as my intern

645
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:17,372
simply because of her
remarkable breasts and buttocks?

646
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,833
- Yeah.
- I find that incredibly insulting

647
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,418
that you would question my integrity.

648
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,671
I picked the student with
the highest test scores. End of story.

649
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,841
- So what have we got here?
- Floater, washed ashore.

650
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,008
Some lady called it in.

651
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,225
He's dead.

652
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,435
That's your best guy?

653
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,229
Looks like he was killed
by the stab wound.

654
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,772
He wasn't drowned.

655
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,607
His body was put
in the water postmortem.

656
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,068
So he was dumped.
Someone tried to hide the body?

657
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,362
Vince?

658
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,239
He wasn't in the water very long.

659
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,866
Three, four hours, max.

660
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,117
So he was dumped right offshore.

661
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,327
Doesn't look like somebody
was trying to hide him.

662
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,788
No, more like they wanted
the body to be found.

663
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,124
Last thing I need
is a complicated crime scene.

664
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,835
Holy shit.

665
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,296
Someone cut him open,
then sewed him back up.

666
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,131
And it just got complicated.

667
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,300
These incisions were made postmortem.

668
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,844
Our fruit vendor?

669
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,185
- Omar Rivera.
- That's our guy.

670
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,148
These stitchings are really weird.

671
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,650
There's, like, an "A" and
then a horseshoe kind of thing.

672
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,571
It's Greek. Alpha, omega.

673
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,406
How do you know Greek?

674
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,366
I dated some sorority chicks
back in the day.

675
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,076
Of course you did.

676
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,081
Holy shit, it's moving.

677
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,500
There's something inside.

678
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,553
Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!

679
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,768
Bag 'em, bag 'em.

680
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,954
- Got 'em all?
- Yeah.

681
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,081
- How many we got?
- Seven.

682
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,500
Seven snakes.

683
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,296
Your guy just fainted.

684
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,092
That's not a good sign
for a crime scene investigator.

685
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,344
Goodbye, big guy.

686
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,304
Hello, runner-up, little Miss Hottie.

687
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,973
Can we get back to this, please?

688
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,808
Snakes. I mean, what the fuck?

689
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,395
How does that happen? I mean, what?
Did the snakes crawl inside of him?

690
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,022
No, they're freshwater snakes.
Somebody put them there.

691
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,608
Somebody cut him open,
took out his intestines,

692
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,485
and replaced them with snakes.

693
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,154
- Why?
- To send a message, maybe?

694
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,951
Dude, what kind of message
does it send

695
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,661
putting snakes
in a dead guy's stomach?

696
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,830
Some kind of warning, maybe.

697
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,625
Whatever the message, whoever sent it

698
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,419
went to a lot of time and trouble.

699
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,130
This is no amateur.

700
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,768
After Joe's had a couple of drinks,

701
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,895
I'll figure out a way
to get him to step outside,

702
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,148
- where I'll M99 him and...
- Dexter!

703
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,318
Trisha.

704
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,527
- Hi.
- Hi.

705
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,614
I was hoping I'd see you
before the weekend was over.

706
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,116
Oh, well, here I am.

707
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,078
Shall we?

708
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,082
If it wasn't for you, I'd have never
made it through high school.

709
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,214
You saved my life.

710
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,134
I saved your... How?

711
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,887
We had so many classes together,

712
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,680
and I'd always sit right behind you.

713
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,558
Every test we took,
I'd copy all your answers.

714
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,436
- It's how I got through.
- Oh, well, I never noticed.

715
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,731
That's OK. That makes us even.

716
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,442
I never noticed how cute you are.

717
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,694
Until now.

718
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,158
Oh, my God, Mr Smith's class.

719
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,951
This is it.

720
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,205
You helped me a lot in this classroom.

721
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,508
Maybe I should give you
a little something back.

722
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,554
Trisha, I don't have time for this.

723
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,223
Yes, you do.

724
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:56,150
This is really...

725
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,028
Stop talking, Dexter.

726
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,176
Oh, God, what did I get myself into?

727
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,095
This is never good.

728
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,181
That was so good.

729
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,975
Thanks, sweetie.

730
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,613
Your purse.

731
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,492
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

732
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,078
Whoa, that was easy.

733
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,641
Trisha, you bad girl.

734
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,670
What is this?

735
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,173
Trisha?

736
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,134
You here?

737
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,637
What the fuck?

738
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,972
Fast reflexes. I hate jocks.

739
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,768
- It's you.
- I'm a mighty panther.

740
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,107
I'm the gold and red.

741
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,401
Jesus, you still are some weird loser.

742
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,945
What the fuck's up with you?

743
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,947
Tonight is meant for victory.

744
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,199
It's time to make you dead.

745
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,828
I don't think that last line is right.

746
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,246
I'm pretty sure it is.

747
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,724
Welcome back.

748
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,269
What the hell is going on?

749
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,729
Why'd you do it, Joe?

750
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,483
- Why'd you kill Janet?
- What?

751
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,069
Who said I killed Janet?
I didn't kill Janet. I was...

752
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:47,947
No more lies.

753
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,621
I'm a blood spatter expert, remember?
I see things others miss.

754
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,043
You shot Janet,
then put the gun in her hand.

755
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,838
No, I came home and I found her...

756
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,674
OK, OK, OK.

757
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,050
But I had to.

758
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,760
Yeah? Why? Why'd you have to?

759
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,973
Because we were having problems,
and the marriage was over.

760
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,726
- And...
- And so you killed her?

761
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,520
Do you know
how expensive a divorce is?

762
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,147
Really?

763
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,190
That's your answer?

764
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,784
What would Jesus have done?

765
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,246
Seriously now.

766
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,380
How do you reconcile your belief
in a higher power, in a god,

767
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,506
with what you've done?

768
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,092
What difference does it make?

769
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,636
I'm just curious.

770
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,555
So what, I'm supposed
to defend my beliefs to you?

771
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,224
If you don't mind.

772
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,937
Look, I mean, everyone makes mistakes.

773
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,191
And they do things
that they shouldn't do.

774
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,778
And they're only human.
But God, see, God forgives us.

775
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,446
Really, it's as simple as that?

776
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,239
You kill someone,
God forgives you for it?

777
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,574
- Yes.
- So I could kill you

778
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,034
- and God would forgive me?
- Well, no.

779
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,244
- You just said he would.
- You have to truly repent.

780
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,749
Do you truly repent for killing Janet?

781
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,709
- Yes, definitely.
- Liar.

782
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,336
No, no, you don't wanna do that!

783
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,797
- Why is that?
- Cos...

784
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,508
If you let me go,
God will give you life everlasting

785
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,843
and whatever you want.

786
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,762
There's really nothing I need.

787
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,766
You know, you don't wanna...

788
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,518
You don't wanna make God mad.

789
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,645
Don't you hear how foolish you sound?

790
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,313
Because he will smite you

791
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,774
with swords and rocks and thunder.

792
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,111
Thunder is just the noise.
It would be lightning.

793
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,571
You cannot kill me,
for God is a mighty fortress.

794
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,698
Joe, please, stop.

795
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,993
And I have been washed with the blood
of the lamb and he will protect me!

796
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,291
Sorry, hammer time.

797
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,173
So I talked to the coast guard today,

798
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,175
and they confirmed
what we'd already figured.

799
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,553
With the tides and all that,
that body was probably

800
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:18,264
tossed in the water
no more than a 1/4 mile offshore.

801
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,767
Really?

802
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,436
You don't seem very interested.

803
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,564
No, of course I'm interested.
I just...

804
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,483
Don't really wanna talk about work.

805
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,694
What is going on with you?
You're acting so weird lately.

806
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,070
I'm not acting weird, I...

807
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,697
You're about to drink the candle.

808
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,286
I'm just gonna use the restroom.

809
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,424
Debra...

810
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,802
will you marry me?

811
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,805
God, I sound like a fucking idiot.

812
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,477
Thank you.

813
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,065
Get down, get down, get down!

814
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,492
Fuck! He's wearing Kevlar.

815
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,547
Don't fuckin' move!

816
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:35,674
You all right?

817
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,134
Yeah.

818
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,974
Life is good.

819
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,852
I'm not at all unhappy.

820
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,856
I'm quite content to go about my life
believing in nothing,

821
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,235
with no fear that there might be
something more out there.

822
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,574
"I stood upon the sand of the sea,

823
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,078
"and I saw a serpent
rise up out of the sea,

824
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,288
"having seven heads."

825
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,625
"And upon his heads,
the name of blasphemy."

826
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,797
So it's begun?

827
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:18,175
Yes. It's begun.

828
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,684
But I also have a son,

829
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,435
and I have to think
about what he wants

830
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,104
and what's best for him,

831
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,939
because who knows?

832
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,650
Maybe he'll grow up to be someone
who wants to think about

833
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,735
those kinds of things.
