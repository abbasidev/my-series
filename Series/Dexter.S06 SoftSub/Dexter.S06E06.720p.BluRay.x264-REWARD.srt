1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,551
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,761
Is this Doomsday number two?

3
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,014
Travis Marshall.

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,475
Professor Porter, you wouldn't
happen to know of any good spots

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,310
where we could get a drink
this evening, would you?

6
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,478
Maybe I do.

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,151
These drawings, they were Gellar's?

8
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,029
No!

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,657
Seems Brother Sam's not a changed man
after all.

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,409
Please get off the property.

11
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,494
Not without our boy Nick.

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,954
You deaf, pendejo?

13
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,962
See how easy it is?

14
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,469
Get out and start walking away.

15
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,264
One way or another,
Travis will lead me

16
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,475
to the one
who really deserves my table.

17
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,095
Most people believe we have free will,

18
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,099
that we all choose our path.

19
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,645
Sometimes the path is clear.

20
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,192
Sometimes, not so much.

21
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,323
Every twist, every turn

22
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,201
can challenge our sense of direction.

23
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,040
But it's the choices we make
when we reach a fork in the road

24
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,000
that define who we are.

25
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,965
Deb, I'm kind of busy. Can...

26
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,343
Dex, I'm sorry, I have bad news.

27
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,886
It's Brother Sam. He's been shot,

28
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,471
- at his garage.
- What?

29
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,307
EMTs are working on him now.
I'm on my way there.

30
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,768
- I'll meet you there.
- No, wait...

31
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,521
Shit.

32
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,029
I think this will be
sufficiently tawdry for our purposes.

33
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,614
Pay the woman.

34
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,324
Ma'am.

35
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,963
- We're almost ready.
- About the woman...

36
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,214
She didn't die, did she?

37
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:21,009
No, but her arm is badly broken.
I'd like to get her some painkillers.

38
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,136
- No, Travis.
- But she's in agony.

39
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,763
She's a whore.

40
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,141
She's an unrepentant sinner.
She deserves what she's gonna get.

41
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,019
Have you given her
her mark?

42
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,521
No, not yet.

43
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,774
What's wrong with you, Travis?

44
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,069
- What do you mean?
- You're hesitating.

45
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,323
You're slacking off.
You better get yourself together.

46
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,285
You know what's at stake here.
We're the chosen ones.

47
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,828
We're the two witnesses.

48
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,705
But what if it's wrong?

49
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,415
What we're doing,
hurting these people...

50
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,208
God can be wrong?

51
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,961
I don't think so.

52
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,423
Do what you're told to do, Travis,

53
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,926
or you're gonna be destroyed
along with the rest of the scum.

54
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,691
It's bad.
There are three entrance wounds,

55
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,109
two in the chest, one in the back.

56
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,736
No exit wounds.

57
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,322
Bullets bounced around,
really tore him up.

58
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,035
Whoever did this to Brother Sam
doesn't deserve to live.

59
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,120
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

60
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,288
My job.

61
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,622
I'm sorry, Dex,
I can't let you do that.

62
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,041
You and Sam are friends.

63
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,460
Deb, I'm fine. Really.

64
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,420
The last thing you need
is another unsolved case.

65
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,546
You need my help.

66
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,839
I need to do this.

67
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,263
Hey, hey!

68
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,016
Somebody get this dog out of here.

69
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,477
- I got him.
- What do we have?

70
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,187
Register's clean.

71
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,646
Looks like a robbery gone bad.

72
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,316
Or Julio's gang finally
got even with Brother Sam

73
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,984
for stealing Nick away.

74
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,403
- I suppose it's too much to hope...
- It is.

75
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,905
DVD's missing.

76
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,990
Whatever happened to stupid criminals?

77
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,825
They're still stupid.

78
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,410
We'll catch this piece of shit.

79
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,621
The likely shooter
is Julio's replacement.

80
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,456
Taking out Brother Sam
would be a good way

81
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,124
to boost his cred as shot caller.

82
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,169
See, Louis, the art of dusting

83
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,839
lies in the caressing
of the powder over the print,

84
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,966
so as not to corrupt it,

85
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,136
as if one was trying to
get a nipple erect.

86
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,055
Like this.

87
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,932
What's the blood telling you?

88
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,144
The spray pattern suggests
the shooter stood here.

89
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,188
Bang, bang.

90
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:45,070
Victim stumbled to the car
and fell here.

91
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,156
Frothy blood suggests
a tracheal haemorrhage

92
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,868
and that the victim fell to his knees,

93
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,206
but the drainage
from the interior wounds

94
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,835
is pooled, not smeared,
so he must have rolled to his side,

95
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,339
and the shooter steps forward
for the kill shot.

96
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,258
Bang.

97
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,634
Victim rolls to his back.

98
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,052
That's how we found him.

99
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,349
The awkward position of the body
causes the bullet to miss the heart.

100
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,893
It's probably the only reason
he's still alive.

101
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,438
Guy's a fucking rock star.

102
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,441
Hey, this is Miami fucking Metro.
We're all fucking rock stars.

103
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,195
Harrison seemed
a little off this morning.

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,822
Is it all right
if I check in with Jamie?

105
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,115
Sure.

106
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,827
The night Julio and his crew
came for Nick,

107
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,246
I hit one of them with a baseball bat.

108
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,874
He seemed like Julio's number two,

109
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,042
which could mean he's now number one.

110
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,131
Blood.

111
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,300
If he's in the system,
I'll have a name.

112
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,360
We have a match.

113
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,029
Leo Hernandez.

114
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,368
Two felony arrests,

115
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,288
as well as one for
failure to pay child support.

116
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,082
What are the odds
you're at your last known address?

117
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,551
Hello?

118
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,720
Yes, hello, I'm calling
for Leo Hernandez.

119
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,971
Who is this?

120
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,723
The Department of Social Services.

121
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,647
Lieutenant, I ran the prints
from the garage.

122
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,190
I got 12 hits on AFIS.

123
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,775
All of them work for Brother Sam.

124
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,069
Well, that really
fucking narrows it down.

125
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,905
Maybe one of his ex-cons
got tired of working for a living.

126
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,658
Yale, Soderquist,
I want statements and alibis

127
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,992
from everyone on the garage payroll.

128
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,995
Yeah, I'm sorry.
He sounds like a horrible baby daddy.

129
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,373
You and your children deserve better.

130
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,583
She hasn't seen Leo in over a year.

131
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,001
Now what?

132
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,509
Any news on Brother Sam's condition?

133
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,594
Last I heard, he was still in surgery.

134
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,638
Hey, I got something.

135
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,016
Eighth Street Locos blame Brother Sam
for the disappearance

136
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,893
of their shot caller, Julio Benes.

137
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,144
I killed Julio.

138
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,980
Is it possible this is my fault?

139
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,440
And according to this report
filed two days ago,

140
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,859
Brother Sam suspected the Locos
of shooting up his garage.

141
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,362
So maybe his motive
was revenge and not robbery.

142
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,364
Or revenge, then robbery.

143
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,658
Hit the street. See if you can't
narrow it down to a triggerman.

144
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,826
Got it.

145
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,369
Deb, if it's OK,

146
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,663
I'm gonna swing by the hospital
and check in on Brother Sam.

147
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,831
Sure.

148
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,008
Hey, what's up?

149
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,345
Just getting some rocket fuel,
keep the engines burning.

150
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,680
Me, too.

151
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,098
Better get back to it.

152
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,643
Relax, I didn't come over here
to crack the whip.

153
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,022
I've just been going so hard lately,
I haven't had a chance to catch up.

154
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,690
What's going on?

155
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,443
- I'm good.
- Me, too.

156
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,866
- Can we get back to work now?
- Yeah, fucking go.

157
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,919
I'm taking a lot of heat on Doomsday.

158
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,840
The commissioner, the mayor's office,
the media are all over me.

159
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,926
Are we making any headway?

160
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,764
Quinn and Batista are going through
our suspect Professor Gellar's boxes.

161
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,015
I was about to get an update.

162
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,059
Good, do that.

163
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,478
And remember, you're lieutenant now,
not one of the gang.

164
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,229
I'm realising that.

165
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,106
OK, well, I'd like
a briefing later today.

166
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,484
OK.

167
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,578
If you're lying there
because of my dark passenger,

168
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,707
I promise you,
my dark passenger will make amends.

169
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,552
The Lord is my light and my salvation.

170
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,846
Hey, Nick, how are you?

171
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,682
Whom should I fear?

172
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,768
The Lord is my life's refuge.

173
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,770
Been trying to do good.

174
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,980
How could this happen to Brother Sam?

175
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,777
It's a hard question to answer.
I'd rather focus on who did it.

176
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,989
One thing I ask of the Lord.
This I seek.

177
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,994
Is Leo Hernandez
the new shot caller for the Locos?

178
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,707
You here as a friend or a cop?

179
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,669
I'm not a cop.
I'm a forensic analyst and a friend.

180
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,381
And you and I both know
the Locos wanted Brother Sam dead.

181
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,508
Where can I find him?

182
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,343
I ain't no rat.

183
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,680
If Leo shot Brother Sam,
he doesn't deserve your loyalty.

184
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,604
Come on, Nick, if you don't tell me,
the cops are gonna drag it out of you.

185
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,565
I'll keep your name out of it.
They won't.

186
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,779
He stays over on St Andrews.

187
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,072
The white house near Romaine.

188
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,782
Brothers and sisters,
let us pray together

189
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,617
for our friend Brother Sam.

190
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,286
Please join hands.

191
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,622
Please hear our prayer, Lord,

192
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,208
as we gather in your name.

193
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,087
Lord, we ask you
to heal our Brother Sam

194
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,298
and bring him back to us,
because we need him.

195
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,967
He's your shining light among us.

196
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,011
He helps us see the way.

197
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,637
- Amen.
- Amen.

198
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,349
And now in the name of forgiveness,
let us say a silent prayer

199
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,186
for the misguided sinner
who shot Brother Sam.

200
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,604
Forget it.

201
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,442
Anger won't bring him back.

202
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,277
I'd rather prey on him.

203
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,031
Here's where we are.

204
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,992
Professor Gellar's former TA,
Carissa Porter...

205
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,827
- The one you got the boxes from.
- Right.

206
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,246
She told us that
Gellar was working on a theory

207
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,707
about an early AD cult,
the Enesserette,

208
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,709
who believed that
the Book of Revelations

209
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,338
was not only a biblical prophecy,
but some kind of code

210
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,006
to bring about the end of the world.

211
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,549
I have no idea what that means.

212
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,636
According to Gellar's papers,
he thought he had deciphered the code.

213
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,931
Seven steps or keys,
each requiring a human sacrifice.

214
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:32,227
We think that the Doomsday tableaus
are an enactment of these keys.

215
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,354
Jesus.

216
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,274
I thought this crazy fuck was trying
to warn us about the end of the world.

217
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,734
You're telling me
he's trying to cause it?

218
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,694
There's more. We found a clipping

219
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,864
from a college newspaper
from a little over three years ago,

220
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,493
and it says that Gellar did
an artistic installation on campus

221
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,287
drawing attention to his work
on the Enesserette cult.

222
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,289
It got him in hot water
with the university.

223
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,875
The dead lamb represents sacrifice,

224
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,628
the naked chick
represents sinfulness...

225
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,797
It looks like a practise run
for his current work.

226
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,006
If we could find that girl
in the photo,

227
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,591
who knows what she could tell us?

228
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,261
Is that marking on her lower back
part of the tableau?

229
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,221
Not sure. We just found this
before you walked in.

230
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,014
We haven't had a chance
to go over it in detail.

231
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,100
- You got a magnifying glass?
- Yeah.

232
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,730
Looks like a tattoo.

233
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,941
One of those Hindu Om dealios.

234
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,777
Wrong religion, sweetie.

235
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,782
Good find, Deb.

236
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,951
We'll take it from here.

237
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,871
- Oh, I can help, if you want.
- No, no, no.

238
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,747
You've got a lot on your plate, so...

239
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,917
It's OK, Deb, we got this.
We'll get back to you.

240
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,096
What?

241
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,473
The chick in the photo
is Carissa Porter.

242
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,767
What? Are you sure?

243
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,895
The tat above her ass?

244
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,981
- I was in the vicinity.
- Shit.

245
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,650
She just became our key witness.

246
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,611
I told you not to go home with her.
Didn't I tell you?

247
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,904
Yes, you told me, Mom.

248
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,614
The question is, what are
we gonna do about it now?

249
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,657
Well, we gotta find out
what else Carissa Porter knows.

250
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,743
That... That's fine.
But we can't let Deb know about this,

251
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,620
cos that could make things
a lot harder for me.

252
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,996
Lie to Deb? No way.

253
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,831
Oh, so you're just gonna
turn your back on your partner?

254
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,167
Oh, no, no, no.
Do not play the partner card.

255
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,460
Of course I'm gonna play
the partner card.

256
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,920
Why wouldn't I play the partner card?

257
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,338
Situations like this are exactly why

258
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,173
the partner card
is in the fucking deck!

259
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,343
I'm really not liking you right now.

260
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,858
Deb, you got a sec?

261
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,235
What's up?

262
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,404
Quinn and I have to go
to Tallahassee tomorrow

263
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,322
to question Carissa Porter.

264
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,490
I thought you already interviewed her.

265
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,658
We did.

266
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,576
We have reason to believe
that she's the naked woman

267
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,828
in the newspaper photo.

268
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,205
No shit. How'd you figure that out?

269
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,748
Just meticulous police work.

270
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,584
Fucking A.

271
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,587
She's gotta be able to
help us get closer to Gellar.

272
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,215
But I can't spare you guys
for a whole day. Have her come here.

273
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:50,925
What?

274
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,886
Bring her into the station.

275
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,849
I don't know if she's gonna
go for that. She's a professor.

276
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,060
- She's got classes to teach.
- Fuck her classes.

277
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,564
She's a material witness
in a serial murder investigation.

278
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,899
Tell her to get her Om-tattooed ass
into this station

279
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,403
by tomorrow afternoon, or I'll have
her hauled in here in handcuffs.

280
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,407
- Try it nicely first.
- Yeah.

281
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,123
Fuck.

282
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,292
What if Carissa says something
about our night together?

283
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,211
I'll handle it.
You just stay the hell away from her.

284
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,999
- Hi, Jamie.
- Hi.

285
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,964
- Harrison go down easy?
- Totally.

286
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,800
We went to the park this afternoon.

287
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,344
So it was like one page
of Goodnight Moon,

288
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,429
and then the sandman
dropped the whole bag on him.

289
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,765
You know, you don't have to do that.

290
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,518
Deb said she'd be by this weekend
to get the rest of her stuff.

291
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,478
Oh, no, I'm happy to do it.

292
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,189
There we go.

293
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,983
All folded and packed
with very little hostility.

294
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,528
Guess I'll hit the road.

295
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,711
I heard about your friend,
Brother Sam.

296
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,338
How's he doing?

297
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,550
He's in a coma. It doesn't look good.

298
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,803
I'm really sorry.

299
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,514
He seemed like a really nice guy.

300
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,642
Yeah, I didn't know him

301
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,894
that well. It definitely sucks.

302
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,901
Well, I'll see you in the morning.

303
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,362
Good night. Thanks.

304
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,603
Why is it so hard for you to admit?

305
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,563
You care about Brother Sam.

306
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,775
It doesn't make sense.
Who is he to me?

307
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,111
A fellow traveller.

308
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,780
He was a killer at one time.

309
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,409
But he found a new path,
a path I could never take.

310
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,746
It's because he's travelled both roads

311
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,582
that he understands
the darkness in you

312
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,292
and he sees the light.

313
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,086
I wish I did.

314
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,548
Maybe things
could have been different.

315
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,052
What-ifs are a waste of time.

316
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,137
I've accepted my dark passenger.

317
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,598
But there's more to you than that.

318
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,309
Brother Sam sees it,

319
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,228
and he's helped you see it.

320
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,272
That's what he is to you.

321
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,116
So is there anything else
you want to talk about?

322
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,327
Nope.

323
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,287
You sure?

324
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,997
Yep.

325
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,333
OK.

326
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,254
Well, as far as the shooting
at Don Aldo's, you're good to go.

327
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,464
There's no need for us to meet again.

328
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,301
- There's one more thing.
- Yes?

329
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,641
I feel like my whole world
has been turned upside down.

330
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,854
That's kind of
more than an afterthought.

331
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,482
Go on.

332
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,531
For the first time, I feel lost in
a place that's always felt like home.

333
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,702
I look at my co-workers
and I see the doubt in their eyes,

334
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,370
and it makes me doubt myself.

335
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,540
I mean, they used to be my friends.

336
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,375
Now they're my subordinates.

337
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,378
It used to be simple.

338
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,133
I feel like shit about Quinn.

339
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,219
I think he thinks that

340
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,347
I dumped him because I think
I'm better than him now.

341
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,392
And I used to be able
to talk to Batista,

342
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,395
but that's awkward because
I made lieutenant over him.

343
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,025
I still have Dexter.

344
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,821
We've always been close,
since we were kids.

345
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,408
But that's different, too, because...

346
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,036
It's weird to be
my big brother's boss.

347
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,665
I just don't know how to act
around anyone any more.

348
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,542
- So don't.
- What?

349
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,835
Don't act.

350
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,212
Just be, Debra.

351
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,591
You're too much in your head.
You're... You're thinking too much.

352
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,843
Just do the job, live your life,

353
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,928
and give it all a chance
to sort itself out.

354
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,766
I don't know if I know
how to do that any more.

355
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,687
What would you be doing right now
if you hadn't gotten this promotion?

356
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,105
If I wasn't lieutenant?

357
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,942
If I didn't have briefings and reports
and meetings coming out of my ass?

358
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,277
Yeah.

359
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,074
I would probably throw
a housewarming party

360
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,742
at my new beach house.

361
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,620
Well, that sounds like a lot more fun

362
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,121
than worrying about
all this other stuff.

363
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,458
For a shrink,
you're not that annoying.

364
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,211
Thanks.

365
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,048
Not that you'd ever need
a shrink, but...

366
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,299
You might need a bookmark.

367
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,820
I would guess it's obvious
that people who party all night

368
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,988
also don't get up in the morning,

369
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,408
but I'm finding it very inconvenient.

370
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,327
Come on, Leo. Wake up.

371
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,849
- Cops, man.
- Oh, fuck.

372
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,016
Oh, fuck.

373
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,438
- Fuck you, man.
- Hey, behave.

374
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,315
That's my little gentleman.

375
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,695
Now, I know the Locos are
the supplier for this neighbourhood.

376
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,531
And I'm guessing that you,
being a savvy consumer,

377
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,200
have kept abreast on
who's running their operation now.

378
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,661
- I don't know shit.
- I just don't believe you.

379
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,956
I'm afraid you leave me
no choice but to flamingo your ass.

380
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,375
- Ass... What?
- It's a Chicago thing.

381
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,210
It's ironic,

382
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,881
because we don't actually
have flamingos in Chicago.

383
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,383
You actually have them here in Miami,

384
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,677
and yet you don't flamingo people.

385
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,138
I'll catch you later.

386
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,473
Wait!

387
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,060
Yeah.

388
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,688
The new Locos shot caller
is Leo Hernandez.

389
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,398
Drives a black muscle car,

390
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,067
similar to the vehicle ID'd
at the garage drive-by.

391
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,319
Operates out of a house

392
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,362
at the intersection
of St Andrews and Romaine.

393
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,530
I'll send backup.

394
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,327
About time, Leo.

395
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,002
Police officer! Hold it right there.

396
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,426
Hold it!

397
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,178
- He's coming out!
- Hands up.

398
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,930
Come on. Go, go!

399
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,272
He's down. Hold your fire.

400
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,442
Get in to secure the weapon! Clear!

401
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,902
Pull it in!

402
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,122
Is this the Locos' shot caller?

403
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,791
Yeah, recently retired.

404
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,418
Hey, Dexter, can I watch you
do the blood work?

405
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,755
Louis, we're learning fingerprints.
You're not ready for blood.

406
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,924
Come on.

407
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,976
Leo, you're not going in my slide box,

408
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,436
but justice has been done.

409
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,230
So why doesn't it feel better?

410
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,823
Think you got the right guy?

411
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,660
In the sense that he was trying to
blow my head off?

412
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,911
Definitely.

413
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,999
As to Brother Sam, I'll know
when I find the 9mm

414
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,500
that put the holes in him.

415
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,258
DVD player's on.

416
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,931
Security disc.

417
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,933
From the garage.

418
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,543
OK.

419
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,630
It's not a slam dunk.
That looks like Leo.

420
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,132
He had on the same sweatshirt
when he was shot,

421
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,675
he had the disc in his possession,

422
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,637
and Yale has two witnesses
who say Leo was bragging

423
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,723
he was gonna "smoke that
negro pendejo, Brother Sam."

424
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,725
That sounds like it should hold.

425
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,477
Good work, Mike, everyone.

426
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,397
Oh, if you haven't heard,
there's a party at my place tonight.

427
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,565
BYOB.

428
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,525
Not because I'm cheap. It's just cos

429
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,736
I don't have time to buy booze.

430
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,909
This doesn't make up for Brother Sam,
but at least we got the bad guy.

431
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,327
Yeah.

432
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,083
Something's not right.

433
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,340
Eli isn't barking.

434
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,386
If Leo were the man in the hood,
the dog would be going crazy.

435
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:05,015
The only person other than Brother Sam
Eli doesn't bark at

436
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,433
is Nick.

437
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,789
I'm sorry,
but the professor said no painkillers.

438
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,000
Please, just let me go.

439
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,461
I can't do that.

440
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,296
I have a son.

441
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,131
A little boy.

442
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,424
He needs his mother.

443
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,307
Please.

444
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,853
I can tell you're a good person.
Please, help me.

445
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,661
- Well, look who's here!
- Hey, Lisa.

446
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,457
Class, this is my brother Travis.

447
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,167
Can you say hello?

448
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,127
Hi!

449
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,004
This is such a surprise.

450
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,464
I mean, I'm... I'm thrilled.

451
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,383
But you've... You've never
visited me at school before.

452
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,135
Just needed to see you.

453
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,888
That's music to my ears.

454
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,223
You wanna paint with us?

455
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,810
Oh, no. I... I have to get going.

456
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,311
Come on.

457
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:19,525
Class! Travis is
a very talented artist.

458
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,318
Don't you think he should join us?

459
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,861
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

460
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,989
OK, OK, just a little bit.

461
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,866
- Yay!
- Yes!

462
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,331
So what are we painting?

463
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,167
We're painting what we're gonna be
when we grow up.

464
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,837
I'm gonna be a nurse like my mom.

465
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,631
That's a great thing to be.

466
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,676
- What about you?
- I'm gonna be a Transformer.

467
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,304
Oh, scary.

468
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,017
Don't you envy them?

469
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,311
So full of dreams.

470
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,357
And all the time in the world
to make them come true.

471
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,517
The night Brother Sam
carried Nick from his apartment,

472
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,768
Nick fired a shot at him.

473
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,438
From the couch, I'm guessing,
since he was stoned.

474
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,190
So the bullet should be...

475
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,738
here.

476
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,347
9mm.

477
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,391
Did it come from the same gun
that shot Brother Sam?

478
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,788
The striations match
the bullet taken from Brother Sam.

479
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,292
Nick shot Sam,

480
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,544
the man who tried to save him.

481
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,797
He's the ultimate Judas.

482
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,887
Thank you for coming down on
such short notice, Professor Porter.

483
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,264
You didn't give me much choice.

484
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,308
I hope you understand that

485
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,560
we're trying to solve
a series of brutal murders,

486
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,604
and your cooperation
is very important.

487
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,064
I don't see how.

488
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,234
I already told you everything I know
and I gave you Gellar's boxes.

489
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,404
Professor Porter,
are you the woman in that photo?

490
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,283
Yes.

491
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,369
Why didn't you tell us about this?

492
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,496
To tell you the truth,
I'd forgotten about it.

493
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,667
Ma'am, you are lying naked
in the middle of campus

494
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,795
with a dead sheep on your head.

495
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,134
That's not the kind of thing
that just slips your mind.

496
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,849
Look, if that photo got out,

497
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,769
I would look like a total flake
to my... The faculty.

498
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,149
Quinn.

499
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,817
Why aren't you in there
with your witness?

500
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,487
I had paperwork backing up,
so Angel took this one.

501
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,947
Paperwork?

502
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,075
She's a material witness
in the fucking Doomsday murders.

503
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,535
Come on, get in there.

504
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,751
Professor Porter, did you...

505
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:09,212
Do you share any of
Professor Gellar's religious beliefs?

506
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,757
I didn't know he had
any religious beliefs.

507
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,592
He was an academic.

508
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,888
Professor Porter.

509
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,557
Detective?

510
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,353
So that would be a no.

511
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,608
You're not a believer
in apocalyptic prophecies.

512
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,109
Of course not. Look...

513
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,987
I was just a prop.

514
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,616
I was young. I was trying to
win favour with my professor.

515
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,285
Well, kind of an unorthodox way
to go about it.

516
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,666
He was an unorthodox man.

517
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,127
- Has Gellar contacted you?
- No.

518
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,714
I told you. I haven't seen or
talked to him in over three years.

519
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,174
Well, you didn't tell us
about the photo,

520
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,635
so you could see how
we might be a little sceptical.

521
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,678
What the hell is going on here?

522
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,973
You think because
I posed for a photo once,

523
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,642
that I'm somehow involved
in all of this?

524
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,685
No one said anything
about you being involved.

525
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,521
But you're acting like
I'm guilty of something.

526
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,772
Not at all, Miss Porter.

527
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,440
We're just trying to
ascertain the full nature

528
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,109
of your relationship
with Professor Gellar.

529
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,153
I told you the full nature
of the relationship.

530
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,696
I was his TA,

531
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,158
and for a brief time, we were lovers,
but that's over.

532
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,368
Are you sure about that?

533
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,745
Jesus.

534
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,497
If we were still involved,

535
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,083
would I have slept
with Mr Warmth over here?

536
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,711
Or are you implying that I'm a whore

537
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,421
as well as an accomplice to murder?

538
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,799
Professor Porter,
can we just stay on the subject here?

539
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,008
No.

540
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,260
I've had enough of this.

541
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,429
I'm leaving now.

542
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,349
You bother me again,
I'll get a lawyer.

543
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,434
Goodbye, Joey.

544
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,902
Leave us.

545
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,665
Are you out of your mind?

546
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,793
You fucked a person of interest?

547
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,173
Who fucks a person of non-interest?

548
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,720
This is no time to be a smartass.

549
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,305
I could have you fired.

550
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:29,102
That woman was the key to interpreting
all of the Gellar evidence.

551
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,605
She's never gonna
fucking cooperate with us now.

552
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,856
Is that really what's bothering you?

553
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,858
What? What... What the fuck else?

554
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,902
Maybe you're jealous.

555
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,117
Are you kidding?

556
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,913
I could give a fuck who you fuck.

557
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,125
Just don't fuck with my investigation,
you fuck.

558
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,851
Well, I guess we're off.

559
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,480
You sure Deb invited me?

560
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,815
I really do not want to
crash a party with your son.

561
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,234
Yes, I'm sure, have fun.

562
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,903
I'll be there later,
after I take care of my business.

563
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,573
Sending Nick in pieces
to the bottom of the bay.

564
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,000
Hello?

565
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,670
Of course, right away.

566
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,756
Thank you for coming.

567
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,384
It was really important to Sam
that he talk to you.

568
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,261
This is good news, right?

569
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,513
He's regained consciousness.

570
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,847
Probably not.

571
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,768
Doctor says sometimes people
come out of comas before...

572
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,107
He doesn't have long.

573
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,450
Sam.

574
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,369
I'm here.

575
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,585
Don't worry.

576
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,463
I know it was Nick who shot you.

577
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,218
I'm gonna make sure he pays.

578
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,471
No.

579
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,725
Don't do that.

580
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,560
I don't understand.

581
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,229
I want you to...

582
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,734
to give Nick a message from me.

583
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,485
Yes.

584
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,780
Tell him

585
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,325
that I forgive him.

586
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,243
What?

587
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:55,248
You're the only one
that I trust to do it.

588
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,627
I didn't tell anybody.

589
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,756
The boys from the shop,

590
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,426
they wouldn't...

591
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,639
They... They're not ready.

592
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,267
You're wrong, I can't do this.

593
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,687
You can.

594
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,525
You don't know me.

595
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,777
Yes, I do.

596
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,366
I know about your darkness.

597
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,496
But I also see your light.

598
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,291
If there's light in me,
I don't feel it.

599
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,628
I just wanna hurt Nick.

600
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,005
You don't know
how much I wanna hurt him.

601
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:47,509
You need to forgive him.

602
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,346
I don't know how.

603
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,807
Just let it go.

604
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,522
Can't live with the hate
in your heart.

605
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,691
Eat you up inside.

606
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,197
We gotta find some peace in life.

607
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,326
Nick doesn't deserve it.

608
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,870
It ain't about him.

609
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:21,376
Dexter, if you don't
let that darkness go,

610
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,461
it won't let go of you.

611
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:33,346
Let it go.

612
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,692
For you.

613
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,861
You can just put it
on the liquor table.

614
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:53,032
No, no... This is a special bottle.
It's a housewarming/apology gift.

615
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,245
I should have told you
about Quinn and Carissa Porter.

616
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,705
Yeah, you should've.

617
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,874
I hope it doesn't hurt us
with Doomsday.

618
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,250
Me, too.

619
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,171
Why couldn't you trust me, Angel?

620
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,549
I do trust you. Of course I do.

621
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,051
It's just that...

622
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,222
Quinn's my partner,
and you're the boss.

623
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,349
I guess I haven't adjusted yet.

624
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,437
Well, that makes two of us.

625
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,564
It was the wrong way to go.

626
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,566
It won't happen again. Here.

627
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,027
It better not.

628
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,573
And this bottle
better cost at least $50.

629
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,619
Not even close.

630
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,752
Harrison's out like a light
on your bed.

631
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,756
But if that's inconvenient,
I can totally move him.

632
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,049
It's fine.

633
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:57,305
Oh, and Dexter said to tell you that
he'll be late, but he'll be here.

634
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,098
- OK, thanks.
- Sure.

635
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,562
Jamie, I feel like
we got off on the wrong foot.

636
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,774
- What do you say we start over?
- I'd like that.

637
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,320
Then how about we have
some of this fancy-ass tequila?

638
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,156
I never say no to fancy-ass anything.

639
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,958
Let me ask you a question.

640
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,796
Is Dexter as cool at home
as he is at work?

641
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:34,133
Why? Is he, like,
your hero or something?

642
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,970
Yeah, right.

643
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,431
That... That would make me a nerd,
which clearly I'm not.

644
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,645
Hey, you fucks.
Let's get the party started.

645
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,813
Oh, God.

646
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,148
Please tell me he didn't drive.

647
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,109
No, my lovely assistant did.

648
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,821
Debra, chick from bar.
Chick from bar, Debra.

649
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,447
I'm sorry, Lieutenant Debra,

650
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,493
her royal fucking majesty,
5th earl of Suffolk.

651
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,537
Cindy.

652
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,664
Feel free to hang all over me, babe,

653
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,375
because Debra here
is completely over my shit.

654
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,295
Wait a minute. This is your ex?

655
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,506
You brought me
to your ex-girlfriend's house?

656
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,174
No, actually, you brought me.

657
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,218
Have a nice life.

658
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,681
Damn, I just keep getting dumped.

659
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,858
Let go of the darkness.

660
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,195
How is that even possible?

661
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,454
Has Satan brought you here, Travis,
or has God?

662
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,291
God.

663
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,960
I'm glad to hear that.

664
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,380
Everything's ready to mark the whore.

665
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,842
I have to go out
and do further preparation.

666
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,553
When I come back,

667
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,723
I expect it to be done.

668
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,014
Who's there?

669
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,601
What's happening?

670
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:54,565
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

671
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,631
- What's happening?
- Get out.

672
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,258
Where are you taking me?

673
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,934
No, please.

674
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,271
You're free.

675
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:37,150
So were you hoping to become
a forensic analyst or whatever?

676
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,653
Actually, I already have a career.

677
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,905
I create video games.

678
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,616
Wow, that's so cool.

679
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,494
So why are you a lab intern then?

680
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,497
Oh, I'm... I'm developing
a new game about homicide.

681
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:54,667
I just figured it was
a great way to do research.

682
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,629
I'm sorry, but you must be,
like, a model, right?

683
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,174
Because there's just
no other explanation.

684
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,635
Hey, excuse me,
we were kind of talking.

685
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,637
Exactly. Were.

686
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,347
Run along back to the lab, Igor.

687
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,682
I think I better go check on Harrison.

688
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,017
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

689
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,935
- Okay.
- Sorry.

690
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,103
Move!

691
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,355
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey!

692
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,191
Why don't you give my sister
a little space?

693
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,027
I can't help it.
She has an outrageous ass.

694
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,195
That's enough.

695
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,697
I wanna have a relationship
with that ass.

696
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,449
I wanna have babies...

697
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,536
OK, Quinn, I think
it's time we call you a cab.

698
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,668
You ever love me?

699
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,631
Now is not the time.

700
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,049
Come on, Deb.

701
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,468
It's not that hard of a question.

702
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,386
Did you ever love me?

703
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,730
That's what I thought.

704
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,408
I'm sorry. He's gone.

705
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,038
That's it. Brother Sam is gone.

706
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,507
Will you honour his dying wish?

707
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,175
Forgive Nick?

708
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,678
I want to.

709
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,013
What did Brother Sam say?

710
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,850
Just let it go.

711
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:37,019
Let go of the darkness this one time,

712
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,855
and show Nick the light.

713
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,034
I've accepted the path I'm on.

714
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:59,458
But can I take a detour with Nick
for Brother Sam?

715
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,419
One thing is certain.

716
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,046
There's no way to get around
the fork in the road.

717
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,965
- Hey, Dexter.
- Hey.

718
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:10,219
I'm glad I ran into you,
I was hoping we could talk.

719
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,471
Let's go for a ride.

720
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,739
Dexter Morgan.

721
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,824
Please leave a message at the tone.

722
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,951
Where are you, bro?

723
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,681
You gonna tell me
what this is about now?

724
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,017
Don't you recognise this place?

725
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,519
It's a beach.

726
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,813
It's the beach
where you were baptised.

727
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,023
So?

728
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,319
So I thought it would be
a good place for you to

729
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,696
explain yourself.

730
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,866
What are you talking about?

731
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,285
Brother Sam regained consciousness.

732
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,872
I know you shot him, Nick.

733
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,170
You gonna arrest me?

734
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,130
I keep telling you, I'm not a cop.

735
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,841
What do you want?

736
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,720
I want to know why.

737
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,473
Why'd you do it?

738
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,726
I don't know.

739
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,062
You don't know?

740
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,398
You don't know why
you put three bullets in a man

741
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,983
who only wanted to help you?

742
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,026
Who believed in you?

743
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,404
Who sacrificed for you?

744
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,572
A man who gave you a home.

745
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,160
A man who baptised you.

746
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,662
Because he's full of shit!

747
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,333
He gave me hope,

748
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,086
but nothing changed.

749
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,005
My life was shit before
he dunked me under those waves,

750
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,089
and it's still shit.

751
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,550
He lied to me.

752
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,594
My homies never did that.

753
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,889
So you went back to them.

754
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,268
They wouldn't take me.

755
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,937
Not unless I proved myself.

756
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,774
Leo wanted Sam dead.

757
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,695
That's why you gave him
the security disc.

758
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,617
Here I am. The fork in the road.

759
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,375
Brother Sam loved you, Nick.

760
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,544
Then why'd he rat me out to you?

761
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,046
He didn't.

762
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,799
He sent me to forgive you.

763
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,303
Brother Sam forgives you

764
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,597
for gunning him down like a dog.

765
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,142
Your life might not have changed,
but his did.

766
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,315
Hey, look, I've gotta talk to him,
all right?

767
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,776
We can work this out.
I can't go back to jail.

768
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,152
He's dead.

769
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,154
What?

770
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,156
He died about an hour ago,

771
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,075
which makes you a murderer.

772
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,833
Turn yourself in to the police.

773
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,336
They'll find you anyway.

774
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,508
No, they won't.

775
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,428
The only witness is dead.

776
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,183
There ain't nothing on that disc.

777
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,645
It's my word against yours.

778
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,318
They got no proof.

779
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,158
Nobody can do anything!

780
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,498
Sweet Jesus!

781
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,795
I can't believe this worked out, man.

782
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,948
There's no light in you.

783
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,120
There's no light in me.

784
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,760
Hey, little brother.

785
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,764
Miss me?
