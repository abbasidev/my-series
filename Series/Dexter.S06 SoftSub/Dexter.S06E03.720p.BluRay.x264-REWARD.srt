1
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,884
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,554
Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!

3
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:14,930
This is no amateur.

4
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,307
What the fuck?

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,476
Debra Morgan, will you...

6
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,894
Are you insane?

7
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,439
What is that holy piece of shit
doing here?

8
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,110
- Brother Sam?
- One big, bad ex-con turned minister.

9
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,446
Runs an auto body shop
using former inmates.

10
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,448
That can't be a man of the cloth.

11
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,241
That's a killer.

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,410
It's why I'm making you
Homicide's new lieutenant.

13
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,245
Fuckballs, you're serious.

14
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,997
I couldn't be happier.

15
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,124
It's about time a real cop
had that job.

16
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,296
How come if Matthews hates you,
I'm always the one paying the price?

17
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,008
I can't tell if I'm seeing a man
who's changed for the better

18
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,801
orjust a better cover.

19
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,304
So that darkness inside is gone?

20
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,307
It's still there,
but I'm fighting its ass every day.

21
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,434
Please get off the property.

22
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,644
Not without our boy Nick.

23
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,146
You deaf, pendejo?

24
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,318
I can't marry you.

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,444
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,862
Ladies and gentlemen,

27
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,823
I give you Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

28
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,288
- Hey, you all right?
- No.

29
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:22,998
Really?

30
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,125
Yeah, I think I heard something snap.

31
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,454
How about we wind up
the Kentucky Derby

32
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,956
and we focus on breakfast?

33
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,958
- Yummy, OK?
- No.

34
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,960
- No, Harrison.
- Mine. Horsey mine.

35
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,421
When you're Harrison's age,
everything's important.

36
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,925
Everything has meaning,
even a piece of moulded plastic.

37
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,512
How about we can play
with the horse afterwards, OK?

38
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,143
It took me 20 minutes
to decide what to wear.

39
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,855
- Really?
- What? Don't I look OK?

40
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:56,652
Yeah. You put on a jacket
over your regular clothes.

41
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,780
Yeah, well, I don't want to overdo it.
I still want to look like me.

42
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,448
Just Lieutenant-me.

43
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,658
Smart.

44
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,704
It's dispatch.

45
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,165
Probable homicide, 930 Euclid.

46
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,501
It's about 10 minutes away.
I'll meet you there.

47
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,503
You're going to the crime scene?

48
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,296
It's just LaGuerta never went
into the field

49
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,465
unless she knew the case
was gonna be high-profile.

50
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,801
Yeah, well, I'm not LaGuerta, am I?

51
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,886
It's totally your call.

52
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,349
Shit. You're probably right.

53
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,643
It's my first day.
I should probably be at the station

54
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,312
working the snakes killing...

55
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,814
in my fucking office.

56
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,069
OK, buddy. Be good to Jamie today.
And no Fruit Roll-Ups.

57
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,570
They make you fart.

58
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,697
Don't we know.

59
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,741
Good luck today.
You're gonna be great.

60
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,536
Thanks.

61
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,509
Why are you doing this to me?

62
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,886
Please, just let me go.

63
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,515
You're not going anywhere
until you've repented for your sins.

64
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything.

65
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,186
Not to me.

66
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,523
To God.

67
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,613
Beg forgiveness, Nathan.

68
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,868
If you're sincere,
all of this will end.

69
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,079
If not, it will get much worse.

70
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,915
But I am sincere.
Please don't... Wait.

71
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,602
0 to 60 in 7.2.

72
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,396
A full 800 RPMs over the red line.

73
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,316
In high school, that was my dream car.

74
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,903
Didn't Smokey drive one of those?

75
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:03,987
Or was it the Bandit?

76
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,113
Burt Reynolds.

77
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,991
Yo, guys! Body's down here.

78
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,958
Any idea who she is?

79
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,129
From her tight mini and
a 24-pack of Trojans in her pocket,

80
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,964
I'd say she's a working girl.

81
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,633
No driver's licence?

82
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,468
Haven't found a purse or an ID.

83
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,512
We need to roll her over.

84
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,140
Easy.

85
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,101
Guess she lost her gym membership.

86
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,479
- Where the hell's Quinn?
- He's on his way.

87
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,441
Multiple blunt force trauma

88
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,152
or manual strangulation.
Take your pick.

89
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,876
Are you crazy?

90
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,129
OK, OK. I'm late. I'm sorry.

91
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,172
Not that. The girl.

92
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,882
What are you doing, man?
What about Deb?

93
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,509
Deb and I broke up.

94
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,512
You broke up?

95
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,222
Yeah, three days ago. We're over.

96
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,683
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.
What happened?

97
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,309
Lieutenant Morgan happened.

98
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,186
She ditched you
because she got promoted?

99
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,730
- That doesn't sound like Deb.
- Yeah?

100
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,191
Cos this is the same Deb
that stole your job.

101
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,236
She didn't steal my job.
It was never mine to start with.

102
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,321
That's always been your problem.
You're too nice.

103
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,157
You let these fucking people
walk all over you.

104
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,867
That's bullshit.

105
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,995
Keep telling yourself that,
Mrs LaGuerta.

106
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,419
You're lucky we got work to do.

107
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,554
- What's so interesting?
- Tooth is chipped.

108
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,556
No surprise there.
She really got worked over.

109
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,057
It's probably from the beating.

110
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,685
Or someone tried to rip it out.

111
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,571
You'll be leading
your first briefing soon,

112
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,281
so make sure you scan
all the field reports.

113
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,367
It's next on my list. I just wanna
finish going through these résumés.

114
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,452
Résumés?

115
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,787
I need to pick a new detective
to take my place.

116
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,956
I can't afford to be
down a man right now.

117
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,249
Well, I can help you with that.

118
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,376
Let's see here...

119
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,466
Sam Harmon from Narcotics.

120
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,800
He's a real up-and-comer,

121
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,595
and the fact that his father's
a district judge could come in handy.

122
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,931
Yeah, I know Sam. He's a solid cop.

123
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,891
Great. Happy to help.

124
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,060
There are a lot of other names
on this list.

125
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,436
You know,
there's this guy from Chicago...

126
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,980
Forget him. With everything
on your plate right now,

127
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,400
the last thing you want to worry about
is a transfer situation, trust me.

128
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,987
Harmon's your guy.
Do you want me to start the paperwork?

129
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,114
No.

130
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,991
I've got it.

131
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,829
Go ahead.

132
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,122
Morgan.

133
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,124
Don't let her shove something
down your throat,

134
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,919
not unless you're ready
for seconds or thirds.

135
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,005
Take it from Mrs LaGuerta.

136
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,132
Got it. Thanks.

137
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,635
Deb, one of the most important
things about this job

138
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,929
is knowing how to
marshal your resources.

139
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,306
Take the help when it's offered.

140
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,142
Remember, we're in this together.

141
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,819
I remember when I found that
under your bed.

142
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,530
I would have rather it had been
a stack of Playboys.

143
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,117
Most kids in the eighth grade
were obsessed

144
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,785
with their favourite baseball players.

145
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,871
You tracked serial killers.

146
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,372
Only certain ones.

147
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,792
The Tooth Fairy was smart...

148
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,504
and arrogant.

149
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,340
They never caught him,
even when he left a body

150
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,508
on a deputy sheriff's lawn.

151
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:41,306
Fifteen women, prostitutes,
all dumped on the roadside,

152
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,308
all missing their lateral incisors.

153
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,895
You really think there's a connection
to the victim from this morning?

154
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,563
Her lateral incisor was cracked

155
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,149
like someone tried to
rip it out with pliers.

156
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,235
There was damage to her gums.

157
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,989
Probably a result of the beating,
like Masuka said.

158
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,077
Maybe someone was
trying to relive old times?

159
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,413
The Tooth Fairy killings
were in the '80s, Dexter.

160
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,916
He'd be 70 years old at least.

161
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,418
What would he be doing in Miami?

162
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,047
Why do most 70-year-olds
come to Miami?

163
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,353
They say old age
is like a second childhood.

164
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,398
There are primary colours,

165
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,609
tricycles

166
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,280
and ball-chasing.

167
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,078
I barely made it through
my first childhood.

168
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,457
I guess no one makes it
through the second.

169
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,629
This place is one block
from where the victim was found.

170
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,465
A short walk for a retiree
on a mission.

171
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,139
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

172
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,975
I'm thinking about moving
my dad down here.

173
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,311
He's 81, but still sprightly.

174
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,521
Bless his heart.

175
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,606
Coral Island's a great facility.

176
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,483
I'm happy to answer
any questions you have.

177
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,319
Do you have any other residents
here from Oregon?

178
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,364
My dad's kind of shy and
it'd be nice to have people around

179
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,659
with something in common,
besides hearing loss.

180
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,328
Let's see.

181
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,668
We have three residents from Oregon.
Fine people.

182
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,004
I'm sure your dad will
get along with them famously.

183
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,380
That's good to hear.

184
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,798
Here are some brochures

185
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,176
with everything you need to know
about Coral Island.

186
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,136
There's some forms to fill out
in case you're interested

187
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,679
in having your dad join us.

188
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,973
Thanks.

189
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,186
I hate to trouble you,
but that coffee really looks good.

190
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,564
I was gonna get some earlier.
I feel a caffeine headache coming on.

191
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,525
I know what that's like.
I'll fetch you a mug.

192
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,195
- Be right back.
- I appreciate it.

193
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,498
One woman,

194
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,208
another in a wheelchair.

195
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,542
That leaves...

196
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,506
Moved here from Grants Pass, Oregon,
five years ago.

197
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,009
How are you spending
your second childhood?

198
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,182
What's that?

199
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,725
You've been doing such a good job,

200
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,895
I put together a little surprise
for your viewing pleasure.

201
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,063
Is this what I think it is?

202
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,732
Evidence from
the Ice Truck Killer investigation.

203
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,235
You said in class
how you were really into this case.

204
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,778
Are you kidding?

205
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:46,074
I was obsessed with this case.
I have followed it night and day.

206
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,408
This is really sweet.

207
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,875
This is the Ice Truck Killer's
hospital ID.

208
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,549
And the holy of holies.

209
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,602
You know,

210
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,938
when the details of this case
were made public,

211
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,774
I painted my nails like this
for a whole week.

212
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,110
Is that just wrong?

213
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,778
Is it wrong that it makes me hot?

214
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,950
What do they do with all this stuff?

215
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,328
It just sits here in evidence,
forever.

216
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,455
That's a shame.

217
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,125
I mean, this is a piece of history.

218
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,503
It's time for the briefing.

219
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,342
There you are.

220
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,637
I've sat through God knows
how many briefings.

221
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,097
Why am I so fucking nervous?

222
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,975
Because everyone will be looking
to see if you know what you're doing.

223
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,184
Do me a favour.

224
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,313
When you get back to your desk,
look up the word "rhetorical".

225
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,189
You'll be fine, Deb.

226
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,191
OK, everyone,
we've got a lot to cover,

227
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,985
so let's get started.

228
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,321
First up is the homicide on Euclid.

229
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,156
Where are we
on identifying the victim?

230
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,534
Her fingerprints gave us a name:
Rosalia Davolos.

231
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,705
Several priors for solicitation.
We talked to the local merchants.

232
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,624
Seems that strip was
practically her office.

233
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,875
Did we run her cell phone?

234
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,878
It turned up a long list of numbers,
mostly johns.

235
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,296
We're working through the names now.

236
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,505
What about a tox screen?

237
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:28,009
Trace amounts of cocaine
in her system and...

238
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,677
doughnuts.

239
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,348
Let's check the area
for known pushers.

240
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:37,143
Maybe she got caught up in a bad deal
or she got behind on a payment.

241
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,228
I'm hoping five
or six people will volunteer...

242
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,855
They'll never tie this
to a quarter-century-old

243
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,316
serial killer case from Oregon.

244
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,736
Not sure I have either,
but I can dream.

245
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,863
That takes us to the snakes killing.

246
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,866
It's looking like this wasn't
a drug cartel hit after all.

247
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,201
As much as I hate to admit it,

248
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,536
maybe Brother Sam was right
about our victim.

249
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,705
Maybe he'd cleaned up his act.

250
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,207
That doesn't mean
there wasn't someone out there

251
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,042
looking to settle an old score.

252
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,586
What if we made some of
the details of the case public,

253
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,880
like the snakes?
Might scare up a lead.

254
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,345
No.

255
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,764
That may compromise the case
when it goes to court.

256
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,684
If we don't catch anyone,
this will never go to court.

257
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,229
I think Detective Quinn has a point.

258
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,401
We let word out about the snakes,
the press will eat it up. Who knows?

259
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,569
Maybe something will shake loose.

260
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,532
- What about the trial?
- Quinn's right.

261
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,410
There'll never be a trial
unless we get someone into custody.

262
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,245
I think it's worth a try.

263
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:41,207
Angel, get started on the statement.
Have it on my desk by this afternoon.

264
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,761
I don't think you really believe
what you are saying, Nathan!

265
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,097
You need to believe
what you are saying!

266
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,099
I do. I swear.

267
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,768
I don't know what it is
you want from me.

268
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,564
I want to hear you tell God
that you are sorry.

269
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,065
OK. OK.

270
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,818
Please, please, God...

271
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:13,114
I'm sorry for everything
I've ever done.

272
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,575
Just forgive me.

273
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:20,163
Forgive me.

274
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,423
No, no. Wait. Wait.

275
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,133
Where are you going? Let me go!

276
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,676
Let me go!

277
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,857
He's telling you
what you want to hear.

278
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,986
He thinks we're gonna release him.

279
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,497
How much longer do we
have to make him suffer?

280
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,001
You really have a good heart, Travis.

281
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,587
That's why I picked you.

282
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,176
But there's much more at stake here

283
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,345
than one man's suffering.

284
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,932
Don't we have to be strong?

285
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,854
He has to be pure or we can't proceed.

286
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,024
Yes.

287
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,944
He's coming around.

288
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,696
It just takes time.

289
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,043
Good morning, Walter.

290
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,963
Keep saying that
and one day you might be right.

291
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,466
Sam's group is about to tee off.
You can join them.

292
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,053
I'm short a partner.

293
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,555
Dan.

294
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,307
Walter Kenney.

295
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,561
I'm a little rusty,
but I'll try not to slow you down.

296
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,105
Just get a cart, will you?

297
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,237
Worst mistake I ever made
was moving down

298
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,573
to this piss-butt corner
of the country.

299
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,910
How bad can it be?
It's the Sunshine State.

300
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:27,081
Only sunshine around here
is what they blow up your ass.

301
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,168
The rest is mosquitoes, humidity

302
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,295
and people that don't speak English.

303
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:38,342
So what's a young guy like you
doing around Coral Island?

304
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,095
Or do you get off
hanging out with corpses?

305
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,933
I'm checking it out for my dad.

306
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,310
You want to help your dad?

307
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,353
Take him to the end of the pier
and push him off.

308
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,355
You'll be doing him a favour.

309
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,443
If I was any more in the rough,
I'd need a fucking machete.

310
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,279
This is like being trapped
in a toxic cloud

311
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,449
that cheats.

312
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,789
Son of a bitch!

313
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,041
You OK?

314
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,710
I always scream in pain
when I take a swing.

315
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,463
Don't just stand there.
I need to sit down.

316
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,881
All right.

317
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,510
I ruptured my back two years ago.
It hasn't been the same since.

318
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,471
OK, just take it easy.

319
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,847
Jesus fucking Christ!

320
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,393
Listen, I'm done here.
Just drop me off at the club bar.

321
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,395
I need something to kill the pain.

322
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,981
You got it.

323
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,657
So what'd you used to do up in Oregon?

324
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,203
I was a pipe fitter for 25 years.

325
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,748
Shit job, but I managed
to work up a pension.

326
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,542
All I want to do now is play golf.

327
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,713
Maybe you should find
something else to pass the time.

328
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,550
I tell you, it's hell not
being able to do what you love.

329
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,011
Is he talking about golf
or his failure

330
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,681
to rip out Rosalia Davolos' tooth?

331
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,768
Walter Kenney may be
the world's oldest asshole,

332
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,770
but that doesn't make him a killer.

333
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,856
On the other hand,
maybe I gave up too soon.

334
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,905
He wears a dental implant
for the lateral incisor.

335
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,741
The same one the Tooth Fairy
pulled from his victims.

336
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,288
Excuse me.

337
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,206
Hello?

338
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,542
This is Sam from Good Shepherd Auto.

339
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,377
I was just calling to
let you know your car's ready.

340
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,878
Great. When can I pick it up?

341
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,547
If you get here before 6:00,

342
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,550
you won't have to
fight the dog off this time.

343
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,094
- I'm on my way.
- OK.

344
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,775
This is on me.
I got to go pick up my car.

345
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,444
You know,
I've got a shitload of errands

346
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,404
to run tomorrow
and with my back the way it is,

347
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,781
I'm gonna have
a real hard time on the bus.

348
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,658
You wouldn't want to
give me a ride, would you?

349
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,118
Perfect, now I won't
have to make an excuse

350
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,411
to run into you again.

351
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,581
I'm in 72. Pick me up at 9:00.

352
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,750
Actually, I'd rather
have my teeth pulled.

353
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,418
Happy to do it.

354
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,943
People don't put no oil in it
and then wonder why they... Hey!

355
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,530
Hey, man, yeah. She's right down here.
I'll be right back, Nick.

356
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,118
God bless him.
Nick has been busting his ass, man.

357
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,455
He's off the drugs.
Cut his ties with the gang, man.

358
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,375
I really think he wants to change.

359
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,709
You must be relieved.

360
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,045
I'm proud of him is what I am, man.

361
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,005
It's not easy turning
your life around, man.

362
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,382
It could go south at any minute,

363
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,135
but I'll take the blessings
as they come.

364
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,971
This looks like the day I bought it.
You do good work.

365
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,769
It's all these repair jobs
that pay for that good work.

366
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,148
Listen. You got any plans this Sunday?

367
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,733
Like service?

368
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,985
What would I be getting serviced?

369
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,614
Like a church service.

370
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,699
No. Not much of a churchgoer.

371
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,076
Yeah, I figured that.

372
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,371
Well, we having something
like a company get-together,

373
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,497
like a beach party.

374
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,332
It'd be great if you could come.

375
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,210
This Sunday's tough.
I don't have a sitter for Harrison.

376
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,420
That's your boy?

377
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,005
Yep. He's two.

378
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:49,051
Yeah? Bring him along.
It's a kid-friendly environment.

379
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,386
He'll love it.

380
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,848
Play some ball, put the grill on,

381
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,059
have a little beach barbecue baptism.

382
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,478
- Baptism?
- Yeah. Nick.

383
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,856
He's taking the big leap, praise God.

384
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,150
He's taking the Holy Spirit
on right there

385
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,693
in the waters of the Biscayne Bay.

386
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,570
Sounds like you're trying
to get me to go to church.

387
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,071
So what?

388
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,698
What? You afraid
you gonna catch something?

389
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,660
I'm just not sure I fit in.

390
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,038
Sure you do. Listen.

391
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,208
I just think it'd be great for you

392
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,212
to take a stand with someone whose
life that you helped turn around.

393
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,175
And if you do happen to find God,

394
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,093
a lot worse ways
you could spend your day off.

395
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,650
Only one mention of Walter Kenney
in the criminal database,

396
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,195
and he's identified as a victim.

397
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,488
Walter Kenney's mother,

398
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,491
charged with felony child abuse
against her son.

399
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,621
I have to vent,
or my head's gonna explode.

400
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,456
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

401
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:04,376
I'm my ex-boyfriend's boss.
I don't know how to act.

402
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,795
I don't know what to do.
I don't know who to hire.

403
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,341
I have a stack of paperwork
on my desk that's taller than I am.

404
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,967
Take a breath, sit down.

405
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,346
I think I really fucked up
taking this promotion.

406
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,890
I was a fucking great detective

407
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,059
who loved her fucking job.

408
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:26,357
I traded it all in for politics and
paperwork and LaGuerta up my ass.

409
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,901
Deb, you're too smart to think
that this was gonna be easy.

410
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,152
Well, I didn't expect this.

411
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,447
I didn't expect people sitting around
waiting for me to fall on my face.

412
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,282
No one wants you to fail.

413
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,244
OK, LaGuerta probably wouldn't lose
any sleep if you stumbled a bit.

414
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,537
She'd pop a bottle of champagne.

415
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,374
But guess what. You're new at the job.
You're gonna stumble.

416
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,625
You think LaGuerta never messed up?

417
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,001
Shit, yeah.

418
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,336
Cut yourself some slack.

419
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,005
You've been Lieutenant one day.

420
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,882
If a couple months go by,
you still hate it,

421
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,217
you can demote yourself,

422
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,261
but until then, just go with your gut.

423
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,097
And when you screw up,
just don't take me down with you.

424
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,473
I need the paycheck.

425
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,767
OK.

426
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,186
My panic needle's
swinging out of the red.

427
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,312
Good.

428
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,232
How are you with the Quinn of it?

429
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,485
I miss being with him.

430
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,988
Really?

431
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,656
Quinn's a good guy.
We had fun together.

432
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,783
It was easy. No expectations.

433
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,286
That's one decision
I know I made right.

434
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,371
Quinn and I were
never meant to get serious.

435
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,959
I have to go. I have to put people
on the snakes killing.

436
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,003
Thank you for talking me
off the ledge.

437
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,254
You're the best.

438
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,339
Is it a good time for me
to ask for a raise?

439
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,216
- Terrible.
- I'm serious.

440
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,219
Fuck off and die.

441
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,309
Maybe she shouldn't have
taken the promotion.

442
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,311
She might not be cut out for it.

443
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,314
I think there's very little
Deb's not cut out for.

444
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,610
Kenney's mother was taken into custody

445
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:57,323
for repeatedly hitting her son
in the face in public.

446
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,617
I'm not seeing the connection.

447
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,660
Maybe that's how he lost his tooth.

448
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,289
So Walter Kenney has mother issues.
Sounds familiar.

449
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,416
Doesn't mean that
he is the Tooth Fairy.

450
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,379
But it's another reason for me
to spend my day off with Mr Sunshine.

451
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,069
You said 9:00.

452
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,821
I just need a couple of seconds.

453
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,670
TV, Barcalounger
and a view of the parking lot.

454
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,631
This wasn't on
the Coral Island brochure.

455
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,657
My son.

456
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,748
Gave him everything in life,
and now I can't get him on the phone.

457
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,542
You have kids?

458
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,878
You're lucky.

459
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,381
Ungrateful little pricks.

460
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,217
They suck the life out of you,
and then they vanish.

461
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,886
Where are my fucking house keys?

462
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,850
He's completely alone.
Alienated everyone around him.

463
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,817
Here they are.
I'm losing my fucking mind.

464
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,450
Abrams in 23.

465
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,204
Dumb as a bag of dog shit.

466
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,752
Looks like a space
just opened up for your dad.

467
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,806
Shit.

468
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,729
Here's my prescription.
Just pick it up for me, will you?

469
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,192
Sure.

470
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,572
Hey, hey, hey!

471
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,493
And a six-pack of beer
from the liquor store

472
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:51,121
and the latest Teen Ass,
Nipple Parade and Spanked.

473
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,958
Teen Ass, Nipple Parade and Spanked.

474
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:59,129
Can this really be the man
who inspired me to keep a scrapbook?

475
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,473
Can I get

476
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,851
Teen Ass, Nipple Parade, and Spanked?

477
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,569
Some needs just don't go away.

478
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,073
Even if the equipment
is on life support.

479
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,575
Does that hold true for killing?

480
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,334
Just one last stop,
and then I'm out of your hair.

481
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,718
I'll take the bus home from here.

482
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,762
What about your back?

483
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,389
Got my remedy.

484
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,184
See you.

485
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,079
What wrong turns do you take

486
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,248
to lead to this at the end
of your life?

487
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,589
An 8 by 12 storage shed,
a six-pack of beer

488
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,799
and a stack of porno mags.

489
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,141
I need those rundowns
on the interviews you did

490
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,517
with the victim's johns.

491
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,603
Yeah, I'm still working on them.

492
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,854
Anything I should know?

493
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,399
They're all sketchy characters,
but their alibis check out.

494
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,027
Final forensics report
on the snakes killing.

495
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,362
Nothing new, but if you notice
the grammar's improved,

496
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,781
it's because Ryan typed it up.

497
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,911
So, Ryan, right?
You've been here a week now.

498
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,579
How you liking it?

499
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,122
- It's heaven.
- Yeah?

500
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,374
- Even with Vince around?
- Good one.

501
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,793
I love homicide.

502
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,338
I've always been fascinated
by people who do bad things.

503
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,298
Maybe that's cos you got
a little bad in you.

504
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,800
You think?

505
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,470
I think you got a lot of bad in you.

506
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,889
You may be right.

507
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,057
Yeah.

508
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,934
But you'll never know.

509
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,650
Can I talk to you for a second?

510
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,116
We're still interviewing
Rosalia's johns.

511
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,160
- So far, nothing.
- Not about the case.

512
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,331
I want to know how you're doing
with the whole situation.

513
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,292
Right. I'm good.

514
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,003
Matter of fact,
I just got done packing up your stuff.

515
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,421
You didn't have to do that.

516
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,840
You know, I figured you're busy
with your new job and all.

517
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,551
You know, might not have time.
Kind of wanted it out of the house.

518
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,637
So if you want to pick it up,

519
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:57,557
it's in the garage right next
to the big bag of fertiliser.

520
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,895
Quinn, I know you're pissed.

521
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,023
You're doing a great job
of letting me know that.

522
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,109
But this wasn't easy on me either.

523
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,276
I'm sure.

524
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,946
You know, from what I hear, that
promotion just came out of the blue.

525
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,823
You think that my becoming Lieutenant

526
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,783
had anything to do
with what happened between us?

527
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:18,161
No, I'm sure it was just
a big fucking coincidence.

528
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,163
Quinn, that is so fucking unfair.

529
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,915
There seems to be
a lot of that going around.

530
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,459
I got my share.
Maybe you're getting yours.

531
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,156
Don't hurt me.

532
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,825
You have to make a choice, Nathan.

533
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,202
Are you going to be saved?

534
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,621
- It's up to you.
- Yes, please!

535
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,122
Please.

536
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,045
Dear God, cleanse me of all my sins.

537
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,923
Forgive me for all the evil
that I've done.

538
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,801
Forgive me, please.

539
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:01,556
Forgive me.

540
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,728
Forgive me. Forgive me.

541
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,273
He's ready.

542
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,239
Two hours in that storage facility.

543
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:21,159
I'm guessing he wasn't
organising his Penthouse collection.

544
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,454
It's like my box of slides.

545
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,626
Dried blood on the roots.

546
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,503
These are from all of his victims.

547
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,256
He's the Tooth Fairy.

548
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,308
The man who terrorised
the Pacific Northwest for 20 years.

549
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,936
All he has left is a box of teeth.

550
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:18,193
Is this what happens to serial killers
at the end of their lives?

551
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,077
Everything's ready.

552
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,162
Kenney's apartment will
make the perfect kill room.

553
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:33,124
No one ever visits him and the maid
won't show up until the morning.

554
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,212
Tonight, Walter Kenney
will have his final tee-off.

555
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,679
- Hello?
- It's Walter.

556
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,888
I'm really fucked!

557
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,014
What is it?

558
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,476
I got off at the wrong stop, and now
I don't know where the hell I am.

559
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,188
I've been riding around for hours.
Fucking hell!

560
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,108
OK, OK. Just calm down.
I'll swing by and pick you up.

561
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,402
What's the street name
and number of the bus stop?

562
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,241
321 Alatka.

563
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,786
Got it. Just stay where you are.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

564
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,454
He made it easy for me to vet him.

565
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,999
Now he's making it easy
for me to kill him.

566
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,626
Kenney's a monster,
but at least he's considerate.

567
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,601
I don't know
what the fuck's wrong with me.

568
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,395
Sometimes I get so confused.

569
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,563
Yeah, don't worry about it.

570
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,398
I'm just glad
I was in the neighbourhood.

571
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:43,403
I don't know what I would have done
if you hadn't answered.

572
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,905
You're a good kid.

573
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,949
As if I wasn't starting
to feel enough pity for him,

574
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,909
now he's throwing gratitude at me?

575
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:54,664
Keep your eye on the road
or I'll blow your head out the window.

576
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,917
Drive until I tell you to turn.

577
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,794
How did you get on to me?

578
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,087
I don't know
what you're talking about.

579
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,715
You're Miami Metro, Dexter.

580
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,261
I checked your car registration
when you were filling my prescription,

581
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,891
and then I "goggled" your name.
Yeah, that's right, dickwad.

582
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,477
Maybe I haven't taken
a decent shit in 10 years,

583
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,228
but I'm not fucking stupid.

584
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,317
Turn right at the next light.

585
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,283
Where are we going?

586
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,118
To settle our business.

587
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,830
You're gonna tell me
how you figured out who I am.

588
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,207
And then you're gonna kill me?

589
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,209
You haven't left me much choice,
have you?

590
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,129
Left into the next parking lot.

591
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,422
OK.

592
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,259
And just for kicks,

593
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,679
I might rip out all your teeth
before I shoot you.

594
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,974
What the fuck are you...

595
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,113
Those are ready for cataloguing.

596
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,074
Hey, after work tonight,
you want to grab some pho?

597
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,618
Grab some what?

598
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,828
It's Vietnamese food.

599
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,205
It's basically a large bowl
of noodles.

600
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,998
And broth.

601
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,293
So you're asking me out? As in a date?

602
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,462
You don't have to call it that
if you don't want to.

603
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,922
I want to.

604
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,425
So that's a yes?

605
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,926
Yeah.

606
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,762
Wow.

607
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,014
What?

608
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,767
It's just that I ran the conversation
through my mind a bunch of times.

609
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,728
It always ended in rejection
and bodily harm.

610
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,648
You should be more confident.

611
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,067
You know, in the right light,
you're actually kind of cute.

612
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,865
I'm about to interview my top pick
for the detective slot.

613
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,199
I thought you might want to sit in.

614
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,660
No point.
Sam Harmon and I go way back.

615
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,037
- Harmon's not my top choice.
- He's not?

616
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,374
It's Mike Anderson,
the transfer from Chicago.

617
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,502
He's got 10 years on homicide,
a ridiculous solve rate,

618
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,921
recommendations coming out of his ass.

619
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,131
We'd be lucky to have him.

620
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,799
I really put a lot
of thought into this.

621
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,011
If that's true, then I'm seriously
worried about your judgement,

622
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,971
because this is a huge mistake.

623
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,890
I don't think it is.

624
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,641
Look, I know I'm new at this job.

625
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,852
And it's not that
I don't value your advice,

626
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,563
but sometimes I have to trust my gut,

627
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,857
and right now my gut is
telling me Mike Anderson.

628
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,277
It's your decision, Lieutenant.

629
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,404
You can do whatever the hell you want.

630
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,490
But understand this:
You're on your own.

631
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,658
If this doesn't work out,

632
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,203
don't look to me to have your back.

633
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,011
Mike Anderson.
I'm here to see the lieutenant.

634
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,889
That's me. It's great to meet you.
Debra Morgan.

635
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,061
- What's funny?
- You, the lieutenant.

636
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,354
- That a problem?
- Listen.

637
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,940
I just got off a three-hour flight
and I'm really tired,

638
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,318
which means I'm not in the mood
for any cute department razzing.

639
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,695
So will you take me
to your boss, please?

640
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,323
Maybe score me some coffee
on the way, no cream.

641
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,078
You listen.

642
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,413
Right now, you're my top choice
for this job,

643
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,624
but that can change real fucking fast.

644
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,835
I put my ass on the line
even considering you,

645
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,171
so stow the attitude

646
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,839
or the only job you're gonna
find in this city

647
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,676
is guarding a landfill
as a rent-a-cop.

648
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,720
Look, I apologise.
I didn't mean any disrespect.

649
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,224
It's just the other lieutenants
I've served under had...

650
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,559
Dicks?

651
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,644
Been around the block.

652
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,522
Trust me. This is just as weird for me
as it is for you.

653
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,608
Moving on.

654
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,443
Let's talk.

655
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,202
You know,
I just got my car out of the shop.

656
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,162
What the hell is this?

657
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,290
This is the end, Walter.

658
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,793
You pulled your last tooth.

659
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,962
How did I get here?

660
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,213
Service entrance.

661
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,924
I think I tweaked my back.

662
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,051
Fuck me.

663
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,345
You could have spent
your final days relaxing,

664
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,350
enjoying life,
but then there was Rosalia Davolos.

665
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,272
She's the first one in 10 years.
Wasn't she? Why now?

666
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,649
I got tired of staring
at a box of teeth.

667
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,986
Took me 10 minutes to kill the whore.

668
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:39,198
Lost another 20 trying
to pull the goddamn tooth.

669
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,872
You know, when I was in high school,

670
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,916
it seemed you were all
the country was talking about.

671
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,251
The Tooth Fairy.

672
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,254
Too clever for the police.
They couldn't catch you.

673
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,132
Like Burt Reynolds with his Trans Am.

674
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,552
I still can't believe
you are the same man

675
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,221
that dumped a body
at a deputy sheriff's house.

676
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,642
Total fucking accident.

677
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,061
I downed a few too many

678
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,605
and didn't feel like driving out
to the highway

679
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,398
to get rid of the bitch.

680
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,067
That's disappointing.

681
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:17,278
Well, I'm very fucking sorry
to let you down.

682
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,489
Does that mean
you don't want my autograph?

683
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,240
No.

684
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,744
Just this.

685
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,913
I took teeth.

686
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,581
You take blood.

687
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,250
You're the same kind of sick fuck,
aren't you?

688
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,127
At least I'm never gonna
end up like you.

689
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:36,589
Yeah? When you can't do this any more,
what do you have then?

690
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,634
More.

691
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,761
You're kidding yourself, asshole.

692
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,097
All I ever cared about was killing,

693
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,474
and I can't even do that
right any more.

694
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,476
That's what you've got
to look forward to.

695
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:53,022
This is your future,
and it includes adult fucking diapers!

696
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,649
You are not my future.

697
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,360
I will not spend
my final days getting drunk

698
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,362
and staring at a box of trophies.

699
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,948
Keep telling yourself that.

700
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,451
Make sure they know who I am.

701
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,996
I wish I could see the look
on my son's face when he finds out.

702
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,499
He won't be able to ignore that!

703
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,131
I'd never want my son to know
who I was.

704
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,633
You said you didn't have a kid.

705
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,219
I also said my name was Dan.

706
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,725
What are you doing?

707
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,476
You're not gonna die
as the Tooth Fairy.

708
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:34,021
You're gonna die as a sad old man
of a heart attack.

709
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,314
No!

710
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:42,071
The latest resident to check out of
the Coral Island Retirement Village.

711
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,925
Walter Kenney's son will never
know his father was a monster.

712
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,428
Or at least not a killer.

713
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,948
We all want life to have
some kind of meaning.

714
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:39,128
Seems like the older we get,
the harder we look for it...

715
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,770
...and the harder it is to find.

716
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,409
And some of us just look
in the wrong place.

717
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,965
But if our lives don't have meaning...

718
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,426
Horsey, Daddy.

719
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:34,225
...what can we leave behind
for those we care about?

720
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,977
There you go, buddy.

721
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,120
Walter Kenney wanted
to pass on the ugliness

722
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,289
that his life had become.

723
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,140
What will I pass on?

724
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,171
I don't know which slide goes where,
who's who.

725
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,674
There's no order any more.
