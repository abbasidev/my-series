1
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,759
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,012
So far, our killer
has given us three tableaus.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,763
The intestines on the scale,

4
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,266
the snakes victim,
and the four horsemen.

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,144
What about the numbers
we found on the body? 1237 and 1242.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,770
He's counting up to something.

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,273
Maybe it's to the end of the world.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,026
- Dexter.
- Sam, what are you doing here?

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,152
Brother Sam?

10
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,154
Are you guys, like, friends now?

11
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,031
We have a lead.

12
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,199
This Revelation expert, James Gellar.

13
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,785
The professor,
from the University of Tallahassee?

14
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,455
Looks like we just found
our number one person of interest.

15
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,707
You're going out with that woman,
aren't you?

16
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,292
You knew this was gonna happen.

17
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,127
She's part of God's plan now.

18
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,380
Is this Doomsday number two?

19
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,168
During the Middle Ages,

20
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,254
it was believed that the outcome
of nearly all earthly events

21
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,423
was decided by angels,

22
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,425
either light or dark.

23
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,762
I'm quite certain
that face I saw in the crowd

24
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,931
was of the dark variety.

25
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,608
Unfortunately, he's chosen
to remain anonymous.

26
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,151
He left no trace DNA,

27
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,362
no sweat, no saliva, no prints.

28
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,305
A small repair.

29
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,519
Something skin-like.

30
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,402
Not your normal glue.

31
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,322
Despite his wish to remain hidden,

32
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,159
I may find a way to yank him
out of the shadows after all.

33
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,348
Eyes on God, not me.

34
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,689
- And all God's people said, "Amen".
- Amen.

35
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,190
Help me up.

36
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,530
It's time to do a little hunting.

37
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,366
I thought that we had some time.

38
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,868
You still don't hear him.

39
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,207
I've been fasting and praying
for days,

40
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,252
and all I can hear
is the sound of my own voice

41
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,712
banging around my head.

42
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,047
God remains silent to me.

43
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,383
It's a good thing I'm around,

44
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,887
cos we have to find
the whore of Babylon.

45
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,772
I was right about the glue,

46
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,776
a polyvinyl acetate polymer
dissolved in toluene.

47
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,912
And the backing is calfskin.

48
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,125
Together they're used
in ancient manuscript restoration.

49
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,004
Dude, your sister, briefing room, now.

50
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,923
OK, thanks. I'll be there in a minute.

51
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,634
This is no amateur.

52
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,639
Thank you for joining us, Dexter.

53
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,266
OK, everyone, let's get started.

54
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,102
Our victim is Erin Baer, 29.

55
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,189
She worked at the Glass House Café
at the Miami Cultural Centre.

56
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,774
Miami Cultural Centre,

57
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,318
full of ancient artefacts
in need of repair.

58
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,487
I want unis
plastering Gellar's picture

59
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,613
all over the area.

60
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,114
Maybe someone got eyes on him there.

61
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,824
- I'll take lead on that.
- Great.

62
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,785
Where are we on
the Revelation aspect of this?

63
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,454
Between the trumpet flowers
placed around her,

64
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,956
the locusts,
and the iconography of an angel,

65
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,958
our Doomsday Killer
was most likely referencing

66
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,002
Revelation, chapters 8 through 10.

67
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,545
Any idea why he changed it up?

68
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,465
Why our entrance triggered her death?

69
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,134
Normally a serial killer
wants to do the kill themselves.

70
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,302
It's the whole point, right?

71
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,808
There's a passage which reads,

72
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,643
"You must go back
and report your message

73
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,563
"to many peoples and nations
and languages and kings."

74
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,148
So I'm guessing we're those people.

75
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,985
It seems his message is more important
than the thrill.

76
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,821
Tell me you got something
from the ME's office.

77
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,824
She found traces of spermicide
in Erin Baer.

78
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,201
The ME's take
is that the victim had sex

79
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,828
with someone
who used a spermicidal condom.

80
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,746
So what are we thinking,
that she just happened to have sex

81
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,164
before she was kidnapped?

82
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,834
Or maybe she met Gellar,
had sex with him,

83
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,169
and things got ugly for her.

84
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,754
Or maybe it was Gellar's accomplice.

85
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,214
Can't say for sure either way.

86
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,217
As far as we know,
she didn't know Gellar.

87
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,094
What did we get on Gellar's last gig?

88
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,345
I've been trying to contact

89
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,099
his last teacher assistant,
Carissa Porter.

90
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,727
But so far University of Tallahassee
has given us shit-all.

91
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,106
University's not exactly thrilled
to be linked to Professor Nutbag.

92
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,524
Let's go up there
and make it clear to them

93
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,359
that we don't give a shit
whether they're thrilled or not.

94
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,735
I'm on it.

95
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,195
Lab boys, what do we have?

96
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,532
I've got locusts.

97
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,909
But the necropsy on them
turned up jack and shit.

98
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,619
All they ate was local greenery.

99
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,038
What about the dead fish
outside the angel crime scene?

100
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,458
All local.
You can catch them off any pier,

101
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,377
buy them at any fish market.

102
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,963
But we did find...

103
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,925
...another number.

104
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,386
This one lodged in Erin's oesophagus.

105
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,388
1244.

106
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,265
Same paper and ink as the other two.

107
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,894
1237, 1242, 1244.

108
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,730
I did a check into that number's usage
in the Book of Revelation...

109
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,064
Excuse me.

110
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,566
Who's this?

111
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,778
Louis Greene,
the latest and greatest intern

112
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,946
from my forensics class.

113
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,740
He's up to speed
on the whole Doomsday case.

114
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,408
- What happened to the blonde?
- She's gone.

115
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,787
Go on, Louis.

116
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:23,251
Yeah, well,
numerology is all over Revelation,

117
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,920
but the only number
that's repeatedly referenced

118
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,173
that's in the thousands is 1,260.

119
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,175
1260. You think
that's what he's counting up to?

120
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,011
If so, we've only got 15 days left.

121
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,429
And then what?

122
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,764
I don't know.

123
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,849
End of the world,
the rapture, Armageddon.

124
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,185
More apocalyptic bullshit.

125
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,437
Dex, please tell me
you have something we can use.

126
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,314
I hate lying to my sister, but...

127
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,858
Sorry, nothing on the wings.

128
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,111
OK, let's keep at it.

129
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,697
Let's find this jizzbucket Gellar.

130
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,701
Class dismissed.

131
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:05,043
Hey. All that tippity-tappy stuff
you do on the laptop,

132
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,712
you're kind of a whizz
with computers, aren't you?

133
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,465
I tool around.
I've done some consulting.

134
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,883
I've made a couple RPGs.

135
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,719
Role-playing games. Nice.

136
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:19,349
Any of them feature Amazon women
of immense strength, by any chance?

137
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,979
- No.
- That's OK.

138
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,690
Anyway, you mind?

139
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,191
Yeah, yeah.

140
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,825
Ice Truck Killer?

141
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,495
Let's keep it down, all right?

142
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,331
It was stolen from our evidence room,

143
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,166
and if word gets out
we're losing evidence,

144
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,669
this department's street cred
goes straight down the shitter.

145
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,254
Why don't you just get it back
from the seller?

146
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,840
I tried. You have to give the site
what you're selling

147
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,550
before they agree to auction it.

148
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,844
- Fuckers.
- I see.

149
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,388
So, my question to you is...

150
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,099
Can I make this problem go away?

151
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,685
I'll look into it.

152
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,240
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- A minute.

153
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,537
- This is awkward.
- What?

154
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,290
The engagement ring.

155
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,378
Fuck me in the ear,
I never gave it back to you.

156
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,923
Yeah, it's just that
I got 30 days to return it,

157
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,550
and since we're not gonna use...

158
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,552
I'll get it back to you. I'm so sorry.

159
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,138
It's OK. I mean, you've had
a lot on your plate lately.

160
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,187
I better go.

161
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,398
Got some professors to harass.

162
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,660
- Hello?
- Jamie, it's Debra.

163
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,078
I need a little favour from you.

164
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,247
About two weeks ago,
I brought a ring box home

165
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,457
with an engagement ring in it.

166
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,167
You lost an engagement ring?

167
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,338
I left it on Harrison's side
of the apartment. Have you seen it?

168
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,632
No.

169
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,884
Do you think you could look for it?

170
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:22,389
I'd really appreciate all the help
I can get right now. Thank you. Bye.

171
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,562
- Hey, Dex.
- Sam.

172
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,731
Hey. Hey, how your little man doing?

173
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,442
He's doing great.
You should come by and see him.

174
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,903
Yeah, OK. I'd love to. Yeah.

175
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,031
How about tonight?

176
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,951
Great, great.

177
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,703
Well, say 8:00?

178
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,831
- Perfect.
- Cool. Good.

179
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,542
You didn't come all the way out here
just to ask about Harrison, did you?

180
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,127
Yeah, I wish.

181
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,881
Some of Nick's old crew,
they came by and shot up the shop.

182
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,719
- Anybody hurt?
- No, it was an after-hours thing.

183
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,180
It's just bullet holes
in the garage door. That's about it.

184
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,433
I called the cops,
but nobody showed up,

185
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,310
so without the cop report,
the insurance don't do shit.

186
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,896
- You ever think of moving?
- No.

187
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,608
God put me there
to do what I'm doing, man.

188
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,152
I don't scare off.

189
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,486
You're a brave man, Sam.

190
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,363
O.G. For G-O-D, know what I'm saying?

191
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,698
Yep.

192
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,116
Nope.

193
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,535
- See you tonight.
- All right.

194
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,129
Excuse me, do you work here?

195
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,173
Read my tag. I'm a docent.

196
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,883
How may I help you?

197
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,260
I accidentally poked a hole

198
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,095
in a painting that belongs to my boss.

199
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,097
I put my elbow right through it.

200
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,807
I know. I'm such an idiot.

201
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,436
- Is there someone I can talk to...
- Follow me.

202
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,687
OK.

203
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,149
- Here at the museum...
- Right in here.

204
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,609
- Thank you.
...a lot of the action

205
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,569
is behind the scenes.

206
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,029
For nearly 35 years...

207
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,864
I'm sorry. This isn't exactly...

208
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,491
Have you seen this before?

209
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,119
- No.
- Well, sit down and watch it.

210
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,538
It's very informative.
That's why we made it.

211
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,208
...staining, colourations.

212
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,460
They can make the art look

213
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,463
almost exactly the way
the artist intended it,

214
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,007
all while using the same materials

215
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,384
that the artist used
during his or her own lifetime.

216
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,345
You wouldn't believe
how people end up treating

217
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,807
what can end up
being priceless works of art,

218
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,434
especially in
our paper conservation laboratory,

219
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,478
where we're equipped with...

220
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,023
It's him.

221
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,652
The face I'm looking for.
He works here.

222
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,029
That's how he knew
how to create those wings.

223
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,118
Morgan.

224
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,663
This is Detective Anderson.

225
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,540
Dispatch gave me your number.

226
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,167
We need a blood guy on the double.
We're out at Miami Shores.

227
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,045
1588, northeast end of 2nd Street.

228
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,296
Got it.

229
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:04,467
Using radiograms
and infrared imaging...

230
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,097
Do you happen to know the name of...

231
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,932
Worst docent ever.

232
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,832
What do we got?

233
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,041
Male and female.

234
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,543
Forties.

235
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,461
Pictures on the walls
and rings on their fingers

236
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,589
make them man and wife.

237
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,635
Three gunshots.
One to the chest, two to the stomach.

238
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,637
A fresh cut on the face
not from a gunshot.

239
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,682
- Maybe the fall.
- No, he fell back.

240
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,351
It looks more like a glancing blow.

241
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,903
Cell phone.

242
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,907
Maybe she threw it at him.

243
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,700
That's not the wife.

244
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,373
Single gunshot to the chest,

245
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,834
through and through,
shot at close range.

246
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,045
No gun in sight.

247
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,713
Give me a hand.

248
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,720
We have our shooter.

249
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,477
The husband leaves, forgets his phone,
the wife finds the pictures...

250
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,228
Wife throws phone
at two-timing bastard.

251
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,939
And shoots him.

252
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,106
Three times.

253
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,525
She realises what she did.
She's distraught.

254
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,403
She turns the gun to her chest
and blam.

255
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,656
Murder-suicide.

256
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,491
Took you all of 15 seconds
to solve that.

257
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,076
It was a pretty easy one.

258
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,079
Hey, how the hell does
a pro like you stand working

259
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,915
with the rest of
these Miami Homicide chuckleheads?

260
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:03,086
No, they're actually pretty good,
especially my sister Deb.

261
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,505
You probably know her
as Lieutenant Morgan.

262
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,926
- Excuse me, Detective?
- Hey, you can't be in here.

263
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,554
No, no, no. It's OK.
I own the place. They just...

264
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,098
Oh, my God.

265
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,183
Can I help you?

266
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,769
I don't mean to sound crass,

267
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,104
but how long will they stay here?

268
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,230
Till we finish.

269
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,023
Then the ME will remove the bodies.

270
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,527
And then how long will it take
for you to clean it up?

271
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,529
Do I look like your maid?

272
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,388
It's hard not to look.

273
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,224
What? I'm sorry.

274
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,684
It's OK.

275
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,438
God gave man the desire
to look at women.

276
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,733
It's the devil
who made them dress like that.

277
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,819
- That's not it.
- What?

278
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,489
It's sad.
All of these people are doomed,

279
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,991
and they don't even know it.

280
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,409
It is sad.

281
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,414
You're very sensitive, Travis.

282
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,207
That's why you've been chosen.

283
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,630
Is that you?

284
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,185
It's not bad, huh?

285
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,228
They're calling you
"The Doomsday Killer".

286
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,147
It's kind of catchy.

287
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,485
I probably should stay out of sight.

288
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,698
You may have to find our whore
without me.

289
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,826
- By myself? I can't.
- Yes, you can.

290
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,079
I believe in you.

291
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,997
God believes in you.

292
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,817
I have a face. Now I just need a name.

293
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,374
"Ancient manuscript restoration
and conservation."

294
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,551
No arrests, no warrants.

295
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,808
No moving violations,
not even a parking ticket.

296
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,352
Appears you live a quiet little life

297
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,896
on 1742 Vanderan Street.

298
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,734
Ready to see Brother Sam?

299
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,240
- Hey.
- Hey, Sam. Come on in.

300
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,451
Let me take those for you.

301
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,744
Nice.

302
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,873
Nice place you got here, man.

303
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,207
Thanks.

304
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,335
Hey, little man. How you doing?

305
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,463
He's sleepy. It's about his bedtime.

306
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,674
I'm right on time then, cos...

307
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,594
it's his bedtime, too.

308
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,430
Maybe you could put him
to sleep for me?

309
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,806
Yeah?

310
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,017
Can you say "thank you", Harrison?

311
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,271
Thank you, Harrison, for helping me
put my little man to sleep.

312
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,316
- Either way, it's very nice of you.
- Not a problem.

313
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,151
How's he doing after the surgery?

314
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,403
- He's doing great.
- That's good.

315
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,072
I'm gonna put him to bed.
I'll just be a few minutes.

316
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,533
All right. Good night, little man.

317
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,119
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

318
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,706
And now, I guess,
Sam and I are gonna hang out.

319
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,502
That's a cute boy you got there, man.

320
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,004
Yeah, he's a keeper.

321
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,842
It must be kind of hard for you, man.

322
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:25,014
Just get up every day, leave,
and go do what you do.

323
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,559
Do what I do?

324
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,228
Homicide every day.

325
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,023
How you end up in that, man?

326
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,734
My dad was a cop.
I just sort of fell into it.

327
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,821
Doesn't sound like the kind of thing
somebody just fall into.

328
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,116
What really happened?

329
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,413
I guess in a weird way
I was sort of drawn to it,

330
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,958
- the blood work.
- Why?

331
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,132
When I was three,
I watched my own mother get killed.

332
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,762
Something like that stays with you.

333
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,847
That's rough, man. I'm sorry.

334
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:11,018
Seeing that so young,
the darkness got in deep.

335
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,772
Never left me. Never will.

336
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,401
You remember anything before she died?

337
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,319
I don't know.

338
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,992
I remember at night
she would wrap me in a quilt

339
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,952
and sing songs to me.

340
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,873
Sometimes she'd trace her finger
along my ear.

341
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,460
Tickling me.

342
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,337
Must have made you feel good.

343
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,714
It did.

344
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,590
She was sharing that light with you.

345
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,634
It's with you now.

346
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,553
It's inside you.

347
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,805
Think you got the wrong guy.

348
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,979
You know, the good book tells us

349
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:58,107
that there's no darkness
that the light can't overcome.

350
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,652
So all the darkness that
you think you got inside you...

351
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,904
- Yeah?
- All it takes is just

352
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,074
a little bit of light
to keep it at bay.

353
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,243
Believe me. I know.

354
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,664
It's like with your son, man.

355
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,458
And see?

356
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,002
I just mention him,
and you just light right up.

357
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,504
I guess I do.

358
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,258
And you're sharing that light with him
every day, all the time.

359
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,219
You really think so?

360
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,554
I see it.

361
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,266
You just got to let it out.

362
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,985
This is really nice, man.

363
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,281
We got to do this again sometime.

364
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,092
Hey! Hey, hey!

365
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,261
Put her down!

366
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,430
Get the fuck out of here!

367
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,140
Help me! Help!

368
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,310
Travis.

369
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,813
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry.

370
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,234
- I couldn't do it. I... I tried.
- It's OK.

371
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,488
Many heroes of the faith
have endured their failures.

372
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,825
God's grace prevailed then, too.

373
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,743
I thought I could do it.

374
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,206
It's my fault really.

375
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,041
I shouldn't have let you
go do this alone.

376
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,294
Tomorrow night,
I'll be there with you.

377
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,629
What about the police?

378
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,717
Do you think God's gonna allow
anything to slow us down now?

379
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,928
You go home,

380
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,389
get some rest.

381
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,391
Tomorrow night, we'll start again.

382
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,654
Tomorrow night.

383
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,078
Brother Sam says
we all have a light inside us.

384
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,249
If I find Travis Marshall
to be guilty,

385
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,215
then I will snuff out his light.

386
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,984
He's neat.

387
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,403
Everything in its right place.

388
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,831
Masters degree in art history
from the University of Tallahassee,

389
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,709
the same place Gellar taught at
before he disappeared.

390
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,232
I understand the urge
to end someone's life,

391
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,819
but what is this fascination
with ending the world?

392
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,553
Looks like the same numbers
we found in the Doomsday victims.

393
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,372
Defacing a Bible.
I'm probably breaking a rule.

394
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,093
Hello, Doomsday Killer.

395
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,679
I swear to God, you're the only cop
I know that drives the speed limit.

396
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,930
That car's not a toy.

397
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,015
In the right conditions,
it'll top 110 easy.

398
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,183
And these weren't
the right conditions?

399
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,434
No.

400
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,440
Is that our professor?

401
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,858
Professor Porter?

402
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,444
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Detective Quinn.

403
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,822
This is Sergeant Batista.
Miami Metro Homicide.

404
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,533
Doctor Knudson, the department head,
said we'd find you here.

405
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,951
Right.

406
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,536
He told me you were coming.

407
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,288
So you knew Professor Gellar?

408
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,833
I did. But I want to state upfront

409
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,127
that Professor Gellar
didn't have anything to do

410
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,170
with those crazy Revelation killings.

411
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,630
And you know this how?

412
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,299
I was his teacher's assistant
for a year.

413
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,801
He even helped me get my job.

414
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,469
Have you seen him recently?

415
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,804
No, not since he left.

416
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,640
- When was that?
- Three years ago, about.

417
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,892
What about his blog,
The Beginning of the End?

418
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,060
I mean, you have to admit,

419
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,812
there's some pretty crazy stuff
on there,

420
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,355
and a lot of it
is in line with the killings.

421
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,190
He likes to stir up trouble,

422
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,527
make people think.

423
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,363
That's what made everyone love him.

424
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,365
So you loved him?

425
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,034
Was he eccentric?

426
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,244
Yeah.

427
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,037
But he was also smart,

428
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,664
charismatic,

429
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,166
brilliant even.

430
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,335
He saw things between lines of text
that nobody else could.

431
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,380
Being with him
was an incredible adventure.

432
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,174
So you did love him?

433
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,343
- We were close.
- Close?

434
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,429
Smart woman like you, with your looks,

435
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,181
I bet he was hitting on you
all the time.

436
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,432
I mean, fuck, if we worked together,

437
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,351
I'd have a hard time
not wanting to get close to you.

438
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,396
It was more than just a flirtation.

439
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,690
We lived together.

440
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,233
For a while.

441
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,693
You're not together any more.

442
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,029
My year as his TA ended,

443
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,032
he found another cute brunette,
did the same thing with her.

444
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,701
Gellar had a thing
for brunette students?

445
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,079
I found out I was one
in a long line of girls,

446
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,458
but, you know what?
It was no big deal.

447
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,419
I'm glad I got the chance to know him.
He was good to me.

448
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,797
Erin, our angel, was a brunette.

449
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:06,136
Well...
if by some miracle he contacts you...

450
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,971
You'll be the first one I call,

451
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,724
if only to prove
you have the wrong guy.

452
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,561
Hey... Professor Porter,

453
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,897
we're gonna be
stuck here for the night.

454
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,066
You wouldn't happen to
know of any good spots

455
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,109
where we could get a drink
this evening, would you?

456
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,569
Like some place kind of quiet?

457
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,613
Maybe I do.

458
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,410
Jesus Christ.

459
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,006
Do you always bring your work
home with you?

460
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,342
I can't work for fuck
in my new office.

461
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,762
It's like LaGuerta's perfume
seeped into the walls.

462
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,764
If she ever had a soul,
it's still in there.

463
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,102
Life was so much simpler when
all I had to do was solve murders.

464
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,854
Red to black. What it's all about.

465
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,605
Who did it?

466
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,649
Wife. Murder-suicide.

467
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,026
That brother of yours

468
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,153
solved it like he was
getting a message from the dead.

469
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,697
Yeah, he's something special.

470
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,324
Nice place.

471
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,119
Right by the beach, too.

472
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,830
Nothing like a murder-suicide
to fuck up a great house.

473
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,290
I've seen worse.

474
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,375
Male, 70s,

475
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,627
self-inflicted shotgun
in the brainpan,

476
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,379
which is bad enough,

477
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,464
but he had cats

478
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,633
- and they got hungry.
- Enough said.

479
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,218
Chicago.

480
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,220
Miss it?

481
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,848
Miss the food.

482
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,475
You can't get
a decent hotdog anywhere.

483
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,854
But homicide is homicide.

484
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,357
Yeah. I see the way
you look at people around here.

485
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,153
You got the world's youngest LT,
Batista and his hot rod,

486
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,362
Masuka with...

487
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,365
I made the mistake of going
in his lab unannounced. He was...

488
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,658
Enough said.

489
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,579
He's got some fucked-up shit going on,
but he gets it done.

490
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,331
The same could be said for you.

491
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,001
Good night, Anderson.

492
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:09,176
I'm grading this paper,
when all of a sudden I realise

493
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,928
I've read this before.

494
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,095
No way.

495
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,765
This dumbass student
changed some words around,

496
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,017
but he plagiarised C.S. Lewis.

497
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,020
C.S. Lewis.

498
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,231
I should arrest this guy right now.
I've got my cuffs on me.

499
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,733
We can go. I mean...

500
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:28,195
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah? You want another round?

501
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,031
You're not married, are you?

502
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,866
Definitely not.

503
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,534
Then I want another drink.

504
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,203
Another round, please.

505
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,537
Thank you.

506
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,915
Look who shows up
when I'm buying drinks.

507
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,543
Listen, we got a long ride
down to Miami tomorrow.

508
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,920
You want to call it?

509
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,255
One second.

510
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,763
You can call it if you want,
but I'm about to cross

511
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,724
a fucking college professor
off my bucket list.

512
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,394
Be careful, partner.
She's part of our investigation.

513
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,562
No, she's not.
She's just like a nice person

514
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,897
we talked to, you know what I mean?

515
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,068
There's like 20 other women here
you could fuck.

516
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,321
I've already spent like
80 bucks on her, though, you know,

517
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,741
so it's like, I don't want to
have to start all over again.

518
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,993
Get out of here. Come on.

519
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,412
We'll see each other
in the morning, all right?

520
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,581
- You're unbelievable.
- Yeah, go on, baby.

521
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,585
And there they are.

522
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,131
Thank you.

523
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,590
Here's to you.

524
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,210
Hi, buddy.

525
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,963
Are you going to sleep?

526
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,467
Are you going to bed? Are you tired?

527
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,804
- Found your ring.
- Oh, jeez, you're a lifesaver.

528
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,307
Deb, really?

529
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,520
Shit.

530
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,649
He came in here
to give you a good night kiss,

531
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,193
not look at pictures of dead bodies.

532
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,653
Yeah, well, maybe
if you gave me a little warning.

533
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,655
Isn't there anywhere else
you can do this, Deb?

534
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,657
Right now? No. Nowhere.

535
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,743
Really? The lieutenant
doesn't get an office?

536
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,996
I don't like my office.
I like to work here.

537
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,999
Harrison's got an entire
goddamn apartment over there.

538
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,167
I've got jack shit.

539
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,086
He just wanted to say good night.

540
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,880
I know that. Next time,
why don't you call me over there?

541
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,507
I will. From now on.

542
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,220
And maybe you could keep
the photos on Dexter's desk,

543
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,679
so Harrison won't see them.

544
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,556
Again, if you were doing your job,

545
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,183
this wouldn't have happened
in the first place.

546
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,726
My job?

547
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,019
- Yes.
- Really?

548
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,231
You mean my job isn't to be
your fucking maid?

549
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,609
- I found it in Harrison's toy box.
- Thank you. Thanks.

550
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,069
You're really lucky he didn't eat it.

551
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,195
Please.

552
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,696
- Thank God you're home.
- Hello.

553
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,365
She needs to do a better job
of watching Harrison.

554
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,242
She is bringing home
all of these horrible pictures.

555
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,119
Would it be weird if I just left?

556
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,703
- Please, Deb.
...take care of this?

557
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,206
Hey, Jamie,

558
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,542
if Harrison's down for the night,
maybe you should just go on home.

559
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,711
- See you tomorrow.
- OK.

560
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,634
Are you taking her side on this?

561
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:41,429
No, I'll talk to her, too, tomorrow,
but, Deb...

562
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,600
you gotta admit,
this isn't good for Harrison.

563
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,103
Yeah. I'm a mess.

564
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,898
Maybe I do need to go to therapy.

565
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,234
No more than me.

566
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,736
Am I that fucked up?

567
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,915
Bet you they don't even know
each other's names.

568
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,461
No wonder he wants us to end it all.

569
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,758
These two.

570
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,677
Follow them.

571
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,846
Are you sure? He looks pretty big.

572
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,270
He's not as big as God.

573
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,443
Go on.

574
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,322
Get the girl before somebody comes.
Put her in the trunk.

575
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,496
Help me.

576
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,832
I'm sorry.

577
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,303
See how easy it is?

578
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,643
Come on.

579
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,318
Hey, come on in.

580
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,655
- Where's Quinn?
- Bathroom.

581
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,156
I'll get him.

582
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,375
Joey, your friend's here.

583
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,594
"The Alpha and Omega
of the Enesserette."

584
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,252
Professor Porter,
could you come out here?

585
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,758
Excuse me, what are you doing?

586
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,510
These drawings, they were Gellar's?

587
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:08,845
You can't just start
picking through...

588
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,263
Did Gellar do this?

589
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,516
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.

590
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,311
- Did he?
- Well, yeah. Let me see.

591
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,443
Holy shit.

592
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,792
- Can I help you?
- Michelle Ross.

593
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,669
The therapist you've been dodging
for weeks.

594
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,546
Fuck. I'm sorry.

595
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,382
Happens more than you'd think.

596
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,634
I figured since you weren't
coming to my office...

597
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,636
That you would come to mine.

598
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,514
Believe me, I understand.

599
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,976
So we should probably
get down to business, right?

600
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,062
Right here, right now?

601
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,231
Is that OK?

602
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,859
Let's do this.

603
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,490
OK, just to clarify,

604
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,201
this is in reference to
the shooting at Don Aldo's?

605
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,663
Have you been experiencing
any lack of sleep

606
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,749
- from the shooting in question?
- From the shooting, no.

607
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,210
Have you found yourself
dwelling on that day?

608
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,629
No. Who has time?

609
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,007
Have you found it hard to
concentrate on day-to-day tasks

610
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,468
- because of the incident?
- No.

611
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,722
Find yourself drinking
more than you did before the shooting?

612
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,724
Fuck, I don't drink enough.

613
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,979
That was a joke.

614
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,191
Have you been experiencing
any guilt since the shooting?

615
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,862
No. If he walked through that door,
I'd shoot him right now.

616
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,576
Great.

617
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,203
So it sounds like everything's fine.

618
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,790
Yeah. Everything's great
with the shooting.

619
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,877
It's just everything that's happened
since then that's fucking me up.

620
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,213
Like what?

621
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,718
Like being lieutenant.

622
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,723
And all the day-to-day bullshit
that comes with it.

623
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,894
Got the Doomsday Killer
doing his shit in my city and...

624
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:24,230
I try to do any work in here,
and I can't, and...

625
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,566
Did I mention
I just broke up with my boyfriend

626
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,901
and I don't have a place
to live any more,

627
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,486
so, at the end of the day,
I can't even go home?

628
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,071
I'm living with my brother
and his son, and...

629
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,493
Don't get me wrong,
I love them, it's just...

630
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,913
There's a reason I'm an aunt
and not a parent and...

631
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,419
I just feel like I don't have a space
to call my own right now.

632
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,760
So maybe you should get
some place that's your own.

633
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,814
Detective Anderson and girlfriend.

634
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,483
Her? No way.

635
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,443
I'm married. She's my boss.

636
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,863
Lieutenant Debra Morgan,
Miami Metro Homicide.

637
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,490
I'm so sorry.
I thought that you two...

638
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,783
- Don't worry about it.
- My bad.

639
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,785
Can we get this crime scene tape down?

640
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,954
Wow, it takes a lieutenant to tell me

641
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,455
it's OK to rent this place.

642
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,457
- Can we go inside?
- By all means.

643
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,505
Thank you.

644
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:37,220
I wanted to come by and see
if I could possibly rent the place.

645
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,516
The floors are a mess.

646
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,520
- Yeah, they are, aren't they?
- Yes, they are.

647
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,648
Might have to replace them.

648
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,402
- I mean, the toxic damage.
- Toxic?

649
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,195
Blood-borne antigens.

650
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,698
Can live for two weeks easy.

651
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,494
Of course, hep C is always a risk.

652
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,496
I didn't know that.

653
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,498
Oh, God, just what I needed.

654
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,418
Look,

655
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:12,046
it's no secret you're gonna have
a hell of a time renting this place.

656
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,216
Legally, you're required to
disclose the murder-suicide.

657
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,011
- But I already know about it.
- And?

658
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,724
What if I was to give you

659
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,518
two-thirds of the current rent
right now, today?

660
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:32,358
Make that three-quarters, two-year
lease, and you clean up the place.

661
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,403
Looks like you got yourself
a new tenant.

662
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,607
What's the...
What's the progress on the...

663
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,735
Yeah, all right,
I did everything I know how,

664
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,279
but I wasn't able
to get the hand back.

665
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,239
The buyer bought it using
an E-sniper programme

666
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,326
that firewalls the buyer,
so whoever's got it's got it for good.

667
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,746
- Fuck.
- However...

668
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,748
I do like the sound of your however.

669
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,417
...I erased any trace of the sale
from the Internet.

670
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,961
So I'm sorry,
that's the best I can do.

671
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,923
So if one were to look online...

672
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,008
It's like it never happened.

673
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,344
And I never checked it
out of evidence.

674
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,180
There's no trail coming back to here.

675
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,766
At the worst, the evidence room
fucked up, not us.

676
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,519
Our department's safe.

677
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,271
And while I was on your computer,

678
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,774
I improved your credit rating,
installed a modded-up Intel chip

679
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,943
to over-clock your CPU
and, most importantly,

680
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,153
I added a porn scrubber to that thing.

681
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,618
My man. Give it up, Lou.

682
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,123
Thank you.

683
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,310
Drive out of the parking structure,

684
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,812
turn right on Flagler

685
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,523
and then drive on
past the Miami River.

686
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,817
Nod if you understand.

687
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,491
You can take the car.

688
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,661
It's yours, my wallet,
whatever you want.

689
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,872
I want none of those things, Travis.

690
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:57,587
- What do you want?
- I want your life.

691
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,923
Just like the ones you took.

692
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,842
Doomsday Killer.

693
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,886
God. God!

694
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,013
Yeah, let's start with him.
I suppose it was God

695
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,682
who told you to
kill all those innocent people.

696
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,517
God doesn't talk to me.

697
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,436
Then how do you know?

698
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,857
He talks to Professor Gellar.

699
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,358
And how do you know he talks to God?

700
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,902
Cos I've seen it.

701
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:28,117
God speaks to the professor.
He speaks through the professor.

702
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,621
Keep going.

703
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,706
Before I met him, I was lost.

704
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,710
But then the professor,
he showed me the truth.

705
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,545
He showed me the way.

706
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,716
He's a prophet
filled with truth and light.

707
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,092
Bullshit!

708
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,890
You killed those people
because you like it.

709
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,141
Answer me!

710
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,311
I couldn't do it.

711
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,317
I'm a failure. I'm failing God.

712
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,569
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

713
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:08,074
Yes, yes, I wanted
to kill those people,

714
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,450
but I couldn't.

715
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,746
You're saying Gellar does the killing?

716
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,583
He's so much stronger than me.

717
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,797
With him, there's...
there's no fear,

718
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,091
there's no regret. But with me it's...

719
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,677
it's pathetic.

720
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,977
Gellar is pulling you
toward the darkness, Travis,

721
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,186
not the light.

722
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,983
No, you don't know.

723
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,820
Trust me, I know more
about darkness than most,

724
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,947
and Gellar is pure darkness.

725
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,285
You need to find
someone else to follow.

726
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,661
Pull over.

727
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,794
- Get out of the car.
- What?

728
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,212
Get out and start walking away.

729
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,381
You'll find your car
back at the museum.

730
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,690
One way or another,
Travis will lead me

731
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,151
to the one
who really deserves my table.

732
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,160
Where are you?

733
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,662
I'm on my way home.

734
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:43,419
- What's going on?
- I don't feel good.

735
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:48,507
I've got... I just feel sick.
I should get some sleep.

736
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,260
Travis, what are you not telling me?

737
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,013
Nothing. Nothing.
I just... I feel sick.

738
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,350
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Hey!

739
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,519
You remember the story
about Jonah and the great fish?

740
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:07,401
Jonah tried to run from God.
He didn't get too far.

741
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,030
Hope you're not trying
to run from God, too.

742
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,241
Think about it.

743
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,381
I don't believe in angels,

744
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,132
but I do believe
there's a constant struggle

745
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,218
between light and dark in the world.

746
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,815
Who knows? Maybe Brother Sam is right.

747
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,109
Maybe sometimes the light can win out.

748
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,622
But in my experience,
darkness usually prevails.
