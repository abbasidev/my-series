1
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,677
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:12,845
What do you think we're up against?

3
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,180
I mean, leaving the intestines on
the scale wasn't done by accident.

4
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,433
The body part removal
could be drug-related.

5
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,351
It could be Santería, voodoo.

6
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,270
Attendance in our preschool

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,023
guarantees your child admission
to our secondary school.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,649
So you are Catholic?

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,151
Actually, I'm not.

10
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,944
What do you believe in, Mr Morgan?

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,613
Nothing. I don't believe in anything.

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,490
You can believe
whatever you want to believe,

13
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,451
but it's not just about you any more.

14
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,996
What kind of father keeps
blood slides in his apartment?

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,459
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Captain LaGuerta.

16
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,380
Seems small without your stuff.

17
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,966
- Had to make room for you.
- I'm acting LT only.

18
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,385
Not if I recommend you
for the position full-time.

19
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,221
What is going on with you?
You're acting so weird lately.

20
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,016
Debra, will you marry me?

21
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,185
God, I sound like a fucking idiot.

22
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,313
Get down, get down! Everybody down!

23
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,531
- What have we got here?
- Floater, washed ashore.

24
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,657
Some lady called it in.

25
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,659
Doesn't look like somebody
was trying to hide him.

26
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,661
More like they wanted
the body to be found.

27
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,246
There's something inside.

28
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,249
Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!

29
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,001
This is no amateur.

30
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,087
So it's begun?

31
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,674
Yes. It's begun.

32
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,377
Until a few days ago,

33
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,130
I was convinced
there was nothing I believed in.

34
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,134
But I was wrong.
There is something I truly believe.

35
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,972
Everything's better
after a bubble bath.

36
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,976
Rituals are important.

37
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:58,153
Not just for a serial killer,
but also for a two-year-old,

38
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,072
if you want him to go to bed on time.

39
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,494
Put him back.

40
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,997
Not that I mind,
this ritual has become my favourite.

41
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:13,210
Bedtime. Alone with my son.
Being myself.

42
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,172
- Monster story, Daddy.
- Again?

43
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,675
OK, I may have told him
this one before.

44
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:28,058
Once upon a time
there was a little chino,

45
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,894
scaring everyone who lived
in the hood.

46
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,273
Nobody knew what to do. But Daddy did.

47
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,861
He would slay that icky monster,

48
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,031
hiding what was left of him
in a special place

49
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,075
that no one would ever find.

50
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,411
Daddy's box.

51
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,417
You know about Daddy's box?

52
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,379
I always knew this day would come.

53
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,549
Just not so soon.

54
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,721
I'm not sure
how this next chapter goes.

55
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,106
- Is that the last of them?
- Just one more to go.

56
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,234
We'll be ready soon.

57
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,904
I may be a little late tomorrow.

58
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,242
And you tell me that now?

59
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,665
Can't help it. It shouldn't take long.
Nothing's changed.

60
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,587
- Travis, we have to find another.
- Don't you think I already know that?

61
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,597
Now look what you've done.

62
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,767
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
- No, it's OK. It's OK.

63
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,603
These things happen.

64
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,608
I just want to make sure
that I can rely on you.

65
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,528
- Of course.
- Good boy.

66
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,548
Hello.

67
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,474
Wow.

68
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,684
Full-on breakfast.

69
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,312
Yeah, juice is in the fridge.
Freshly squeezed.

70
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,023
Fresh-squeezed.
Well, aren't we the fucking Kennedys.

71
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,150
A good breakfast is a good way
to start the day.

72
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,985
Yeah, another day
of sitting on our asses,

73
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,406
waiting for OIS to clear us
on the restaurant shooting.

74
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,032
Pancakes?

75
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,661
You do realise the bar is set
very high with me and pancakes.

76
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,079
My dad's were the best.

77
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,707
What the fuck?

78
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,003
What are you doing?

79
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,423
I wanted to do this the other night,

80
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,758
but the shooting sort of
messed everything up.

81
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,096
Debra Morgan, will you...

82
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,181
- Are you insane?
- Come on, Deb.

83
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,516
I'm trying to
be fucking romantic here.

84
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,352
Romantic isn't springing
something like this on me.

85
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,230
When have we ever
talked about marriage?

86
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,025
Will you get up?

87
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,862
Come on, Deb,
we've been at this for a year.

88
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,864
You make me happy, I make you happy.

89
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,574
- So?
- So...

90
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,869
- I love you.
- But...

91
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,330
This is huge!

92
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,250
You don't like the ring?
Is it the ring?

93
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,627
No, it's...

94
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,714
It's beautiful. It's just...

95
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,263
I just need time to think about this.

96
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,724
Take all the time you need.

97
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,147
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Pancakes are burning.

98
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,865
Quinn just fucking proposed to me
over fucking pancakes.

99
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,034
What the fuck is wrong with him?

100
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,202
He's Quinn?

101
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,622
I never said I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with him.

102
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,459
So I take it this means it's a "no"?

103
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,627
I can only hope.

104
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,629
Quinn as Deb's boyfriend is one thing.

105
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,673
Uncle to my son, over his dead body.

106
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,799
Maybe.

107
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,095
I don't know.
I mean, I guess Quinn makes me happy.

108
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,223
Really?
Cos there's a vein in your forehead.

109
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:42,479
Quinn and I, we get along great,
and there's no drama.

110
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,942
And after the last couple years,
that's kind of nice.

111
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,402
But?

112
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,906
But I'm not sure I want anything more
than no drama right now.

113
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,449
Sounds like you have your answer.

114
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,826
But if I tell him "no,"
then it's over, right?

115
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,912
And I'm not sure I want that, either.

116
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,456
God, why can't things
just stay the same?

117
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,334
Tell me about it.

118
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,003
Come on, we're gonna be late
for the briefing.

119
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,883
Watch this. She totally decks him.

120
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,927
- She flattened that guy.
- Where was Quinn?

121
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,972
- She's already got 500,000 hits.
- Hey, hey, she's coming.

122
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,517
Nice.

123
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,811
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hero.
Fuck you very much.

124
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,564
You've totally gone viral, Morgan.
You're an Internet sensation.

125
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,148
Give it a rest, man.

126
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,900
What? Dude, she's a superstar.

127
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,068
I mean, have you guys
read the comments...

128
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,236
She has,

129
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,572
and if you're the one
that wrote the poem about my ass...

130
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,449
I know not of what you speak.
And it was a limerick, thank you.

131
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,659
Can we get started, please?

132
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,244
All right, everyone, settle down.

133
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,663
Where are we with ballistics
from the restaurant shooting?

134
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,082
All casings and bullets
are accounted for.

135
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,501
All the victims were shot
by the shooter's gun

136
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,795
and no stray bullets
from Morgan or Quinn.

137
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,921
The shooter talking?

138
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,923
He was pissed off
the restaurant fired him.

139
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,383
The manager was the first to go down.

140
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,886
Two dead, all because this asshole
wanted his job back waiting tables.

141
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,263
All right,
with the shooting behind us,

142
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:02,017
we put everything into finding out
who did this to Omar Rivera.

143
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,728
Dex, the ME report come back
on the fruit vendor?

144
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,895
Nothing we didn't already know.

145
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,023
The stitches and the snakes
are definitely post-mortem.

146
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,275
I and my lovely new intern Ryan

147
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,693
are still waiting
for the medical examiner

148
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,111
to return our snakes.

149
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,072
Keep me updated.
Yale is looking into our vic.

150
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,908
Rivera had ties with the Salas Cartel.

151
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,869
You still thinking
this is drug-related?

152
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,914
Well, to a cartel,
a snake is a snitch.

153
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,375
If this wasn't a warning to others
to keep their mouths shut,

154
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,918
I'm not sure what the message is.

155
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,214
Maybe because the message
is in a language only I understand.

156
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,260
What is that holy piece of shit
doing here?

157
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,474
I know that piece of shit.
Or at least I did.

158
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,478
Rivera worked at Brother Sam's garage
after he got out of jail.

159
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,230
Hey, I don't like it
any more than any of you.

160
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,150
Maybe the padre points us
in the right direction.

161
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,986
Guys like that
and his ex-con fucking friends

162
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,780
can go to hell for all I care.

163
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,411
- Brother Sam?
- One big, bad ex-con turned minister.

164
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,747
Runs an auto body shop
using former inmates.

165
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,457
And, as you can see,
some of our brothers in blue

166
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,792
think it's a sham.

167
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,754
They may be right.
That can't be a man of the cloth.

168
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,923
That's a killer.

169
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,770
Settled in next door.

170
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,272
Well, that would explain
the smell of perfume.

171
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:38,488
I was wondering,
have you gotten around to finalising

172
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,282
- Sergeant Batista's paperwork?
- I'm on top of that.

173
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,619
Because I haven't seen anything
come across my desk.

174
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,995
I think the sooner

175
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,956
the department has
a full-time lieutenant, the better.

176
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,499
I could not agree more.

177
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,004
Is that all, Captain?

178
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,801
That's all.

179
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,649
When's the last time you saw Rivera?

180
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,820
A few months ago.

181
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,031
He came in.
He needed some brakes for his pickup.

182
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,327
He brought

183
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,663
everybody grapefruits and oranges.

184
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,916
It was a good day.

185
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,004
So are you...

186
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,256
Are you guys any closer to finding out
who did this to him?

187
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,008
Well, that's why you're here.

188
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,888
But I need something to go on.

189
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,351
When I knew Brother Sam,
he was Samuel Wright.

190
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,604
A string of holdups
led to the inevitable.

191
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,523
One of his victims fought back
and Wright killed him.

192
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,692
I was ready to make my move

193
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,028
until a drug bust
took Wright off my table.

194
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,114
And you never saw Rivera hanging out
with any of his old crew?

195
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
No, I didn't.

196
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,206
Omar had moved past that world.
He was on a righteous path.

197
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,542
It's funny, cos I remember you
saying the same thing

198
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,377
about the last ex-con you vouched for.

199
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,630
Remember Victor Torres?

200
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,800
He gets paroled and goes out
and kills a 19-year-old girl.

201
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,885
There's not a day that goes by

202
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,055
that I don't pray for that girl
or reach out to her family.

203
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,389
Well, her blood's on your hands.

204
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,934
There's a lot more
than that girl's blood on my hands.

205
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,900
My past, the things that I've done,
the life that I lived,

206
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,109
is haunting me to this day.

207
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,778
- Bullshit.
- I don't give a rat's ass

208
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,155
what you think about me,
you understand?

209
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,616
Or the work that I do
or the men that I do it with.

210
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,288
What I do know is this:
Omar did not have this coming.

211
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,669
His demons were gone. Men can change.

212
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,091
Men, maybe.

213
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,176
- Are we done?
- Yeah.

214
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,970
- Thanks for coming in.
- OK.

215
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,351
But what about a monster?

216
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,946
You wanted to see me, sir?

217
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,826
I remember when I had this office.
Miami was a different place.

218
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,537
Corruption was everywhere.

219
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,041
My dad said you never knew
who you could trust back then.

220
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,210
Harry was one of the good ones.

221
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,007
- And so are you.
- Thank you, sir.

222
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,217
That means a lot.

223
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,888
It's why I'm making you
Homicide's new lieutenant.

224
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,307
Me, right. Lieutenant.

225
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,520
Fuckballs, you're serious. Sir.

226
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,397
You're exactly what
this department needs.

227
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,734
- A fresh face, new ideas.
- Wait, really?

228
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,069
You want me in charge?

229
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,698
I don't even know what to say.

230
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,326
- Well, "yes" would work.
- But this is Batista's job.

231
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,995
He's expecting it. He's earned it.

232
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,538
Well, Sergeant Batista's
a fine officer,

233
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,666
but he comes with certain baggage.

234
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,337
Besides, he's not a hero. You are.

235
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,671
Why does everyone keep saying that?

236
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,757
- I was just doing my job.
- That's not how I see it.

237
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:31,054
That's not how the city sees it. No.
This office needs someone like you.

238
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,098
Oh, my God. Dexter would flip out.

239
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,435
And poor Masuka.
I'd be that little fuck's boss.

240
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,188
I'd be everybody's boss.

241
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,566
This is an honour.

242
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,528
Do you really think I'm ready
for something like this?

243
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,865
Listen, I know this is
a lot to take in.

244
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,951
We can talk about it
more tomorrow, OK?

245
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,957
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

246
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,465
Lieutenant.

247
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,597
What the fuck is going on today?

248
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,727
Keep your eyes on the bouncing ball

249
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,729
and not on Daddy's bad pictures.

250
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,067
Samuel Wright killed
this store owner in cold blood.

251
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,152
Bashed in his head with a bottle.

252
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,073
Now he's calling himself Brother Sam,
professing to be a changed man.

253
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,908
But I can't tell if I'm seeing

254
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,412
a man who's changed for the better
or just a better cover.

255
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,913
Daddy's box.

256
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,917
You want to put this in Daddy's box?

257
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,461
Thank you.

258
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,758
It seems like yesterday
he was just learning to crawl.

259
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,846
Daddy's box.

260
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,640
Or he's putting
all the pieces together.

261
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,810
What I say, what I do.

262
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,771
Where things go.

263
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,151
- I'll be more careful.
- Is that gonna be enough?

264
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,367
You're looking at
Homicide's new fucking lieutenant.

265
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,495
I know, right? Got any beer?

266
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,376
That's quite the day. Lieutenant.

267
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,963
Nope.

268
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,382
Two beers in
and it still sounds fucking weird.

269
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,136
I can't do this.

270
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,473
And it totally dicks Batista.

271
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,143
What could Matthews
possibly be thinking?

272
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:48,316
That you're smart, you're driven,
you're a great detective.

273
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,736
Who'll be leading the department
that may hunt me down one day.

274
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,864
You should give yourself some credit.

275
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,240
You should give me another beer.

276
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,909
I'm empty here.

277
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,580
You ever wonder why Dad never made LT?

278
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,124
He had his hands full. With me.

279
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,210
Everyone talked about him
like he was some super cop,

280
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,462
but he stayed in the pen
his whole career.

281
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,339
Maybe he never wanted it.

282
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,717
You know, after his funeral,

283
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,014
a tiny part of me was relieved.

284
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,560
I tried so hard to get him
to pay attention to me.

285
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,188
And I thought with him gone,

286
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,565
I wouldn't need his approval
any more, but...

287
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,278
Twenty years later, I still do.
He's still up here in my head.

288
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,115
You don't say.

289
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,909
The weird thing is,
if I take this job,

290
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,829
I'll have achieved more
than he ever did on the force.

291
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,581
And that's the part
that scares the shit out of me.

292
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,166
Not sure I follow.

293
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,545
Dad was my litmus test
for what a real cop is supposed to be.

294
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,131
And if he never made lieutenant...

295
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,174
Then you have no one
to compare yourself to.

296
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,968
And I don't want to
be fucking LaGuerta.

297
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,098
So how would I even know
if I was doing a good job?

298
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,891
I'd be totally on my own on this.

299
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,519
Well, if you don't want the job,
don't take it.

300
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,062
Fuck you. Of course I want it.

301
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,108
Holy shit, I really want it.

302
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,741
Quinn, again.
What the fuck does he want?

303
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,536
Out on a limb here,
but maybe an answer

304
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,371
as to whether you want to
be Debra Quinn?

305
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,207
Jesus H. Fuck, I totally forgot.

306
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,336
Debra Quinn.
Your initials would be DQ.

307
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,214
- Like the...
- I will kill you.

308
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,429
I have no idea what to say to him.
I've got to stall.

309
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,891
Can I sleep here?

310
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,768
About one life-altering decision a day
is my max.

311
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,229
Yeah. I'll sleep on the couch
in the other room.

312
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,939
That's why you don't suck
as a brother.

313
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,651
Yeah, but what about as a father?

314
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,605
Travis! God damn it.

315
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,024
Really wish
you wouldn't use that word.

316
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,194
Well, maybe I wouldn't
if my brother would use the doorbell.

317
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,325
You really scared me.

318
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,169
Slow down.
And save some room for dessert.

319
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,506
I told you, I have to work tonight.

320
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,595
You're working too much.
I can see it in your face.

321
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,557
I like to keep busy.

322
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,228
You want busy,
try keeping a bunch of fifth-graders

323
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,522
focused on art.

324
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,065
Today, all they could talk about was

325
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,484
they found another flock
of those dead birds up north.

326
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,071
They think it's the end of the world
or something.

327
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,534
What if it were?

328
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,705
Then I'd say
we better eat this ice cream fast.

329
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,999
No, I can't stay. I have to go.

330
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,335
Come on. Blow off work for once.
For me.

331
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,380
I barely get to see you any more.

332
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,173
Well, that was before...

333
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,260
Before what?

334
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,057
It's nothing.

335
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:58,107
Travis, we used to be so close.
We used to talk and do things.

336
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,152
Now it's like pulling teeth
just to see you for an hour.

337
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,404
I miss you.

338
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,949
I miss you, too.

339
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,869
Then let me spend an evening
with my baby brother.

340
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,204
Please?

341
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,362
Now, who put that there?

342
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,419
Good thing I have just the place
to get this fixed.

343
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:23,317
If Brother Sam believes in giving
men like this a second chance,

344
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,278
who am I to deny him one on my table?

345
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,655
You here about Eddie?

346
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,077
- What?
- Eddie. You here about Eddie?

347
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,704
His parole agent.

348
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,582
No, I'm just a customer.
I dinged my car.

349
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,459
Is Brother Sam here?

350
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,796
He's out back.

351
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,393
Can I help you?

352
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,853
Yeah. I was hoping to get an estimate.

353
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,273
You're not from around here, are you?

354
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,150
Your shop came highly recommended.

355
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,735
- By who?
- Co-worker.

356
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,575
You out front?

357
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,747
Was that the holy spirit?

358
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,667
Or his dark passenger
checking out mine?

359
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,211
Yeah, my guys can have this out
in a day or two.

360
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,219
"Good Shepherd."
What's that mean, exactly?

361
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:39,018
Well, the men you see here,
they're like my flock.

362
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:44,064
And my job is to make sure
that they don't wander.

363
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,026
That's a lot to take on.

364
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,612
Yeah, well, I got a lot to answer for.

365
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,700
Nothing broke that can't be fixed,
right?

366
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:00,331
Lord have mercy.
No car is ever totalled.

367
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:05,461
Yeah, it's like a man's life.
Like a man's soul.

368
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,754
I ought to know that.

369
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,134
You know, I once killed a man
and walked off scot-free?

370
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,887
- For that I need to pay.
...need to pay.

371
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,934
- I'm surprised to hear you say that.
- Don't be.

372
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,354
The spirit moves me
to tell my story and share.

373
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,191
I was facing death row.

374
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:31,820
The judge presiding over my case
suddenly dropped dead.

375
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,364
Mistrial?

376
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,742
Yeah. It sounds
like divine intervention.

377
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,452
Yeah.

378
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,247
God was playing me all right,
you know.

379
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:44,250
I had to go out here
and get good and high

380
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,502
before he just said,
"Son, that's enough."

381
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,672
And I get stopped.

382
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:54,009
Possession charge.
I go back to jail, but,

383
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,512
hallelujah, praise God,
that's how I got saved.

384
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,682
So that darkness inside is gone?

385
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,725
No.

386
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,729
It's still there,
but I'm fighting its ass every day.

387
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,650
I really don't have much of a choice,
you know?

388
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,613
I sacrificed that bad part of my soul

389
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,826
to make up for some of the pain
I caused.

390
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,162
Nick still hasn't showed.

391
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,375
You find him and you tell him
I'm coming for him, you understand?

392
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,836
Now. Tell him now.

393
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,634
One of the flock get lost?

394
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,554
Yeah, something like that.

395
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,018
So what do you say there, brother?

396
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,274
I guess I'll be seeing you soon.

397
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,862
All right. You have a blessed day.

398
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,578
Once we work our magic,
we put it up on the board here.

399
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,288
What are the abbreviations?

400
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,958
What was run?
TR is trace. TX, toxicology.

401
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,170
So where does everything go
after it's been run?

402
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,255
Inquisitive. I like.

403
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,758
Evidence, down the hall.

404
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,803
Cool.

405
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,140
Yeah, medical examiner
finally sent 'em over.

406
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,227
- They don't make you squeamish?
- Are you kidding?

407
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,732
- I love this.
- Me, too.

408
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,532
Vince.

409
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,372
- Hands off.
- She's my student.

410
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,500
Yeah, and a lawsuit landing on my desk
if she catches you staring like that.

411
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,711
Sounds like someone's expecting
to make Lieutenant Buzz-kill.

412
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,804
Take these files
down to Central Booking.

413
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,056
Have them cross-referenced
with the CI lab

414
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,433
- and get back to me right away.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,025
Wow.

416
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,403
You really drink that swill?

417
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,947
Keeps me young.

418
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,533
How about we go around the corner
and I buy you a real cup of coffee?

419
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,743
- My treat.
- OK.

420
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,248
Dexter, you got a minute?

421
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,374
Yeah, I need to get to my lab.

422
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,876
Has Deb mentioned anything to you,
you know, about us?

423
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,754
- She may have said you proposed.
- And?

424
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,506
The pancakes weren't bad.

425
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,300
- I fucked this up royally, didn't I?
- I wouldn't know.

426
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,845
Look, I know you and I have
had our differences,

427
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:46,432
but it would really mean a lot to me
if you could help me out here.

428
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,101
- Well, this is between you and Deb.
- No, I know.

429
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,644
It's just,
I don't want her to feel like

430
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,565
she has to, you know,
choose between you or me.

431
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,483
She doesn't.

432
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,027
Because it is never going to be you.

433
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,989
No, I got it.

434
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,366
- I said it was my treat.
- I got it. Here.

435
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,577
I can afford it.

436
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,497
What is it?

437
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,170
I just wanted to let you know

438
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,798
that I'm the detective I am
because of you.

439
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,800
Thank you.

440
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:26,597
And you have always,
always had my back.

441
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,391
And, more than that,
you're like family to me.

442
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,684
Where is this going?

443
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,354
- Don't look at me for a second.
- Deb.

444
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,653
Angel, Matthews has asked me
to be the new lieutenant.

445
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,075
I'm sorry.
I know how much you wanted this.

446
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,872
What did you say?

447
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,374
That you should be
the new lieutenant, not me.

448
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,460
- What did he say?
- He wouldn't listen.

449
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,048
I could never, ever do this job
without your blessing,

450
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,174
so you just say the word,

451
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,551
and I'll tell Matthews
to go fuck himself.

452
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,557
This...

453
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,061
It's really great.

454
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,941
- You mean that?
- Damn right.

455
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,985
It's about time a real cop
had that job.

456
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,740
I couldn't be happier. Come here.

457
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,578
I'm gonna need
that money back, though.

458
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,704
OK.

459
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,797
- Angel.
- It's been a long day, Maria.

460
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,467
I just found out about Morgan.
I'm so sorry.

461
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,761
There's nothing to be sorry about.

462
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,055
I was on the fence about this
whole lieutenant thing anyway.

463
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,558
Look, this has nothing to do with you.

464
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,394
Matthews is just using Morgan
to get back at me,

465
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,562
but it won't work.

466
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,565
- I mean, she's barely out of diapers.
- Don't do that.

467
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,528
Deb's a good detective.
Better than you ever were.

468
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,365
Look, you're angry
and you have every right to be,

469
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,909
but I will fix this. I...

470
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,995
Enough, Maria, enough.

471
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,748
Angel, I'm so sorry.

472
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,585
How come if Matthews hates you,
I'm always the one paying the price?

473
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,873
The good shepherd has fled his field
for seedier pastures.

474
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,755
The question is, why?

475
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,425
It seems old habits die hard.

476
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,928
Brother Sam's not a changed man
after all.

477
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,263
Hallelujah.

478
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,290
I can't come back for Brother Sam
until I make sure he killed that man.

479
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,088
But while I'm checking,
better safe than sorry.

480
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:41,143
I was right all along.
Brother Sam is no shepherd.

481
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,519
He's still a wolf.

482
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,701
Well, it is an animal tranquiliser.

483
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,827
Good doggy.

484
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,998
Who the fuck is out here?

485
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,792
Sam, it's me. I was here earlier.
The SUV.

486
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,254
I left my clicker for my garage
in the glove compartment.

487
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,715
I thought it was too late to call.

488
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,383
- Do you mind?
- Sit!

489
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,718
Eli!

490
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,769
Sorry. I didn't see anyone here.
I thought I would be in and out.

491
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,646
Your car's inside.

492
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,982
Maybe I should just
come back tomorrow.

493
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,192
No.

494
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,153
We can get it over with now.

495
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,907
OK.

496
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,409
Eli!

497
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,996
Appreciate it.

498
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,505
This isn't how I envisioned
taking down Brother Sam,

499
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,840
but it's either him or me
if I want to stay...

500
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,220
Alive?

501
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,930
Get off the man's damn car.

502
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,682
Can't believe you hit me, man.

503
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,643
I can't believe you took a shot at me.

504
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,353
Now I'm confused.

505
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,605
Take Eli out back
and don't you think about running off.

506
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,358
I chased your ass down once.
I'll do it again. You understand?

507
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,401
Come on, boy.

508
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,159
Your missing worker.

509
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,789
You know, the Bible says,

510
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,875
"David broke a lamb's leg
to protect it from wandering off."

511
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,587
I have to tend to my flock
any way I can.

512
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,923
- Drugs?
- Yeah.

513
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,091
I knew when he missed his shift,

514
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,844
he was just holed up in his house,
getting high.

515
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,971
The good shepherd.

516
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,431
Yeah, when I have to be.

517
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,394
It's open.

518
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,234
- The clicker.
- Oh, right.

519
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,782
I got it...

520
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:01,908
All wrong.

521
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,411
Is this what the power of belief
is all about?

522
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,872
Knowing a dead fruit vendor
never strayed,

523
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,291
tending to a lost member
of your flock,

524
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,168
the ability to change?

525
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,050
- What is it?
- Nothing good.

526
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,305
Stay back.

527
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,270
- Where's our boy?
- Safe.

528
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,522
- Please get off the property.
- Fuck you.

529
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,358
Is there a problem?

530
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,445
This is you staying back?
This is not your fight.

531
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,448
Hey, you deaf, pendejo?

532
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,664
You should pick up
your friend and leave.

533
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,916
We're going.

534
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,793
But not without our boy, Nick.

535
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:09,142
I'm not afraid of you, son.
And I damn sure ain't afraid to die.

536
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,605
I know what's waiting for me
on the other side. Do you?

537
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,566
"Mark the perfect man

538
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,444
"and behold the upright,
for at the end of that man is peace."

539
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,654
Shut up.

540
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,117
What you waiting for, son?

541
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,412
He can't tell
if Brother Sam is bluffing,

542
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,373
crazy or a true believer.

543
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,167
Join the club.

544
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,214
- You don't want to do that.
- Faith, brother.

545
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,049
God is in control.

546
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,597
Miami Metro.

547
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,684
You kill him or me,

548
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,186
you'll have the whole department
after you.

549
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,690
Yo, Julio,
let's get the fuck out of here.

550
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,067
This ain't over.

551
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,987
Well, until it is,
I'm praying for you, son.

552
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,155
Well, you best be praying
I don't put you down

553
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,199
like the last fuck-up that crossed me.

554
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,159
Remember Hector Nunez?

555
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,538
They never found his body, did they?

556
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,050
- That was...
- That was a miracle.

557
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,179
Miami Metro?

558
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,101
Forensics department. Lab geek.

559
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,644
They didn't need to know that.

560
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,479
You don't fight like no lab geek.

561
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,861
Lord have mercy.

562
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:46,614
It's just an evening
full of wonders tonight, huh?

563
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,327
Praise God.
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

564
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,204
You don't say.

565
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,600
Where were you last night?

566
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,644
My sister's.

567
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,815
She was worried about me.

568
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,526
I couldn't get away.

569
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,696
You know
that she can't be saved, right?

570
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,991
She is a good person.

571
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,995
She's all that I have.

572
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,457
You know that isn't true.

573
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,045
You have me and you have God now.

574
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:46,383
But I see
you have to be reminded of that.

575
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,763
Is this what you want, Travis?

576
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,607
To hurt me?

577
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,776
You see how I suffer for your sins?

578
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,444
Stop!

579
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,572
I won't see her again.

580
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,826
I won't.

581
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,954
I swear.

582
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:19,082
It's my job to take care of you.

583
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,001
- Not hers.
- Forgive me.

584
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,256
I will do better.

585
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,761
I will show you that I'm worthy.

586
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,569
Oh, fuck me.

587
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,699
Hey.

588
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,868
So...

589
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,789
You shouldn't have. Really.

590
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,000
You know, I figured if, you know,
we're gonna talk,

591
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:05,587
then why not over Chinese
from that place you like?

592
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,755
- Beer's in the...
- I can't marry you.

593
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,841
...fridge.
- I'm sorry.

594
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,968
You're so good to me, but I can't.

595
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:20,268
Well, if you don't want to be with me,
then why are you with me?

596
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,145
Because...

597
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,272
it wasn't...

598
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,900
this.

599
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:32,572
I'm sorry for wanting to
be an adult here, Deb, but...

600
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:37,118
I never meant to hurt you.
Or lead you on.

601
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,289
I just like things the way they are.

602
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,005
Yeah. That's...

603
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,467
not good enough, you know?
I want more.

604
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,469
That's the problem.

605
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,222
I don't.

606
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,938
- You are a great...
- You know what? Just don't.

607
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,232
Don't be here when I get back,
all right?

608
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,864
And I'm your new boss.

609
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,887
- Did you tell the little guy a story?
- Jamie put him to bed.

610
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,851
Looks like Brother Sam's
a changed man after all.

611
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,104
He was true to his word
about being a good shepherd.

612
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,065
He put his own life on the line
to save that kid

613
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,441
from a pack of wolves.

614
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,152
And here's the leader of the pack.

615
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,990
Harrison eventually is going to
need a good shepherd, too.

616
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,660
I'll be there for him.

617
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,413
And what about him?

618
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,584
I was set on proving

619
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,961
Brother Sam still deserves
to be on my table,

620
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,546
but miraculously,

621
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,757
Julio goes and vets himself
to take his place.

622
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,678
Hector Nunez was a barber
in Julio's neighbourhood.

623
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,307
Went missing six months ago. No body.

624
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,226
The Almighty at work?

625
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,980
I'm not ready to call Julio
a sign from God,

626
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:33,067
but I am thankful for the bounty
I am about to receive.

627
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,449
I have any clean shirts?

628
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,284
Your room. Or former room.

629
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,954
- Deb being here is temporary.
- Who doesn't rinse out their bowl?

630
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,372
Temporary, I promise.

631
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,335
Deb. I need a shirt.

632
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,340
What do you think?

633
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,967
Dad would be proud.

634
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:02,388
Thanks again for letting me crash here
until I find a place.

635
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,432
It's why I don't suck, remember?

636
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,560
Just help Jamie out when you can.

637
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,439
Am I making the biggest mistake
of my life?

638
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,112
I don't know, Deb.

639
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,280
As Harrison gets older,

640
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,366
I've been thinking more
about what I believe in.

641
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,493
I'm coming to find
the list is kind of short.

642
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,705
What do any of us really believe in?

643
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,208
That you'll be a great lieutenant.

644
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,047
Screw Dad.
I'm gonna make you proud of me.

645
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,761
Dissected all seven baby snakes.
Stomachs were empty.

646
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,972
They didn't come from a pet store.
Most likely the wild.

647
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,349
Back to square one.

648
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,855
Remember Barry Manilow tickets.

649
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,357
Toxicology's back.

650
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:57,235
- On what? The board is clear.
- The snakes.

651
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,029
I hope you don't mind,
but I ran tissue samples.

652
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,074
Which I would have done.

653
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,034
And look. Heavy metals.

654
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,994
If there was nothing
in the bellies of the snakes,

655
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,496
where did it come from?

656
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,834
From Mama snake,

657
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,254
who had to have been living
in a toxic environment

658
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,880
to pass it on to her young.

659
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,466
You wanna look up EPA clean-up sites
or should I?

660
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,511
I'd rather look up your...

661
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,724
I mean, I didn't... I wasn't...

662
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,145
- Please don't sue.
- You like to watch.

663
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,939
Good to know.

664
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,986
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

665
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,946
Morgan as lieutenant?

666
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,407
Yes. I was just sending
over the paperwork.

667
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,783
Fuck you, Tom.

668
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:49,537
You get one of those as captain,
but don't push your luck, Maria.

669
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,872
We agreed

670
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,249
- the new lieutenant would be Batista.
- I agreed to nothing.

671
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,376
And need I remind you
that all personnel decisions

672
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,878
are ultimately my decision.

673
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,838
If they weren't,

674
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,299
your little plan to blackmail me
wouldn't have worked.

675
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,927
This is gonna be a fucking disaster

676
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:08,681
- and I won't take the fall for it.
- Well, we'll see, won't we?

677
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,894
- Better hurry. Don't want to be late.
- For what?

678
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,480
Your first official task, Captain.

679
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,735
The Everglades?

680
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,029
All 4,000 square miles of it?
That's your big break?

681
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,238
I never said the Everglades.

682
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:28,201
I said hazardous waste sites
near or around the Everglades.

683
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,453
It would explain where the pollutants
in the snakes came from.

684
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,663
Yeah. We narrowed this down.

685
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,666
Someone could have seen
the bad guys coming or going.

686
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:43,174
- I suppose it's a start.
- What gives with all the reporters?

687
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,718
We're getting a new lieutenant.

688
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,182
What the fuck did you say to Deb?

689
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,975
Good morning to you, too.

690
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,101
You know, everything was fine,

691
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,561
until she spent the night
at your place.

692
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,773
You know, she's made her choice,
but it's not you or me.

693
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,360
Press conference is starting.

694
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:12,036
Everyone, thank you for coming
on such short notice.

695
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,415
You're here today,
because it's my privilege

696
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,377
to introduce an officer who...

697
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,296
while under my watch,
has proven herself

698
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:26,133
to be one of Miami's finest
and a true friend.

699
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,636
Ladies and gentlemen,

700
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,348
I give you the youngest officer
ever to make lieutenant

701
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,685
in the history
of Miami Metro Homicide,

702
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:36,894
Debra Morgan.

703
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:03,588
I gotta hand it to you, Julio.
You ran quite a racket.

704
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,551
I read all about how you were
shaking down local business owners

705
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,555
like Hector Nunez.

706
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,270
You.

707
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,606
- You recognise this shop, don't you?
- Fuck you.

708
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,400
My boys will fucking kill you
for this.

709
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:29,655
Let me guess.
With your history of violence,

710
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,075
Hector stood up to you and your gang

711
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,161
and that's why
they never found his body.

712
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,749
Just the way they'll never find yours.

713
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,876
Yeah, I killed him. So what?

714
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,337
You're a dead man. My boys will...

715
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,841
Will miss you, I'm sure.

716
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,093
So I'll make this quick.

717
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,431
I have to get home.

718
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,852
I have a much more important
ritual to tend to.

719
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:05,107
You must be thinking "Why me?"
Right about now.

720
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,859
I can't explain it myself.

721
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:11,614
God. The universe. Irony.

722
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,702
Brother Sam wasn't
who I thought he was, but you...

723
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,955
This...

724
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,915
I know all too well.

725
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,212
Always the same ending.

726
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:37,223
Because monsters don't
get to live happily ever after.

727
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,760
Hands up and...

728
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,763
Good job.

729
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,183
The good thing about
the mind of a two-year-old,

730
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,810
it's easily distracted.

731
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:23,978
You want to roll it?

732
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,985
He won't remember Daddy's box
if he has one of his own.

733
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,201
Monster story, Daddy.

734
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,454
How about a new story?

735
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:50,796
"Once upon a time,
there were three little pigs.

736
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,134
"The first little pig built
a house of straw.

737
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,472
"The second, a house of sticks.

738
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,685
"And the third, a house of bricks.

739
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,484
"But along came the big, bad wolf."

740
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,029
Wolves come in many forms.

741
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,657
Some have big eyes,
the better to see you with.

742
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,203
You want to connect this part.
That's the joiner.

743
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,038
Others huff and puff...

744
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,833
- Hey, you all right?
- No.

745
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,210
...while others hide in plain sight.

746
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,336
- I think I sprained my ankle.
- Really?

747
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,921
- Let's take a look at it.
- I heard something snap.

748
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,006
- Did you fall down or something?
- Yeah.

749
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,885
I should know, because like it or not,
I'm one, too.

750
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,929
That's never going to change.

751
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,019
And neither is the fact

752
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,438
my little lamb
is becoming a little boy.

753
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:54,193
Walking. Talking. Listening.

754
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,282
As much as I want Harrison
to stay this way forever,

755
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,118
from now on,
the only wolves in his life

756
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,203
have to be the stuff of fairy tales.

757
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,707
I can no longer allow him
to see the real me.

758
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,543
Only the version that's make-believe.

759
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,964
It's the only way this story
gets to have a happy ending.
