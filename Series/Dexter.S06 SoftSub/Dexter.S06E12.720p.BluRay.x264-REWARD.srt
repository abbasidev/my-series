1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,051
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,429
- What do you believe in, Mr Morgan?
- Nothing.

3
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,431
You can believe
whatever you wanna believe.

4
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,224
But it's not just about you any more.

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,435
It's why I'm making you
Homicide's new lieutenant.

6
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,103
Fuckballs, you're serious.

7
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,938
There's something inside.

8
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,733
Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!

9
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:26,900
So it's begun?

10
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,777
Yes.

11
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:31,947
No!

12
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,950
This Revelation expert, James Gellar.

13
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,827
The professor,
from the University of Tallahassee?

14
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,413
Gellar disappeared
three years ago after he got fired.

15
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,460
Travis Marshall.

16
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,339
I suppose it was God who told you
to kill all those innocent people.

17
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,134
God speaks to the professor.

18
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,761
You're saying Gellar does the killing?

19
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,512
He's so much stronger than me.

20
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,850
Gellar. He's been dead all along.

21
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,644
Travis, you killed Gellar.

22
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,814
"Miami Metro Homicide."

23
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,317
That's where
God wants us to stage wormwood.

24
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,824
Dex, you saved a lot of lives today.
You saved my life.

25
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,993
Every time the shit hits the fan,
I go to him.

26
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,661
He's your safe place.

27
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,373
You're making it sound like
I want to be with him or something.

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,541
Well, do you?

29
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,668
This is a job of trust.

30
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,004
And I can't have
a partner I can't trust.

31
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,882
The beast is coming for you.

32
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,677
You didn't really think
you could foil God's plan, did you?

33
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,497
I guess it's fitting that I end up
where I've left so many others.

34
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,146
I only wonder if the world
will be a better place without me.

35
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,553
It's wrong
what people say about dying.

36
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,223
I'm not flashing back over my life,

37
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,892
over the lives I've taken.

38
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,479
I'm thinking about the life I'll miss.

39
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,983
Harrison.
I'll miss watching my son grow up.

40
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,348
Are you OK?

41
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,435
You are very lucky.

42
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,396
God is looking out for you.

43
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,632
Where are we?

44
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,095
Florida. Maybe five miles away.

45
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,932
We'll be there soon.

46
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,936
Perhaps.

47
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:51,118
He's robbing us,
and I have nothing to give.

48
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,006
I can give him death.

49
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,687
You're safe.

50
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,817
We'll be there soon.

51
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,327
"It's finished."

52
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,538
Those were Travis' last words to me,
and he's right.

53
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,999
There's no way to find him now.

54
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,918
I'm going home to my son.

55
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,421
Excuse me.

56
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,925
- Do you have a phone I can use?
- Oh, sure.

57
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,261
More on the ball games later.
And now, in other news...

58
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,933
The solar eclipse is due
at 3:28 tomorrow afternoon.

59
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,187
It's a great opportunity to trick your
kids into learning a little science.

60
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,189
Stick with us,
and Dr Mehler will teach you

61
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,233
how to make a simple pinhole camera

62
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,944
that will allow you
to watch in safety with your children.

63
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,071
But first, this message.

64
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,408
Stare at the sun, you idiots.

65
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,788
Better you be blinded than
face the horrors that await you.

66
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:16,054
I can't stay here much longer
if you're gonna stink like that.

67
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,645
Daddy.

68
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,818
I cannot believe you fell off
your boat and swam to shore.

69
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,987
You must be exhausted.

70
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,155
Yeah. Mostly, I feel dumb.

71
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,950
I'll be OK.

72
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,828
Let's go home.

73
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,329
Yeah.

74
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,965
I lost my keys, wallet, cell phone.

75
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,675
Yeah, of course.

76
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,532
Are you OK?

77
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:23,663
Yeah. Just thirsty, hungry.

78
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,499
I can't imagine
if he would have lost you, Dexter.

79
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,335
You're very lucky.

80
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,546
Yeah.

81
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,840
Lucky.

82
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,722
What can I do to help?

83
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,559
- We're good until the morning.
- OK.

84
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,394
Don't forget, his pageant's tomorrow.

85
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,063
I'll be there.

86
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,484
Thank you.

87
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,893
If some God or some force
did save me today...

88
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,066
I'm sure it was for you
and not for me.

89
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,798
Today's the day.

90
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,486
Dex!

91
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,869
I got a report that
your boat had washed ashore.

92
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,704
I'm OK. I'm OK.

93
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,290
Kept calling your cell phone,
there was no answer.

94
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,210
God, you can't keep doing this to me.

95
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,046
I've almost lost you twice.

96
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,301
I love you.

97
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,845
I love you, too.

98
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,015
You do?

99
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,684
Of course I do.

100
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,231
I don't think
you've ever said it before.

101
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,792
It's a double murder. There's blood.

102
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,420
Will you write down
the address for me?

103
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,005
Are you sure you're up for it?

104
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,049
Yeah, I'm good.

105
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,488
- You been inside yet?
- No.

106
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,074
We've been waiting on you.

107
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,568
This was Travis.

108
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,778
He killed these people...

109
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,575
because he needed a place to hide.

110
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,544
Well, we'll take care,
we'll find out.

111
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,257
It's about fucking time.

112
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,508
I had to get gas.

113
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,556
I'll never get used to that.

114
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,142
The sweet smell of hydrogen sulphide,
carbon dioxide,

115
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,479
and methane all liquefying
into a frothy treat.

116
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,772
Where's Dex?

117
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,284
Fuck me.

118
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,119
Fucking Travis Marshall was here.

119
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,705
Looks like it.

120
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,208
What's the painting of?

121
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,251
It's the beast being thrown
into the lake of fire.

122
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,753
It's the last tableau.

123
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,713
Why do you think
he smashed in the face?

124
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,841
I can't imagine.

125
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,136
Better go photograph the bodies.

126
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,347
I'll take care of this room.

127
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,021
What do you think happened here?

128
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,189
I don't know.

129
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,901
Either way, it's a horrible way to go.

130
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,293
They were both killed
by blows to the head.

131
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,130
Her, once. Him, multiple times.

132
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,174
Blunt instrument.
Most likely that frying pan.

133
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,177
When?

134
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,722
At least 48 hours ago.

135
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,893
You're looking at me weird.

136
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,479
- Am I?
- Aren't you?

137
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,442
I'm just taking pictures, Deb.

138
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,530
OK.

139
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,908
Let's just focus on work
right now, OK?

140
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,076
OK.

141
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,875
Where the fuck is Travis Marshall?

142
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,753
He could be anywhere.

143
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,088
You think he's done
the lake of fire yet?

144
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,757
I don't know.

145
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,341
He could just be hiding out somewhere.

146
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,303
He could just be kicking back
with a beer, waiting for the eclipse.

147
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,889
That's very possible, Deb.

148
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,145
OK...

149
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,774
I'm gonna go back to the office.

150
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,651
I gotta find a way
to catch this fucker.

151
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,653
- I'll see you back there.
- OK.

152
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,489
Sorry.

153
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,806
Despite what Travis said,
maybe it's not quite finished.

154
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,392
My one advantage is
that he thinks I'm dead.

155
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,208
Now, where do I go?

156
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,754
Please, God.

157
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,590
I've done everything
you've asked of me.

158
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,039
Thank you.

159
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,547
You know, my last day
is coming up fast.

160
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,758
A dark day indeed.

161
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,553
You will be missed.

162
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,977
I was wondering...

163
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,857
there's no way
I could stay on permanently?

164
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,275
Maybe as an assistant?

165
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,152
What about your video games?

166
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,282
It just doesn't seem
important any more.

167
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,621
Louis, Miami Metro Homicide
is an elite crew, OK?

168
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,332
Just because you're
the world's greatest batboy

169
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,084
doesn't mean that you're ready
to pinch hit for the Yankees.

170
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,839
In other words...

171
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,302
...finish training, you must.

172
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,305
Save you, it will, Luke.

173
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,727
Maybe I'll throw you
some consulting work,

174
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,229
just to keep your dick wet.

175
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,606
That'd be great.

176
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,360
This is the lake of fire.

177
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,903
It's the last of seven keys

178
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,446
that's supposed to bring about
the end of the world.

179
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,906
It was Travis' last tableau.

180
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,785
A picture taken last night
about seven miles off the coast.

181
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,328
Some guy in an aeroplane saw it

182
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,746
and took a picture
with his cell phone.

183
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,498
Now based on this,

184
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,209
I'm thinking that Travis has already
completed tableau number seven.

185
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,711
- Does anyone think I'm wrong?
- I think we're in agreement.

186
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,837
We've got the coast guard out there

187
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,674
looking for signs of
a wreck or a body, but nothing yet.

188
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,133
Cos I'm right here.

189
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,636
So Travis is done with his work.
Now what?

190
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,887
Well, now all Travis has to do is

191
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,305
sit back and wait
for the end of the world.

192
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,765
Which means he could be anywhere.

193
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,933
Or maybe not.

194
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,851
Maybe he's somewhere very specific.

195
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,187
Somewhere where we can
grab his crazy ass. Check this out.

196
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,822
This is Gellar's last sketch.

197
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,615
- The two witnesses.
- Yeah.

198
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,784
And their dog.

199
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,412
I guess Fido wanted to watch
the end of the world, too.

200
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,039
So you're thinking if Travis
is following Gellar's drawings,

201
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,000
this points to where he'll be next?

202
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,876
And what time he'll be there.

203
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,380
All this shit's gonna go down
when the eclipse is happening.

204
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,007
Which is four hours from now.

205
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,800
Where do you go to watch an eclipse?

206
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,552
Well, you'd want a good view.

207
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,304
No obstructions.

208
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,513
High ground.

209
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,015
Yeah, look where they are.
They're on a mountaintop.

210
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,810
Could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure
there are no mountains in Miami.

211
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,395
Unless you find a substitute.

212
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,897
- Fucking A...
- Skyscrapers.

213
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,358
Fucking big-ass,
tall-as-shit skyscrapers.

214
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,527
- Makes sense.
- It does, right?

215
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,778
I'm gonna call LaGuerta.

216
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,281
I want to station unis on top of
Miami's tallest buildings.

217
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,116
There's a lot of tall buildings
in Miami.

218
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,826
I mean, that's gonna require
a lot of manpower.

219
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,538
I don't care. If Travis gets away,
he is gone for good.

220
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,880
Travis redid
that same sketch yesterday,

221
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,924
and it looks different.

222
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,682
I thought it was a mountain,
but maybe it's a building.

223
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,101
What was the last thing
Travis said to me?

224
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,188
He'd be standing atop
a shining pillar of light.

225
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,426
"The solar-powered Transcorp Building

226
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,929
"was designed to capture
and reflect the sun

227
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,764
"as it moves across the Miami sky."

228
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,102
A pillar of light.

229
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,150
- Hey.
- Hey.

230
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,945
The abandoned church

231
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,030
where Travis and Gellar
were hanging out...

232
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,448
What about it?

233
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,911
I need you to do a final
forensic sweep so we can clear it.

234
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:39,208
I have Harrison's
Noah's Ark pageant this afternoon.

235
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,961
I promised him.

236
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,130
Afterwards, then.

237
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,465
Copy that.

238
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,217
Hey...

239
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,305
What?

240
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,350
Do we need to talk?

241
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,188
I don't know. Is there something
we should talk about?

242
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,862
I don't know. You almost died.

243
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,364
I didn't know if you needed to...

244
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,701
unload or whatever.

245
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,664
I think I'm OK, but thanks, sis.

246
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,084
Great.

247
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,462
Don't forget about the church.

248
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,088
Got it.

249
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,217
I have plans for that church.

250
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,978
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

251
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,646
This is exactly why I'm doing this.

252
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,356
You never take anything seriously.

253
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,691
Why you're doing what?

254
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,569
I wanted to give you
the heads up about your transfer.

255
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,655
What fucking transfer?
I didn't ask for a transfer.

256
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,532
- I'm putting one in for you.
- The fuck you are.

257
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,783
I am.

258
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,329
You've been screwing up
for the last few months.

259
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,957
And when you almost got me killed...

260
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,626
- I thought we settled that.
- We did.

261
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,504
But as sergeant, I can't risk myself

262
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,756
or anyone else here
in Homicide any more.

263
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,971
Good talk, Sergeant.

264
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,641
So even though Travis Marshall
killed Gellar,

265
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,559
at some point, we're not sure when,

266
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,728
he's still recreating images
from Gellar's sketchbook,

267
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,854
and this is the last one.

268
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,690
It's two witnesses looking
at the eclipse from a mountaintop.

269
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,069
And skyscrapers
are the mountaintops of Miami.

270
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,363
So you think that Travis Marshall

271
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,657
will watch the eclipse
from a skyscraper.

272
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,200
Can you narrow down which one?

273
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,869
The Four Seasons is
the tallest building in Miami,

274
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,287
but we're not sure
where he'll show up.

275
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:44,124
And that's why I want to put unis on
top of every building over 400 feet.

276
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,047
Do it.

277
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,507
You're agreeing with me?

278
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,218
If you think this is
the best use of your resources,

279
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,053
I trust your judgement.

280
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,638
Yeah, so when this
blows up in my face,

281
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,847
you can fire my ass.

282
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,352
I know that you think
that I'm some heartless bitch,

283
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,062
and sometimes I have to be.

284
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,732
But everything I do is always
in the best interest of Miami Metro.

285
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,651
Matthews might disagree with that.

286
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,278
Well, Matthews put his dick
before his department.

287
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,988
Yeah, and you cut it off.

288
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,157
You didn't hesitate to
take advantage of that situation.

289
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,867
Was that really the best
for Miami Metro?

290
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,704
Morgan, we need to get
Travis Marshall.

291
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,082
All I need to know is
will this plan of yours work?

292
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,500
Yes.

293
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,753
Then count on having
all the manpower you need.

294
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,454
Did you look under your bed?

295
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,333
Maybe Blanky's in here.

296
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,225
We're late.

297
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,273
Here it is.

298
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,196
Dexter.

299
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,790
OK, let's go.

300
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,756
So the beast has a son.

301
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,868
Be a big boy lion.

302
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,412
Just in time for the flood.

303
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:33,997
Sorry I'm late.

304
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,042
I was getting worried the world would
have to make do with only one lion.

305
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,336
Just a few minutes, everybody,
before the show begins.

306
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,255
Break a leg, you two.

307
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,883
OK, bud. Remember what the lions say?

308
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,306
Sorry.

309
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,267
It's OK, it's OK. We're lions.

310
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,477
That's just what lions do.

311
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,898
All right, now we got an ark
to get on.

312
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,651
And that boat has a place
for all the animals,

313
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:06,738
not just the sheep and the zebras,
but the lions, too.

314
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,324
I'll be right with you, by your side.

315
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,493
Let's get that mask on.

316
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,497
Two by two,

317
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,876
the animals went inside the ark.

318
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,169
The bunny rabbits,

319
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,046
the tigers,

320
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,799
even the lions.

321
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,719
All of God's creatures.

322
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,681
Noah welcomed them all on his boat.

323
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,562
And the rain kept falling

324
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,607
for 40 days and 40 nights,

325
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,527
until the whole world
was covered in water.

326
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,535
The tallest building in Miami
is the Four Seasons building,

327
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,288
and this is where we believe
Travis Marshall will be.

328
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,081
Sergeant Batista and Detective Quinn

329
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,500
will accompany the two officers
that are stationed there.

330
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,379
If you see Travis Marshall
or contact is made,

331
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,006
call for backup immediately.

332
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,968
He is highly unpredictable
and very dangerous.

333
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,720
Let's go get this fucker.

334
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,017
Check in with me every 15, OK?
I want to stay on top of this.

335
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,769
I spoke to my union rep.

336
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,064
We decided I have
a problem with alcohol,

337
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,316
and as long as I seek help
and admit it,

338
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,527
I can't be transferred or fired.
It's a disease.

339
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,279
Are you shitting me?

340
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,115
That rule is for people
that really have a problem.

341
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,409
You're not an alcoholic,
you're just a fuck-up.

342
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,412
Look, you said
to take control of my life.

343
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,873
That's what I'm trying to do, OK?

344
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,876
I like Homicide.
I'm in it for the long haul.

345
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,712
Why can't you put this much effort
into actual police work?

346
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,302
We remind you
to not look directly at the sun.

347
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,137
The eclipse will happen
within the hour.

348
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:58,141
And the two witnesses will
watch the world end with their dog.

349
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,103
I still don't get the dog.
Why do they want to bring the dog?

350
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,771
Are you sure that's a dog?

351
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,523
What else could it be?

352
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,984
A sheep, a lamb.

353
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,443
Lamb of God?

354
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,945
A lamb. We've seen that before.

355
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,738
Yeah, it was that hot chick
that Quinn fucked.

356
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,949
Carissa Porter, right.

357
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,617
She was in that tableau
that Gellar staged

358
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,911
at the University of Tallahassee.
She slaughtered a lamb.

359
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,955
The school newspaper sent
the contact sheets from that day.

360
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,165
I've got them right here.

361
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:27,254
The lamb has only an omega
on its forehead, no alpha.

362
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,131
An omega. The end.

363
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,551
Killing the lamb signifies the end.
Holy fuck.

364
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,554
What if Travis isn't done killing?

365
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,354
- Deb.
- I think Travis is gonna kill again.

366
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,275
- When?
- Before the eclipse.

367
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,154
That's an hour from now.

368
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,698
I know, but I think
he's gonna make a sacrifice.

369
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,408
An offering to his god.

370
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,662
It makes sense, right?

371
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,457
A spilling of blood
to bless the new world.

372
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,083
I mean, I'm not 100% sure, but...

373
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,626
In the last drawing
from Gellar's book,

374
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,962
one of the witnesses has a sword,

375
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,756
and the animal approaching them is...

376
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,882
A lamb.

377
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,468
And that tableau that Gellar did
on campus a few years back,

378
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,053
the slaughter of a lamb.

379
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,221
I don't know
what a lamb means to this crazy prick.

380
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,558
It could be an actual lamb,
it could be an innocent of some kind,

381
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,852
but I think that could be
his next kill.

382
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,064
I gotta go.

383
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,529
Excuse me, Sister.
Have you seen Harrison?

384
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,823
Yes. He just left.

385
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,241
He left?

386
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,368
He was with a man
wearing a lion's mask.

387
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,996
- I thought it was you.
- Where'd they go?

388
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:58,553
The time is nigh
and the end is near

389
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,682
It's time for God's children
to listen and hear

390
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:07,813
For his word has said
that the world will end

391
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:12,984
And the mountain will fall
when he comes again

392
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,957
Hey!

393
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,334
Hey, little boy! Hey, come back here!

394
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,400
The time is 3:26.
Get ready for the eclipse...

395
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,651
Should all be in place by now, right?

396
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,069
Yeah.

397
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,572
Four Seasons,
this is Lieutenant Morgan.

398
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,240
We're all clear up here.

399
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,243
No sign of Travis
or a lamb of any kind.

400
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,663
Copy that. Miami Tower,
this is Lieutenant Morgan. All clear?

401
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,082
All clear.

402
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,458
Copy that.

403
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:14,087
Transcorp Building,
this is Lieutenant Morgan. All clear?

404
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:21,887
Transcorp?

405
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,098
All clear.

406
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,322
So jump to the sky
Repent of your sins

407
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,326
Run to your saviour

408
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,706
and you'll be saved again

409
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,252
It is done.

410
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,176
I am the alpha and the omega.

411
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,599
I am the beginning and the end.

412
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,684
I am making everything new.

413
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,145
No!

414
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,731
Stop!

415
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,650
What?

416
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,943
Get away from him!

417
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,527
I killed you. Stay back!

418
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,155
You're supposed to be dead.

419
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,242
How's the world going to end
if the beast is still alive?

420
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,952
It won't.

421
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,955
Until the beast is dead,
a sacrifice is meaningless.

422
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,833
Time is running out, Travis.

423
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,294
I know that. Stay there!

424
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,547
Take me, and let my son go.

425
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,425
You need me. You don't need him.

426
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,427
Let him go. Take him to the elevator.

427
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,346
Do you have
any of your needles with you?

428
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:49,599
Yes.

429
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,393
Let's see it.

430
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,270
Show me.

431
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,569
Inject yourself.

432
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,323
I will, but not until you let him go.

433
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,960
It's OK, buddy.

434
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,555
Stop! You stay there!

435
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,524
Inject yourself, or I'll kill him.

436
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,195
Do it now!

437
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,023
The eclipse is here, Travis.

438
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,326
Daddy's here.

439
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,842
Looks like the moon has
just finished traversing the sun.

440
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,428
Lieutenant, it's the Four Seasons.
We're all clear.

441
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,764
Miami Tower's all clear.

442
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,724
Marquis, all clear.

443
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,185
50 Biscayne, all clear.

444
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:58,895
The eclipse is over. Nothing happened.

445
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,522
Marinablue, all clear.

446
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,565
400 Main, all clear.

447
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,984
Transcorp hasn't checked in.

448
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,533
Transcorp, this is Lieutenant Morgan.
Are you there?

449
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,827
Are you there?

450
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,829
Transcorp, do you copy?

451
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,916
God fucking damn it!

452
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:28,133
10-1, 10-1. Officer down
on top of the Transcorp Building.

453
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,051
Get the paramedics up here now.

454
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,761
Search every fucking inch
of this place!

455
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,430
- Yes, ma'am.
- First quadrant, clear.

456
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,932
- Second quadrant, clear.
- Third quadrant, clear.

457
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,476
- Fourth quadrant, clear.
- All clear.

458
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,687
No sign of Marshall.

459
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,397
Lieutenant!

460
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,780
What the fuck is that?

461
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,283
Looks like it was some kind of altar.

462
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,952
Maybe the officer was the sacrifice.

463
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,121
Let's go! Move!

464
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,914
South quadrant.

465
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,420
Deb, what happened?

466
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,713
He got away.

467
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,423
Lieutenant, the officer's dead.

468
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,969
Deb, you OK?

469
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,305
What does it matter?

470
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,599
How does any of it fucking matter?

471
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,892
Shit.

472
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,900
Where's Morgan?

473
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,486
She needed a moment alone.

474
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,905
She's over there.

475
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,288
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

476
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,959
Don't, OK?

477
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,421
You made the right call.

478
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,968
What is this, you being understanding?

479
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,137
Pragmatic.

480
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,808
You kick a horse during the race,
not after it's over.

481
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,647
Travis Marshall was here.

482
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,108
Yeah, and an officer is dead.

483
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,110
Because of Travis Marshall.

484
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,820
Who's still out there.

485
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,073
Who knows what he'll do next?
He's capable of anything.

486
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:19,369
And if he fucking disappears,
this case could stay open forever.

487
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,788
You'd always have that
to throw back in my face.

488
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,873
I won't do that.

489
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,251
Why, it's not best for Miami Metro?

490
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,670
Because you'll find him.

491
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,092
You have the potential
to be a good lieutenant,

492
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,804
but you need to prioritise.

493
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,807
You're letting your emotions
take charge of you.

494
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,729
You know what worked for me?

495
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,024
Making my job the centre of my life.

496
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:55,572
Puts everything else in perspective
because the control is all mine.

497
00:42:56,282 --> 00:43:00,285
And that's what you need to do, Deb,
take control.

498
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,523
One thing I'm sure I have faith in

499
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,693
is the staying power
of animal tranquilisers.

500
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,820
Is that my shirt?

501
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,085
The mighty kings return!

502
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,338
It's a jungle out there.

503
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,214
Here, I'll put him to bed.

504
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,384
No, I got it. I have to go back out.

505
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,971
- Late night?
- Probably not too late.

506
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,474
Deb wants me to
go back to a crime scene,

507
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,352
- collect some evidence.
- OK.

508
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,813
Let me see those paws,
let me see those paws.

509
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,610
I'm glad you're safe.

510
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:22,492
Whether you're a lion or a lamb,
I'll always love you.

511
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,377
Maybe that's all I need
to pass on to you.

512
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,104
You were right.

513
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,689
Debra, we can schedule a time...

514
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,190
I told him.

515
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,694
I fucking told my brother
that I love him,

516
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,279
and he said "I love you" back.

517
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,783
Not, "Me, too,"
or something like that.

518
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,244
- He actually said, "I love you."
- Wow.

519
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,578
That's big, isn't it?

520
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:11,916
Yeah, I mean, I don't think he
understood that I'm in love with him,

521
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,794
but still, he said the actual words
for the first time.

522
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,422
So what do you think it means?

523
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:21,467
I don't know what the fuck it means.
That's why I'm here.

524
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,430
Is this just...

525
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,809
horribly wrong?

526
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,229
Does it feel wrong?

527
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,480
It makes...

528
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,942
my whole life...

529
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,490
every man I've ever loved, make sense.

530
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,287
It's like I've always been
looking for someone like Dexter

531
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,998
or someone
who's the opposite of Dexter

532
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,668
as a way to avoid the fact
that I'm in love with him.

533
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,005
That's just clear to me now,

534
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,593
and I want it to be clear to him.

535
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,678
I want him to understand.

536
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,180
OK.

537
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,477
You want to tell him how you feel
in a way that he can hear you.

538
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:13,770
Yes.

539
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,194
Is this how it feels
to be in control of your emotions?

540
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,324
But you can't control his.

541
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,994
You don't know
how he's going to react.

542
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,472
Hello, Jesus.

543
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,644
Hello, Travis.

544
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,145
What?

545
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,148
What is going on?

546
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,819
This is the way the world ends.

547
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,905
- Your world, anyway.
- No!

548
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:09,325
No, no! I'm supposed to
finish enacting the seven keys.

549
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,994
- Sorry.
- But I was chosen!

550
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,081
I was chosen to
bring about the new world.

551
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,916
Chosen to kill innocent people?

552
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,251
No one is innocent.

553
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,086
My son is. You tried to kill him.

554
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,338
God allowed his son to die.

555
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,924
How could you believe in that?

556
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,718
Because I walk the path
of the righteous.

557
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,763
I've known people who believed in God.

558
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,849
They would never use their faith

559
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:36,561
as a convenient excuse
to kill 10 people.

560
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,438
You used God.

561
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,899
It's not the other way around.

562
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,402
You...

563
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,947
You are a shining example

564
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,741
of how putrid man has become.

565
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,954
I am a father,

566
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,124
a son,

567
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,752
a serial killer.

568
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,799
You're going to burn in hell.

569
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,303
No, I think I belong right here.

570
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,978
Because maybe there is
a place for me in this world...

571
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,524
just as I am.

572
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,488
Light cannot exist without darkness.

573
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,326
Each has its purpose.

574
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,206
And if there is a purpose
to my darkness,

575
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:42,501
maybe it's to bring some...

576
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,504
balance to the world.

577
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,473
Because, let's face it,

578
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,517
the world is going to be
a better place without you.

579
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,022
The world is going to end.

580
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,232
And when it does,

581
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,151
I will be by God's side.

582
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,737
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

583
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,864
Good for you.

584
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,368
You're mocking me.

585
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,536
No, I almost envy you.

586
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,580
It must be nice

587
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,208
to be so certain.

588
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,669
You're wrong about everything

589
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,004
because you don't believe in God,

590
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,716
but I have faith.
I trust in God's plan.

591
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,426
Really?

592
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,888
Then it must be God's plan
that you're on my table.

593
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,354
Do you think it's God's will
that I'm about to kill you?

594
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,898
God has nothing to do with this!

595
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,109
You are wrapped in plastic

596
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,611
because I want to kill you.

597
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,867
This is not how it's supposed to be!

598
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,913
Maybe this is exactly
how it's supposed to be.

599
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:09,588
Maybe everything
is exactly as it should be.

600
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,225
Oh, God.
