1
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,300
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,760
You're not alone anymore, Dexter.

3
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:17,474
You can be yourself with me,
your real, genuine self.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,226
You can...

5
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,769
Sorry.

6
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,439
Jonah, why are you still here?

7
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,150
I can't leave my mom
and sister alone with him.

8
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,737
Everything's ready to mark the whore.

9
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,281
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,449
No, please.

11
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,284
- Where are you taking me?
- You're free.

12
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,911
I know it was Nick who shot you.

13
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,165
Tell him that I forgive him.

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,834
He's dead, which makes you a murderer.

15
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,754
They got no proof.
Nobody can do anything!

16
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,138
Hey, little brother.

17
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,641
Miss me?

18
00:02:55,425 --> 00:03:00,470
I've been lost before.
After Rita died, after Lumen left.

19
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,766
But now I've been found.

20
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,896
Brian Moser, my dead brother,

21
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,273
it's been a long time
since I've seen him.

22
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,400
Too long.

23
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,778
Here. Catch.

24
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,994
You used to love to play.
Why the long face?

25
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,581
Brother Sam had hoped I'd be able
to forgive Nick for shooting him.

26
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,461
Cos you don't turn the other cheek,
you slice it.

27
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:36,506
Brother Sam doesn't know you
like Brother Brian does.

28
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,799
Admit it.

29
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,844
You're a little glad to see me.

30
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,597
- I feel...
- Relieved?

31
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,516
Relieved. Unburdened.

32
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,810
Like maybe I can stop pretending.

33
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,273
Pretending there's any light in me.

34
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,484
Feel that sun.

35
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,278
Feels good, doesn't it?

36
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,659
You know, we don't have to go back.

37
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,619
We could keep going.

38
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,666
It's Debra.

39
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,211
The one that got away.

40
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,005
Hey, Deb, what's up?

41
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,383
I'll get there as soon as I can.

42
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,013
We'll talk about this later.

43
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,901
Closing the door. Must be serious.

44
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,240
Very serious.

45
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,367
It's Trinity.

46
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,536
He's back. He killed again.

47
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,541
- He... What?
- Two people.

48
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,584
Family members, his wife,

49
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,004
Sally Mitchell,
and his daughter Rebecca.

50
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,508
Witpro placed the Mitchells
in the middle of Bumfuck, Nebraska,

51
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,052
and somehow Trinity managed
to track them down.

52
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,847
Well, not Trinity. You killed Trinity.

53
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,099
What about his son, Jonah?

54
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,727
Trinity came after him, too,
but Jonah survived the attack.

55
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,894
How lucky.

56
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,604
Didn't he say what happened?

57
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,106
According to his statement,

58
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,733
Jonah came home from work

59
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,360
and saw Trinity push Sally
down the stairs

60
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,570
and begin to beat her.

61
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,906
Jonah fought him off. Trinity ran.

62
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,452
And Jonah went upstairs
and found Rebecca

63
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,747
dead in a tub.

64
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,750
Or Jonah killed them

65
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,753
and is masquerading
as the Trinity Killer.

66
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,591
And this all happened in Nebraska?

67
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,969
Some town called Kearney.

68
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,137
Road trip.

69
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,268
Brother Sam's death is
hard enough on you, I'm sure,

70
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,103
and to top it off with this...

71
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,938
Let's go kill Jonah.

72
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,943
- I... I'm gonna need some time.
- Whatever you need.

73
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,321
Take the day.

74
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,082
"Carnival."

75
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,170
- What?
- Nothing.

76
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,839
I just love having you here.

77
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,343
Usually when you come to stay with me,

78
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,514
there's some problem
that you need help with.

79
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:40,982
I can't, for the life of me,
figure out how...

80
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,323
how to turn off the predictive text
on my phone.

81
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,658
Do you have any idea how to do that?

82
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,661
I texted my boss
that I had two tickets to jizz fest.

83
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,038
Well, maybe you'll get a promotion.

84
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,166
Well, I wouldn't hold my breath
on that one.

85
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,294
Your boss doesn't mind
you not coming in?

86
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,963
My boss thinks I'm out tracking down

87
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,174
an ancient manuscript
from a private collector.

88
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,388
You sure you can't get
the whole day off?

89
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,850
Parent/teacher conferences are a bitch
to reschedule.

90
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,229
I'll only be a few hours.

91
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,538
- I'm done.
- Done?

92
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,165
With you. With everything.

93
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,377
God is the one with choice, Travis.

94
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,546
He chose you and me.

95
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,257
We, however, have no say.

96
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,426
What about free will?

97
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,012
Please. Let me inside.

98
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,058
No. You see? Free will.

99
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,060
God's will doesn't stop

100
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,062
just because you want to play house
with your sister.

101
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,232
Until this little detour of yours
is over,

102
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:08,278
I will carry on his work.
For the both of us.

103
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,913
Rebecca Mitchell.

104
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,790
Severed femoral artery.
She bled out in minutes.

105
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,793
- Razor blade?
- Check.

106
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,254
- Mirror?
- Check.

107
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,923
Sally Mitchell.

108
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,927
She was pushed down the stairs,
but that's not what killed her.

109
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,263
She suffered blunt-force traumas
to the head, neck and chest.

110
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,933
She was bludgeoned.
Was it with a hammer?

111
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,643
Hockey stick.

112
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,271
A girl dead in the bathtub,
a mom pushed and bludgeoned.

113
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,607
Kind of
an efficient little combo pack there.

114
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,025
Jonah's been a very good student.

115
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,779
But Jonah loved his mom and sister.

116
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,950
When has love ever kept people
from killing one another?

117
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,454
You and I both know how easy
it would be to choke Becca out.

118
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,289
Jonah climbs in the tub behind her,

119
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,209
cuts off her airway, opens her artery.

120
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,212
Now, Mommy,
it's kind of genius of Jonah

121
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,130
to bludgeon her on the staircase, why?

122
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,551
Because the castoff pattern is
consistent with Trinity's height.

123
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,969
Jonah stands on the highest step,

124
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,305
and suddenly he's as tall
as good old dad.

125
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,474
Kid has some real talent.

126
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,852
It's in his blood.

127
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,147
Son of a serial killer
becomes a killer.

128
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,482
What are the odds?

129
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,988
Let's go play in your room.

130
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,199
Cute kid. My nephew.

131
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,415
Kearney, Nebraska is a mere 30 hours
from Miami, FLA.

132
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,333
Thirty-one if you must stop
along the way.

133
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,045
We could rent a car, take I-95 north.

134
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,173
Don't tell me
you're having second thoughts.

135
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,759
What about DDK?
Miami Metro could get to them first.

136
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,053
- They're not even close!
- I don't know.

137
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,597
When you 86'ed Trinity,

138
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,516
you gave Jonah the perfect alibi
to get away with murder.

139
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,686
I know how much you hate it
when people get away with murder.

140
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,855
Everyone, that is, except for you.

141
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,441
So I'm a little, what,
responsible for this happening?

142
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,693
Your life is nothing
but responsibility.

143
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,528
Look around, Dexter.

144
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,405
Look at your life!

145
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,950
Sippy cups, poopy diapers,
baby monitors!

146
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,368
You've been domesticated!

147
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,039
You need to take this trip.

148
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,957
Come on, Dexter.

149
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,711
When was the last time you had fun?

150
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,217
Thanks for coming over
on such short notice.

151
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,136
No problem.

152
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,472
I shouldn't be gone
more than four or five days.

153
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,560
Come in.

154
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,480
Timing's perfect.

155
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,732
The first chapter of my dissertation
is due next week,

156
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,734
and I never get anything done at home,

157
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,111
especially when Angel's there.

158
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,739
It's Brother Sam, isn't it?
You miss him.

159
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,909
I just need to get away from it all.

160
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,494
I'll only bug you
if it's super important.

161
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,246
- Where you going?
- I'm not sure.

162
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,583
Maybe down to the Keys,
wherever the road takes me.

163
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,086
Well, have fun. Let's get you to bed.

164
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,090
- I love you.
- Wow. "Love." Really?

165
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,759
It's weird seeing you with a kid.

166
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,594
Let's go to Nebraska.

167
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,994
Starting your mornings off right,

168
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,706
Georgia's Heart to Heart,
Rock Hits 96.

169
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,295
Deb, hey, it's me.

170
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,464
You know, I'm gonna need
more than a day to clear my head.

171
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,008
It's hard to concentrate.

172
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,511
There's a lot to digest, I guess.

173
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,180
I'll be back in four days, five tops.

174
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,642
Hope that hearing thing goes well.

175
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,482
Seventy percent of the murders
in my district were by firearms.

176
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,318
What percentage of murders
is by spiked collar?

177
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,323
I created a separate category
for the Doomsday Killer murders.

178
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,827
So that those unsolved cases
don't count against your clearances?

179
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,372
What is your division's
clearance rate?

180
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,250
Forty-two percent.

181
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:36,755
Add back in the open DDK murders,
and your clearance rate drops to...

182
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,218
Twenty-nine percent,
but I can explain...

183
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,846
Numbers can't hear you. Moving on.

184
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,515
Hey.

185
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,519
Six of those murders happened
on your watch, before I took over.

186
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,229
The clearance rate is a running total.

187
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,023
It doesn't matter
who was in the lieutenant's position.

188
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,734
If it doesn't fucking matter,
then what was that in there?

189
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,943
Cos it felt personal.

190
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,946
That was my first COMPSTAT hearing,
as a captain.

191
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,870
So you were just as nervous as I was.

192
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,246
But it has to be a fuckload easier

193
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,791
to sit there and listen to stats
than it is to present them.

194
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,751
It is. But as your captain,

195
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,212
they're my stats, too,
so they have to be accurate.

196
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,965
My numbers are lousy.
Makes me feel lousy.

197
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,219
That's why I like COMPSTAT.
It's just numbers.

198
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,642
Look, I don't know what happened
between you and Quinn,

199
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,562
but I lost a relationship
because of this job,

200
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,234
and I take great comfort
in the pure objectivity of numbers.

201
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,113
At COMPSTAT, there's no age,
no gender, no feelings.

202
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,782
Improve your numbers,

203
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,450
and everything will change.
I promise you.

204
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,995
And if you don't catch DDK,
you will crash and burn.

205
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,266
Hey, bro, I got your message.

206
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:15,186
I know this is a tough time for you,
so take today off.

207
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,480
But please don't take four.

208
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,108
What's left of my ass just got handed
to me on a paper plate

209
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,943
at the COMPSTAT hearing.

210
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,113
DDK is either gonna make my career
or end it.

211
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,448
I need your help.

212
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,395
She's cute.

213
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,190
No. I keep telling you no.

214
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,526
Go talk to her, Dexter.

215
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,819
I told you

216
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,488
I don't like fucking
when your mom's home.

217
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,742
Register's over here. I gotta go.

218
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,748
Smile, Dexter.

219
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,044
You know, if it's any consolation,

220
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,004
I think boundaries are good
in a relationship.

221
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,213
Is that right?

222
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,924
Let's do her.

223
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,217
I, for example,
would never fuck anyone

224
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,552
if my mom were home.

225
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,429
Or I should say
if my adoptive mother were home.

226
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,015
I could never have fucked anyone
if my actual mother were home,

227
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,059
cos she was murdered in front of me
when I was three.

228
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,394
Is that right?

229
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,732
I don't see any mothers around here.
Do you?

230
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,746
That was...

231
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,706
Thanks.

232
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,252
Wouldn't it have been more fun
to kill her than fuck her?

233
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,714
I got what I wanted.

234
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,724
Right through the "O".

235
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,898
I don't even like guns.

236
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,984
Faster! Let's go faster!

237
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,159
Try different targets.
Something more familiar.

238
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,964
Gospel Hour is happy
to welcome Pastor Bill O'Connor

239
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,925
of Kearney's
First United Methodist Church.

240
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,136
He will command his angels,
concerning you,

241
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,304
and they will lift you up
in their hands,

242
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,266
so that you will not strike
your foot against a stone.

243
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,279
A twister would do this town a favour.

244
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,368
Stay here.
I want to talk to Jonah face-to-face.

245
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,157
Hello, Dexter Morgan.

246
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,536
After Rita Morgan died,

247
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:04,165
Kyle Butler's face was all over
the news as her grieving husband.

248
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,003
That's when we realised Kyle Butler
was really Dexter Morgan.

249
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,589
No one connected the dots for the FBI.

250
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,841
We talked about it,

251
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,845
but decided as a family
that you tried to help us.

252
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,890
So we tried to help you.

253
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,770
But why did you lie
about who you were?

254
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,023
I was trying to protect my family.

255
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,568
I suspected your dad
was the Trinity Killer.

256
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,947
I thought I could bring him to justice

257
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,200
before he killed again.

258
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,413
I wanted to be a hero. It was stupid,

259
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,040
and selfish.

260
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,252
That's what got Rita killed.

261
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,963
Then my father ruined both our lives.

262
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,382
What happened here, Jonah?

263
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,136
What I really think happened?

264
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,554
This I want to hear.

265
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:04,267
My mom probably called him
at some point asking for money,

266
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,769
making it easy for him to find us.

267
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,689
- Did you see your father?
- Yeah.

268
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,151
I mean, I heard him before I saw him

269
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,612
fighting with my mom
at the top of the stairs.

270
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,365
And I came in, and he looked at me.

271
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,452
Then he pushed her down the stairs
like he wanted me to see.

272
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,206
Then he started hitting her
with my hockey stick,

273
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,293
and I grabbed it and fought him off.
He ran.

274
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,172
I went to my mom and...

275
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:41,012
Then I went upstairs,
and that's when I found Becca.

276
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,056
What a performance.

277
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,433
Jonah, I'm sorry.

278
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,143
You're sorry?

279
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,187
For your loss.

280
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,816
Yeah, well,
I'm sorry for your loss, too.

281
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:59,071
Now, is that why you came
all the way out here? To tell me that?

282
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,826
I just wanted to see
how you were holding up.

283
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,329
I'm gonna be OK.

284
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,086
Go back to Miami. It's over.

285
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,592
I'd say the fun is just beginning.

286
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,682
LT.

287
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,602
The unis took a statement
from a woman at St Joseph's.

288
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,229
Says she was chained up for a few days

289
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,605
by someone called "the Professor".

290
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,649
Was her name Mary Ann or Ginger?

291
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,859
No, it's Holly.

292
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,741
One of them kept
calling the other "Professor".

293
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,245
But I didn't see either of them.
I was blindfolded.

294
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,621
There were two of them?

295
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,581
The younger guy is the one
who let me go.

296
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,876
I sort of could tell
that he was the weaker of the two.

297
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,879
The younger guy said...
He kept calling me...

298
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,590
Holly, you're safe.

299
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,634
What did he call you?

300
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,595
The whore.

301
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,265
They didn't touch me,
except when they chained me.

302
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,226
And the Professor, I think,

303
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,355
would jam his knee behind my neck

304
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,777
and hold my head,
so that I couldn't close my mouth.

305
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,029
And then he would pour this stuff
into it.

306
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,032
And the younger guy kept
saying that he was sorry,

307
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,742
so sorry for doing this to me.

308
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,119
What'd they make you drink?

309
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,247
It was cold and it made me puke.

310
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,957
It tasted like metal.

311
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,917
I think it was blood.

312
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,257
There's probably no way
to get a sample of that blood,

313
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,384
but we should run it all past Dexter.

314
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,553
Jamie said she was watching Harrison
for a few days.

315
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:49,432
Yeah, Dex said he needed a break,
so he just took off.

316
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,599
I get that.

317
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,018
Did Jamie mention where he was going?

318
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,020
No, but it was part
of a larger conversation

319
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,188
about a date she has with Louis.

320
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,649
- Masuka's intern?
- Yeah. She met him at your party.

321
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,318
Let me get this straight.

322
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,695
The guy who is Masuka's tool
all day long

323
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,363
is gonna be sexing up your sister?

324
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,115
When you get a hold of Dexter,
find me.

325
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,076
...for the Knights of Columbus
Demolition Derby.

326
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,370
Make sure you stop by
and give Doc a big hello.

327
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,624
Debra, Debra, Debra.

328
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,668
Is she really worth it, Dexter?

329
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,922
What is it with you and her?

330
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,550
I feel like I ran over a nail
or something.

331
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,636
Let's pull over.

332
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,680
We need to find a base camp, anyway.

333
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,894
This looks good.

334
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,881
And if I can just get your signature
right there.

335
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,218
Keep that pen if you want.

336
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,805
That'll be $39. Please, and thank you.

337
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,478
I saw from your plates
that you're from Florida.

338
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,313
Must be happy to get out of there.

339
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,149
From what I see on the news,
that Miami is a real sewer.

340
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,653
And now, whatever the hell
is going on down there.

341
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,321
Horses running in the streets.

342
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,950
- People say the world is ending.
- Crazy assholes.

343
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,661
So what brings you to these parts?

344
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,957
I'm following the Oregon Trail.

345
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,835
Well, so partial
to the great outdoors,

346
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,294
what is it you do back in Florida?

347
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,004
Landscaping.

348
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,965
Never made any sense to me.

349
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:50,010
Just hiring someone to do
what nature does naturally.

350
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,596
This place would turn anyone
into a homicidal maniac.

351
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,807
Can you point me
to the nearest garage? I have a flat.

352
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,684
I can patch that for you.

353
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,854
- You can do that?
- Yeah. We're pretty handy here.

354
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,106
Unlike us city people.

355
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,150
Can you patch a tyre?

356
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,361
No, I cannot.

357
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,364
Well, I'm happy to help. I'll give you
a good deal, too. How about 20 bucks?

358
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,200
- Sign me up.
- It's a deal.

359
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,911
Not a callous on that hand, is there?

360
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,666
I wear gloves when I work.

361
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,420
About how long do you think?

362
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,047
It shouldn't take me
more than a while.

363
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,883
Town's not too far
if you want to grab a bite.

364
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,676
Just follow the road.
It'll take you directly there.

365
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,761
I'm starving.

366
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,723
You're welcome.

367
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,862
Shortcut?

368
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,614
Lead the way.

369
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,096
It's a little pot farm.

370
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:21,143
Now I see why Shady Norm
wanted us to stay on the road.

371
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,438
Shady Norm's been a very
industrious little fellow, hasn't he?

372
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,483
Come on, let's get out of here.

373
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,068
Let's get lunch.

374
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,966
"When the whore of Babylon
is revealed,

375
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,968
"she is sitting
on a scarlet coloured beast

376
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,135
"having seven heads."

377
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,055
There were some pictures of this beast
in Gellar's sketch book.

378
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,807
I blew them up a little.
Looks like a dragon.

379
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,684
Yeah, on paper.

380
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,978
Who knows how they'll bring it to life
in the next tableau?

381
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,187
Listen to this.

382
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,857
"The whore, in addition to being
arrayed in purple and scarlet,

383
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,318
"will be drunk
with the blood of the saints."

384
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,237
That's why they had
Holly drink the blood.

385
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,655
Drunk on the blood of the saints?

386
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,240
Were they making her
drink their blood?

387
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,910
If they considered themselves saints,
the creepy fucks.

388
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,079
And why'd the younger guy let her go?
Who is he?

389
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,747
Probably a former student, right?

390
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,666
I mean, he kept referring to Gellar
as "Professor".

391
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,585
How do we get an ID on him?

392
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,254
Well, Gellar taught at Tallahassee
for 12 years.

393
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,883
400 students per year, 4,800 names.
2,400 if you exclude females.

394
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,010
So if they're gonna continue,

395
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,262
the best way for us
to stop the next murder from happening

396
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,347
is to get a name
on Gellar's accomplice

397
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,684
in a haystack
of 2,400 potential suspects?

398
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,853
Fuck just isn't enough right now.

399
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,896
2,400 is not that big a number.

400
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,940
Yeah, unless you're talking virgins.

401
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,775
Maybe I could be of some help.

402
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,944
I'll work on it.

403
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,615
I would kill myself, but it would add
to my murder total for the month.

404
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,200
At least we're closer to catching him
than we were this morning.

405
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,036
Yeah, I feel a lot better.

406
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,873
Where the fuck is Dexter?

407
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,379
I promise I won't tell anyone.

408
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,797
Well, how do I know I can trust you?

409
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,595
Oh, well, that kiss is a contract,
you know.

410
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,221
- Come on.
- All right.

411
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,223
OK, this is rough.

412
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,059
And it's not even
a beta version, but...

413
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,730
You totally got my brother.

414
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,275
Even down to the way
that hat sits on his big head.

415
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,777
Is he like the star of your game?

416
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,737
Well, the game is
modelled on the department,

417
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,282
so if he's the lead on a case,
then he's kind of the star. Yeah.

418
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,117
- You're really smart.
- I know.

419
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,246
Someone's here.

420
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,751
- Debra?
- Hi. Where's Dexter?

421
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,960
On a trip.

422
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,629
Where did he go?

423
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,339
I don't know.

424
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,799
The Keys?

425
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,634
His boat is still docked
at the marina.

426
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,968
Well, maybe he took his car.

427
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,639
- Have you tried calling him?
- About a thousand times.

428
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,517
But not from here.

429
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,771
If you could go somewhere else,
where would it be?

430
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,482
I've never been to Portland.

431
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,775
That's a little predictable, isn't it?

432
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,485
Isn't that
where all serial killers go?

433
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,699
Home, sweet home.
Don't answer that, Dexter.

434
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,826
Jamie? What's wrong?

435
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,286
Where in fucktopia are you?

436
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,705
Deb. Hi.

437
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,790
Did you get my messages?

438
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,375
What's that sound?

439
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,627
I can barely hear you.
The reception's terrible.

440
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,546
We had a breakthrough on the DDK case.

441
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,465
- Deb, I gotta go.
- You know,

442
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,468
you could have asked me
before you just took off.

443
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,346
You offered me some time off.

444
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,141
I meant the afternoon,
not five fucking days

445
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,476
to go wherever it is that you are!

446
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,186
Where are you?

447
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,730
It's, I don't know,

448
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,233
personal.

449
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,359
I'm your sister.

450
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,654
Then tell my lieutenant
that I'll be back as soon as I can.

451
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,906
I'm sorry, you're breaking up.

452
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,160
We don't have much time.
We gotta do Jonah's now.

453
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,745
Let's go.

454
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,204
Goody.

455
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,282
There it is. 1965 Walnut Street.

456
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,619
Home of the family
formerly known as the Mitchells.

457
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,209
You want to kill him here
or just lie in wait?

458
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,880
Neither.

459
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,174
Then what are we doing here?

460
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,384
I don't know
for sure that he's guilty.

461
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,012
Not this again.

462
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,722
Harry's code.

463
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,601
Tell me why it matters
if a person is good or bad.

464
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,229
Does it make you feel better
to kill bad people?

465
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,438
It's part of the ritual.

466
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,732
You don't need
a justification to kill.

467
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,275
The code is more than that.

468
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,860
It's kept me from getting caught.

469
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,404
It's given me a life.

470
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,115
A life that is a big, fat lie.

471
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,743
Just like Jonah's story.

472
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,622
What more proof do you need
that Jonah's guilty?

473
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,923
The FBI didn't photograph
the entire living room.

474
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,092
Maybe Jonah made a rookie mistake.

475
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,428
My knives!

476
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,140
I'm guessing it's the motel gimp.

477
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,978
Whoever it is
also took my forensic kit.

478
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,146
Now, that I don't miss so much.

479
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,788
It's the Midwest.

480
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,125
Nobody locks their doors.

481
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,440
There's no blood anywhere.

482
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,653
Bleach.

483
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,488
He cleaned up.

484
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,204
Rebecca died in the bathtub upstairs.

485
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,374
I'm bored.

486
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,545
Why aren't we setting up a kill room?

487
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,633
This is where Jonah would
have had to stand

488
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,135
to make it look like
his father beat his mother to death.

489
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,139
Try it. Take a pretend swing.

490
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,696
Not the best clean-up job
I've ever seen.

491
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,032
Now for the living room.

492
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,911
This is the kitchen.

493
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,996
I'm making a test for bleach,

494
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,874
which I wouldn't have to do
if my forensic kit hadn't been stolen.

495
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,429
Get the fuck out of my house.

496
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,600
Show me where it happened, Jonah.

497
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,937
Your father killed your mother here,
on this staircase?

498
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,563
Police can be here in three minutes.

499
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,440
Here is where her body was,

500
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,735
and here is where you cleaned up
your mother's blood.

501
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,696
You're a sick fuck, you know that?

502
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,698
Where'd you fight your father off?
It was here, right?

503
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,367
When you took the weapon from him
and hit him,

504
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,244
- chasing him off?
- Yeah.

505
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,372
- Swinging at him the whole time.
- Yeah, I was. Yeah.

506
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,582
If that were true,
there'd be blood here on the wall,

507
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,335
and on the ceiling here.
But there's no spatter here.

508
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,504
Hey, that's because I cleaned it up.
Now go!

509
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,214
- With bleach?
- Yes.

510
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,592
Not on this wall.

511
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,428
Because there was no blood
on this wall,

512
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,179
because your father was never here.

513
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,435
I know for a fact that Trinity
did not kill anyone in this house.

514
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,237
Is that because you killed him?

515
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,200
Yes.

516
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,039
Just like you killed your mother
and your sister.

517
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,587
Get him.

518
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,898
Satisfied?

519
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,816
Let's go set up a kill room.

520
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,735
That's my baby brother.

521
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,279
What about your knives, Dexter?

522
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,822
You're gonna need them.

523
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,639
He's in the shed.

524
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,858
Hey, there.

525
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,028
You're real interesting, Florida,
you know that?

526
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:20,200
All these potions and solutions
in this kit I found in your car.

527
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,827
And these knives of yours.

528
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,206
They ain't exactly
landscaping tools now, are they?

529
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,127
I'd like them back.

530
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,380
I know you saw what I was growing
out there in that cornfield.

531
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,714
You know what's going on here.

532
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,550
- I don't care about that.
- Really?

533
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,218
Then what are you doing here?

534
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,054
You obviously have
some sort of desk job.

535
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,014
Those hands of yours are so smooth.

536
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,726
You with the DEA, ATF, FBI?

537
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,395
Why don't you put the knife down
and we can talk?

538
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:49,896
What are they worth to you?

539
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,359
I can see you have some money
by that fancy car of yours.

540
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,153
It's a rental.

541
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,321
This is not how I was hoping
our first kill would be.

542
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,907
I should think
knives like those of yours

543
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:05,328
would be worth $10,000 to you.

544
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,247
This guy is leaving you no choice.

545
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,207
He's gonna kill you
if you don't kill him first.

546
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,918
So I pay you $10,000,
you forget you ever saw me?

547
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,253
You can have your knives back.

548
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,840
I'll go find an ATM,
but I'm taking these with me.

549
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,675
I found this in your car, too.

550
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,137
$10,000.

551
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,847
Please, and thank you.

552
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,849
Or you're a dead man.

553
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,669
At last, a kill!

554
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,298
No lengthy vetting process,
no stalking.

555
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,091
One could argue self-defence, maybe.

556
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,636
A little too much talking
for my taste.

557
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,887
Did you see his eyes?

558
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,431
Yes.

559
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,100
Why do you wake up your victims
when they're on the table?

560
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,729
I want them to know what they've done.

561
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,855
Bullshit!

562
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,317
You like to watch the light
go out of their eyes.

563
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,029
Doesn't make a bit of difference
if they're guilty or not.

564
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,034
How do you feel?

565
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,039
Like anything is possible.

566
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,751
This is the life
I've always wanted for you.

567
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,838
Where do we go from here?

568
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,800
Jonah.

569
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,552
And then what, Dexter?

570
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,305
And then

571
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,642
we keep going.

572
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,647
But first things first.

573
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,901
How do you dispose of a body
when you're miles from an ocean?

574
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,862
Norm's a thief,
a pot-grower and an asshole,

575
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,282
any one of which
would explain his death.

576
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,825
You can just
leave his body out in the open.

577
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,707
I have a better idea.

578
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,594
I hope you took a souvenir.

579
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,731
It's nice to see you, Travis.
I thought you were done with me.

580
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,236
These are your things.
I wanted them out of my apartment.

581
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,867
Would have been a little bit easier

582
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,620
if you'd just dumped them
in the trash, wouldn't it?

583
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,541
I thought bringing them here
would give me closure.

584
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,254
Closure.

585
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,924
Sounds like you went
from reading the Bible

586
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,217
to reading the self-help books.

587
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,596
But if you really came here
because you secretly wanted me to beg,

588
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:56,226
well then,
please, Travis, come back to me.

589
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,228
I didn't come here to have you beg.

590
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,896
How about a story, then?

591
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,774
I read one the other day in the paper

592
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,610
about a little girl
in California who was abducted.

593
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,612
They went into her room,
and they grabbed her

594
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,864
while she was asleep
next to her teddy bear.

595
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,449
They raped her
and then they killed her,

596
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,867
and then they dumped her
into the woods.

597
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,828
- Don't tell me...
- There was another story

598
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,206
about someone
who set off a bomb in Pennsylvania.

599
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,127
Eleven people were killed, 20 maimed.

600
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:28,174
That's why the world as it is
has to end.

601
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,551
Stop talking.

602
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:34,389
The sins of humankind continue
unless we put a stop to it.

603
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,224
No, no, shut up. You shut up!

604
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,352
Are you gonna kill me?

605
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,855
Is that what you want to do, Travis?

606
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,609
What I want

607
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,241
is to be free.

608
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,668
I'll talk to God.

609
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,629
I release you.

610
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,674
I can go?

611
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,135
You know where the door is.

612
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,525
You have no messages.

613
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,114
You're looming.

614
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,703
I came to apologise.

615
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,460
I apologise
for being an asshole at your party.

616
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,129
And for sleeping
with that professor chick.

617
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,549
And I apologise for proposing to you.

618
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:57,764
I just thought it was something
people did after a while, you know?

619
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,350
Like buying a coffee table.

620
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,231
- We never bought a coffee table.
- Well, we talked about it.

621
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,274
And we couldn't talk
about getting married?

622
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:13,446
We did have something good, right?
I mean, I'm not crazy, am I?

623
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,492
Yeah.

624
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,995
We had something good.

625
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,709
You know, there's times
when I come home,

626
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,878
and I still expect to see you there.

627
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,257
And then I open up the door,

628
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,260
and everything's so neat and clean.

629
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,554
And it hits me all over again.

630
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,891
You're gone.

631
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:50,108
- I'm right here.
- Yeah.

632
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:54,070
- In LaGuerta's office.
- Fuck, I know, right?

633
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,573
It still feels like her office.

634
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,491
I think that's why
I haven't unpacked anything.

635
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,285
At all.

636
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,953
Yeah.

637
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,793
I wanted to tell you first
about this before anyone.

638
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,714
- I made that difficult.
- Yeah, but

639
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,011
you were hurt because of me.

640
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,348
And for that, I am truly sorry.

641
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,185
I really miss you, Deb.

642
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:32,025
You, like, kept me glued or something.

643
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,860
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doing.

644
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,945
I feel like the last day
my life made any sense

645
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,864
was the last day I spent with you.

646
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,302
We can't.

647
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,559
We're over, aren't we?

648
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,229
Like "over" over.

649
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,631
This is what our life together
could have been like

650
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,091
if you hadn't have killed me.

651
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,471
- Here's the call.
- Jonah.

652
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,807
Hello?

653
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,768
Dexter, can we talk about this?

654
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,436
Sure, Jonah.

655
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,940
Maybe somewhere private.
I was thinking the shop's closed.

656
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,274
I'll meet you there.

657
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,777
Jonah doesn't want to chitchat,
you know.

658
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,195
I know.

659
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,280
He has every reason
to want to kill me.

660
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,949
I'm the one person
who knows what he did.

661
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,827
Don't you just love it
when things fall into place?

662
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,826
You shouldn't have come to Nebraska.

663
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,536
I had to. I didn't believe it.

664
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,330
Believe what? That I turned
into a killer like my father?

665
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,666
Yes. I thought I set you free.

666
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,668
Set your whole family free.

667
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,504
I wanted to kill him myself.

668
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,091
But you'll settle
for killing your mom and your sister?

669
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,051
Yeah, and you.

670
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,892
Do it, Dexter! Do it!

671
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:13,895
Kill me!

672
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,565
What did you say?

673
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,859
Please.

674
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:24,030
- You want me to kill you?
- What are you waiting for?

675
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,948
Kill me for what I did.

676
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:32,872
Tell me what happened.

677
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,123
Who cares what happened?

678
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,708
I didn't kill Becca.

679
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,253
She killed herself.

680
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,299
I found her like that in the tub,
my baby sister.

681
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,053
God, I should have gotten her
out of that house sooner.

682
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,429
She couldn't take it any more.

683
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,265
- Take what?
- Dexter?

684
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,725
My mom.

685
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:58,064
How she just...
She blamed us for everything he did.

686
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,650
She just...
She was still in love with him.

687
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,276
She kept defending him.

688
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:08,115
She just wished he would come and
whisk her away to Thailand or Mexico.

689
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,409
Then I found Becca.

690
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,831
And I just... I exploded on Mom.

691
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:19,252
I kept hitting her over and over,
just like Dad!

692
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,838
I'm my father's son!

693
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,173
Time to put him down, Dexter.

694
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,601
You brought me here to provoke
a fight, hoping I would kill you.

695
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:39,146
Death by Dexter. Fantastic idea!

696
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,273
Kill him!

697
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,154
What if this were my son?

698
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,365
We have come so far.

699
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,658
He's not a monster.

700
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,952
Don't you want to see
the light in his eyes go out?

701
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,288
No.

702
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:59,959
- Think how good it will feel.
- He has a conscience.

703
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,711
And regret.

704
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,631
This is the wishy-washy part of you
I can't stand.

705
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,885
Biney's mad.

706
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,223
This is like Debra all over again.

707
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,309
You're weak.

708
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,981
I'm stronger than you.

709
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,068
We had a plan, Dexter.

710
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,320
Just you and me.

711
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,989
I'm going home.

712
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,998
- Baby brother.
- Wait!

713
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,668
How am I supposed to live with this?

714
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,840
Forgive yourself.

715
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,394
Have you been a good girl,
Debra Morgan?

716
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,730
Because it's about to be Christmas.

717
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,023
Show her, Louis.

718
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,108
I created a programme
that cross-referenced

719
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,737
former students of Gellar with people
living in a 20-mile radius of Miami.

720
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,198
- I excluded a few variables.
- And presto!

721
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,200
- Two hundred names.
- It was that easy?

722
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,953
- But not all that legal.
- Not a problemo.

723
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,455
Louis Greene is not
an employee of Miami Metro,

724
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,040
just an unpaid intern.

725
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,794
Thank you.

726
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,212
I think.

727
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,214
Here to serve.

728
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,557
If you want a ride to work,
I'm leaving in seven minutes.

729
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,227
- Not six?
- Not eight.

730
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,896
I'll be ready.

731
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,796
Brother Sam believed
light can keep darkness at bay.

732
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,425
But I wonder if darkness
is defined by light.

733
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,928
If so,
darkness can't exist on its own.

734
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,601
There must, by definition,
be light somewhere,

735
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,354
waiting to be found.

736
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,282
Welcome home, Son.
