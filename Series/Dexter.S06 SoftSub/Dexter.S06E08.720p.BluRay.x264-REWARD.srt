1
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,134
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,720
Gellar is pulling you
toward the darkness, Travis,

3
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:13,804
not the light.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,723
What's happening?

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,560
No, please.

6
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,644
You're free.

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,271
- I'm done.
- Done?

8
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,731
With you. With everything.

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,441
Oh, please.

10
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,610
God's will doesn't stop

11
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,571
just because you want to play house
with your sister.

12
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,948
You could have asked me
before you just took off.

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,117
You offered me some time off.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,786
I meant the afternoon,
not five fucking days

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,289
to go wherever it is that you are.

16
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,030
Kids trust everybody.

17
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,622
- For the little one.
- Here you go.

18
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,584
They trust the food you're giving them
is safe to eat.

19
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,294
This way, buddy.

20
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,422
They trust you to lead the way.

21
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,717
Not the usual today.
Two coffees and...

22
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,260
What's good for an apology?

23
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,595
Male or female?

24
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,930
- My sister.
- I'd go with a cruller.

25
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,140
OK.

26
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,766
They don't question your motives.

27
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,102
Give a kid a mouthful of sugar
and trans fat,

28
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,270
and he's your friend for life.

29
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,064
Thanks, Francisco.

30
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,617
Grown-ups are a lot harder.

31
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,786
My sister gave me a day off,
and I took five.

32
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,788
She has every right to be angry,

33
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,625
but I can't tell her
that I was in Nebraska.

34
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,793
Or why I was there.

35
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,842
Well, look what
the fucking cat dragged in.

36
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,345
The cat also brought
coffee and doughnuts.

37
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,096
You have five minutes.

38
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,807
Some of us actually
have to show up for work.

39
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,274
I see you're all moved in.

40
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,318
Now it's four minutes.

41
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,653
Right.

42
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,490
I'm sorry...

43
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,159
I took off like that, I...

44
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,496
really needed to get away.

45
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,833
I'm sorry about what happened
with Brother Sam.

46
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,628
And this whole Trinity thing sucks,
I get it.

47
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,880
And you want to blow me off?
That's fine, too.

48
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,383
But you put me in
a really shitty position at work.

49
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,509
- I know.
- Everybody thinks

50
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,387
I gave you a week off in the middle
of this DDK shit-storm,

51
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,347
which is only slightly better

52
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,308
than them knowing
that I didn't give you a week off!

53
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,060
I know.

54
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,982
- I took advantage of you.
- Yeah, you did.

55
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,276
I really am sorry.

56
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,780
OK.

57
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,199
You're forgiven.

58
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,202
But it's only because
I need you in on this DDK shit.

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,370
What's going on?

60
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,622
Looks like this chick, Holly Benson,

61
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,874
was taken by DDK.

62
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,377
She got chained up,
was held hostage...

63
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,380
but she got away.

64
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,548
How?

65
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,966
They dumped her in some parking lot.

66
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,385
What, "they"?

67
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,555
That's the best part.
Turns out there are two of these

68
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,557
end-of-the-world motherfuckers
out there.

69
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,058
Gellar and some younger guy.

70
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,560
He's the one that let our vic go.

71
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,061
I think he might be a former student.

72
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,981
Seems like Travis Marshall
isn't my secret any more.

73
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,483
Wow. Two of them.

74
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,570
Why did they let her go?

75
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,406
Why did they tie body parts
to mannequins?

76
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,035
Why did they hang a waitress
from a spiked collar in a greenhouse?

77
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,578
They're bat-shit. That's why.

78
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,248
But it sounds like Travis
is having second thoughts.

79
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,250
OK, I have to go.

80
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,587
I'll fill you in on the rest
when we get to the station.

81
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,422
Yeah, I'm going to be a little late.

82
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,258
You have got to be fucking kidding me.

83
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,511
Brother Sam's funeral is this morning.
I feel like I should...

84
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,100
OK. Fine, go.

85
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,686
Fucking funerals and doughnuts,
you're really good.

86
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,938
Sorry.

87
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,861
Travis?

88
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,780
Hey, just in time.

89
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,283
I got an egg white omelette,
your favourite kind of veggie bacon

90
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,951
and scones in the oven.

91
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,620
I can't believe you did all this.

92
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,288
Yeah, well,
you're always doing everything for me.

93
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,706
It's definitely my turn.

94
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,083
Go, sit down.

95
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,292
Just let me get dressed first.

96
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,794
All right, hurry up.

97
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,819
I remember that day.

98
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,946
What are you doing here?

99
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,322
You said I was free.

100
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,824
And you are.

101
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,033
But I can't say I'm impressed

102
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,660
with what you've done
with your freedom.

103
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,995
You traded your place in God's plan

104
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,164
for the pathetically mundane.

105
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,375
- I like mundane.
- Really?

106
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,962
Because when we met,
you had plenty of it.

107
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,256
Your sister treated you like a child.

108
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,675
You had no friends. No faith.

109
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,512
Your life was of no consequence,
and were you happy?

110
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,848
- It's not like that now.
- No.

111
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,016
Now you have garden gnomes and...

112
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,937
Someone's made you breakfast.

113
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,522
Want to see what I've made?

114
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,695
It's beautiful, isn't it?
All it needs is the right whore.

115
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,822
Travis?

116
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,163
I bet she'd look lovely in red.

117
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,667
You stay the fuck away!

118
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,468
Are you taking that out?

119
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,221
Yeah, I'll just... I'll do it later.

120
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,185
Travis, you all right?

121
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,313
Yeah, I'm fine.

122
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,315
Hey, do you want to get out of here
for a couple of days?

123
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,484
We... We could go to Disney World.

124
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,360
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

125
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,738
Right now, let's just... go.

126
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,033
Travis, you know I... I can't leave.
I have school.

127
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,412
But maybe in a...
in a couple of weeks on my break.

128
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,247
That would be fun.

129
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,381
How many people here can say
that Brother Sam changed my life?

130
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,723
Let us always keep him in our hearts.

131
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,436
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.

132
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,272
"He makes me lie down
in green pastures,

133
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,275
"he leads me beside quiet waters,

134
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,778
"he restores my soul.

135
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,905
"He guides me
in the paths of righteousness

136
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,740
"for his name's sake.

137
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,535
"Even though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

138
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,119
"I will fear no evil,

139
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,455
"for you are with me.

140
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,124
"Your rod and your staff,
they comfort me.

141
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,796
"You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

142
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,716
"You anoint my head with oil,
my cup overflows.

143
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,970
"Surely, goodness and love
will follow me

144
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,888
"all the days of my life,

145
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,808
"and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."

146
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,789
- Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.

147
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,670
Hey, Dexter.

148
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,964
OK.

149
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,133
I have something for you.

150
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,181
Sorry about the blood.

151
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,434
He always had it close by,

152
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,311
so when he was shot...

153
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,357
Last time I saw him,
he said he wanted you to have this.

154
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,113
There's probably someone else
who would get more use out of it,

155
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,656
someone more religious.

156
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,618
I don't know.

157
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,704
Brother Sam used to always say
that no matter what the problem is,

158
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,372
the answer's in here.

159
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,625
You just have to
figure out the question.

160
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,712
Oh, hey.

161
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,505
Have you seen Nick lately?

162
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,549
Nick?

163
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,344
Yeah, disappeared
after Sam passed away.

164
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,553
None of us have seen him.

165
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,722
Maybe he wanted some time alone.

166
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,391
Or maybe I drowned him,

167
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,727
right where Brother Sam's
ashes are floating.

168
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,650
Is it possible
that Brother Sam changed me?

169
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,905
I didn't kill Jonah
when I had the chance.

170
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,158
Did Sam somehow bring out
a little bit of light in me?

171
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,009
And did I pass that light on
to Travis as well?

172
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,553
Is that why he let Holly go?

173
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,849
You did the right thing.

174
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,229
I know who you are.
I remember your voice.

175
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,522
I'm not here to hurt you.

176
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,440
You were in my car.
You tried to kill me.

177
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,359
And I let you go.

178
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,945
Just like you let Holly Benson go.

179
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,279
I want to know why.

180
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,199
I didn't want to see her suffer.

181
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,618
You've seen people suffer before?

182
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,371
What you said to me

183
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,123
made me think.

184
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,582
Think what?

185
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,460
That I don't have to do what he says.

186
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,881
I told him I'm done.
I'm not working with him any more.

187
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,883
How did Gellar take it?

188
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,094
Not very well.

189
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,471
He's angry.

190
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,974
He won't leave me alone.

191
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,393
Why not just tell the police?

192
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,815
I helped him do horrible things.
They'd... They'd arrest me.

193
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,734
They'd...

194
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,777
I am a good person.

195
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,822
I thought we were doing
the right thing. I just...

196
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,495
I made a mistake
getting involved with all of this.

197
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,747
I can help you, Travis.

198
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,582
I can get him out of your life
for good.

199
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,625
The police will never know about you.

200
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,836
You just have to help me find him.

201
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,922
Just because I'm not working with him

202
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,008
does not mean
that I will work with you.

203
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,177
All you have to do
is tell me where he is.

204
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,012
I'll take care of the rest.

205
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,181
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

206
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,976
Do you have any idea
how dangerous he is?

207
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,312
He is crazy, I know that now.

208
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,272
He will finish his mission,

209
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,233
and he will kill anyone
who tries to stop him.

210
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,819
And then what?
Assuming the world doesn't end?

211
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,545
I don't want to talk
about this any more.

212
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,591
Both of you need
to just leave me alone.

213
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,346
Travis has a dark passenger
all his own,

214
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,557
but unlike mine,
his walks and talks and breathes

215
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,268
and goes by the name Professor Gellar.

216
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,145
And most significantly,

217
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,397
his dark passenger can be killed.

218
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,609
Later.

219
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,619
What have we got?

220
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,288
Call girl, of the high-end variety.

221
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,624
ID says Jessica Morris.

222
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,585
The lobby bar downstairs
is a known hangout for working girls.

223
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,922
Not that I would know that
for any reason.

224
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,924
Rings and a track mark
say it's heroin.

225
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,013
Maid must have wiped everything down
before she found her.

226
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,641
No prints anywhere,
except hers on the tub.

227
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,310
Looks like she OD'd,
then hit her head.

228
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,980
If the drugs didn't kill her,
the blow to her skull sure did.

229
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,568
Probably an accidental death,
but the ME'll tell us more.

230
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,862
What do you think?

231
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,114
Blood coming from her nose...

232
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,448
Consistent with an overdose.

233
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:31,578
Yeah, but look at the pattern,
sort of a zigzag.

234
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,413
It starts this way,

235
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,457
suggesting that
she fell in this position.

236
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,294
The blood dries,
and then it changes direction,

237
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:44,132
as though her head were turned
and then moved back,

238
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,051
suggesting the body was lifted
and then repositioned.

239
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,308
Heroin overdose
kills almost instantly.

240
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,476
Once her heart stopped beating,

241
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,395
there should have been
hardly any blood flow

242
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,105
from the head wound.

243
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,107
Unless...

244
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,985
Unless someone did
chest compressions post-mortem.

245
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,491
Broken rib.

246
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,659
Could have been the EMTs.

247
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,661
She was long gone
when the maid found her.

248
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,080
The EMTs didn't attempt CPR.

249
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,333
What do you think?

250
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,793
I think it happened
pretty much like Vince said.

251
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,840
She OD's, hits her head, she dies.

252
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:29,302
Someone comes in, sees her.

253
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,346
He flips her over,

254
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,765
causing more blood
to come out of her nose.

255
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,934
Tries CPR,

256
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,353
but he cracks her rib
cos he's panicked.

257
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,314
And he realises that
he's just causing more blood

258
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,650
to flow from the head wound,
so he stops.

259
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,194
Puts the body back where he found her,

260
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,112
then wipes everything clean.

261
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,199
Someone call the Captain over here?

262
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,201
No, why?

263
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,203
Because she's here.

264
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,668
- Captain.
- Where's Sergeant Batista?

265
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,169
Downstairs.

266
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,130
- What do we have here?
- Looks like an overdose.

267
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,508
OK, good.

268
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,386
Make sure to copy me
on the ME's report.

269
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,055
- I'm going downstairs.
- Yes, ma'am.

270
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,398
Hey, Dexter. You're back.

271
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,525
- Louis.
- Hey.

272
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,902
I heard what you did
at that crime scene.

273
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,405
You know, the body was moved
and then repositioned.

274
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,531
So cool.

275
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,324
You... You gotta show me
how you figure that stuff out.

276
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,868
Yeah, sure, we'll do that sometime,
but right now, I gotta...

277
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,332
OK, I'm going to make this quick.

278
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,418
The whole city is freaking out
over DDK.

279
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,586
We're getting over 100 calls a day.

280
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,255
People saying
that they've seen Gellar,

281
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,757
people asking if it's safe
to go out at night.

282
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,718
I need everyone's asses
on the fucking ball.

283
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,721
I'm going to keep rearranging
that sentence to make it hotter.

284
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,098
- Holly's experience with DDK...
- And that's still my sister.

285
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,184
...suggests that Gellar
is working with an accomplice.

286
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,269
Now, thanks to Louis,

287
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,188
we have a list
of male Tallahassee graduates

288
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:08,026
living in the Miami area
that have taken classes with him.

289
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,528
We have over 200 names to investigate,

290
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,905
so I'm going to take some myself.

291
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,115
Batista, Quinn, Mike,

292
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,867
you guys can divide up the rest.

293
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,286
And let's not let on that
we know Gellar has an accomplice.

294
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,788
This fucker thinks
we don't know who he is?

295
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,707
Let's keep it that way.

296
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,250
How do I get Travis to trust me

297
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,795
before the cops
get to his name on the list?

298
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,423
I'm sorry I wasn't
at the crime scene this morning.

299
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,966
It's fine. Mike was there.

300
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,635
I got a way to make it up to you.

301
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,304
There's a new place
opening on Washington.

302
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,222
Opening night's invitation only.

303
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,974
Guess who's got two of these?

304
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,144
I'll pass.
I've got Auri on Friday night.

305
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,646
- Auri always cancels on you.
- Take Masuka.

306
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,232
Your loss.

307
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,069
- Hey, sis.
- Hey.

308
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,278
What brings you here?

309
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:56,657
We were just
at Harrison's music class,

310
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,785
and he wanted to see his daddy.

311
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,453
Come on, admit it.

312
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,330
You wanted to say hi
to your big brother.

313
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,999
Hey, I got your text.

314
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,919
Yeah, we were just
in the neighbourhood.

315
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,504
Want to maybe go for a walk with us?

316
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,672
Yeah, sure.
Let me just tell Mr. Masuka.

317
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,007
OK.

318
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,803
You're still seeing that guy, huh?

319
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,098
- You don't like him?
- I don't really know him.

320
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,849
You know what?

321
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,643
- You should come to dinner with us.
- I don't know...

322
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,854
If you're going to judge him,

323
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,483
then maybe you should have some idea
who you're talking about first.

324
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,361
OK, sure. Why not?

325
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,696
- It'll be fun.
- Yeah.

326
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,535
Children trust
that when we put them to bed at night,

327
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,370
they'll live to see another day.

328
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,129
Adults are not always so fortunate.

329
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,800
Travis is my only way to Gellar.

330
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,718
I have to convince him to help me.

331
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,558
Maybe I need to learn
to speak his language.

332
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,911
Brother Sam did say
all the answers were in here.

333
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,375
I'm not sure he meant
the answers to my kind of questions.

334
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,997
What are you doing here? I told you...

335
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,874
I know,
you don't want to get involved.

336
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,668
I understand that,
but you are responsible

337
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,046
for hurting a lot of people, Travis.

338
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,133
I'm sure
you don't feel good about that.

339
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,806
You've wandered from God's path.

340
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,016
I was led astray.

341
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,857
I know, the blood.

342
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,734
Long story.

343
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,986
But what's more important
are the words underneath the blood.

344
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,241
It says here, "Anyone then
who knows the good he ought to do..."

345
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,409
"...and doesn't do, sins."

346
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:50,122
The sin of omission. James 4:17. So?

347
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,167
So it sounds to me
like you're in some trouble, Travis.

348
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,171
If you allow Professor Gellar
to continue doing what he's doing,

349
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,464
according to James here,

350
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,175
it's just as much of a sin
as doing the killings yourself.

351
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,510
I know.

352
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,680
I wish that I could take it all back.

353
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,642
But now I can't risk
antagonising him.

354
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,185
I can protect you.

355
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,604
It's not me that I'm worried about.
It's my sister.

356
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,648
Gellar's threatened her before,

357
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,192
and I can't let
anything happen to her.

358
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,863
Can I blame him?

359
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,700
As long as Gellar's out there,
she's still in danger.

360
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,703
- I can protect her.
- What if you can't?

361
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,547
OK.

362
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,968
I'll try to convince Lisa
to go to her friend's

363
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,346
up in Pensacola for the weekend.
Gellar won't leave Miami.

364
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,058
Let me get her safe,

365
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,728
and then I promise,

366
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,647
I'll do whatever you say.

367
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,702
Sam was right about this book.

368
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,665
Hi, can I help you?

369
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,043
I'm Lieutenant Debra Morgan,
Miami Metro Homicide.

370
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,253
I'm looking for Travis Marshall.

371
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,088
His building manager said
that they were forwarding

372
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,506
his mail here.

373
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,259
Travis is my brother,
but he's not here right now.

374
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,428
Can I...
Can I help you with something?

375
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,680
We're investigating
a college professor,

376
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,099
James Gellar,
in connection with three homicides.

377
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,602
The Doomsday Killer.

378
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,938
Oh, my God. Travis.
Has something happened?

379
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,608
No, we're just looking into
former associates of his.

380
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,193
And according to our records,

381
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,112
Travis took some classes with him
up in Tallahassee.

382
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,615
We just want to ask him
a few questions.

383
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,285
I... I doubt that Travis
would be able to help you much.

384
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,413
I don't think he stays in touch
with anyone from school.

385
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,207
He must have been pretty shaken up
when he found out

386
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,793
an old professor was a murder suspect.

387
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,796
I guess so.

388
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,547
He didn't mention it?

389
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,591
Well, Travis isn't really
the type to talk

390
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,885
about how he feels about things.

391
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,137
Not even to his sister.

392
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,263
So you aren't close?

393
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,310
Our parents died
when Travis was still a teenager,

394
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,521
so I pretty much raised him
the rest of the way, so...

395
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,565
Tragedy makes you tight, you know?

396
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,151
But, with Travis,
I think it also made him...

397
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,947
closed off, I guess you would call it.

398
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,908
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

399
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,787
So you haven't noticed
any unusual behaviour?

400
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,581
- Nothing out of the ordinary?
- No.

401
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,667
Same old Travis.

402
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,130
I actually have to get back to work.

403
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,132
OK, if you could just have him
give me a call

404
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,342
the next time you see him,
so we can check him off our list?

405
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,887
OK. I'm sorry I couldn't
have been more help.

406
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,973
No, thank you for your time.

407
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,045
Hey.

408
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,842
So, any luck finding DDK's accomplice?

409
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,096
No, not yet, but I crossed five names
off the list.

410
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,473
And I'm going to go back out there

411
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,141
as soon as I make
a couple of phone calls. Thank you.

412
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,685
Sounds like detective work,
Lieutenant.

413
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,188
Well, it's a team effort.

414
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,190
One of these names
is going to pan out.

415
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,400
Well, until it does,
I've got good news for you.

416
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,446
The ME report came back in
on Jessica Morris, the prostitute.

417
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,157
Cause of death was the overdose.

418
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,869
Why is that good news?

419
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,246
Because the case
can be closed as an accident,

420
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,624
which means you have
one less homicide to worry about.

421
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,586
Wait, why were you looking
at the ME's report on that?

422
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,590
Your plate is so full with DDK.

423
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,092
Came across my desk,
and I took a look at it.

424
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,806
- Team effort, right?
- Right.

425
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,143
OK, so...
you can close the case now.

426
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,104
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

427
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,995
- Hey.
- Hey, where are you?

428
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,914
I'm on my way back from lunch.

429
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,457
Look, will you do me a favour

430
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,627
and put a rush on
Jessica Morris' blood report?

431
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,505
- LaGuerta's acting weird.
- Weird how?

432
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,508
She's being helpful.
I just want to see what she's up to.

433
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,177
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

434
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,266
Lisa. Come on. Hurry up, Lisa.

435
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,652
Stop following me!

436
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,153
Sorry, Travis.

437
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,657
We don't have time for
your little journey to find yourself.

438
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,033
We have work to do.

439
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,296
You know, when Jamie told me
you got the Trans-Am, I was jealous.

440
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,048
That is one awesome car.

441
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,967
You drive a VW, right?

442
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,012
Yeah, it's a limited edition.
Actually, it's very rare.

443
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,681
I'm going to go to the restroom.

444
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:44,518
You guys keep talking
about car things.

445
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,198
She's amazing.

446
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:02,202
I can't believe that a girl like that
could be interested in a guy like me.

447
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,871
She's interested in a lot of people.

448
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,167
My sister's a really nice girl.

449
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,544
She has a hard time saying no.

450
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,421
So she dates a lot of guys?

451
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,714
She's young.

452
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,090
She's in school.

453
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:19,845
She's not in a place in her life
to be taking anybody too seriously.

454
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,556
OK.

455
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,224
I know you seem like a nice guy.

456
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,941
I just wouldn't want
to see you get hurt.

457
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,742
So when Jessica Morris OD'd,

458
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,244
there was definitely someone
in that hotel room with her.

459
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,746
No doubt.

460
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,874
Then why is LaGuerta on my ass
to close this thing?

461
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,252
Maybe she wants to
keep it low-profile?

462
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,713
So what am I supposed to do?

463
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:59,093
If I do my job and I investigate
a possible homicide, then...

464
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,721
I piss off Captain Close-it.

465
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,890
And if I close it, this guy walks.

466
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,434
Maybe you should talk to LaGuerta.

467
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,437
Yeah. Maybe I should.

468
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,940
Either way, I have to sign
this fucking blood report.

469
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,775
Do you have a pen?

470
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,323
Here.

471
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,165
Why do you have a pen
from the Shady Lane Motel

472
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,000
at Kearney, Nebraska?

473
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,795
Must have picked it up somewhere.

474
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,297
Yeah, at the Shady Lane Motel
in Kearney, Nebraska.

475
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,258
- I can explain.
- Kearney, Nebraska,

476
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,593
is where Trinity's family
was murdered.

477
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,805
Which you found out about
the day you took your little joyride.

478
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,683
So that is either
one motherfucker of a coincidence,

479
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,477
or you were "just driving"
to fucking Nebraska.

480
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,105
- OK, yes, I went to Nebraska.
- Why?

481
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,692
Guess I just felt drawn there.

482
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,986
Did you talk to Jonah?

483
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,655
Yes.

484
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,950
Why?

485
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,665
I don't know, Deb. We both lost
people we love to the same killer.

486
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,376
I just felt a connection with him,

487
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,336
and I needed someone to talk to.

488
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,214
And you couldn't talk to me?

489
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,550
I didn't want to burden you.

490
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,137
Burden me, my ass.

491
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,515
I burden you all the time.

492
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,895
It's not a burden for me
to be there for you.

493
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,813
It was a mistake.
I shouldn't have gone.

494
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,359
That's not the point.

495
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,363
The point is
that you lied to me about it.

496
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,741
The point is that
you thought you had to go

497
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,911
to buttfuck-ville
to talk to somebody about Trinity.

498
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,372
Dexter, don't you think I get it?

499
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,255
I lost Lundy because of Trinity, too.

500
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,387
Hey, guys,
looks like DDK struck again.

501
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,659
Janitor found this early this morning.

502
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,747
The whore of Babylon.

503
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,211
The next tableau.

504
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,556
Shit!

505
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,391
I interviewed her yesterday.

506
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,893
Her brother was a...
a student of Gellar's.

507
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,020
Travis. Travis Marshall.

508
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,981
Find Travis Marshall
right the fuck now,

509
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,483
and if you can't find him,
put a BOLO out on him.

510
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,235
I think he's Gellar's accomplice.

511
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,570
Travis just shot to the top

512
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,197
of Miami Metro Homicide's
most-wanted list.

513
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,700
Did Travis go back to Gellar,

514
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,786
or was this the price Travis paid
for defying him?

515
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,460
A ripped seam.

516
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,882
"F.N. Galway."

517
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,469
This used to be some kind of vestment.

518
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,638
A robe, maybe.

519
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,982
What do you think the letters
on her forehead mean?

520
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,068
We'll find out.

521
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,154
Hey, I got something.

522
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,621
It's your card.

523
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,582
What the fuck?

524
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,003
What the fuck do you think that means?

525
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,254
Maybe it doesn't mean anything.

526
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,964
These assholes are all about messages.

527
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,258
You think it's because
I talked to her?

528
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,928
- You think it's to keep her quiet?
- This isn't your fault, Deb.

529
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,099
But it could be mine.

530
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,045
Sorry for the chain.

531
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,548
I couldn't risk
you disappearing on me.

532
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,510
You know you're far too important.

533
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,890
What do you want?

534
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,229
Penance, to cleanse your soul.

535
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,900
It's not your fault, Travis.

536
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,987
The devil comes in many forms.

537
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,156
Sometimes he tempts you with an apple,

538
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,618
or fame, or riches,

539
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,539
or a mundane life with your family.

540
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,960
Do not talk about my sister.

541
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,380
Your sister whom you hold
in such high esteem

542
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,882
talked to the police.

543
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,927
She betrayed you.

544
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,514
Just like the whore of Babylon.

545
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,058
What did you do to my sister?

546
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,147
No.

547
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,069
No!

548
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,739
She's part of it now.

549
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,534
Don't you get it, Travis?

550
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,746
She was doomed to hell on Earth.

551
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,498
Tribulations.

552
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,293
But now her soul is pure.

553
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,254
She can go to God.

554
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,631
Just like you wanted.

555
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,469
And you can come back to our mission.

556
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,430
I didn't want this!

557
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,684
I understand. It'll take time.

558
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,688
Pray for your sister.
Do whatever it is you need to do.

559
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,066
And when I come back,

560
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,987
I sincerely hope you have
a change of heart.

561
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,995
I was just on my way up to see you.

562
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,914
I hear DDK has struck again.

563
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,083
We have a BOLO out on Travis Marshall.

564
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,460
Everyone in the city is going
to know what he looks like.

565
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,088
Meanwhile, you now have two suspects
and no arrests.

566
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,299
Yes, I know.

567
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,344
Actually, I was coming
to talk to you about Jessica Morris.

568
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,222
The dead prostitute.

569
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,350
Why hasn't that case been closed?

570
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,352
Because I saw Dexter's report.

571
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,686
Someone else was in the room.

572
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,605
The woman overdosed, Debra.

573
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,690
What does it matter
who else was in the room?

574
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,402
Because some dickhead
left a dead woman in a bathroom.

575
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,321
Aren't we talking
involuntary manslaughter,

576
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,074
not to mention solicitation,
obstruction?

577
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,826
- Hell, we could get murder two.
- Stop.

578
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,413
Debra.

579
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,335
I'm going to level with you.

580
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,546
That COMPSTAT hearing
did not go very well

581
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,713
for either one of us.

582
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,842
Another open case will put
our clearance rate at 19%.

583
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,011
- But if we let a guilty man...
- 19%, Debra!

584
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,805
Do you understand what's happening?

585
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,600
We have a city in an all-out panic.

586
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,561
Last night,
a woman tried to drive her car

587
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,772
into Biscayne Bay
with her infant son inside,

588
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,440
because she thinks
it's the end of the world

589
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,068
and she didn't want him
to go through the tribulations.

590
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,028
Now...

591
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:01,700
Don't take this the wrong way,
but being young and personable

592
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,911
and saying bad words on TV
just is not going to cut it right now.

593
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,163
Trust me.

594
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,456
Find the men
who killed four innocent people,

595
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:12,210
not some john who bailed
on a fucking junkie prostitute

596
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,837
who overdosed.

597
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,548
And that's an order, Lieutenant.

598
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,093
OK.

599
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,347
- Fine. I'll close it.
- Good.

600
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,610
Yeah, it's me. It's taken care of.

601
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,282
Yes, I'm sure you have
nothing more to worry about.

602
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,087
My search for F.N. Galway
has turned up nothing.

603
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,923
This is the last of them.

604
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,759
And there's not much I can do
with intern puppy dog

605
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,219
watching my every move.

606
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,846
You know, Google's kind of
five minutes ago, right?

607
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,557
Try Eliot.

608
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:14,314
Yeah, it uses a targeted algorithm
to aggregate content

609
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,816
without getting tripped up
by all that sneaky SEO bullshit.

610
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,319
Intern puppy dog has skills.

611
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,453
I'll let you do your thing.

612
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,707
Got the ME's report.

613
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,459
Looks like Lisa Marshall
was killed the same way

614
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,294
as our fruit vendor and our jogger.

615
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,421
But get this,
the ME didn't find any of

616
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,132
those paper 1,000-whatever-the-fuck
number things

617
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,300
anywhere on the body.

618
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,511
That's because it was Travis
who put the numbers there.

619
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,304
That means this kill was all Gellar.

620
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,681
Weird.

621
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,224
Any luck finding Travis Marshall?

622
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,393
Not yet.

623
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,770
But I found out
he works at the museum,

624
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,855
restoring old bibles.

625
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,024
I'll fuck Masuka
if this isn't our guy.

626
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,402
Sounds like you're getting close.

627
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,738
Too close. I'm going to have
to work fast if I want to save Travis.

628
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,991
Hey, listen.

629
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,326
You want to grab dinner
after work tonight?

630
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,371
You know, chat?

631
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,039
Talk?

632
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,625
Can we do another night?
I'm pretty tired,

633
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,879
and I just want to spend
some downtime at home with Harrison.

634
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,676
OK. Sure, another night.

635
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,303
Definitely.

636
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,021
I'm sorry I'm late.

637
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,897
I saw the news.

638
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,817
I wasn't sure you'd be able to
make our session anyway today.

639
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,110
Yeah, I almost cancelled.

640
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,070
But I don't know.

641
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,072
I could use the break.

642
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,908
That must have been
a difficult thing to see.

643
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,286
You could say that.

644
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,915
I mean, I show up, right, to...

645
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,169
question her about her brother and...

646
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,048
twenty-four hours later...

647
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,304
I can't help but feel responsible.

648
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:12,891
You know, I knew that there was
something that she wasn't telling me.

649
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,145
Do you think she knew
that her brother was involved?

650
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,481
I think she knew
something was up with him.

651
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,276
And I think she was trying to
protect him,

652
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,945
which is what a good sister does.

653
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,615
And then he ends up killing her.

654
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,243
Oh, Jesus.

655
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,538
Are all brothers assholes?

656
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,582
Who are we talking about now?

657
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,376
Who else? Dexter.

658
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,963
So you think he might kill you?

659
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,927
No, I don't think
he's going to kill me, I just...

660
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,432
I think he treats me like shit.

661
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,400
He shuts me out.

662
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,151
He won't tell me things,

663
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,863
like really important things.

664
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,494
Sounds like you two are having
a little trouble communicating lately.

665
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,872
We aren't having
trouble communicating.

666
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,583
He's the one
that's keeping all the secrets.

667
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,711
But normally,
you're pretty open with each other.

668
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,921
Yes.

669
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:29,509
I tell him everything.
I tell him about boyfriends, work.

670
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,762
I tell him about everything.

671
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,723
Sounds like
a lot of talking about yourself.

672
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,394
Aren't you supposed to be on my side?

673
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,604
I'm just telling you what I'm hearing.

674
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,690
OK, yeah. We talk about me.

675
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,859
A lot.

676
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,278
But that's what I'm saying.

677
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,030
I can't get him
to tell me shit-all about jackshit.

678
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:55,201
Or maybe he doesn't think
there's any room

679
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,037
in the relationship for his needs.

680
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:05,044
Maybe next time you get together
you could just make some effort

681
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,881
to focus on him and his issues.

682
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,325
Need another round? Next one's on me.

683
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,076
I'm pacing myself.

684
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,828
I need to retain my ability...

685
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,246
Oh, yeah!

686
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,624
...to...

687
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,958
focus.

688
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,711
Sure, I get that.

689
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,631
- All right.
- Thanks, cutie.

690
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,758
Hey, be honest with me.

691
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,968
I wasn't your first choice
to bring here tonight, was I?

692
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,304
Not really, but does it matter?

693
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,515
Not really.

694
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,477
Hey, excuse me.
Can I get a refill, please?

695
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,103
Wait, no, no, no. Don't go anywhere.

696
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,233
If I said you had a beautiful body,
would you hold it against me?

697
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,235
- Please.
- Come on, it's a song.

698
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,736
I can sing it to you.

699
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,279
Yo, man. Come on, relax.

700
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,324
Look, just look around,
enjoy the scenery.

701
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,243
Look at that right there.

702
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,332
In the green thong.

703
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,879
That's a thing of beauty.

704
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,384
I'm going to marry her.
I'm going to marry Green Thong.

705
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,428
Come on, Quinn. Sit down.

706
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,598
Will you marry me?

707
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,433
No, I mean, of course
no one wants to marry me,

708
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,893
but can I at least
get a kiss from you?

709
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,979
Hey, back off, buddy. All right?

710
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,898
We got to cut you off, man, OK?

711
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,442
But wait, she's not
finished breaking my heart yet.

712
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,278
If you don't take him outta here,
I gotta take him out.

713
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:56,239
OK, no, no, no. We don't need that.
No problem, we out. We out, let's go.

714
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,408
Green Thong! I love you, Green Thong.

715
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,993
All right.
Let's get you home, come on.

716
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,995
Nah, man. I ain't going anywhere.

717
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,163
I'm just getting started.

718
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,088
Louis' search engine
turned out to be useful.

719
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,508
Father Nicholas Galway,
retired Catholic priest.

720
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,219
You understand that
Father Galway's dementia

721
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,221
has progressed extensively?

722
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,265
It isn't likely he'll remember you.

723
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,392
I'm not sure if that's good or bad.

724
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,566
- Father?
- Yes?

725
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,028
You have a visitor.

726
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,281
Thank you.

727
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,286
Father Galway?

728
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,955
Yes, that... That's me.

729
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,791
I'm... I'm having trouble
remembering your name.

730
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,835
Actually, we've never met.

731
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,754
- My name is...
- Francis Connolly!

732
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,715
You've come to apologise
for breaking the window

733
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,925
in the narthex, I take it.

734
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,930
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm in the wrong place.

735
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,433
You're not going anywhere, young man.

736
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,061
You must confess your sins.

737
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,313
Actually, I'm OK. If I could just...

738
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,231
"Bless me, Father,

739
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,609
"for I have sinned."

740
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,987
My sins? OK.

741
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:25,036
I've exceeded the speed limit
a few times.

742
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,622
Who hasn't done that?

743
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,291
What other sins must you confess?

744
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,963
I lied to my sister.

745
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,133
The freckle-faced one,
Mary Grace, isn't that it?

746
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,303
She always had a cookie in her hand,
that one.

747
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,638
What else?

748
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,515
He's too far gone.

749
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,392
- I really should get going, Father.
- Son!

750
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,436
How do you expect to get into heaven,

751
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,231
unless you let me
absolve you of your sins?

752
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,943
- You can do that?
- Anything you confess,

753
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,569
God will forgive.

754
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,415
I'm waiting, Francis.

755
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,793
I've killed people.

756
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,799
Continue.

757
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,969
A lot of people.

758
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,057
Murder is a mortal sin.

759
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,646
You must...

760
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,818
Where were we?

761
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,864
Confession.

762
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,241
Oh, yes. Of course.

763
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,456
I absolve you of all of your sins.

764
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,752
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

765
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,712
Amen.

766
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,262
Thank you.

767
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,571
It's sad, isn't it?

768
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,492
He was a wonderful priest
back in the day.

769
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,577
Yes, he was.

770
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,747
Now half the time,
he doesn't know where he is.

771
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,875
Some Sunday mornings
he asks to be driven

772
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,212
to his church because he thinks
he's supposed to lead Mass.

773
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,297
His church?

774
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,092
- Santa Maria De Loreto.
- Right.

775
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:49,222
- And that's in...
- It's out in Davie.

776
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,474
But... But don't waste your time.

777
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,726
It's been abandoned
for over 20 years now.

778
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,977
Not much left of it.

779
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,396
An abandoned church.

780
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,357
Very sad, huh?

781
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,025
If Gellar's at that church,

782
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,736
his hideout
will make an even better kill room.

783
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,906
I'll say good night to Harrison,
and then I'll be on my way.

784
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,494
Hey, Dex. Deb said I could take off
since she's here.

785
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,164
- I told you tonight wasn't good.
- I know.

786
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,708
But you got to eat, right?

787
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,877
So you can just relax and kick back.

788
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,045
I'm making steaks.

789
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,672
Which is a big deal,
because I can't remember

790
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:23,840
the last time I cooked something

791
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,676
that didn't involve
pierce film with fork.

792
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,553
Something came up. I have to go out.

793
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,972
I just came
to say good night to Harrison.

794
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,598
I'm sorry for the mix-up, Jamie.

795
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,433
Oh, that's OK. I can stay.

796
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,813
- Daddy.
- Something came up?

797
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,773
What the fuck do you mean,
something came up?

798
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,733
Would you please watch
your language in front of him?

799
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,944
I'll go give him his bath.

800
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,280
- Night, buddy.
- Night-night.

801
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,618
So when you said you wanted
a quiet night at home,

802
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,870
you were just blowing me off.

803
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,204
I told you, something came up.

804
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,789
You're not going
to tell me what it is?

805
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,625
I can't talk about it right now.

806
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:03,629
You can't talk about it,
or you can't talk about it with me?

807
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,258
Deb, this isn't the time.

808
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,260
I gotta go.

809
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,473
Do you know why
I came over here tonight?

810
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,642
It was for you, asshole.

811
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,812
- So you could talk to me.
- Talk about what?

812
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,774
About whatever stuff you drove
to Nebraska to talk about.

813
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,984
Deb, please just let this go.

814
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,487
I am just trying
to have a conversation with you.

815
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,948
Is that so fucking hard?

816
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,619
Deb...

817
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,498
Fine.

818
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,676
I don't want to hurt you, Travis.

819
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,597
I think you do.

820
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,184
I think you like
watching people suffer.

821
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,438
There's only one way to get
the demons out of your head.

822
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,796
Who's out there?

823
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,966
Don't you say a word.

824
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,092
Did Gellar do this to you?

825
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,888
He killed my sister.

826
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:19,765
Where is he?

827
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,352
Travis, is he here?

828
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,050
Damn it.

829
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,979
Gellar has seen me now.

830
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,148
This just got much harder.

831
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,157
I'll help you.

832
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,202
I'll help you kill him.

833
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,496
I've gotten Travis to trust me.

834
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,249
In my own way, I'm going to eliminate
a small bit of darkness

835
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,293
and let some light in.
