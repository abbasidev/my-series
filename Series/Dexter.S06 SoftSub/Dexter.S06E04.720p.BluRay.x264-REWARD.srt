1
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,801
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,928
That takes us to the snakes killing.

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,972
Maybe Brother Sam
was right about our victim.

4
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,432
Is this what I think it is?

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,059
Evidence from
the Ice Truck Killer investigation.

6
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,859
You think that my becoming Lieutenant

7
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,861
had anything to do
with what happened between us?

8
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,572
No, I'm sure it was just
a big fucking coincidence.

9
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,198
I don't know how to act.

10
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,034
I don't know what to do.
I don't know who to hire.

11
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,369
Deb, you're too smart to think
that this was gonna be easy.

12
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,414
I put my ass on the line
even considering you,

13
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,374
so stow the attitude.

14
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,462
Are you going to be saved?

15
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,505
- It's up to you.
- Yes, please!

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,801
Dear God, cleanse me of all my sins.

17
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,262
He's ready.

18
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,175
Do you undertake
to keep God's commandments

19
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,302
and the faith of his son, our Lord?

20
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,469
I do.

21
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,681
Some people think that religion
began as a way for primitive cultures

22
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,100
to explain natural phenomenon,

23
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,686
the fire, the wind, the rain.

24
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,189
They created a God for each one.

25
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,150
I baptise you, my brother, in Christ.

26
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,110
You are baptised with Christ in death.

27
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,197
You'd think science
would have made religion obsolete.

28
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,657
But it hasn't.

29
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,457
Go for a swim,

30
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,792
come out a new man.

31
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,171
If only I believed
it were that simple.

32
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:40,469
But Brother Sam believes,
and because of that, he's fulfilled.

33
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,932
It's written all over his face.

34
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,698
That's my son, Harrison.

35
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,951
Can you say hi?

36
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,663
Guess not.

37
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,456
It's all right.

38
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,126
Did you see Nick?
He wanted to thank you for coming by.

39
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,506
Yeah, he can thank me tomorrow
at the shop when I bring my car in.

40
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,341
What? You had another accident?

41
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,926
Bad driving karma.

42
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,096
Man, somebody trying to tell you
to slow down, brother.

43
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,723
So what'd you think?

44
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,769
It was interesting.

45
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,480
Don't get me wrong.
The spiritual stuff,

46
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,857
the second chances,
I think it's great.

47
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,317
For Nick.

48
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,111
But not for you, huh?

49
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,657
I get it.

50
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,660
You take a dunk in the bay,
you fix all your problems.

51
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,370
It probably sounds
like bullshit to you.

52
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,414
That's one word for it.

53
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,165
But, you know,
it's not about the dunk.

54
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,962
It's about, surrender to something
greater than yourself.

55
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,007
- I don't get it.
- Man, just look around.

56
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,760
You think you make the sun
come up in the morning?

57
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,554
You think you can make
the tide come in?

58
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,473
No, but that's the Earth rotating
on its axis, the pull of the moon.

59
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,268
So you do believe
in something greater than yourself.

60
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,362
- Got to go. Work.
- OK.

61
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,406
Harrison, get the car.

62
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,075
Yeah, somebody
got to do the driving with him.

63
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,956
Go ahead.

64
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,009
Jesus Christ!

65
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,362
What's with the wicked rodeo?

66
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,697
Your guess is as good as mine.

67
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,658
Some sick fuck sewed
body parts to mannequins

68
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,619
and then strapped them to horses.

69
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,245
I mean, what the fuck?

70
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,540
Body parts?
This spectacle makes me think of...

71
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,125
Brian, my brother.

72
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,293
Your brother?

73
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,587
- Rudy, the Ice Truck Killer?
- Sorry.

74
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,173
No, it's OK. I was thinking it, too.

75
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,966
Just the idea that someone
would put this much...

76
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,761
- Imagination.
...brutality into killing.

77
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,137
Come here.
I want to show you something.

78
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,056
- Lieutenant.
- Hold on a sec.

79
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,101
Check it out.

80
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,603
- Lieutenant.
- I'm in the middle of something.

81
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,729
Remember this?

82
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:46,196
It's the same insignia that was carved
into the stomach of the snakes victim.

83
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,406
Looks like a signature.

84
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,743
Same sick fuck.
Two different killings.

85
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,203
Hey, Lieutenant?

86
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,080
For the love of God, what?

87
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,252
Right.

88
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,295
One at a time. Go.

89
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,047
Been calling around the local stables.

90
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,091
There's one about a mile
north from here,

91
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,051
reported four horses missing
two days ago.

92
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,178
- Quinn?
- Mounted patrol's on the way.

93
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,430
They'll be here within the hour.

94
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,849
I've been counting the body parts
and typing the blood,

95
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,975
and it's all B-positive.

96
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,060
So I think we're looking
at one victim here.

97
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,479
Jesus. Somebody
went to a lot of trouble.

98
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,565
He's trying to tell us something.

99
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,942
Yeah. "I'm a crazy piece of shit."

100
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,862
He's saying,
"It's the end of the world."

101
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,405
Something like that.

102
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,701
Four horsemen of the Apocalypse,
white, red, pale, and black.

103
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,327
Doesn't take a genius
to figure it out.

104
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,662
And who are you?

105
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,123
I'm sorry.
This is Mike Anderson from Chicago.

106
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,460
He's my replacement.
Mike, this is everyone.

107
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,586
You were saying?

108
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,672
The killer's showing us a scene
from the Book of Revelation.

109
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,174
A killer with faith?

110
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,677
- Damn, it's hot out here.
- Yeah.

111
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,220
It's Miami, genius.

112
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,307
- What about snakes?
- What about them?

113
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,059
Seven snakes. Any mention of them
in the Book of Revelation?

114
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,395
- Don't know. I'll look into it.
- Do that.

115
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,856
In the meantime, you two,
go to the stable.

116
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,150
See if a surveillance tape
will give us a suspect.

117
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,110
Dexter, Masuka,
take shots of the horses

118
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,737
so we can start
taking this shit apart.

119
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,408
Whoever did this
seems to be a member of my tribe.

120
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,787
But this is a horse
of a different colour.

121
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,666
What is this?

122
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,094
Masuka confirmed that the body parts
all belong to the same victim.

123
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,764
We got an ID off the fingerprints,
Nathan Roberts.

124
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,392
Went for a jog a couple of days ago,
never came back.

125
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,561
Did you compare the kill wound
against the snakes victim?

126
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,313
- I did.
- And?

127
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,398
It's a perfect match.

128
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,401
Same signature, same kill wound.

129
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,611
Same killer.

130
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,032
The ME's report
said there was residue in the wound.

131
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,993
It's being processed. We should
have it back at the lab later today.

132
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,828
Any ideas for a murder weapon?

133
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,164
Some kind of stabbing implement.

134
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,292
Won't know for sure until we get
the ME's measurements of the wound.

135
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,002
What about the cuts on the body?

136
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,006
I'm guessing a bone saw.

137
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,849
What do we have here?

138
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,742
1242.

139
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,452
- What is it?
- I don't know.

140
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,830
- Some kind of message.
- Another one?

141
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,749
Jesus! How much
does this fucker have to say?

142
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,086
A lot, apparently.

143
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,341
Want to bet he left one
on the snakes victim, too?

144
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,262
Nothing behind his eyes.

145
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,139
What about the mouth or the ears?

146
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,599
Already checked.

147
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,642
What are we missing?

148
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,813
We're not. It's what he's missing.

149
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,025
His intestines.

150
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,118
Kind of reminds me of
looking for the prize in a cereal box.

151
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,995
You were always good at that, too.

152
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,456
Jackpot!

153
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,169
1237, 1242.
What do you think it means?

154
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,547
That I've been lieutenant
for less than a week

155
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,258
and there's already some game-playing,

156
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,469
sick-as-fuck serial killer
for me to catch?

157
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,887
Technically, he's not a serial killer.

158
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,806
Yet.

159
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,018
Serial killing involves
the murder of several people

160
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,604
in three or more separate events.

161
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,980
So far our guy's only done two.

162
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,107
Are you trying to make me
feel better or worse?

163
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,443
Sorry.

164
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,657
It's Jamie.

165
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,033
Hey, everything OK?

166
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,243
Harrison isn't feeling so great.

167
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,704
- What happened?
- I don't know.

168
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,082
He didn't... He didn't eat breakfast.

169
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,001
But, I mean, he seems OK otherwise.

170
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:14,089
Just a little tired. I don't know.
Maybe it's a tummy ache, or...

171
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,715
Should I cancel his play-date?

172
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,343
Yeah, absolutely.
It's better to be safe than sorry.

173
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,719
- OK.
- If he gets any worse...

174
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,805
I'll call you. I promise.

175
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,602
You wanted to see me?

176
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,313
Yeah, this four horsemen case,
it's all over the news.

177
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,439
We need to address the press.

178
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,274
Already two steps ahead of you.

179
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,235
I called a conference
for this afternoon,

180
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,696
- and I'm working on a statement.
- Morgan's gonna make the statement.

181
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,323
But she doesn't have any experience.

182
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,201
I've led hundreds
of press conferences,

183
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,786
and, really,
under the circumstances...

184
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,122
Morgan is the new face
of this department, Maria.

185
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,748
- I'm still...
- The old face.

186
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,918
Now, set it up for tomorrow afternoon.

187
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,004
Fine.

188
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,302
Why the fuck
would I lead a press conference?

189
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,305
- Isn't that your thing?
- Usually, yes.

190
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,851
But I made a strategic decision
to put you in the spotlight.

191
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,645
You'll give the public the impression
that the situation's less critical.

192
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,692
Besides, dealing with the press
is your responsibility as lieutenant.

193
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,818
I thought my responsibility

194
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,862
was catching the horse fucker
that's killing people.

195
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,990
You'll have to learn to multitask.
And while you're at it,

196
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,325
you still haven't finished
your fit-for-duty therapy.

197
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,786
The shooting was over two weeks ago.

198
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,288
How am I supposed to find time
to go to a therapist?

199
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,248
Figure it out.

200
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,042
You're a liability
until you get cleared.

201
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,631
Fucking nightmare.

202
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,970
You OK?

203
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,848
Obviously.

204
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,144
You'll be fine. Just...

205
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,022
Never mind. Not my place.

206
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,066
What? Tell me.

207
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,195
You just might want to

208
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,992
dress a little more professional.
Like a lieutenant.

209
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,829
I mean, you know, skirt suit, heels.

210
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,915
What's wrong with the way I dress?

211
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,958
I mean,
you kind of look like you're...

212
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,502
What?

213
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,669
A detective?

214
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,088
No, like you're going to a hoedown.

215
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,303
Where should I put
the medical examiner's report

216
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,639
- for the four horsemen's case?
- Wherever.

217
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,224
You busy later?

218
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,643
Thought we could have our second date.

219
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,020
Sure, I have roller derby practise
until 9:00,

220
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,396
but we can totally hang after.

221
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,816
Wait, wait, wait.
You're a... You're a derby girl?

222
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,484
Got the bruises to prove it.

223
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,194
I think my head just exploded.

224
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,863
I have an idea.

225
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,408
Why don't we have
our second date right now?

226
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,910
What are you thinking?

227
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,954
Little make-out session
in the women's bathroom?

228
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,833
I was thinking some show-and-tell
in the evidence room?

229
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,084
Even better.

230
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,253
Not the dirty kind.

231
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,258
You know, showing me the
Ice Truck Killer stuff was so cool.

232
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,802
I was just thinking maybe
you could show me the Trinity stuff

233
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,221
- or the Bay Harbour Butcher evidence.
- I can't.

234
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,056
FBI has all those files...

235
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,642
But I promise
to make it up to you later.

236
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,936
You better.

237
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,690
Now open the ME's report.
I'm dying to know what it says.

238
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,657
When Brian sent messages,
they were tailor-made for me.

239
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,702
But I should still be able
to crack this guy's code.

240
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,913
- All right.
- Ready?

241
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,164
Let's do this.

242
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,709
Most of you have already
met Detective Mike Anderson.

243
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,335
He's working on a theory
that our killer

244
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,671
is re-enacting scenes
from the Book of Revelation.

245
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,173
There's a lot of brutal imagery here,

246
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,633
and our killer had
a lot to choose from.

247
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,136
I just got the ME report
from the four horsemen vic.

248
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,679
- Guess what it says.
- Must be pretty important

249
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,972
for you to bust in here like this.

250
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,557
He's a little bit of a drama queen.

251
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,351
There were traces of oxidised iron
in the kill wound.

252
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,897
Rust. I mean, nobody's used iron
to make weapons since the Middle Ages.

253
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,275
Which means our killer
could have used an ancient artefact.

254
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,612
- What kind of artefact?
- I'm not sure yet.

255
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,031
But the dimensions of the wound
suggest a sword.

256
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,325
But there are hundreds
of varieties of swords.

257
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,243
Great. Stay on that.
Mike, you were saying?

258
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,079
So far, our killer
has given us three tableaus.

259
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,623
The intestines on the scale,

260
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,750
the snakes victim,
and the four horsemen.

261
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,336
I'm sorry. "Tableaus"?

262
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,587
It's a theatrical term

263
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,797
referring to a picturesque grouping
of people or objects.

264
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,216
All this time, I just thought
they were called crime scenes.

265
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,093
No, it's more than just a crime scene.

266
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,012
Everything he's showing us
has meaning,

267
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:35,224
from the positioning of the bodies
to the clothes he puts on his victims.

268
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,809
- Nothing's by accident.
- Exactly.

269
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,977
He's communicating with us.

270
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,938
Mike's just helping
with the translation.

271
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,984
The four horsemen of the Apocalypse
are described in Revelation 6,

272
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,277
verses one through eight.

273
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,489
As for the seven snakes murder,
Revelation 13.

274
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,036
"And I stood upon the sand of the sea
and saw a serpent rise out of the sea,

275
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,996
"having seven heads."

276
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,623
And what about the intestines?

277
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,126
There's no passage on intestines,

278
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,878
but the scales of justice
are all over the Bible.

279
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,214
I figure he's referencing
God's judgement of mankind.

280
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,882
What about the numbers
we found on the body?

281
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,509
1237 and 1242.

282
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,052
Don't know.

283
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,470
But I can get in touch
with a Revelation expert

284
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,596
who might be able to tell us more.

285
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,018
They happened five days apart.

286
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,437
The two murders,
they happened five days apart.

287
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,357
The difference between
1237 and 1242 is five.

288
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,858
I don't know
why I didn't see it before.

289
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,652
So the numbers are days.

290
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,945
He's counting up to something.

291
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,488
- To what?
- Don't know.

292
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:35,326
But if all this Revelation stuff
has to do with doomsday,

293
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,078
maybe it's to the end of the world.

294
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,040
OK, so we're looking
for a religious nut-bag.

295
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,209
Quinn, Batista,
round up any end-times fanatics

296
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,335
that might have criminal records.

297
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,839
Let's find this Doomsday Killer.

298
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,395
It's happening, Travis.

299
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,898
Look around us. People are afraid.

300
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,361
Soon, you'll start to understand
what we're...

301
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,619
Travis, are you listening to me?

302
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,080
Yes. They're afraid.

303
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,459
OK, I got it. She's pretty.

304
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,335
- Who?
- The waitress.

305
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,546
You've been staring at her.

306
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,923
But we really have to stay focused.

307
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,596
So you don't think
I should ask her out?

308
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,891
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know. Maybe.

309
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,144
- I think she likes me.
- Hey, Trav.

310
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,729
Can I get you anything else?

311
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,980
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

312
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,401
Thank you.

313
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,200
I thought religion
was supposed to be comforting.

314
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,744
But swarms of locusts, bowls of wrath?

315
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,246
Why would anybody
want to believe this stuff?

316
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,376
Be honest.

317
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,504
Professional or stupid?

318
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,214
Professional.

319
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,592
But you don't look much like you.

320
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,222
You want to tell me
how I'm supposed to catch Doomsday

321
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,517
if I'm spending all my time
writing press statements,

322
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,312
going to court-ordered therapy
and shopping for ugly-ass clothes?

323
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,022
You'll figure it out. You always do.

324
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,441
Quinn used to say that
when I was in meltdown mode.

325
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,610
He saw you in meltdown mode
and he still wanted to marry you?

326
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,571
- Poop explosion.
- Harrison?

327
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,532
If it's Jamie,
you've got bigger problems.

328
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,034
Keep an eye on him
while I'm down in the laundry room?

329
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,619
- His tummy still upset?
- Yeah.

330
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,288
It's probably just a bug, but I can
take him to the doctor tomorrow.

331
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,920
Hey, what's the matter, little man?
You don't feel so good?

332
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,592
Wish I could make it all better.

333
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,641
I guess there are some things
even daddies can't fix.

334
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,408
So I gave you
the friends and family rate.

335
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,994
And I can have that to you ASAP.

336
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,037
Thanks. The sooner the better.

337
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,790
I just want to let you know
I'm taking off, all right?

338
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,250
All right.

339
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,128
- Dex, what's up?
- What's up!

340
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,462
So you headed off to class?

341
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,464
Hey, Sam's sending me
to computer class.

342
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,259
- Gonna build him a bomb website, yo.
- Yeah, you better.

343
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,011
- All right. Laters.
- Be safe.

344
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,137
See you, Nick.

345
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,806
You really take care of these guys.

346
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,517
Yeah, well, you know,
God's taking care of all of us.

347
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,605
Here go your estimate. Again.

348
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,905
- Are these your notes?
- Yeah.

349
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,034
Every time I read it,
I'm finding something new.

350
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,953
- You ever read it?
- Yeah, I just started, for work.

351
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,415
We're tracking this killer.

352
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,376
We think he's re-enacting scenes
from the Book of Revelation.

353
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,131
That four horsemen case
from the news, yeah?

354
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,677
Lord have mercy.

355
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,514
Saying it's in the name of God,
the devil is busy.

356
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,393
You think he's using God
as an excuse to kill?

357
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,896
People use God
as an excuse for a lot of things.

358
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:36,108
Just because
he believes in some crazy bullshit,

359
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,361
that don't mean
his faith is any less real.

360
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,365
But if faith makes people
do such crazy bullshit,

361
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,491
what's the point of having it?

362
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,496
It's human nature.
Gotta believe in something.

363
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,998
Right?

364
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,585
I mean, haven't you ever
had a problem so big

365
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,671
that you just couldn't
handle it on your own?

366
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,839
- Yeah.
- Well, who helped you?

367
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,344
My dad.

368
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,477
Well, you're lucky, you're blessed.

369
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,104
That's a blessing.

370
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,067
Faith, man,
you put it in the wrong things...

371
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,072
it'll fuck you up.

372
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,040
Goddamn pantyhose.

373
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,212
Has anyone ever died
from crotch asphyxiation?

374
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,548
You have now crossed the line

375
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,092
into inappropriate
brother-sister exchanges.

376
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,389
Is that Lieutenant Morgan in a skirt?

377
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,267
I don't know. I don't recognise her
without the man boots.

378
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,020
You'll recognise my foot
when it's kicking you in the face.

379
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,982
- But the Mayan calendar says...
- The Mayans weren't Christians.

380
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,319
Look, God told Noah that the
great flood would be in seven days.

381
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,030
Batista and Quinn's
people of interest.

382
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,492
Even if none of them is Doomsday,
they're all totally insane.

383
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,498
At 9:45 yesterday morning, four horses
were released at the intersection.

384
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,170
Lieutenant, you ready
for the press conference?

385
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,339
Yeah. I'm just...

386
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,632
practising my statement.

387
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,052
You want some honest advice?

388
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,179
I guess.

389
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,140
Lose the speech. Just relax.

390
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,976
Have a conversation.
You're not a formal person,

391
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,896
so a formal statement
could come off as insincere.

392
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,109
So you're saying
I should just be myself?

393
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,652
Exactly.

394
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,906
Nice shoes, by the way.

395
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,242
- They look better on.
- Yeah, well, they hurt my feet.

396
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,536
You know what else you could use?

397
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,755
Nice.

398
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,050
See you later.

399
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,845
Brother Sam reads his Bible
like I read blood,

400
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,223
and every time he comes away
with something new.

401
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,016
Maybe if I want answers
about this killer,

402
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,268
his work deserves a second look.

403
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,980
Such aggressive, brutal cuts.
He butchered this body.

404
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,108
But that doesn't make any sense.

405
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,779
Not when he was so meticulous
about composing his crime scenes.

406
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,242
The complexity of the stitching
in the belly of that fruit vendor.

407
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:35,204
The attention to detail,
attaching plastic to flesh.

408
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,332
So why would
this same fastidious craftsman

409
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,835
so carelessly hack and slash?

410
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,670
Unless it's not the same killer.

411
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:47,216
You think one person cut up the body
and another composed the crime scene?

412
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,971
Maybe we're not looking
for one Doomsday Killer.

413
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,057
Maybe we're looking for two.

414
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,360
This is Vince Masuka.

415
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,737
Hey, I've been bounced around
to, like, five people,

416
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,197
so I'm hoping you can help me.

417
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,532
I can try. What you need?

418
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,742
I'm a collector,
and there's a prosthetic hand

419
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,744
for auction on buythistreasure. Com.

420
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,873
Says it's from
the Ice Truck Killer investigation.

421
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,541
- Is that real?
- What?

422
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,751
No. Hang on a sec.

423
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,387
No, that's... It's gotta be fake.

424
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,890
The only people
with access to our evidence room

425
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,435
are police employees and interns.

426
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,730
Fuck me.

427
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,399
So I shouldn't bid on it, or...

428
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,276
No, definitely not.

429
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,571
Ryan.

430
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Shit.

431
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,665
No, no, no.

432
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,629
What's wrong?

433
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,966
You stole the hand
from the Ice Truck Killer evidence

434
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,259
and sold it online?

435
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,429
You said
it was just going to sit there.

436
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,598
The chain of custody is sacred.

437
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,434
I mean, did you ever stop to think
what would happen

438
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,269
- if we ever needed to go back?
- I'm sorry.

439
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,273
I was short on rent,
and I needed the money, so I...

440
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,777
Are you crazy?
I mean, I could lose my job over this.

441
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,153
No one has to know.

442
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,863
Just...

443
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,451
- Let me make it up to you.
- I'm such an idiot.

444
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,203
For thinking
you were actually into me.

445
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,663
I was.

446
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,542
I am.

447
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,212
Get out. We're done.

448
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,228
And we're live in three,

449
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,564
two, one.

450
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,775
My detectives are interviewing
several suspects,

451
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,320
but we won't release a name
until a suspect is officially charged.

452
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,989
Is it true the four horsemen case

453
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,575
is connected to the murder
of the fruit vendor, Omar Rivera?

454
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,203
We're not here
to discuss the Rivera case.

455
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,998
But the same alpha and omega signature
was found at both crime scenes.

456
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,332
Isn't that right?

457
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,168
Come on, Deb.
Don't go into meltdown mode now.

458
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,927
Actually, yes, we believe
that's our killer's signature.

459
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,764
So if you see something,
say something.

460
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,683
Call the department
with any information

461
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,351
that might help us catch this killer.

462
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,520
We're all in this together.

463
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,109
I'm not gonna lie to you
about this investigation,

464
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,695
because I don't really see the point.

465
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,863
I'm not into politics,

466
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,574
and I don't care
about press conferences or...

467
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,036
Or public opinion. All I care about
is catching the fucker that did this.

468
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,623
Shit.

469
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,710
That'll be all.

470
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,878
Lieutenant Morgan, another question.

471
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,047
Is it me,
or does our captain look happy

472
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,715
our lieutenant just shit the bed?

473
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,216
It's not you.

474
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,218
Trust me. I used to be married to her.

475
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,723
Hey, we got
one more nut-job to interview.

476
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,143
This preacher, Jeremiah Allen.
So we got to make a house call.

477
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,978
All right. Let's go.

478
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,815
Please tell me it wasn't that bad.

479
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,150
It was pretty bad.

480
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,113
Is that LaGuerta's necklace?

481
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,116
I seriously hate you right now.

482
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,244
Deb, hold on a sec.

483
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,788
Hello?

484
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,083
I'll be right there.

485
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,336
Your son's temperature's 104.
We need to get him into surgery ASAP.

486
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,089
- His appendix is ruptured.
- What happens now?

487
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,091
We'll do our best
to make sure he's OK.

488
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,513
Need you to sign
that parental consent.

489
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,764
He's gonna be OK, right?

490
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,973
We'll do everything we can.

491
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,186
Hey, buddy,
Daddy's gonna wait right here

492
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,355
so the doctors
take good care of you, OK?

493
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,324
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Sam from Good Shepherd.

494
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,492
Your car's ready.

495
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,536
You said you needed it ASAP,
so it's here.

496
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,497
Yeah, can I pick it up tomorrow?
I'm at Saint Peter's with my son.

497
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,333
- Is everything OK?
- He just went into surgery.

498
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,210
- Do you need me to...
- I got to go.

499
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,843
You gave us the wrong address.

500
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,846
It was a sandwich shop.

501
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,515
The preacher, Jeremiah Allen.

502
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,435
He's unlisted. Fine! Call me back.

503
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,020
Should have taken my car. Got the GPS.

504
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,023
Just finish up your frita
so we can head back to the station.

505
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,025
We'd already be on the way
if you let me eat in the car.

506
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,528
No way.
You're not getting grease on Norma.

507
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,531
What? It was my mother's name.

508
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,241
Now I think I know
why you're divorced.

509
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,832
Fucking waste of an afternoon.

510
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,918
You got a little, like, cilantro
or something on your...

511
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,256
What the fuck?

512
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,802
Is this yours?

513
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:27,014
No. It belonged to the kid
that sold me the car.

514
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,266
I mean, the weed, the Trans Am.

515
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,393
If you're having a mid-life crisis,
we can talk about it.

516
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,521
I'm not having a mid-life crisis.
What's wrong with this car?

517
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,982
- I think it's cool.
- Yeah, it's...

518
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,485
- What are you doing?
- I'm making lemonade.

519
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,821
Put that shit away. We're cops.
We're on-duty cops.

520
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,031
So what?

521
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,658
It's not like we're gonna hear back
from dispatch today anyway.

522
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,871
I haven't smoked that shit
since I was 16.

523
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,791
Exactly, Grandpa.
Don't you want to be cool?

524
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,546
Give me that.

525
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:32,996
I could feel hot flames
of fire roaring in my back.

526
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,251
Dude, quit staring at me.
You're freaking me out.

527
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,463
It's sad. I can feel how much
your heart hurts for Deb.

528
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:46,218
Dude. Get your big,
fucking sausage hands off me.

529
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,970
That's terrible.

530
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,140
Batista.

531
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,855
Got it. Thanks.

532
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,108
That was dispatch.

533
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,944
We got Jeremiah Allen's address.

534
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,112
Jeremiah who?

535
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,365
The guy. The dude.
The... The preacher.

536
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,577
Right! Awesome.

537
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,453
Where's my hat?

538
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,542
Did you know that children
who undergo anaesthesia

539
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,587
under the age of three are more likely
to develop learning disabilities?

540
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,881
Are you doing research?

541
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:29,469
And once the appendix bursts,
the complication rate rises to 59%.

542
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,263
Maybe you should get off the internet.

543
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,769
You think
we should call Astor and Cody,

544
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,521
let them know Harrison's in surgery?

545
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,858
No, not yet.
I don't want to worry them.

546
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,652
Deb, is that you on TV?

547
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,907
Or public opinion. All I care about
is catching the... that did this.

548
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,742
Fuck.

549
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,077
Sorry.

550
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,251
- Dexter?
- Sam, what are you doing here?

551
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,589
I figured if I had a son
who was going through surgery,

552
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:09,217
I'd probably want
some backup, too, so...

553
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,345
- Thanks.
- Brother Sam?

554
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,932
You came in on the Omar Rivera case.

555
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,102
Are you guys, like, friends now?

556
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,815
- Yeah, well, I have the auto shop.
- Yep!

557
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,571
I'm gonna go to the cafeteria,
see if anything's edible.

558
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,031
Any takers?

559
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,407
I'll browse.

560
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,539
How you holding up?

561
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,876
Honestly, not good. I hate not knowing

562
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,587
if he's gonna be OK,
not being able to protect him.

563
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,465
Sometimes you just got to surrender.

564
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,304
I'm sorry, man.
That probably wasn't the...

565
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,640
- It's OK.
...best thing to say.

566
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,642
No, it's...

567
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,398
If I was in your situation,
I would not want to hear that shit.

568
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,026
I used to not always be like this.

569
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,573
People used to talk to me
about God, man.

570
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,742
Used to make me
want to punch them in their face.

571
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,078
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

572
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,458
I used to believe in something else.

573
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,004
What?

574
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,341
The same as you. My dad.

575
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,055
Whatever, that...
That didn't work out.

576
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,682
What happened?

577
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,728
Hey, you got enough on your mind, man.
You don't need to...

578
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,355
Want to hear no stories

579
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,691
- about me and my dad.
- No, I appreciate the distraction.

580
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,783
When I was growing up,
my dad was a real popular guy.

581
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,912
Everybody knew him.

582
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,708
They used to call him "Mister".

583
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,630
He was always working,
but I never really knew what he did.

584
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,885
So one day I asked him.
I said, "Daddy, what do you do?"

585
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,180
He looked at me and said,
"Whatever I want, whenever I need."

586
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,223
Like that.

587
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,603
He said
he was going to see a friend of his.

588
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,607
So we get there.

589
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,652
He says, "Go on up there
and ring that doorbell for me."

590
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,447
So I do it.

591
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,242
And this man comes to the door.

592
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:44,206
And he's staring at me,
not knowing who I am or why I'm there.

593
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,669
And before I can turn around
and say, "I'm with Mister,"

594
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,050
my dad is standing
right there behind me

595
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,760
with a pistol in his hand.

596
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,180
And he takes his pistol
and he points it at this man,

597
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,141
and he shoots him in the face.
Killed him.

598
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,772
Blood everywhere.

599
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,776
All on my Superman shirt.

600
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,197
My dad just calmly picks me up,

601
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:22,577
walks to the car, drives off slowly.

602
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,288
And he says,

603
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,083
"You did a good job."

604
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,924
He used you.

605
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,510
No surprise I ended up in prison.

606
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,556
So what changed?

607
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,816
Well, when I first got locked up,
them first few months,

608
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,069
I was just mad.

609
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,699
And I just
wanted to hurt somebody, anybody.

610
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,871
And this new guy comes in.

611
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:13,170
And he's just loud and bragging,
and, "I was this, that in the street."

612
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,922
And so I'm just looking at him.
I'm thinking to myself,

613
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:20,051
"OK, when I get a chance,
I'm gonna tune this motherfucker up."

614
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,723
So we get yard time,

615
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,475
and I'm following him.

616
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,353
And he goes into the chapel.

617
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,899
I sneak up on him,

618
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,402
and I start choking him out.

619
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,864
I'm trying to kill him.

620
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,368
And then I see this light.

621
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,373
Like, figuratively, or...

622
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,044
No, no, like, for real. Like, light.

623
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,464
Sunlight coming through
these chapel windows, and...

624
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,594
I could just see everything around me.

625
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,349
I could see where I was at
and what I was doing,

626
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,645
and I didn't want to do it no more.

627
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,898
And you think that was God?

628
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,322
Dexter, all I know

629
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,367
is that when I let that man go,

630
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,539
that I'd never felt that good
about nothing in my life.

631
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,006
- I'm gonna grab some coffee.
- Yeah.

632
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:59,693
Come on.

633
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,451
Just let him be OK.
Please let him be OK.

634
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,586
I don't know how this works,

635
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:22,590
but if there's something
I need to do in return, I'll do it.

636
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,387
OK?

637
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,955
You're going out with that woman,
aren't you?

638
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,875
Her name is Erin.

639
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,712
If you like, I could cancel.
I could stay here with you.

640
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,464
There's more work I could do.

641
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,551
No, we were given free will
for a reason, Travis.

642
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,805
You can do whatever you want.

643
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,186
As long as you're willing to...

644
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,899
accept the consequences God gives you.

645
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,616
It's just dinner.

646
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,535
I'll be back home by 10:00.

647
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,752
Good night.

648
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,262
And your parents, are you close?

649
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,683
Yes, we were. They died when I was 14.

650
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,686
- Car wreck.
- I am so sorry.

651
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,397
That's terrible.

652
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,566
My sister pretty much raised me
after that.

653
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,569
Poor thing.

654
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,489
You guys are really lucky
that you had each other.

655
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,747
I want you, Travis.

656
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,877
Travis.

657
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,674
Kid's a champ.
Made it through with flying colours.

658
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,842
Thank God.

659
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,305
I mean, thank you.
Thank you so much, Doctor.

660
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,682
My pleasure.
They're taking him up to recovery now.

661
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,808
You can see him in a few minutes.

662
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,728
I knew he'd be OK.

663
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,939
I got to go.
Matthews wants to talk to me.

664
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,317
Probably about the conference.
I'm totally fucked.

665
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,446
Long day, you should go home.

666
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,780
Are you sure? I can hang.

667
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,824
No, go.
I'll call you if anything changes.

668
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,826
- OK. Good night.
- Good night.

669
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,872
Thanks for staying.
You didn't have to.

670
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:44,250
Not a problem. I wanted to.
I'm glad little man is all right.

671
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,044
Yeah, me too.

672
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,546
I know. Thank God.

673
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,257
That's just an expression.

674
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,093
I know. Just,

675
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,554
another marvel of modern science.

676
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,265
Yeah, you put your faith in God,
I put my faith in science.

677
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,644
It's cool. We don't have to believe
in the same thing,

678
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,771
but you got to keep an open mind.

679
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:10,276
You may say I can't prove
that God exists,

680
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,779
but you can't prove he doesn't.

681
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,327
You take care, Dex.

682
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,760
Deputy Chief?

683
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,930
Morgan, did you see the news?

684
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,391
I been getting calls
about it all night.

685
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,393
I did, sir. Let me just say
that I am truly, deeply...

686
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,187
Everybody loves
my new sparkplug of a lieutenant.

687
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,189
- They do?
- You're direct.

688
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,691
No bullshit.

689
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,401
Well, I was just trying
to get the community...

690
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,279
I took a big risk
when I promoted you, Morgan.

691
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,448
I took a lot of crap
from a lot of people.

692
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,659
But today...

693
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,662
today you've made me
very, very proud.

694
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,749
Your dad would have been proud, too.

695
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,544
Keep up the good fucking work.

696
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,465
Thank you, sir.

697
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,471
Hey.

698
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,142
Which one of you characters
drives a Firebird?

699
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,185
Crockett or Tubbs?

700
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,813
You park like a dick.

701
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,903
You guys want to go in my office,
tell me what you've been up to?

702
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,781
Well, we'll be right in.

703
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,909
I've been meaning to thank you
for that fashion advice.

704
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,078
Really upped my professional factor.

705
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,083
Jesus, Anderson,
you have something to say, say it.

706
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,293
With all due respect, Lieutenant,

707
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,253
you should probably
watch the language.

708
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,090
Well, for your information,
Matthews said people liked it.

709
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,014
We have a lead.

710
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,309
We've been speaking to this preacher,
Jeremiah Allen.

711
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,937
Turns out he's obsessed with
this Revelation expert, James Gellar.

712
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,024
The professor,
from the University of Tallahassee?

713
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,400
Yeah?

714
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,072
Found this on a Google search
for "Revelation expert".

715
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,745
- It's all about end times.
- Yeah. Check this out.

716
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:29,123
The posts end on the day
of our very first crime scene.

717
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,335
I can try and get in touch with him,
but...

718
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,713
You can't get in touch with him,
because he went underground.

719
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,715
Underground. Why?

720
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,343
Now look who's behind the curve.

721
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,095
I called the university.

722
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,806
Gellar disappeared
three years ago after he got fired.

723
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,307
- Ask me why.
- Why?

724
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,727
He got accused
of stealing an ancient sword.

725
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,272
Like the one Masuka thinks our killer
could have used in both murders?

726
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,399
Just like that.

727
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:59,195
And get this.
This isn't just any Roman sword.

728
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,447
According to medieval legend,

729
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,409
this one belonged
to John the Revelator.

730
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,038
The guy who actually wrote Revelation.

731
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,501
Looks like we just found
our number one person of interest.

732
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,547
- Good job.
- Thank you.

733
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,775
You knew this was gonna happen.

734
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:43,364
No! Please, let her go. I like her.

735
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,367
You should have thought about that
before you defiled her.

736
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,704
This is the best thing for her.

737
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,792
She's part of God's plan now.

738
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,183
Looks like your prayers were answered.

739
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,561
- I was desperate.
- Hey, no judgement.

740
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,564
You already talk
to an imaginary father figure.

741
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,317
- It didn't mean anything.
- Are you sure?

742
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:24,071
Harrison's OK,
and you did make that pact.

743
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,496
Come on. You don't really think
there's someone out there

744
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,831
- holding my IOU.
- I don't know.

745
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,585
But if there is, you'd better be ready
to pay the piper.

746
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,552
Hey.

747
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,929
Hey. How's Harrison?

748
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,597
He's fine. He's sleeping.

749
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,140
Are you sure?
Cos I wouldn't want to bother you.

750
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,475
Deb, just tell me what's up.

751
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,436
Got a call to a crime scene
in Coral Gables.

752
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,396
A gardener at the botanical gardens

753
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,316
found an alpha and an omega
outside the greenhouse.

754
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,944
- You think it's Doomsday?
- Could be.

755
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,530
And we might have a suspect,
a middle-aged professor.

756
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,491
- I'm not sure if I should leave.
- Dexter.

757
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,410
Sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt or anything,

758
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,329
but if that's work, you should go.

759
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,331
- But Harrison...
- Harrison is sound asleep.

760
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,583
Between the painkillers
and the sedatives they gave him,

761
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,502
you can probably get there and back
before he even wakes up.

762
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:22,296
Dex, at the risk of sounding
like the world's worst aunt,

763
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,966
I could really use you on this.
There's blood.

764
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,053
I'll be there.
Call me the minute he wakes up.

765
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,596
I will.

766
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,144
I was drawn to science
out of curiosity.

767
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,772
Any questions I had,
the answers were already there.

768
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,278
But even science is never certain.

769
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,614
Even the soundest of theories
is subject to new data.

770
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,451
And there are some things
even science can't explain.

771
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,287
Brother Sam would say
it's not an accident

772
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:58,541
that I've stumbled onto a killer who
seems to have his own kind of faith.

773
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,334
And while I don't believe
in an unseen hand

774
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,503
creating his own tableau,

775
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,424
I do believe
I don't have all the answers.

776
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,759
- Dex, thanks for coming.
- What do we got?

777
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,721
Blood and fucking fish.

778
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:22,940
Catch of the day.

779
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:31,866
It didn't get here on its own.
So where did it come from?

780
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,293
Dex, where are you going?

781
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,506
Over here! Check this out.

782
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,555
Handle.

783
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,156
- Holy shit.
- In here!

784
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:28,881
No!

785
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,307
Deb, wait! Could be another trap.

786
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,101
Oh, God, I have to help her!

787
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,770
Her jugular's punctured.
She's already gone.

788
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,773
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

789
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,153
Kill number three. It's official.

790
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,780
He's a serial killer.

791
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,993
Wait, wait, everybody. Listen.

792
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:00,997
What the hell is that?

793
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,959
It's coming from over here.

794
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,445
Locusts.

795
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,049
I'm not looking
at Debra's middle-aged professor.

796
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,177
Is this Doomsday number two?

797
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,975
But that's not the look of a murderer.

798
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,603
That's the look of a man
with true faith.

799
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,521
I've seen it before on Brother Sam.

800
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,817
Whatever this guy believes,
he knows it to be true.
