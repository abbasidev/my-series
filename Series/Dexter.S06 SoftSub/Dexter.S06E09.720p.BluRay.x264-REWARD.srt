1
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,925
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,385
You're saying Gellar does the killing?

3
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,137
He's so much stronger than me.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,304
I can protect you.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,640
It's not me that I'm worried about.
It's my sister.

6
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:19,143
Your sister talked to the police.

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,811
She betrayed you.

8
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,646
Just like the whore of Babylon.

9
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,106
No!

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,274
Ice Truck Killer?

11
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,775
It was stolen from our evidence room.

12
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,736
I erased any trace of the sale
from the internet.

13
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,447
However, I wasn't able
to get the hand back.

14
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,781
So when Jessica Morris OD'd,

15
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,783
there was definitely someone
in that hotel room with her.

16
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,160
No doubt.

17
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,287
Then why is LaGuerta on my ass
to close this thing?

18
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,831
My sister's a really nice girl.

19
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,125
You seem like a nice guy.

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,254
I just wouldn't want
to see you get hurt.

21
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,135
Travis, is he here?

22
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,639
Gellar has seen me now.

23
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,016
This just got much harder.

24
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,517
I'll help you.

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,687
I'll help you kill him.

26
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,766
I've had my dark passenger for so long

27
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,935
that I can't really recall
life without it.

28
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,608
Like someone who's grown up
with a club foot,

29
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,485
or a stutter, or a lazy eye,

30
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,448
it's simply been my own affliction
that I accept as part of who I am.

31
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,620
But for Travis,

32
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,289
his dark passenger
is a more recent acquisition,

33
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,626
and he's not adjusting so well.

34
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,221
So I'm going to help separate them.

35
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,862
You saved my life.

36
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,906
Gellar would have killed me.

37
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,659
You said you'd help me find him.
Where is he?

38
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,538
Travis.

39
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,207
I don't know.

40
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,542
Where else does he stay?

41
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,879
Nowhere. This place was his home.

42
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,591
The only time he left was
when we were doing the work.

43
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,511
You mean hunting your victims.

44
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,355
This one.

45
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,857
The bowls of wrath. The next tableau.

46
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,693
- Where will Gellar stage it?
- I don't know.

47
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,194
Then who will Gellar's next victim be?

48
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,362
I don't know.

49
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,948
He murdered
your sister, Travis. Think.

50
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,409
Gellar was the one
who made all the decisions.

51
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,204
Come on, Travis.
You must know something.

52
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,794
"2LOT."

53
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,547
Is that from the bible?

54
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,052
I've never seen that before.

55
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,558
Look for anything
that'll help us find Gellar.

56
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,252
I feel dizzy.

57
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,924
We need to take care of that arm,

58
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,261
and find you a place to stay
where Gellar can't find you.

59
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,073
What's this about, Dexter?

60
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,450
It's what Brother Sam would want.

61
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,577
Are you sure
this is about Brother Sam?

62
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,455
I know what I'm doing.

63
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,265
My cell phone's on the speed dial.

64
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,268
Sit down. Hold out your arm.

65
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,982
So what am I supposed to do here?

66
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,859
Nothing.

67
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,612
There's nothing you can do right now.

68
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,865
Not to mention you're wanted
for multiple murders.

69
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,909
You can't help me if you're in jail.

70
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,621
I'll be back later with some food.

71
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,416
In the meantime,
do not leave this room.

72
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,253
And try to think of anything
that might help me figure out

73
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,629
where Gellar is.

74
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,970
2LOT.

75
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,395
"2LoT: The Second Law of
Thermodynamics.

76
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,150
"Tendency for order
to become disorder or chaos."

77
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,527
What does it have to do
with the bowls of wrath?

78
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,576
A parking pass.

79
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,328
You visited the Miami South Campus.

80
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,248
Were you stalking your next victim?

81
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,679
"Professor Casey's
controversial book 2LOT's Tales

82
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,140
"claims to demolish
every argument offered

83
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,392
"for a God-centred universe."

84
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,229
If Gellar wants to pour out his wrath,
who better to receive it than...

85
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,566
"Tireless crusader
for the virtues of atheism."

86
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,156
Dexter's allowed
to have a private life,

87
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,950
but is it too much to ask
for a little give and take?

88
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,038
Would you say that your brother
has always been guarded?

89
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,708
Well, yeah, that's the problem.

90
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,127
But if he's always been this way,

91
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,172
why would you
suddenly expect him to change?

92
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,300
I don't know.

93
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,887
Would you expect a chair
to suddenly become a table?

94
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,555
No, but...

95
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,599
- No, because a chair...
- Is a chair.

96
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,853
Dexter is who he is.

97
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,775
You're good.

98
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,111
How does it make you feel
when he shuts you out?

99
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,864
Alone.

100
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,285
Where do you think this comes from?

101
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,621
This feeling of being alone?

102
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,249
I don't know.

103
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,505
My mom died when I was a teenager.

104
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,466
That must have been hard.

105
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,263
Becoming a woman with...
with no mother figure.

106
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,979
It would have helped if my dad
had paid me any attention.

107
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,068
That's probably why I fell in love
with someone twice my age.

108
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,862
He was shot in front of me.
Did I mention that?

109
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,406
No.

110
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,451
I was probably looking
for someone safer

111
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,038
after being engaged
to this really great guy

112
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,083
that also turned out
to be a serial killer.

113
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,547
Would you like it
if we started seeing each other

114
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,465
more than once a week?

115
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,976
Deb.

116
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,395
Listen, I'm sorry about last night.

117
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,896
You don't have to apologise.

118
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,732
- I don't?
- Nope.

119
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,108
I get it.

120
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,276
You're a chair.

121
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,612
I'm a... what?

122
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,781
I don't have time to explain it.
I'm late for the briefing.

123
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,206
You look confused.

124
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,335
Your sister ever say anything

125
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,587
that makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever?

126
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,547
- All the time.
- She ever call you a chair?

127
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,840
I don't think so.

128
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,555
Hey, have either one of you
seen Quinn?

129
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,892
I hope he's OK.

130
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,185
Why wouldn't he be?

131
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,189
He got shit-faced last night
and started proposing to strippers.

132
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,565
OK, let's get started.

133
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,234
- Where's Quinn?
- He's on his way.

134
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,614
Lisa Marshall is DDK's latest victim.

135
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,157
The whore of Babylon.

136
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,368
Where are we on finding
her brother Travis?

137
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,620
He's gone missing.
Hasn't reported to work in days.

138
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:07,207
We got unis at his apartment
and at Lisa's house. So far, nothing.

139
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,709
So he and Gellar either
got the fuck out of Dodge

140
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,087
or they're holed up somewhere
planning their next instalment

141
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,213
of what the fuck.

142
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,465
Travis is holed up waiting for me.

143
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,676
They have three tableaus to complete.

144
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,513
Now, according to Gellar's notebooks,
the bowls of wrath are next.

145
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,224
Now religious experts
that I've consulted

146
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,769
say that it's punishment
poured on the people.

147
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:31,064
Each bowl is a plague.
Disease, darkness...

148
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,316
The ocean turns to blood.

149
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,442
You know this shit?

150
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,362
I've been studying.

151
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,280
Gellar updated his blog.

152
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,949
It's the first post
since the killings began.

153
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,201
- Which is huge, right?
- Let me see it.

154
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,872
"In six days, the end will be
marked with a solar eclipse.

155
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,418
"All those following
false prophets are doomed."

156
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,086
Could be Professor Casey.

157
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,630
Or me.

158
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,341
I'm the one Gellar saw in the church.

159
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,137
Look at all the comments.

160
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,847
People are taking this shit seriously.

161
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,518
Professor Gellar,
I support your quest.

162
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:12,689
I'm inspired by your courage
and faithfully follow you to the end.

163
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,107
"Doomsday_Adam."

164
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,069
Well, a blog update's
not gonna help us find their location.

165
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,405
Well, I could take a stab
at tracking down

166
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,990
the blog's Internet Protocol address.

167
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,534
I hope you're not as good
as you think.

168
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,204
Do it, Louis. I don't want to know
how you do it, but do it.

169
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,664
We're running on fumes here.

170
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,374
I need people following all leads,

171
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,710
whatever it takes
to catch these assholes, OK?

172
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,044
Let's do it.

173
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,963
I hate to root against my own team,

174
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,424
but I want a shot at Gellar first.

175
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,603
All right! Jesus Christ.

176
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,190
You missed the morning briefing.

177
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,816
Hey, I overslept. It happens.

178
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,402
Yeah, well, it's happening a lot.
Get dressed.

179
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,157
Your gun, where is it?

180
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,413
- Oh, fuck me.
- You got to be kidding me.

181
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,124
The whole city is looking to us
to fix this DDK shit,

182
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,667
and you lose your gun?

183
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,338
I went to the strip club with Masuka,
he bailed on me...

184
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:24,511
And then me and this stripper
went to her car, and she...

185
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,596
You banged a stripper in her car?

186
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,598
Maybe my gun fell out
in her back seat.

187
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,892
You better pray that it did
and that it's still there.

188
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,436
Please, tell me
you at least got her number.

189
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,690
- Oh, fuck me.
- Dios mío.

190
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,235
I got enough to babysit
with my kid sister.

191
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,654
Your phone's got GPS. Track it.

192
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,250
That address is halfway across town.

193
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,961
We just lost a whole morning
because of your dumb ass.

194
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,587
I'll make it up to you.

195
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,298
Mr Morris.

196
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,926
Yes. I'm Jessica Morris' father.

197
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,220
Thank you for seeing me.

198
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,763
I am sorry for your loss.

199
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,599
How can I help you?

200
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,852
I'd like you to reopen Jessica's case.

201
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,605
Mr Morris, I know
this must be very difficult,

202
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,607
but the medical examiner ruled
that your daughter's death

203
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,902
was an accidental overdose,
not a homicide.

204
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,112
Yes, I know.

205
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,030
But her sternum was cracked.

206
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,616
And the paramedics said
they never performed CPR

207
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,952
because she was already dead
when they arrived.

208
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,705
- How do you know that?
- Does it matter?

209
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,748
If someone was with her when she died,

210
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,916
why aren't you looking into that?

211
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,751
I'm sorry, but the case is closed.

212
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,378
Well, then reopen it.

213
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,714
What if that person killed her
and then tried to cover it up?

214
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,632
I am sorry, but my hands are tied.

215
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,634
Please, just listen.

216
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,889
I don't know if you have kids,

217
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,142
but I hope you never have to see them
turning tricks on Collins Avenue.

218
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,646
I will run it upstairs.
I'll see what I can do.

219
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,316
Thank you. Thank you.

220
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,153
How is your magic working?

221
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,239
This is a tough nut, but I want to
prove Sergeant Batista wrong.

222
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,824
I can do this. I can do this.

223
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,743
What's his problem with you?

224
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,330
He doesn't think I'm good enough
to date his sister, so I backed off.

225
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,833
OK. Stop with the fingers.
We gotta talk.

226
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,506
Look, I...

227
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,843
I understand the whole
cowardly geek response.

228
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,179
- I'm not a geek.
- One bridge at a time, Louis.

229
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,431
You're into Jamie, right?

230
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,599
Yeah, she's amazing.

231
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,517
Well, you have to tell her that.

232
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,355
When it comes to matters of the heart,

233
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,190
always follow your dick.

234
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,779
Yeah, but how am I
ever gonna win over Batista?

235
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,988
You don't.

236
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,824
If Jamie's into you
as much as you're into her,

237
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,285
she's gonna
take care of Batista for you.

238
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,121
Just don't tell him I told you so.

239
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,541
Yeah, I wanted to talk to Dr Casey
about this D he gave me.

240
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,711
When's his class again?

241
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,717
Brunner Hall of Science. Got it.

242
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,803
I'll catch him after class.

243
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,398
I brought you a sandwich.

244
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,066
Did you find Gellar?

245
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,651
No.

246
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,403
But he updated his blog.

247
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,697
He did?

248
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,002
You have any idea what this means?

249
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,089
"All those following
false prophets are doomed."

250
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,592
It's a message for me.

251
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,720
He's offering me a way back in.

252
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,265
And I'm the false prophet.

253
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,562
You ever heard of this guy?

254
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,355
Trent Casey?

255
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,608
Yes. Gellar hates him.
He's an atheist.

256
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,361
Does he hate him enough
to want to kill him?

257
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,615
The painting of the bowls of wrath
in the church

258
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,242
had "2LOT" written on it.

259
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,455
- You think he's the next victim.
- Yes.

260
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,377
How do we find him?

261
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,795
I'll let you know.

262
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,590
Oh, man!

263
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,884
All right, boys and girls,
time for a snack.

264
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,595
- I want one.
- Good job. Time for a snack.

265
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,805
Is this your penance, too?

266
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,307
What?

267
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,809
Catering for the toddler horde.

268
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,397
My wife's in a meeting.
What's your excuse?

269
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,484
I'm here for my son.

270
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,902
Harrison.

271
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,653
- Cookie.
- Cookie.

272
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,157
Thank you, Harrison.

273
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,581
That one's mine.

274
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,967
Hey. How are you?

275
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,513
OK. How are you?

276
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:24,143
This is a little awkward, but I think
I left something in your car.

277
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,813
Sorry. I don't have a car.

278
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,359
Didn't I meet you last night
out at Virginia Gardens?

279
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,695
Oh, you're looking for my mom.

280
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,199
Mom.

281
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,202
Hotness like that's got to
run in the family, right?

282
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,411
I mean, she must be like...

283
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,998
Holy shit. Hi. We got the wrong house.

284
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,500
- Joey.
- Hey.

285
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,001
OK.

286
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,880
So you two met at the club?

287
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,674
Oh, no, no.

288
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,217
We met across the street
at the Waffle House.

289
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,677
I work the late shift,

290
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,221
and this one was all hands.

291
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,391
I'd love to hear more,

292
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,227
but Joey and I have to
get back to the station,

293
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,772
and we think he may have left
some things in your car.

294
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,067
It wasn't his innocence,
if you know what I mean.

295
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,571
It's unlocked.

296
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,906
Thank you, ma'am.

297
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,870
You can't tell anybody about this.

298
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,454
I can say anything I want.

299
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,541
Got it.

300
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,421
Oh, my God. We took pictures.

301
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,218
I hope you at least wore...

302
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,220
Oh, no, no, no.

303
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,930
Oh, great. Fucking great.

304
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,143
Shit.

305
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,395
Just call the station.
Have them send a tow.

306
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,606
The station doesn't know
that we're down here

307
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,108
getting your gun back,
and we got to keep it that way.

308
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,235
Or that you're driving a car
the '70s wants back.

309
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,113
Stow it, will you? I wouldn't have to
be racing back if it weren't for you.

310
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,281
I could have handled this on my own.

311
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,326
You can't handle your balls right now.
When are you gonna grow up?

312
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,785
Like you're one to talk.

313
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,579
Come again?

314
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,750
All you want to do is try and control
everything and everyone around you

315
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,294
in order to feel better
about your own fucked-up life.

316
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,795
You're so full of shit.

317
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,922
Yeah, really?

318
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,007
Cos your first wife up and left you.

319
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,802
Your second wife, she was
your wife for what? Six months?

320
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,263
You got a daughter
that wants nothing to do with you.

321
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,473
I think you need to shut up.

322
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,808
And now your panties
are in a big wet wad.

323
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,478
Why? Because your little sister's
dating someone you don't like.

324
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,687
Am I right, Lieutenant?

325
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,023
Oh, wait, no, my bad.
I'm sorry. You're still sergeant,

326
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,650
cos you fucked that up, too.

327
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,704
Come on, is that all you got,
you motherfucker?

328
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,997
Little motherfucker.

329
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,334
Hey! Leave him alone
or I'll call the police.

330
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,682
Now, creationists say

331
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,017
the second law of thermodynamics

332
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:15,022
doesn't allow order
to arise from disorder.

333
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,024
So...

334
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:22,738
Why does this idea make
their bible-clutching fingers twitch

335
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,699
with excitement?

336
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,913
Because for creationists,

337
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,918
it means that the idea of evolution,
life arising from chaos,

338
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,878
contradicts the second law.

339
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,380
It can't happen.

340
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,924
Can I look at your syllabus?
I forgot mine.

341
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,678
And you need

342
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,887
God...

343
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,726
...to explain everything, right?

344
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,935
Wrong.

345
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,730
He's kind of a self-important asshole,

346
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,898
but I like him.

347
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,901
Casey's office is in Scarnes Hall

348
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,070
and he has late office hours tonight.

349
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,906
In case Gellar decides to show up,
I'll be here as well.

350
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,743
This coming from people
who think there are no unicorns

351
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,079
because they were late
getting to Noah's Ark.

352
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,541
All right, that's all for today.

353
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:20,046
Read chapters 9 through 10
for next week.

354
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,423
Thank you.

355
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,556
- Professor Casey.
- Yes?

356
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,518
I believe you're in danger.

357
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,399
What variety of lunatic might you be?

358
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,777
I'm only trying to warn you.

359
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,529
Well, then you're
one of the good ones.

360
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,532
Do you have any idea
how many threats I get each week?

361
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,285
- This one is real.
- Please.

362
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,954
Unless you have some proof...

363
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,139
One elevator and one set of stairs
equals two exits.

364
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,308
Finally, some use for Travis.

365
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,151
Nice place.

366
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,987
Thank Gellar. He found it.

367
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,781
So this is where it all started.

368
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,867
And where it's going to end.

369
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:36,997
This has become very important to you,
killing Travis's dark passenger.

370
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,124
Yes.

371
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,504
I would have done anything
for a chance to get rid of yours.

372
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,091
I'm not sure you even tried.

373
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,220
You just refocused it.

374
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,889
So what will you do with him
once Gellar's gone?

375
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,183
Allow him to start over.

376
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,895
I know of a few people
who aren't using their identities.

377
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,356
Your slides.

378
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,068
I kill Gellar,
and Travis gets a second chance.

379
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,197
The one I'll never have.

380
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,618
What is Gellar like?

381
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,413
First year of college,

382
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,206
I took his class,

383
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,376
and he took me under his wing.

384
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:27,256
Made me feel like
I was part of something important.

385
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,427
And I know it sounds crazy,

386
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,391
but he convinced me
that God had chosen us

387
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,727
to become the two witnesses.

388
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,982
And what do the two witnesses do?

389
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:49,111
They enact the Book of Revelation
and bring about the new world.

390
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,864
By ending this one?

391
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,285
Why would you want to do that?

392
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,624
Have you ever wanted
to wipe everything clean

393
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,376
and start your whole life
all over again?

394
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,015
Once Gellar's gone,
you can start again.

395
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,315
There's Gellar.

396
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,234
Let's go.

397
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,496
I'm gonna take the elevator.

398
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,624
If Gellar took the stairs,
maybe I can head him off.

399
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,253
Watch the stairs, make sure
he doesn't double back on me.

400
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,712
Stay here.

401
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,510
Gellar doesn't have
much of a head start.

402
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,645
He knows I'm here.

403
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,376
Come on.

404
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,380
Gellar.

405
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,727
Sorry. You told me not to move.

406
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,729
- Did you see Gellar?
- No.

407
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,821
Stay behind me.

408
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,752
This is all my fault.

409
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,171
Travis is proving to be my penance.

410
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,592
There's not that much blood.

411
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,428
Casey could still be alive.

412
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,099
Let's go.

413
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,320
I can't believe we lost him.

414
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,448
And Casey, he's gonna kill him.

415
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,284
We can still stop him.

416
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,954
How?

417
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,998
Through you.

418
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,502
This blog that Gellar writes,
it's important to him.

419
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,463
Send a message to him.

420
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,385
Tell him you've changed your mind
and you need to see him.

421
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,637
I'll do it right now.

422
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,480
Just keep sending messages.
Call me as soon as he responds.

423
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,987
Travis posted as the prodigal son,

424
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,157
asking if it's OK for him
to make his way back home.

425
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,325
No response from Gellar.

426
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,995
Hey, good morning.

427
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,414
Someone helping you fight crime?

428
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,208
All wiggles present and accounted for.

429
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,418
Excellent.

430
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,506
Morgan.

431
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,884
DDK struck again
at Miami South Campus.

432
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,343
Casey.

433
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,720
I'm on my way.

434
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,890
Casey's lecture hall. Of course.

435
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,684
Gellar laid him out where
he preaches his godless doctrine

436
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,437
to the young and impressionable.

437
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,782
This is Professor Trent Casey.

438
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,118
He's an evolutionary biologist
and a noted atheist.

439
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,286
Check it out.

440
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,039
The abdomen's got
an alpha-omega carved into it.

441
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,583
- Similar to the fruit vendor.
- Only this guy's missing stitches.

442
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,376
And a hand.

443
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,045
That's new.

444
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,255
The puckering on the wrist tissue

445
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,382
indicates the hand
was removed post-mortem.

446
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,594
And judging from his pallor,
all his blood's been drained.

447
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,930
Looks like he was strung up
and bled out.

448
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,558
Gellar took another page
from my brother Brian's playbook.

449
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,815
The stomach cavity's
been hollowed out.

450
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,735
Any bets on the prize
that DDK left inside?

451
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,238
Unis swept the room.

452
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,323
They didn't find
any tripwires or blood.

453
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,618
So if this is the bowls of wrath,
then what,

454
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,453
is it gonna show up
in a bowl somewhere?

455
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,163
Open him up.

456
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,667
Brace yourselves for awful.

457
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,259
He's empty.

458
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,761
So, then, where are
the bowls of wrath?

459
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,473
Let's get him to the ME's office.
Somebody get a gurney.

460
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,766
I got it.

461
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,768
Quinn's right.

462
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,855
If each bowl is a plague
that God poured...

463
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,110
No, don't!

464
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,030
Oh, my God!

465
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,033
What the fuck?

466
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,833
Gellar hasn't seen wrath
until he's seen mine.

467
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,513
Are you serious?
Bowls of blood dropped on my head?

468
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,683
It's like a perfect fucking metaphor
for my entire fucking life.

469
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,437
I'm not even sure I believe in God,
but I'm pretty sure he hates me.

470
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,857
Losing your parents is difficult.

471
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,903
Having a loved one shot
in front of you is unthinkable.

472
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,448
Finding out that your fiancé
is a serial killer...

473
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:35,410
Did I mention that
he was Dexter's biological brother?

474
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,913
No, you did not.

475
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,040
So wait a minute.

476
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,583
The Ice Truck Killer was your brother?

477
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:46,046
No. Dexter was adopted,
so we're not blood-related.

478
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,260
What? What does that "oh" mean?

479
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,556
You mentioned that your father
didn't pay much attention to you.

480
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,558
What was his relationship
with Dexter like?

481
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,103
They did everything together.

482
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,065
And without your mother...

483
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,610
I was left behind.

484
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,240
You can move forward, Debra.

485
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,326
But it's gonna mean
taking responsibility

486
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,995
for your feelings and your choices.

487
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,579
What does that mean?

488
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,668
Please don't misunderstand me.

489
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,462
I am very sensitive to the trauma
and the tragedy

490
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,423
that you've experienced.

491
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,093
But as far as your failed
relationships are concerned...

492
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,347
What?

493
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,808
We are responsible
for the partners we choose.

494
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,268
Bullshit.

495
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,107
How the fuck was I supposed to know
that Rudy was the Ice Truck Killer?

496
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,196
Are you saying that I chose
to be with a serial killer on purpose?

497
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,658
I think you have a history of choosing
inappropriate or unavailable men.

498
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,327
Well, what the fuck
do you want me to say?

499
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,290
That my life is a train wreck
of a disaster?

500
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,459
That my life is a shithole?
Well, I already know this.

501
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,378
This isn't news to me, OK?
I know that I am broken.

502
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,796
Do you know that you don't have to be?

503
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,383
You can pick up the pieces.

504
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,845
- How?
- By making different choices.

505
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,139
By breaking your patterns.

506
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,476
Debra, it's gonna be hard.

507
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,478
But you can make yourself whole again.

508
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,564
You can.

509
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,160
I heard about the bloodbath
at the crime scene.

510
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:41,995
You OK?

511
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,372
I'm fine.

512
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,167
I was actually coming down
to talk to you about your request

513
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,836
- to open the dead call girl's case.
- And?

514
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,173
You can't afford to put
an unsolved back on your plate.

515
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,258
Jesus fuck.
Are we really gonna do this again?

516
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,718
Careful, Lieutenant.

517
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,845
I'm just gonna
stop you right here, OK?

518
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,181
- Excuse me?
- We've been through this.

519
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,226
You're gonna say it's not happening

520
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,393
and that I better do what you say

521
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,938
cos you're gonna give me
some scary, squinty-eyed look,

522
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:12,359
but I am so fucking sick
of having this conversation.

523
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,947
So I'm just gonna
break the pattern right now.

524
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:22,619
If you have a problem with me
investigating a potential homicide,

525
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,955
which is my job,

526
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,081
then fire me.

527
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,042
Otherwise, I am reopening the case.

528
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,569
Morgan won't let
the call girl's death go.

529
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,736
God damn it.

530
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,906
I could have pressed harder,
but she'd only be more suspicious.

531
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,578
You know, it wasn't until I did CPR

532
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,830
that I saw the drugs
and realised she OD'd.

533
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,958
Maria, I swear to God,
I did all I could.

534
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,836
Your career would have been over
if you'd stayed.

535
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,258
What the fuck is Morgan thinking?
Doesn't she know when to back off?

536
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,970
Well, isn't that tenacity the reason
you promoted her in the first place?

537
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,347
Against my advice, of course.

538
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,480
- We have to stop her.
- Don't worry.

539
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,660
Hello?

540
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,454
The police found Casey's body.

541
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,708
The bowls of wrath. He's done it.

542
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,711
The body was missing a hand.
Any idea why Gellar took it?

543
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,297
The writing is on the wall.

544
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,633
What?

545
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,968
The expression. It's from the bible.

546
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:07,849
The fingers of a human hand
appeared and wrote out,

547
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,727
"Your days are numbered."

548
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,230
Gellar's sending another message.

549
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,898
What's the message?

550
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,902
I don't know.

551
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,320
But it doesn't matter.

552
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,988
Gellar contacted me through his blog.

553
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,573
He wants me to meet him
at the church tonight.

554
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,533
Stay in the motel.
I'll pick you up later.

555
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,957
You have the bowls of wrath
blood work?

556
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,209
Yeah, just finished.

557
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,295
Good news.
The blood was pathogen-free.

558
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,005
So the shot I got was just for fun?

559
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,509
Are you OK?

560
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,011
Yeah, I just threw away
a pair of shoes

561
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,347
because they're full of blood,
but I'm great.

562
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:53,561
Cos I'm here if you need a chair.

563
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,480
What?

564
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,024
What you said before. I'm a chair.

565
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,527
Yeah, but I don't want a chair.
I want a table.

566
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,156
- What are you even saying?
- Never mind.

567
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,493
Are we OK?

568
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,039
I have no idea if you are.

569
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,041
I'm sure not, but I'm working on it.

570
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,218
Louis Greene is the man.

571
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,762
Easy with the bromance.
You're gonna pitch a tent.

572
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,222
Well, just remember that
I discovered him

573
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,557
when I'm up for review.

574
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,766
What'd he do?

575
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,519
Unscrambled the IPA of Gellar's blogs

576
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,522
and tracked it to an address.

577
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,734
Anderson, grab your gear.

578
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,277
Right behind you.

579
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,907
Yeah, that's my IP address,
but it's unsecured,

580
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,368
so I couldn't tell you
who all uses the signal.

581
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,911
What's the signal's range?

582
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,747
Give or take 500 feet.

583
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,081
Well, you're putting out
1,000 milliwatts.

584
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,459
I'm guessing
it's probably closer to 900 feet.

585
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,961
These guys ever come in here?

586
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,213
I wouldn't know,

587
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,798
but I can keep an eye out if you want.

588
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,759
- Yeah, we'd appreciate that.
- You bet.

589
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,721
You know, your guys could
drive up anytime, use their laptop,

590
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,765
and never even get out of the car.

591
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,601
- Up to 900 feet?
- Give or take.

592
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,311
Further if there's an antenna
within range.

593
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,771
What would that do?

594
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,606
Boost the signal by a couple of miles.

595
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,902
What are you thinking?

596
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,071
I want to bring in some unis,
have them fan out,

597
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,948
canvass the surrounding area,
see what they come up with.

598
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,452
Louis, I'd buy you a beer,
but it has been a long day.

599
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,747
Well, thanks. I have plans anyway.

600
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,635
Wow!

601
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,181
People love their games.

602
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,642
- There's a lot of money in it.
- Yeah.

603
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,143
I guess.

604
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,484
You have quite the collection

605
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,362
of collections.

606
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,282
Yeah, I don't...

607
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,535
I don't let a lot of people in here.

608
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,537
It's kind of obvious

609
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,497
I'm overcompensating for something.

610
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,501
I've been known to collect.

611
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,044
Yeah?

612
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,798
I went through an '80s phase
in high school.

613
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,885
I had a zillion
of those black rubber bracelets.

614
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,346
Wore them like body armour.

615
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,225
- So...
- So...

616
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,477
weird, I understand.

617
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,856
But why did you blow me off?

618
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,234
I was...

619
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,822
I was trying to be respectful
of Sergeant Batista,

620
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,701
AKA your brother, who happens to
carry a very large gun, by the way.

621
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,665
He sort of gently suggested
that I back off.

622
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,917
He scared you.

623
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,378
Does it make me a pussy if I say yes?

624
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,755
It makes you

625
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,882
honest.

626
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,391
There's another door along that side
at the west narthex,

627
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,770
and a door at the very end,
just off the sacristy.

628
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,940
But you always go
in the main entrance?

629
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,942
- We both do.
- Then go in that way.

630
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,736
And then what?

631
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:16,074
Just talk to him,
tell him you made a mistake,

632
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,158
that you're sorry.

633
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,618
Keep him engaged.

634
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,663
- And what will you do?
- I'll go in the back way.

635
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,291
And then?

636
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,419
It's better you don't know.

637
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,840
You don't trust me.

638
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,635
- Oh, it's not that.
- No, I understand.

639
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,096
Gellar's too smart.

640
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,973
I'd just give it away.

641
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,101
Just do what you have to do.

642
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,313
I will.

643
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,724
Hello, Travis.

644
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,518
Professor Gellar.

645
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,814
I'm kind of surprised
you haven't burst into flames.

646
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,735
God is very kind.

647
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,196
God doesn't want to hurt me.

648
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,201
Don't fucking tell me
what God wants or doesn't want.

649
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,496
You have no idea.

650
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,041
You're wrong.

651
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,336
I don't believe
in a God of violence...

652
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,212
Then go read your bible.

653
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:57,842
Because God promises that
the devious tongue will be cut out,

654
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,844
and he will tear you limb from limb

655
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,431
and destroy thee forever.

656
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,267
Repent your sins, Travis,

657
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:10,563
or you will burn for all eternity.

658
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,567
I have only tried to do what I thought
was right, what I thought...

659
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,735
No!

660
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,782
God has given you so many chances,

661
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:24,077
and you disappoint him
time after time.

662
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,579
But he loves you.

663
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,792
He truly loves you.

664
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,754
He's gonna give you one more chance.

665
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,717
And all you have to do
is listen to me.

666
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,097
Come to me.

667
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:08,579
You've got a lot riding on
this second chance for Travis.

668
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,082
It's up to him
what he does with his life

669
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,625
once I'm done with Gellar.

670
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,127
What about your life?

671
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,254
My life?

672
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,256
Dexter, the police
are closing in on Gellar.

673
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,799
You're taking a risk here.

674
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,635
This isn't just about Travis.
You're not that unselfish.

675
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,179
I'm more than you ever thought I'd be.

676
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,974
So if you remove
Travis's dark passenger,

677
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,934
what are you getting out of this?

678
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,645
Maybe

679
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,314
I can learn to control my own.

680
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,025
Maybe I can be

681
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,318
better.

682
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,779
A better what? A better person?

683
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,656
I don't care about
being a better person.

684
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,949
It's too late for that.

685
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,659
Then what do you care about?

686
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,707
A better father to my son.

687
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,503
Is that so surprising to you?

688
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,386
I want to be a better father

689
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,221
for Harrison.

690
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,897
I have work to do.

691
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,704
Travis.

692
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,375
He's still breathing.

693
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,709
Travis.

694
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,754
Where is Gellar?

695
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,724
Gellar.

696
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,191
He's been dead all along.

697
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,696
Did Travis act alone?

698
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,702
Did Travis

699
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,080
kill all those people?
