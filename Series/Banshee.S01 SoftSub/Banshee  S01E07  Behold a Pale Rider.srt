1
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,690
I'm ready to bring him to you.

2
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,402
Finally.

3
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,848
Finally.

4
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,729
Mr. Proctor.

5
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,480
Hello, Kai.

6
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,322
Hold the work. Clear the room.

7
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,848
I'll call you guys later.

8
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,289
Would you excuse us, Burton?

9
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,290
Last time you spoke to me...

10
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,602
we were pulling yams
in your father's field.

11
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,811
You barely even had that beard yet.

12
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,327
I've come to talk to you about Rebecca.

13
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,130
How is your daughter?

14
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,169
There's no need to pretend.

15
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,926
I know that she talks to you.

16
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,402
She defies every other rule,
so why not that one?

17
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,322
I wouldn't have come if I didn't think...

18
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,891
She is my daughter and I love her.

19
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,607
But she is getting lost.

20
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,088
What happened to you...

21
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,527
has saddened me.

22
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,128
I don't want to lose her.

23
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,964
I understand.

24
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,769
She trusts you.

25
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,408
And because of that...

26
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,846
maybe she would listen to you.

27
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,610
Maybe she would.

28
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,525
Good.

29
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,729
I still pray for you, Kai.

30
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,408
And they were carrots, not yams.

31
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,326
- Don't you got to get going?
- Mm.

32
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,370
I don't think a few kids
in Saturday detention...

33
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,842
will be too crushed
if I'm a little late.

34
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,211
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

35
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,410
Ah, nothing. I'm just distracted.

36
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,166
You've been distracted for the last year,
Dan.

37
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,041
Yeah, well, there's a lot going on at work.

38
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,485
Well, what about what's going on here?

39
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,325
Or not going on, actually.

40
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,609
Well, I'm just a little bit stressed out.

41
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,129
Okay. I've got to go to work.

42
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,329
Four casino guards...

43
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,608
two drivers, and another in the back.

44
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,644
I've studied the photos and the schematics.

45
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,322
And it's like I said, we ain't getting
into that truck once it's closed.

46
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,801
Well, we can't take them
in that loading bay...

47
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,930
if that's what you're thinking.
We'd be dead inside a minute.

48
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,320
You got a better idea?

49
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,887
Yeah, anything but that.

50
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,646
Can we please set you up
with a computer and Quicken or some shit?

51
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,848
Looking at you is like watching
the History Channel.

52
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,005
You of all people should know
that computers are not secure.

53
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,029
Yeah,
there's a million hackers in China just

54
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,841
dying to get their
hands on your financials.

55
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,880
These aren't rent-a-cops. This is
Longshadow's hand-vetted security team.

56
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,929
- They'll die for him.
- So, what then?

57
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,047
We need a friend in the truck.

58
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,043
Lord, I was afraid you were gonna say that.

59
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,565
Hood.

60
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,130
I'll be there.

61
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,602
Oh, for fuck's sake, I know it was her.

62
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,161
I can hear your heart beating from here.

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,642
- She says she has a fence for the stones.
- Just like that? Fucking spectacular.

64
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,768
After 15 years,
she just suddenly found someone.

65
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,285
That's what she said, Job.

66
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,920
There is no fence, man. You know it.

67
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,570
Maybe not.

68
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,962
Then why are you going?

69
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,122
- Because it's her.
- She is not her anymore.

70
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,521
And whoever she is,
she's gonna get you killed.

71
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,364
We'll see.

72
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,885
There is pussy-whipped and then there is
that hopeless motherfucker.

73
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,526
Oh, for fuck's sake.

74
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,681
Hey.

75
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,484
Just like old times.

76
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,246
Don't get too attached.
This is just unfinished business.

77
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,368
We got no shortage of that, right?

78
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,211
Where'd you find these guys?

79
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,727
I started putting out feelers
when you came to town.

80
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,928
A guy in Jersey came through.

81
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,639
You trust him?

82
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:21,890
If I trusted him,
you wouldn't be coming along.

83
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,851
God,
you were always better at this than me.

84
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,531
Fuck!

85
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,444
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,122
- Ana, what are you doing?
- What I have to do.

87
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,770
Oh, fuck.

88
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,766
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,807
Fuck.

90
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,449
Well, honey, is there a particular brand
you want? I mean...

91
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,769
Well, how about whichever
one gives us a yes, huh?

92
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,727
All right, baby. Bye.

93
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,204
Fuck my shit.

94
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,409
- Don't fucking move!
- Okay. Just calm down.

95
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,244
Shut the fuck up, cop!

96
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,482
Keep your hands up, motherfucker.

97
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,766
No! Jesus!

98
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,042
Lance, was that fucking necessary?

99
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,771
- He reached for something.
- Please, let me help him.

100
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,724
Get on your fucking knees.

101
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,843
Get on your fucking knees!

102
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,729
Please, no.

103
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,762
- Fuck me.
- Finish him!

104
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,571
Finish him! Let's go!

105
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,210
Fuck me.

106
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,081
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.

107
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,527
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

108
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,081
I shall fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

109
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,323
Surely goodness, mercy, and love
will follow me all the days of my life...

110
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,245
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

111
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,763
Alma, I've got a robbery in progress.

112
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,804
Shots fired and a civilian down
in the drugstore.

113
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,804
Go, go!

114
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,480
Stop! Hey! Step away from that car!

115
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,962
You should've finished him
in the store, you pussy.

116
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,969
It was a highly charged situation.

117
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,764
And what do you call this?

118
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,161
Killing a cop has ramifications.

119
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,606
Jesus! Fuck!

120
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,525
Sir, are you all right?

121
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,770
Okay, look, stay here.
I'll call an ambulance.

122
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,605
Alma, they're on foot heading towards
the Oak Street parking garage.

123
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,040
Brock, they just crossed Oak Street.
Repeat, they just crossed Oak.

124
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,208
That fucker is still coming.

125
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,886
Suspects heading towards
Banshee High School gymnasium.

126
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,681
I said stop!

127
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,888
- No!
- Come here!

128
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,281
No! No!

129
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,801
- Aah!
- Let her go now!

130
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,485
Ow, fuck!

131
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,005
No!

132
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,085
Do you have any idea
what kind of shitshow you just started?

133
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,966
One of these days we're gonna find you
a functioning set of balls.

134
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,050
Oh, great. Good old BHS.

135
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,611
Shit, more cops.

136
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,960
Help him up!

137
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,770
They ain't gonna come in.

138
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,161
Not when we have us a hostage.

139
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,051
Mrs. Kendall?

140
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,284
- What the fuck is this?
- It's detention.

141
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,124
Get down here now!

142
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,011
Get down from there!
Get up! Move your ass!

143
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,130
Get over here!

144
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,730
Now!

145
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,486
Well, this is new.

146
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,007
I must have gotten the dosage wrong.

147
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,648
You shouldn't have woken up yet.

148
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,801
You called him?

149
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,725
I gave you every chance to leave.
I begged you.

150
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,085
I didn't want to leave.

151
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,642
I would tell you to think
about what you're doing...

152
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,404
but I'm guessing you already have.

153
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,085
I'm protecting my family.

154
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,487
You really think he won't come after you?

155
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,165
That's the deal.

156
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,407
He's gonna torture me to find you.

157
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,085
And you're not gonna tell him.

158
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,686
I'm gonna sing my fucking lungs out.

159
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,081
- Goodbye.
- Hey.

160
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,848
I'll catch up to you.

161
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,166
Anything else?

162
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,084
Yeah, one of them is named Lance.

163
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,125
This place was like church to me.

164
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,126
We were 1983 state champs.

165
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,603
I started at point guard.

166
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,163
You know how many points I averaged
a game, Future Horse?

167
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,125
Twenty points.

168
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,606
Nice.

169
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,489
Goddamn nice.

170
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,204
Get down. Get down.

171
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,880
Any movement in the front?

172
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,088
No, all the doors are
chained up except this one.

173
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,567
- Okay, that'll help us.
- Let me see this.

174
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,165
Fuck.

175
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,322
All the doors
are padlocked shut.

176
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,687
There's no fucking way out of here.

177
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,048
- Lance, can we focus?
- Can you get off my dick?

178
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,202
We've got to get the fuck out of here.

179
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,408
Oh, I forgot.
You hate this place, don't you?

180
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,121
- Hey, look what she's got.
- Hey, hey, hey!

181
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,765
What, are you filming us? Feisty, huh?

182
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,323
Leave her alone. They're just kids.

183
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,046
But you're not, are you?

184
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,882
- You called Hood, right?
- Hood's off today.

185
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,769
He's out of town on personal business.

186
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,208
- Brock, he's the sheriff.
- All right, fine.

187
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,522
Alma, get me the sheriff.

188
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,081
I've been trying him. No answer.

189
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,605
Why am I not surprised?

190
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,330
I just say we go in.

191
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,005
No, we wait.

192
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,401
They've already killed one person.
We're not rushing in.

193
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,406
All right, listen, keep me here,
but let the students go.

194
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,566
Get all their fucking phones.

195
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,081
Give me your phones. Let's go.
Give me your phones!

196
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,642
Siobhan, do another perimeter check,
all right?

197
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,881
Check every window.

198
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,805
Any movement in any room,
you radio in, all right?

199
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,000
She all right?

200
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,685
She's still coming around.

201
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,525
Oh, shit.

202
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,651
Hey! How we doing?

203
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,929
They got fucking TV cameras
set up out there.

204
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,765
This shit's getting out of control.

205
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,044
Time to talk.

206
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,489
Talk to who?

207
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,046
You're on this, huh?

208
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,328
I got the call from Harrisburg.
I was the closest man.

209
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,721
I'm working at scrambling
a SWAT team from Philly.

210
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,008
- All right.
- Where's Hood?

211
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,730
He's out of town on personal business.

212
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,121
We're trying to reach him,
but I can handle this.

213
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,248
- Brock.
- Go for Lotus.

214
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,920
I've got Janie Kendall,
the mayor's wife, on the line.

215
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,082
- She's with the gunmen.
- Put her through.

216
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,648
Janie, this is Brock Lotus. You okay?

217
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,000
Janie?

218
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,646
Tell him it's simple.

219
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,086
He says to tell you it's simple.

220
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,683
We want a car and an easy way out.

221
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,042
They want a car with a way out.

222
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,131
We want it within an hour.

223
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,760
They want it within an hour.

224
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,848
Or bad things will happen in here.

225
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,882
Or bad things will happen.

226
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,087
Janie, is everyone all right in there?

227
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,409
Just tell him to get the fucking car.

228
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,971
Who's with you?

229
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,361
Get the fucking car.

230
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,966
A gangster named Kassin killed my father.

231
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,444
I heard soon after that he'd left Ukraine
and gone to Kunda.

232
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,650
I went there, but I couldn't find him.

233
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,290
Then a few years later...

234
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,881
I was in Yalta on business.

235
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,445
I turned the corner...

236
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,682
and there was Kassin...

237
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,562
carrying a bottle of wine.

238
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,402
We saw each other at the same moment.

239
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,531
It was like two old friends
running into each other.

240
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,043
I gutted him like a fish
right there in the street.

241
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,847
That night I drank his wine with my dinner.

242
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,083
We break from our regular program...

243
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,163
to go live to Banshee, Pennsylvania.

244
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,765
Fuck!

245
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,090
We're here outside Banshee
High School in Banshee, Pennsylvania.

246
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,164
So far what we have to report
is that a pair of armed gunmen...

247
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,520
have taken hostages here
in the school's gymnasium...

248
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,648
after fleeing a robbery gone wrong.

249
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,644
We know at least one person
has been killed at this time.

250
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,167
One hostage posted a video
on her Facebook page...

251
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,886
and we have that footage.

252
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,407
The police confirm
that they have been in contact...

253
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,767
with the gunmen,
but are releasing no information...

254
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,570
regarding the identity of the men...

255
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,804
We are close, no?

256
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,367
Just 15 miles.

257
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,683
These are all the Lances
that Alma could find in our system.

258
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,002
Lance McManus, Lance Hershler...

259
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,323
- Lance Mangan.
- Him. Mangan.

260
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,490
Jesus, I remember him.
He was a point guard back in the day.

261
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,926
- A golden boy.
- Not anymore.

262
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,208
He shot that cashier
like it was target practice.

263
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,323
Brock! Brock!

264
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,272
What's going on?

265
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:04,563
All right, listen.
I talked to Janie. She's okay.

266
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,210
All right? Gordon, hey.

267
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,691
Deva's inside. She had detention.

268
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,286
- We know.
- Where's the sheriff?

269
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,120
What do we know?
What steps are you taking?

270
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,168
Gordon, come on. Dan, please.

271
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,561
Just stay back.
Stay back behind the barrier.

272
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,563
For your own safety, all right?

273
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,931
Come on, Carrie, pick up.

274
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,611
What?

275
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,491
Wait, what?

276
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,209
What the fuck are you doing?

277
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,600
Are you fucking with her?

278
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,081
- No.
- Yes, you are. You're fucking with her.

279
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,290
Instead of trying to get us out of here,
you're acting like a fucking asshole.

280
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,487
Fuck you.

281
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,086
Why'd you have to shoot
that goddamn cashier?

282
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,049
He was reaching for something.

283
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,690
I said I was sorry.

284
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,962
Yeah, well, are you sorry
for all of this shit, huh?

285
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,565
Because that's on you too.

286
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,081
You know, you don't fucking
think shit through.

287
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,888
Can we focus here?

288
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,563
The police confirm
they have been in contact...

289
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,243
with the gunmen,
but are releasing no

290
00:22:26,255 --> 00:22:28,247
information regarding
the identity of the men...

291
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,767
or the nature of the contact.

292
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,049
But rather were
serving a week of academic detention.

293
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,004
Don't worry.

294
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,651
Fuck.

295
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,768
Fuck.

296
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,123
Oh, fucking spectacular.

297
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,080
How did you find me?

298
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,163
I have a tracker on your phone.

299
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,200
Come on!

300
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,370
Car?

301
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,204
- No!
- Enough of this bullshit, man.

302
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,970
We've got to get the fuck out of here.

303
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,009
Get the fuck out of my way.

304
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,686
- Please.
- You don't need to look at this.

305
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,084
You don't need... Fuck!
Just don't fuck with me. Don't look.

306
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,850
Please.

307
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,684
No, please.

308
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,241
Please don't.
They'll give you what you want.

309
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,244
- I know they will.
- So will you.

310
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,889
You bastard! Goddamn it, stop!

311
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,530
Don't. Don't!

312
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,531
- Yeah?
- Car's here for you now.

313
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,569
I'll call you back.

314
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,841
Come on. We'll pick this up later.

315
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,364
Hey, hey. I've been trying...
Hey, hey, hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

316
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,960
- Deva's in there? Okay.
- They're doing everything they can.

317
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,008
- Yeah?
- Listen up.

318
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,527
No, you listen.

319
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,923
You're Lance Mangan. I remember you.

320
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,925
Who the fuck are you?

321
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,211
Brock Lotus.
I was a year behind you in school.

322
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,249
Yeah, well, I don't remember you.

323
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,290
Well, I remember you were all-state.

324
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,842
You started at point guard.
You called smart plays.

325
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,963
See if you can call a smart play now.

326
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,690
All right? Your car is here.

327
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,168
You want it moved up there by the door,
I'm gonna need something from you.

328
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,891
Let's get the kids out of there.

329
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,685
I'll send out four kids.

330
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,728
Then you move the car to the door.

331
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,645
All right, it's a deal.

332
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,322
You four in the front, you're leaving.

333
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,721
One, two, three, four. Get up.

334
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,000
- Nathan, bring them to the door.
- Let's go. Come on.

335
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,522
I said four.
Future Horse stays right here.

336
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:42,243
Whoa, whoa.

337
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,609
She's coming with me.
I'm not leaving without her.

338
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,728
It's okay, Beaty, go.

339
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,602
- What the fuck? Get over here.
- Run!

340
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,240
Get back here! Get back down!

341
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,811
- Watch them!
- Sit down!

342
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,325
- No!
- Get over there, teacher.

343
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,920
Well, especially if they cover this...

344
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,162
Brock, can you please give us an update?

345
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,448
I'd like one too.

346
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,129
What's going on? You going in?

347
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,886
No. I just negotiated
the release of four of the kids.

348
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,883
Great. Where are they?

349
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,245
Um...

350
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,603
- These men are willing to kill.
- You go in there guns blazing...

351
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,640
you're gonna have a handful
of dead children.

352
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,285
Who said anything about guns blazing?

353
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,010
You can't walk in there... Aah!

354
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,643
Don't touch me.

355
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,009
We follow him in, right?

356
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,242
I'm not following him anywhere.
He's insane.

357
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,643
We stay to protocol. We wait out here.

358
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,445
What the fuck?

359
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,444
I'm unarmed.

360
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,568
Don't fucking move!

361
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,166
I came in here to help you work this out.

362
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,890
Fuck you.

363
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,644
You're in some
deep shit here, man.

364
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,087
Lance, get back here!

365
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,364
Where's Lance?

366
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,491
Huh?

367
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,890
Future Horse.

368
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,526
You're not gonna walk out of this.

369
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,886
They won't let you go.

370
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,447
They have to. We have hostages.

371
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,965
That doesn't matter anymore.

372
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,724
That's gone. You killed a man.

373
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,922
I didn't kill anyone!

374
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,687
- It was fucking Lance.
- I believe you.

375
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,487
Lance killed him. What's your name?

376
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,240
You don't need to know my fucking name.

377
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,930
- It's Nathan.
- Shut the fuck up!

378
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,800
- Hey, hey, hey, Nathan.
- Back the fuck up.

379
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,251
- I can help you.
- Lance!

380
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,244
Get the fuck back here! Back up!

381
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,920
Lance can't help you. I can.

382
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,565
Oh, my God! Come on!

383
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,404
Hey!

384
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,564
Don't fucking move.

385
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,120
I will fucking kill you.

386
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,844
- I don't think so.
- Yes, I will.

387
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,326
- No, not you.
- Yes, I will.

388
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,881
- Not you, man.
- I will fucking kill you.

389
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,531
You're no killer, Nathan.

390
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,131
Yes, I am.

391
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,527
- It's Lance.
- No.

392
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,364
Lance, he's the killer.

393
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,803
No, I am a fucking killer.

394
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,241
Shots fired. We're going in!

395
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,528
All of you up. Out, now.

396
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,162
- Hold your fire!
- It's the students.

397
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,164
- Get clear!
- Stay down. Come on. Come on.

398
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,284
- Where's Deva?
- I don't know.

399
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,171
- Where's my daughter?
- She's inside.

400
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,731
Go forward!

401
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,771
Jamie.

402
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,961
It's okay.

403
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,804
Let's... Let's go home, okay?

404
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,362
Get up, Future Horse.

405
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,569
Aah! Nathan, I got them. Nathan.

406
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,290
Nathan. Oh, no, no, no.

407
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,645
No!

408
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,649
Oh, fuck.

409
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,728
- Aah!
- Let her go, Lance.

410
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,611
- Drop your fucking gun.
- Not gonna happen.

411
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,171
Stand down, sheriff.

412
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,681
- I'll fucking kill her!
- Let the girl go.

413
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,763
I'll fucking blow her head off!

414
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,287
- Drop that fucking gun now.
- Drop your weapon!

415
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,249
Get down the fucking stairs right now!

416
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,368
- Drop your weapon.
- Drop your fucking guns!

417
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,921
- Get away! Get back!
- Stand down.

418
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,407
Drop your gun! Drop it!

419
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,085
Put it on the ground now!

420
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,168
Sheriff. Are you injured?

421
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,402
Uh, no.

422
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,325
Good, then you can tell me...

423
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,445
I did what I had to do.

424
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,571
You just endangered the lives
of eight innocent people.

425
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,370
Listen...

426
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,722
I'll give you everything you need...

427
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,929
I promise, in my report.

428
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,049
Welcome to my world.

429
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,604
Hey.

430
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,686
Alma told me I'd find you here.

431
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,209
That guy, the cashier,
he just woke up today and went to work.

432
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,360
He really had no idea that...

433
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,047
Hey, you are an excellent cop
and an excellent man.

434
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,323
If there was something you could have done,
you would have done it.

435
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,126
I'm pregnant.

436
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,967
Police have confirmed
that the two gunmen...

437
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,851
were both killed inside the school,
that the location is secure...

438
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,287
and that all eight of the
former hostages are alive...

439
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,482
and being attended
by medical professionals.

440
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,563
The gunmen were involved
in a botched robbery...

441
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,051
at a drugstore earlier today.

442
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,682
A local police deputy intervened
and pursued them here to the high school...

443
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,207
at which point the gunmen
took eight hostages.

444
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,527
So now you want to tell me
who the hell put the cuffs on you?

445
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,610
Long story.

446
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,371
- Sugar.
- Kai.

447
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,010
Sheriff.

448
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,482
I thought I'd find you here.

449
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,690
Still patching yourself up, I see.

450
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,011
I'll survive.

451
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,003
You did good work today, sheriff.
This town owes you a real debt.

452
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,321
It seems I'm in your debt as well.

453
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,240
The DA formally dropped all charges today.

454
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,482
Apparently the key piece of evidence
disappeared.

455
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,405
Hmm, and a key witness.

456
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,729
This is the first I've heard about that.

457
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,881
Well, congratulations.

458
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,849
You're a free man.

459
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,330
You know, generally,
Banshee is a pretty quiet town.

460
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,007
But after you arrived,
it's been one thing after another.

461
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,002
It's almost as if you
brought it all with you.

462
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,243
"And behold a pale rider...

463
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,966
and his name that sat upon him
was Death.

464
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,010
And hell followed with him."

465
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,011
Revelations 6:8.

466
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,807
Yeah, I've never had much patience
for people who quote scripture.

467
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,884
This is God's country.
You'd better acquire the taste for it.

468
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,849
You have a good night, Sugar.

469
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,964
- Sheriff.
- You too, Kai.

470
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,087
Are you ever gonna tell me that story?

471
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,606
Come on, you and Proctor.

472
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,324
What would we be without our secrets?

473
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,722
Are you gonna shoot me?

474
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,604
I'm sorry.

475
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,086
I'm so, so sorry.

476
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,491
Shh.

477
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,210
Made them all myself.

478
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,528
Strawberry, pecan...

479
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,603
and this one's called triple chocolate.

480
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,445
The dark one.

481
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,124
You're not from around here,
I can tell you that much.

482
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,041
Everyone passes through here
at some point.

483
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,847
And I would have remembered you.

484
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,647
So that accent, where are you from?

485
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,251
I'd rather talk about where I am.
