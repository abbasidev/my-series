1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,447
Ana, look at me. You're gonna be fine.

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,485
Ana, listen to me.
You're going to the hospital.

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,123
You're gonna be fine. Just hold on, baby.

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,770
I need some help here! Help!
I need help!

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,006
- What happened to her?
- She was attacked.

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,004
- We got a puncture wound here.
- Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,050
She's bleeding out. Call up to Surgery.
Tell them we're coming now.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,840
- Is she gonna be okay?
- How long has she been bleeding like this?

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,649
- Uh, I don't know.
- How long?

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,723
- Uh, half an hour.
- She's crashing.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,484
All right, let's bag her and move.

12
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,008
My wife was brought in. Carrie Hopewell.

13
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,367
I'm so sorry, Mr. Hopewell.
The doctor will give...

14
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,522
You can't tell me anything else?

15
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,924
- Not at this time. I'm sorry.
- All right, thanks.

16
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,007
- She's in surgery.
- They said that you brought her in.

17
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,120
- What happened?
- I don't know. She was attacked.

18
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,686
- Attacked? By who? Where?
- I don't know.

19
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,320
- You don't know who, don't know where.
- Hey, take it easy.

20
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,568
- What exactly do you know?
- Take it easy.

21
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,408
You just happened to be the one
who found her.

22
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,929
Listen, she was outside The Forge.
Okay? That's where I live.

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,971
Yeah, I know where you live.
I'm not an idiot, Hood.

24
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,566
Whatever she's caught up in
has got something to do with you.

25
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,200
The shit that's gone on
since you've been here.

26
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,320
- If she doesn't make it...
- She's gonna make it.

27
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,850
- Shut up.
- Mr. Hopewell.

28
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,963
I'm Dr. Granger. Your wife is stable.

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,964
She's lost a good deal of blood
and she was bleeding internally...

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,009
but there doesn't seem
to be organ damage.

31
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,323
We normally have to report injuries
on this scale to the police, but...

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,051
I've already called it in.

33
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,124
- Where is she?
- She's in post-op.

34
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,328
We'll get her moved to her room
in about an hour.

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,164
Thanks.

36
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,290
Hood.

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,845
This is not over.

38
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,401
Sweet Jesus.

39
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,642
What, you've never seen
a dead body before?

40
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,571
No, I just never had you pegged
as a slumlord.

41
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,960
Would it kill you to slap a coat of paint
on this place?

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,368
Maybe get some rattan furniture,
a nice throw rug?

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,331
I remember you, motherfucker.

44
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,682
Hi.

45
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,201
Out for a swim?

46
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,522
It's beautiful out here.

47
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,611
I hope you don't mind.
I found it in the closet.

48
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,884
No.

49
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,769
Not at all.

50
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,608
She gonna make it?

51
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,605
Yeah.

52
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,361
Yeah, it looks that way.

53
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,200
I never should have left her with him.

54
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,122
Not for nothing, but she put a lot of holes
in that Ukrainian motherfucker.

55
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,805
Dude was leaking all over the place.

56
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,487
Are you just going to stand there,
or are you going to pour me a drink?

57
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,809
- I'm all out of them little umbrellas.
- Fuck you, Sugar Daddy.

58
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,850
We just buried a body together.
We tight now.

59
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,566
That bad?

60
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,484
Rabbit?

61
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,802
End of days, man.

62
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,886
So, what are you gonna do?

63
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,960
What you should do, what we both should do,
is get the fuck out of Dodge.

64
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,809
I can't.

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,765
I can't. I brought him here.

66
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,440
I led him straight to her.

67
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,680
So, then, what do we do?

68
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,488
You don't do anything.

69
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,010
You stay as far away from me as possible.

70
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,165
- Hey, now wait...
- Hey, I mean it. Both of you.

71
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,364
- And you?
- I'm gonna kill him.

72
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,043
I always meant to.

73
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,610
Olek...

74
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,922
was our brother.

75
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,881
Let's go.

76
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,610
Who are you?

77
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,447
What time is it?

78
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,968
- It's not important right now.
- Just tell me.

79
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,441
- It's around 11:30.
- What day?

80
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,841
- Jesus.
- What day is it?

81
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,002
It's Monday.

82
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,202
- The kids.
- Max is in school.

83
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,489
I let Deva have the day off
after everything that she's been through.

84
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,167
- We have to get them.
- You're in no condition to go anywhere.

85
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,731
Carrie, cut it out.

86
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,288
I know how this must seem to you,
and I'm sorry for all of it...

87
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,329
but you have to trust me right now.

88
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,289
Baby, that is a pretty
tall order right now.

89
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,886
- We're all in danger.
- You hit your head.

90
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,122
- You're not thinking straight.
- Listen to me.

91
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,650
We have to get the kids
and get out of Banshee right now.

92
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,604
- Come on.
- You're bleeding, Carrie.

93
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,205
I'm fine. Just drive.

94
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,810
I'll get Deva and be out in a minute.

95
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,204
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm going to get Max.

96
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,242
You're in no shape to drive.

97
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,549
Yeah?

98
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:52,090
Hood,
I need you to take a look at my report...

99
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,211
on that school business
and then sign off on it...

100
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,767
when you get a chance.

101
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,804
There.

102
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,166
What?

103
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,290
You shot and killed two guys,
got Xavier breathing down your neck...

104
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,967
and you better believe this report is
gonna be read as high up as he can take it.

105
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,010
If I was you, I'd wanna read every word.

106
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,083
I trust you.

107
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,202
One thing about our people,
they raise you to respect your elders.

108
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,967
Something the rest of the world
seems to have forgotten.

109
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,762
- I bought you something.
- Really?

110
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,490
Thank you.

111
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,768
Why don't you try it on after you've eaten.

112
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,683
I'd like you to come with me
to a meeting today.

113
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,641
What for?

114
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,444
I need someone I can trust.

115
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,202
You trust Burton, don't you?

116
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,802
I do, completely.
But Burton is, uh, limited.

117
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,169
You, on the other hand, are not.

118
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,167
- Mrs. Hopewell. You're awake.
- How long was I out?

119
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,290
Just a couple of minutes
would be my guess.

120
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,249
You know you're in a hospital gown?

121
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,441
Yeah.

122
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,321
I changed your bandage.
You were bleeding through.

123
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,081
This is the first time I've ever treated
one of the parents.

124
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,561
Oh, I don't think
you should be standing just yet.

125
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,683
- I've called for an ambulance.
- Thank you.

126
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,845
Mrs. Hopewell, I really think you
should wait for the ambulance.

127
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,524
Mrs. Hopewell!

128
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,522
Mrs. Hopewell?

129
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,369
Ms. Lymon, hi.

130
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,521
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I need to get Max.

131
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,642
He's at recess now.

132
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,849
- You're bleeding.
- No, that's from before.

133
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,164
Listen, I'm sorry to barge in like this.
I'm just gonna get Max and go.

134
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,042
No. No, no.

135
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,088
- Max! No! Max!
- Wait... Mrs. Hopewell.

136
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,242
No, get away from him!
He's gonna take him.

137
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,760
- Help me.
- What? What's going on?

138
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,723
He's gonna take him.

139
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,731
Max!

140
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,963
Max! Max!

141
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,121
Max! Where's Max?

142
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,489
Max. My baby. Max!

143
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,569
Max!

144
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,928
Help. Help me!

145
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,166
Okay, so I just need to be clear on this.

146
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,243
You went to the school
before Max was abducted.

147
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,482
His teacher said you saw him
sitting on a bench...

148
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,051
so you knew he was in danger.

149
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,125
- I knew he would come for him.
- Who? Who came for him?

150
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,766
You can't help me.

151
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,810
Carrie, you have to let us try.
Every second counts here.

152
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,160
- Hey.
- What, are you done at the school?

153
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,845
Yeah, the FBI took it over.

154
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,048
Excuse me. Yeah, I just heard from Xavier.

155
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,160
- They're gonna be here any minute.
- Okay. Why is she not in the hospital?

156
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,482
She raised hell when
they tried to take her.

157
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,847
It's the only thing she'd agree to do.

158
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,081
Sorry.

159
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,083
I wasn't in time.

160
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,085
It's all my fault.

161
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,440
She's in shock.
We need to get her back to the hospital.

162
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,403
They're telling me
she never even checked out.

163
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,927
I'm not going back to the hospital.

164
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,526
It's okay, deputy. I'll take it from here.

165
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,853
It just doesn't add up.

166
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:21,809
Yeah,
just give me a few minutes with her.

167
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,405
Thank you.

168
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,204
- You okay?
- It was Rabbit. He was at the playground.

169
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,089
Hey, hey, hey. He's not gonna hurt him.

170
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,160
- He's not gonna hurt Max.
- You don't know that.

171
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,680
He's using him to get to you and me.

172
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,480
- That's what he wants.
- He's gonna kill us.

173
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,985
He's not gonna kill anyone.

174
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:38,326
You have no idea what
he will or will not do!

175
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,529
I won't let anything happen
to your family.

176
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,490
I promise. I'll find Rabbit.

177
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,371
You don't have to. He's already found you.

178
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,929
Emmett, will you keep an eye
on Deva for me?

179
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,837
Sure, Gordon.

180
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:05,209
I mean it.
Do not let her out of your sight.

181
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,486
Understood.

182
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,728
I wanna talk to my wife alone.

183
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,646
Get the fuck out.

184
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,691
Who has our son, Carrie?

185
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,807
My father.

186
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,569
Your father?

187
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,447
You mean the one that died
when you were 13?

188
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,489
That father?

189
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,170
Yes.

190
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,163
Jesus Christ. Sheriff Hood.

191
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,600
What the hell happened to her?

192
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,647
Mrs. Hopewell, she was attacked yesterday.

193
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,484
And now they've grabbed her son.

194
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,240
And she was the one who was assaulted by
those bikers a few weeks ago, wasn't she?

195
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,966
- Yes.
- Has it occurred to anyone else here...

196
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,727
that Mrs. Hopewell is far and away
the unluckiest woman in Pennsylvania?

197
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,048
Obviously she's mixed up in something.

198
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,247
You think?

199
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,122
Did she get a look at whoever took the boy?

200
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,765
She may have. She's still very upset.

201
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,607
But the teacher,
she saw an older man in a dark suit.

202
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,603
I want a sketch artist
here within the hour.

203
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:39,136
And if they can't get anyone local...

204
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,242
get somebody on a goddamn chopper
from Quantico.

205
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,731
Do you have anything else for me?

206
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,560
- We're just getting into it, so...
- Yeah.

207
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,728
Deputies, could I have
your attention, please?

208
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,089
As of right now,
this is officially a federal investigation.

209
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,925
You will all brief Agent Carlson
and McAvoy...

210
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,208
on any interviews
that you've conducted thus far...

211
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,647
as well as any and all evidence
gathered at the scene.

212
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,684
I've got a team on the way here from D.C.,
but until they arrive...

213
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,723
you will be assisting us
with the legwork.

214
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,848
This is a felony kidnapping.

215
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,810
It is federal by a mile,
so do not fuck with me.

216
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,165
Until the boy is sleeping
in his bed again...

217
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,210
everyone in this room works for me.

218
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,805
Do you understand?

219
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,404
Okay.

220
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,370
I'm gonna go in
and talk to the mother now.

221
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,608
As you can see,
we haven't wasted any time getting to work.

222
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,764
At our current pace,
we're looking at a grand opening...

223
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,922
a month ahead of schedule.

224
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,162
My people are working
with the gaming commission...

225
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
to ensure our licensing
is in order by then.

226
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,603
Afternoon, gentlemen.
I hope you like what you see.

227
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,081
Excuse me a minute.

228
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,650
Proctor.

229
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,125
This is coming up nicely.
And ahead of schedule.

230
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,886
Oh, let me introduce my niece.
This is Rebecca Bowman.

231
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,931
She'll be sitting in, learning the
business. And this is Alex Longshadow.

232
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,050
Sorry, this is Chief Alex Longshadow.

233
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,441
He is the leader of the
Kinaho tribal council.

234
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,166
What are you doing here, Proctor?

235
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,369
- I thought you said you had a meeting.
- Oh, we do.

236
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,887
It's just that Alex here
forgot to mention to me...

237
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,443
that he was bringing in a new round
of potential investors for our project.

238
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,441
I don't take that personally.

239
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,683
It's just there's a give-and-take
in every partnership.

240
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,686
We're not partners.

241
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,287
I don't know how to make that any more
clear to you than I already have.

242
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,809
Now I'm gonna ask you one last time
to stay out of the tribe's business...

243
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,082
and then I'm gonna stop being polite.

244
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,802
Listen to his tone.

245
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,485
Look at his posture.

246
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,729
How certain he is
he is the one with all the power here.

247
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,121
Get out now.

248
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,405
Your father and I had a deal, Alex.
You didn't like it, I know that.

249
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,121
But you inherited it
just like you inherited all this.

250
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,448
Now, the smart thing for you to do...

251
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,889
No, the only thing for you to do
is to honor that deal.

252
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,525
- Heh.
- If you continue to think...

253
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,364
you can break your father's promises...

254
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,922
you may cause me
to rethink my own terms.

255
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,803
You know what this is?

256
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,731
It's a whistle.

257
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,929
It's a lesson in power.

258
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,562
Let's go. We're done.

259
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,207
Very nice to meet you.

260
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,888
That was fun.

261
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,130
That was a waste of our time.
I need those workers working.

262
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,361
Then why did you do it?

263
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,371
Because I promised his father
I wouldn't kill him.

264
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,205
Hey, Max. You are okay?

265
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,250
Just let me go home. I wanna see my mom.

266
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,009
Hey.

267
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,528
You don't have to be scared of me.

268
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,407
I would never hurt you.

269
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,891
I just wanna go home.

270
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,043
What is it? What's wrong?

271
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,328
I can't breathe.

272
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,642
I need my nebulizer.

273
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,963
Just calm down. Take a deep breath.

274
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,770
I can't.

275
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,769
I have asthma.

276
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,004
Door was unlocked.

277
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,291
No, it wasn't.

278
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,366
I, uh...

279
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,363
I need your help.

280
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,524
You want my help?

281
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,166
Yeah.

282
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,124
First I have to ask you something.

283
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,121
The Amish girl, Rebecca...

284
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,885
did you fuck her?

285
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,562
- What's that got to do with anything?
- She's my niece.

286
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,684
Small fucking towns.

287
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,680
- So that's a yes.
- Yeah, I didn't know she...

288
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,967
Unh. Hang on.

289
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,880
I said, hang on.

290
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,608
You had enough?

291
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,081
I think I've had enough.

292
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,930
Good.

293
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,331
So, what did you wanna talk about?

294
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,081
There are some men in town.

295
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,529
They came here for me.

296
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,363
Seems to me I'd be better off
letting these men have what they came for.

297
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,843
No. You're too smart for that.

298
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,606
Why's that?

299
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,087
Because I'll owe you one.

300
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,491
Huh.

301
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,646
One thing.

302
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,245
Rebecca, she's off-limits.

303
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,450
- Deal.
- It's not a deal.

304
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,601
It's a fact.

305
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,643
So how long have you had that stuff
buried in our backyard?

306
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,848
There are things
you don't know about me, Gordon.

307
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,651
I'm sorry. Things from my past.

308
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,041
Yeah, but you were holding that gun today.

309
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,049
Gordon, I love you...

310
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,002
but I can't do this now.

311
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,207
Max needs me.

312
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,684
Is anything about us true? About you?
Is Carrie even your real name?

313
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,929
Not now.

314
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,564
Shit.

315
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,364
Ah, here she is.

316
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,444
I bet you didn't know
your mother could handle a gun, did you?

317
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,649
She was just about your age
when I taught her.

318
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,450
Go upstairs, baby.

319
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,251
No. Stay here.

320
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,164
Leave her out of this.

321
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,049
Put the gun down.

322
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,564
Put it down!

323
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,081
Deva...

324
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,809
how old are you?

325
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,720
I'm 15.

326
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,891
- Fifteen.
- Please don't.

327
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,241
Who are you?

328
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,010
- I'm your grandfather.
- My grandfather is dead.

329
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,010
No.

330
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,207
Not yet.

331
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,291
Deva.

332
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,128
Is this him?

333
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,929
- Dad!
- Gordon, no! Gordon!

334
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,848
You tell me where my son is,
you son of a bitch.

335
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,770
Your son is missing for five hours
and you are angry and terrified.

336
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,845
My daughter was gone for 15 years.

337
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,724
Get Deva out of here.

338
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,804
Gordon. Gordon.

339
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,048
If you shoot him,
his men will slit Max's throat.

340
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,811
No!

341
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,126
Is that any way
to greet your father-in-law, Gordon?

342
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,205
Please. Please don't hurt my father.

343
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,568
This is not your father.

344
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,802
Please, don't.

345
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,247
Okay. Please...

346
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,283
can we all just sit down?

347
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,328
Like a family.

348
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,448
- Um, my brother, Max...
- All in good time.

349
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,606
Your mother has told you many lies, Deva.

350
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,004
And I think maybe she lied
to your stepfather too.

351
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,049
I don't know.

352
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,565
Look, you see?

353
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,564
Look at her face. It's true.

354
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,409
- Mom?
- I'm sorry.

355
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,251
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

356
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,244
Deva, your brother has a breathing machine.

357
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,408
- His nebulizer.
- Yes.

358
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,848
- Go get it for me, please.
- Is he having attacks?

359
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,331
He could die.

360
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,447
Then you'd better hurry.

361
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,286
Don't do this. Please.

362
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,165
Let me come with you.

363
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,008
You can do what you want with me...

364
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,926
just let me make sure he's okay.

365
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,401
He's just a little boy.

366
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,528
He's just a little boy.

367
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,247
Anastasia.

368
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,566
Yes, father?

369
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,769
Where is Olek?

370
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,761
You will get no mercy from me.

371
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,366
Let me come with you.
I can take care of him.

372
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,522
You're such a sweet girl.

373
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,289
I will see you again.

374
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,570
Hey.

375
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,328
I'm gonna kill you.

376
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,167
You already have.

377
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,969
- Jeffrey Thompson.
- Yeah?

378
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,451
You're a big fucking guy.

379
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,763
With a big fucking gambling problem.

380
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,730
Rick knows I'm good for the money.

381
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,640
Rick works for me, and it's not his call.

382
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,441
That money belongs to the Kinaho tribe,
and it's my job to safeguard that money.

383
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,682
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

384
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,808
You're into us for 46 grand.

385
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,567
Yeah, I know.

386
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,403
I made some calls.
Ours is not the only casino you play in.

387
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,764
You're into Fox Valley for 60 grand.

388
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,363
Those guys are some tough bastards.

389
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,488
I don't see that's any concern of yours.

390
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,965
It's not, but we have a working
relationship. See, we do each other favors.

391
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,485
I could wipe your slate clean.

392
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,210
And why would you wanna do that?

393
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,721
Ahem. You used to work
for Kai Proctor, right?

394
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,645
- Yeah.
- What happened?

395
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,963
- Let's just say we parted ways.
- I heard he fired you.

396
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,328
Just when you were
paying off your debt too.

397
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,802
All right, look.

398
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,891
You know you have me,
and I know you have me.

399
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,409
So just tell me what the plan is.

400
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,403
I like where your head's at, Jeffrey.

401
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,323
You look like shit.

402
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,122
Long day.

403
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,688
You know...

404
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,764
sometimes you spend so long
waiting for something...

405
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,806
it simply can't measure up
to your expectations.

406
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,088
So maybe you should just go home, huh?

407
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,286
So you're a pretend policeman now?

408
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,167
Inspired but stupid.

409
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,243
This was always the way with you.

410
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,570
Always in the moment,
blind to the consequences.

411
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,407
You'd make a terrible chess player.

412
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,564
Is this your plan? To insult me to death?

413
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,289
You spent all those years
locked up with animals.

414
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,169
Then you come here...

415
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,322
only to find she's married...

416
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,164
with a family.

417
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,684
Where's the boy, Rabbit?

418
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,285
You can't help him.

419
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,771
You're gonna kill a little boy?
Is that gonna satisfy you?

420
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,207
That's not your concern anymore.

421
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,206
Are you going to shoot me or what?

422
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,603
- I'm considering it.
- Well, decide quickly.

423
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,240
No?

424
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,649
Okay.

425
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,961
What do you want, Rabbit?

426
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,569
I just wanted to look into your eyes
for the last time.

427
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,928
To be the last face you ever saw.

428
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,129
Good-bye.

429
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,520
Oh, shit.
