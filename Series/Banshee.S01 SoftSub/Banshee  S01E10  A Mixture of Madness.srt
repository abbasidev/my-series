1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,728
Is there anything you'd like to talk about?

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,803
Not really.

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,562
Every week you just sit
in silence on that couch.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,363
- Do you know why you're here?
- I got caught.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,122
No, why you're here with me.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,161
I have to go through you to get parole.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,402
Well, in a manner of speaking.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,528
It's my job to evaluate you...

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,643
the progress of your rehabilitation.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,690
Come on, you really think anyone in here
gets rehabilitated?

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,444
I think we rehabilitate ourselves.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,327
You've been in here
for what now, seven years?

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,364
- Yeah, something like that.
- You've had your share of fights.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,648
It's kind of what we do in here.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,768
You're eligible for parole in four months.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,922
I would think a man
of your obvious intelligence...

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,447
and skill would at least
create the impression...

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,047
of cooperation with me to manipulate me
into recommending parole.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,205
Well, maybe I just know
not to bullshit a bullshitter.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,523
Fair enough. But believe it or not,
I am here to help you.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,727
Yeah, right.

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,243
I'm just another file you got to process...

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,767
before you go home to your cats.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,608
What makes you think I have cats?

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,808
Well, I know you have a cat.

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,167
Cats was a guess.

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,810
What else?

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,728
You're wearing a black bra
under a white blouse again.

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,685
It's happened before...

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,923
so it's not because you
didn't get your laundry done.

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,208
If that were the case,
you'd go with no bra.

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,842
Your tits aren't that big.

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,770
No, you deliberately
project your sexuality.

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,810
Maybe because of a recent breakup...

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,729
or a divorce.

36
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,289
Either way...

37
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,649
you get off on sitting across from men
who haven't seen a woman in years...

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,323
knowing that we're gonna go back to our
cells and rub one out thinking of you.

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,251
I mean, why else would
a woman that looks like you...

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,402
work in a place like this?

41
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,491
And, yeah, you have cats.

42
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,769
Every time you wear dark clothing
like that navy pantsuit...

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,651
that you had tailored to cling
to your ass like a second skin...

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,211
I see hairs on you.

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,689
You're exceptionally observant.

46
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,410
- Occupational hazard.
- Of a thief.

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,244
- Inmate.
- Are you gonna steal again?

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,526
- No.
- Are you sure?

49
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,808
- It's a trick question.
- Why so?

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,890
If I say no, I'm full of shit.

51
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,520
If I say yes, I don't get parole.

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,442
Not everything's a trap.

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,249
Never say that to a man
who's living in a cell.

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,609
I like you.

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,765
Isn't that against the rules?

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,926
Yes.

57
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,966
What do you want, Rabbit?

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,566
I just wanted to look into your eyes...

59
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,529
for the last time.

60
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,409
Good-bye.

61
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,321
Oh, shit.

62
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,968
I guess you owe me one.

63
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,885
Hey.

64
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,930
Go ahead.

65
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,491
I don't want to play.

66
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,849
But it will sharpen your mind...

67
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,844
teach you patience.

68
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,126
Holy...

69
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,089
shit.

70
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,731
- Emmett, check the back.
- Jesus.

71
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,609
Emmett, check the back.

72
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,289
- Hell.
- We need an ambulance.

73
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,882
Hood, talk to us. What happened here?

74
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,960
We just got here. Been out all night
looking for the kid.

75
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,361
Got three dead bodies.

76
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,966
Hood? Sheriff Hood!

77
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,126
I don't know what happened.

78
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,691
They just started shooting.

79
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,287
These are military grade M4s.

80
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,284
That's pretty high-end hardware
for this neck of the woods.

81
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,408
All I care about now is finding that boy.

82
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,245
No, that's my priority
and that's my jurisdiction.

83
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,610
In my estimation, sheriff, you've become
an impediment to this investigation.

84
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,240
I can make a phone call to a judge...

85
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,728
and have a writ within the hour
suspending you from duty.

86
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,724
Hood. Where the hell
do you think you're going?

87
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,409
If you want to stop me,
you're gonna have to shoot me.

88
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,845
Let me have your weapon.

89
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,084
- What are you looking for?
- I'll know it when I see it.

90
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,883
I can help you.
I've lived my whole life here.

91
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,800
Which explains why you haven't
grasped the concept of personal space.

92
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,251
Just tell me what you got.

93
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,803
This is from the traffic camera
at the county line yesterday morning.

94
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,889
- How do you know that's him?
- New York plates.

95
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,963
And Rabbit usually rolls four cars deep.

96
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,202
I tried calling our friendly
neighborhood sheriff...

97
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,727
to put out an APB,
but he's apparently not taking calls.

98
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,723
At least not mine.

99
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,689
I ran the plates, they're counterfeit.

100
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,649
But I ain't got no picture of them leaving.

101
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,848
- They're here.
- Think he's okay?

102
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,490
He's not okay.

103
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,411
If Rabbit's here, no one's okay.

104
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,968
I told him, man.
I said over and over again...

105
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,963
we need to get the fuck out of here.

106
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,691
This has never been anything
but a terrible idea.

107
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,320
How do we find the boy?

108
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,288
We hack into street cameras,
we look for the cars.

109
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,841
We review security footage
from mini-marts and supermarkets.

110
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,724
Someone had to do a food run.

111
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,684
We reroute spy satellites
from the CIA...

112
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,009
and look for heat signatures
where they shouldn't be.

113
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,050
This is a tiny needle
in a big motherfucking haystack.

114
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,201
Hmm.

115
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,044
There's just too much
ground to cover.

116
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,329
I need 20 men doing this
and I ain't got them.

117
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,249
It's just us two.

118
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,446
Or us three.

119
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,450
Hey, Job.

120
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,169
Long time.

121
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,561
Gang's all here.

122
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,090
Please.

123
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,887
Keep trying.

124
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,727
You know they're just here
to keep us safe.

125
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,411
Hey.

126
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,529
You okay?

127
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,205
Deva, I'm sorry about all this.

128
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,045
Why would she lie to us?

129
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,242
Everything's not going
to be all right, is it?

130
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,608
I don't know, honey.

131
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,528
I honestly don't.

132
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,162
I must admit...

133
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,245
you have an admirable
knack for survival.

134
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,523
I'm already dead.

135
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,128
- I know that.
- Yes?

136
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,721
So why do you resist?

137
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,760
You haven't offered any other options.

138
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,968
Such as?

139
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,401
Surrender.

140
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,609
You would sacrifice yourself for the boy?

141
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,165
No.

142
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,326
For all of them.

143
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,210
So...

144
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,684
finally you admit your responsibility
in all of this.

145
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,404
Yes, I do.

146
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,004
Uncle Kai?

147
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,249
- Hi.
- Hey.

148
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,449
I'm getting a glass of wine downstairs.

149
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,691
I'm actually gonna go to sleep.

150
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,204
So good night.

151
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,329
Good night, Rebecca.

152
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,006
Agh! Unh.

153
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,120
Who sent you?

154
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,207
Fucking Indians.

155
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,767
Go help your uncle.

156
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,369
You've been in a fight.

157
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,928
Just a misunderstanding.

158
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,082
Do you want to tell me about it?

159
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,208
Someone had a crush on me.

160
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,362
I just wanted to be friends.

161
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,129
- Are we done?
- Not quite.

162
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,526
- Must be exhausting.
- Agh.

163
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,284
What?

164
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,407
Being on guard 24 hours a day.

165
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,642
Wondering where the next
attack is gonna come from.

166
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,609
Can you ever rest?

167
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,409
I've been looking at your
initial police report.

168
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,806
There were two of you in that building.

169
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,370
The police said that you
made it as far as the woods...

170
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,881
where your chance of escape
would be much greater...

171
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,044
but yet you turned around. Why?

172
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,649
Your accomplice...

173
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,209
it was a woman.

174
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,531
These sessions are confidential
and inadmissible in court.

175
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,842
You can't incriminate her.

176
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,206
You must have loved her very much.

177
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,451
And you haven't seen
or heard from her since?

178
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,602
I'm so sorry.

179
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,170
You okay?

180
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,245
Yeah.

181
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,163
So where you been?

182
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,923
You know, around.

183
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,283
Will you stay for a while...

184
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,802
now that he's gone?

185
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,608
I could really use you.

186
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,121
Well, that's not really
my bag, big brother.

187
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,006
Ugh.

188
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,124
Well, this is interesting.

189
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,930
Oh, that motherfucker!

190
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,090
This is my home.

191
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,764
So you're upset that the man...

192
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,491
who cut off the head
of the guy you sent to kill him...

193
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,961
isn't respecting your privacy?

194
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,329
What's this?

195
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,009
It's one of ours.

196
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,605
I'm thinking...

197
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,804
maybe I will stick around for a while.

198
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,131
This man will take you home, Max.

199
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,525
It's okay, Max.

200
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,280
Hey.

201
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,048
No one's gonna hurt you.

202
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,850
Go.

203
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,570
You trusted me to keep my word?

204
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,524
You always have.

205
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,847
Your call has
been directed to an automated voice-mail...

206
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,804
- Still no answer.
- Keep trying.

207
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,330
It's okay.

208
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,090
Gordon.

209
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,771
Sugar.

210
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,763
What are you doing here?

211
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,891
We got Max back.

212
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,122
What? What do you mean? How is he?

213
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,363
He's safe. He and Deva are with the FBI.

214
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,808
- He came home a little while ago.
- How?

215
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,765
He just rang the doorbell.
Said that they

216
00:24:33,777 --> 00:24:35,726
dropped him off a block
away from the house.

217
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,080
Uh... I don't understand.

218
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,329
What do you mean? They just...?

219
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,166
They just dropped him off just like that?

220
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,368
No, not just like that.

221
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,000
Your father told him to tell you something.

222
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,971
What?

223
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,882
He said that you were forgiven.

224
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,330
- Hood.
- Max said they have him.

225
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,649
- He traded himself for Max.
- I don't understand why Hood...

226
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,565
- Would think that that's something...
- His cell phone.

227
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,641
- What?
- I got a tracker on his cell phone.

228
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,406
- There you are.
- What is that? Where is that?

229
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,086
The Bottoms near the North Valley Woods.

230
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,120
What the fuck are the Bottoms?
What's out there?

231
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,005
Heh, well, nothing that I can think of.

232
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,249
Wait.

233
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,448
The metalworks.

234
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,600
We've been here all day
looking at these maps...

235
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,722
moving satellites around
in outer fucking space.

236
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,723
And then he says,
"Wait, wait, the metalworks."

237
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,565
Well, the Bottoms aren't on most maps.

238
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,246
Is that it? Is that it right there?

239
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,566
Yeah.

240
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,804
What are you doing?

241
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,402
You call the FBI
and you let them handle this.

242
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,005
- I can't.
- You have to.

243
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,407
Now, I don't know what
Hood's role in all this is...

244
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,531
but we have two children whose lives
have been turned upside down.

245
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,321
Now, nothing and no one else
is more important than that.

246
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,406
Come on, man. Come on.

247
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,928
Now, you lied to me.

248
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,601
You lied to our kids.

249
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,480
I don't know if you can
ever make that right, but if...

250
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,051
If you're gonna try...

251
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,328
you need to come home
with me right now.

252
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,802
Gordon, don't do this.

253
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,320
Don't make me choose.

254
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,450
You go with them,
you're making that choice yourself.

255
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,529
Um, what are you doing?

256
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,729
Look, I've seen you drive. Get in.

257
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,646
We're probably gonna die.

258
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,364
Probably.

259
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,206
If we do die...

260
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,643
I just want you to know
I don't like you very much.

261
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,170
Duly noted.

262
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,129
Well, if you're going to drive, then drive.

263
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,647
I want to be dead or home by morning.

264
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,163
Just drive.

265
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,564
So your parole hearing is in two weeks.

266
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,569
Do you feel ready?

267
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,610
Uh, yeah, yeah. I think so.

268
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,491
I know you're ready to get out of here.

269
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,804
You think they'll let me out?

270
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,128
You present as intelligent and capable...

271
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,567
as remorseful and articulate.

272
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,961
Plus, you have the single
best psych eval ever written...

273
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,248
in the history
of the prison system, so...

274
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,690
Thank you.

275
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,971
I just wish...

276
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,126
What?

277
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,169
Ah, nothing.

278
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,960
- Come on, what?
- Nothing, no. I'm sorry.

279
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,240
- I forgot myself for a moment.
- It's our last session.

280
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,129
You're never gonna see me again.

281
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,925
Um, I was gonna say I just wish...

282
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,209
we had met under
different circumstances.

283
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,441
I know it's pathetic, cliché.

284
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,410
No, no. It's not.

285
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,483
Um, you saved me in here.

286
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,324
Are you scared?

287
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,084
Terrified.

288
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,406
Are you gonna see Ana
when you get out?

289
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,771
Uh, yeah.

290
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,244
Yeah, I've got a few places
I think I can, uh...

291
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,330
look for her.

292
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,923
- Who are you?
- What?

293
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,167
Who the fuck are you?

294
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,126
I never told you her name.

295
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,166
Mr. Rabbit has a message for you.

296
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,725
Mr. Rabbit says there'll be no parole.

297
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,446
You will serve out the
remaining eight years.

298
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,604
And he wants you to know that when
you do get out, he'll be waiting for you.

299
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,770
There's nowhere you can go
that he won't find you.

300
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,244
Aah! Help me!

301
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,802
Guard, help me!

302
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,568
- Get off! Get off!
- Oh, God!

303
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,609
It's funny being here with you.

304
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,289
I think of all that time
we were together...

305
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,163
the three of us.

306
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,411
We were a family.

307
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,967
Aw, don't kid yourself.

308
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,842
We were never a family.

309
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,368
Me and Ana, we were family.

310
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,525
Not you.

311
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,002
I think maybe we both
kid ourselves sometimes.

312
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,850
Oh, fuck you.

313
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,651
You betrayed me for love.

314
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,251
Then you got out of prison
to find your love had betrayed you.

315
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,449
And then a few days ago...

316
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,126
she barters your life for her own.

317
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,328
My daughter is better at punishing you
than I could ever be.

318
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,489
However...

319
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,606
a man can still try.

320
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,890
Oh, wow.

321
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,886
What is it?

322
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,371
Shit. I don't know.

323
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,969
Shit!

324
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,690
Were you speeding?

325
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,604
I knew I shouldn't have let you drive.

326
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,643
Evening, folks.

327
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,520
Mrs. Hopewell,
I don't know if you heard yet, but, uh...

328
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,201
- Your son turned up safe.
- I know. Thank you.

329
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,044
And, uh...

330
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,484
you, uh...

331
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,001
You three are clearly
not going to a PTA meeting.

332
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,889
Can you step out of the car, Mrs. Hopewell?

333
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,210
There.

334
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,171
That's better, right?

335
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,084
You took my only daughter from me.

336
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,201
There are no words to express the pain.

337
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,211
The rage I feel.

338
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,802
Oh, believe me...

339
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,720
she couldn't get away
from you fast enough.

340
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,361
She hated you...

341
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,964
more than she ever loved me.

342
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,324
You're right.

343
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,051
I took your little girl.

344
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,524
And there is nothing...

345
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,927
that you can do to me...

346
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,844
that can ever change that.

347
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,243
At least I can watch you
pay for your betrayal.

348
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,920
Why don't you shut the fuck up
and get on with it?

349
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,610
We got the call. What's going on?

350
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,411
Yeah, she's telling me
that Hood has been kidnapped...

351
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,848
- By the same guys that took her son.
- He wasn't kidnapped.

352
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,002
He traded himself for Max.

353
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,881
And they're gonna kill him
if I don't get over there.

354
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,088
If Hood is in trouble,
why wouldn't you call us?

355
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,680
- I can't involve you.
- An abduction and you can't involve...

356
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,966
the sheriff's department?

357
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,044
- That's kind of strange, don't you think?
- You think that's strange?

358
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,726
Take a look at who she called instead.

359
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,365
Oh, and, uh, Mrs. Hopewell
was strapped with these.

360
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,363
Two Springfield DX9s.

361
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,521
You want to tell us what
the hell's going on?

362
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,200
The man who has Hood
is a gangster named Rabbit.

363
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,209
He and I have a history.

364
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,728
It's me he's here for.
That's why he took Max.

365
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,446
He's got a small army with him
and he's not gonna think twice...

366
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,400
about killing you or me
or anyone else who gets in his way.

367
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,890
Well, what were you and the A-Team
over here planning to do?

368
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,682
He's going to kill him.
He may already have.

369
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,242
- Please, we are wasting time right now.
- This... This is crazy.

370
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,363
Sorry, I don't...

371
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,805
- You're the sheriff.
- I know I am.

372
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,524
- What?
- If it was you they had...

373
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,207
or any one of us,
what do you think Hood would do?

374
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,891
Shit.

375
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,489
I don't care what kind
of gangsters they are.

376
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,086
They picked the wrong fucking town.

377
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,570
Well, all right.

378
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,450
- You sure about this?
- Do I look sure?

379
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,201
Gregor, tell the men to start packing up.

380
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,805
We're leaving soon.

381
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,326
When I was a teenager...

382
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,691
I found two boys in a field.

383
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,601
They had tied a stray dog to a tree...

384
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,441
and they were beating it with sticks.

385
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,331
He was badly hurt, bleeding.

386
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,567
His front leg was broken.

387
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,443
After I finished with the boys...

388
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,962
I decided I would care for the dog.

389
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,731
But when I went to untie him...

390
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,008
he bit my leg.

391
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,646
The dog meant me no harm.

392
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,485
He was acting on instinct. I knew that.

393
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,883
But I also knew I had to kill him.

394
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,921
Because I, too...

395
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,411
was acting on instinct.

396
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,566
We're all animals, really.

397
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,844
Gentlemen.

398
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,685
Hmm.

399
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,005
Who the fuck are you?

400
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,285
I'm going to need you
to open this here gate.

401
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,165
This is private property. No one enters.

402
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,609
Oh, honey, if I had a dollar
for every time I heard that.

403
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,529
Now open the motherfucking gate.

404
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,084
- Fuck you.
- Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?

405
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,891
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo.

406
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,041
My bad.

407
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,210
Nice shooting.

408
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,771
I've been taking lessons.

409
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,691
I should have killed you 15 years ago.

410
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,804
But there was a part of me
that hoped that you'd...

411
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,849
Both of you.

412
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,764
Would change your minds.

413
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,804
All right, hold up. Hold up.

414
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,162
The only entrance to this place
is on the other side.

415
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,924
We're gonna be outnumbered
and outgunned.

416
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,447
We have to surprise them.
I'll create a diversion.

417
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,807
You guys go up front and
wait for my signal.

418
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,806
- And then what? What's your plan?
- Save Hood, shoot everybody else.

419
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,363
Like you, I was blinded by love.

420
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,844
No.

421
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,485
This isn't about love.

422
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,606
We spent two years...

423
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,764
figuring out how to fuck you over.

424
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,928
And we did.

425
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,288
That's why you're angry.

426
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,684
Because you got played.

427
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,169
So do me a favor.

428
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,891
Stop whining...

429
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,281
about fucking love.

430
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,608
You don't know what love is.

431
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,363
You're wrong.

432
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,288
- Unh!
- This...

433
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,125
- Is love.
- Agh.

434
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,402
- Agh!
- Go now! Go, go!

435
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,681
Fuck!

436
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,080
- Agh!
- Sugar!

437
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,365
Sugar!

438
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,646
Go!

439
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,401
I knew she'd come for you.

440
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,767
Now she can watch you die.

441
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,607
Unh! Yes!

442
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,206
Aah!

443
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,883
- Brock!
- Aah!

444
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,811
- Motherfucker!
- Brook's hit.

445
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,321
I know. There's no way I can get to him.
He's too far away.

446
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,448
Go around and I'll cover you.

447
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,765
Left and right, flanking pattern.

448
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,967
I've got the center.

449
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,962
I'm running out of ammo!

450
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,082
Goddamn it! Emmett!

451
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,086
Agh!

452
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,921
- Shit, I'm running out.
- Unh.

453
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,006
How you doing?

454
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,767
Oh, fuck, that hurts.

455
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,489
- Sugar?
- He's okay. He's over there.

456
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,926
I'm fine.

457
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,045
- Did we win?
- We didn't lose.

458
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,082
Suck my tit.

459
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,408
- Unh!
- Agh!

460
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,891
Stay away from him.

461
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,367
I forgave you.

462
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,129
I gave you back your son.

463
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,051
Well, I never forgave you.

464
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,843
So, what now...

465
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,289
clever girl?

466
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,766
Good-bye, Daddy.

467
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,682
Hey. Let me see you.

468
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,569
- Unh.
- Oh, God.

469
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,404
Oh, my God.

470
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,289
My God.

471
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,881
Max?

472
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,691
He's safe. He's okay.

473
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,604
Next time, I say we just run away.

474
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,650
Hang on, okay?

475
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,323
I missed you.

476
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,171
Buck. Buck.

477
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,241
Bucky.

478
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,410
Buck.

479
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,526
Hey, boss.

480
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,003
Listen, Janie.

481
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,921
I'm sorry that I've been so distant.

482
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,851
You know, I've just been so obsessed
with taking down Proctor.

483
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,082
I never meant to shut you out.

484
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,770
He's everywhere, you know?

485
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,400
I worked with the Kinaho
to try to get this new casino built...

486
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,244
and now he has his hands in that, too.

487
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,402
That's the hotel.

488
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,804
And on the northern side
will be the casino.

489
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,162
That's why Longshadow wanted you killed?

490
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,401
Yeah.

491
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,170
So now what?

492
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,084
Well, I could just get rid of Alex...

493
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,084
but that would create
a power vacuum within the tribe...

494
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,050
and there's no telling
who would take over.

495
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,841
Better let Alex understand
who his friends are.

496
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,843
And how do we do that?

497
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,366
We could start with a phone call.

498
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,728
You just hit send.

499
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,010
Hello?

500
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,246
Is anyone here?

501
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,327
Well, I guess we'll have to settle
for leaving a message.

502
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,803
Any word on Rabbit?

503
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,571
The FBI turned the woods upside down.

504
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,527
Full-on search grids, dogs, the works.

505
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,730
So far, the theory is that he crawled
into a hole somewhere and died.

506
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,930
Hey.

507
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,930
- They'll find him.
- Yeah.

508
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,970
There. Heh.

509
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,645
Now that's what a sheriff looks like.

510
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,169
Uh, when do you have to change it again?

511
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,171
Tomorrow.

512
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,561
All right, then.

513
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,529
I'll see you tomorrow.

514
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,245
Thanks.

515
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,931
Deputy Yawners.

516
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,000
Agent Xavier.

517
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,965
One of the two active officers of the BSD.

518
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,242
How long you plan to keep us on a leash?

519
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,760
I don't like this any better than you do.
All right?

520
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,486
But Sheriff Hood,
his behavior throughout all this...

521
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,689
has been somewhere between
highly questionable and outright criminal.

522
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,290
And what went down at the metalworks...

523
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,488
that's gonna take some time to soft out.

524
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,211
The Bureau is assigning
a special investigator.

525
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,126
Look, in the meantime, you're just gonna
have to deal with federal oversight.

526
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,806
So...

527
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,763
never a dull moment around here, huh?

528
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,006
Couple of hunters found them this morning.

529
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,925
Based on the level of decomposition,
the coroner's ballparking it...

530
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,651
at 10 to 12 weeks
since they were killed.

531
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,842
Who might you be?

532
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,608
Church County Sheriff's Department.

533
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,287
Hi, uh, it's Jason Hood.

534
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,841
I was wondering if you had heard
from my old man at all.

535
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,130
