1
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,364
Come this way, come this way.

2
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,204
Turn over.

3
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,561
Mm.

4
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,325
Mm.

5
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,211
- You good?
- Mm-hm.

6
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,761
Was it okay for you?

7
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,571
Yeah, of course.

8
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,051
Are you sure?
You're usually a little more animated.

9
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,202
It was a quiet one.

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,731
Well, that's no fun.

11
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,645
Come on, let's see
if we can make some noise, huh?

12
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,441
Ha, ha. Oh, honey.

13
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,728
It's okay.

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,690
Honey, not now.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,604
What is it?

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,689
Nothing. I'm just...
I'm just a little spent.

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,885
You're sure there's nothing wrong?

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,690
It's fine.

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,131
I'm gonna grab a glass of water.

20
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,284
Fuck!

21
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,647
Hello. Where's my fucking money?

22
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,485
- I'm in a bit of a bind.
- And you're calling me.

23
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,405
Am I the only one detecting a pattern here?

24
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,085
I'm on a take. I got boxed.

25
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,641
- Where are you?
- State Museum, Harrisburg.

26
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,691
State Museum.
How the mighty have fallen.

27
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,850
I'll bet she could suck the chrome off
a trailer hitch.

28
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,729
It's a Modigliani exhibit.

29
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,884
I don't know which I find harder to
believe, that there's a Modigliani...

30
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,805
in Harrisburg or that you got boxed
in a State Museum.

31
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,122
There was no box
in the schematics, Job.

32
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,851
Well, not in the ones
you were looking at, baby.

33
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,571
Oh, look, the alarm's got a dialer.

34
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,121
- State police are responding.
- Six minutes. Ha, ha.

35
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,368
I'm telling you, you should ask her out.

36
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,649
Job, I can barely hear you.
Can you turn this shit off?

37
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,850
- Is it off?
- Yeah.

38
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,010
Then I'm in there with you.
And I'm gonna get you out.

39
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,924
Okay. Is there a manual release?

40
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,084
Not one that you can reach
without a blowtorch.

41
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,368
- What's behind these walls?
- Solid stone.

42
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,761
Someone knew what they were doing.

43
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,731
Hold on a second.

44
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,810
- Hello?
- Oh.

45
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,484
I figured I'd get your voice mail.

46
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,361
- I keep odd hours.
- We need to talk.

47
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,170
Now is not really an ideal time.

48
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,961
Really? Well, it's the middle of the night
and I'm sneaking out to my backyard...

49
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,088
because I haven't slept
since you showed up.

50
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,402
You're putting me and my family at risk.

51
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,130
Hold on.

52
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,841
- Job.
- I know you did not just take a call...

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,162
while I'm trying to save
your pasty, dumb ass.

54
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,766
- Where are the cops, Job?
- Three minutes away.

55
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,771
I am looking for an override.

56
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,365
Look harder!

57
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,049
Hey, mama, you suck any dick yet tonight?

58
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,004
Yeah, like... Like maybe your own?

59
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,850
Well, yeah, yeah.

60
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,765
Wait, do you ever get bored
and tit-fuck yourself?

61
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,760
Ooh, she's getting pissy.

62
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,366
- Oh, yeah.
- I think she's upset.

63
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,490
- I'll be right back.
- What?

64
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,210
Job!

65
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,010
Oh, we pissed him off.

66
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,889
Oh, yeah, we did piss her off.

67
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,724
I think she likes you.

68
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,689
Hey, sweetie.

69
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,963
Sit your bitch-asses down.

70
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,244
Now I am going back to my table.

71
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,169
And the next one of you
that gets up out of this booth...

72
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,011
is gonna be pissing sitting down
for the rest of his life.

73
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,726
It's Zack's Diner,
just off the interstate...

74
00:07:59,738 --> 00:08:01,206
Oh, sure, narc on a sister.

75
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,601
She... I mean, he has a knife.

76
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,240
- Job!
- Now we both on the clock.

77
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,402
Yeah, I'll be right back.

78
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,800
Ana.

79
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,961
It's Carrie.

80
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,043
Listen, we're gonna have to talk
some other time.

81
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,123
I don't wanna have another conversation
with you.

82
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,044
You need to stop this
for both of our sakes.

83
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,201
Hold on.

84
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,203
Job, I need this door open now!

85
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,364
Job? You're talking to Job?

86
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,005
Jesus Christ, you're on a take?

87
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,685
Listen, I'm in a jam.

88
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,443
You're on a take. Oh, my God.

89
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,365
I got boxed. Fuck.

90
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,526
Okay.

91
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,168
Okay.

92
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,810
It's okay.

93
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,246
Just breathe.

94
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,530
Now, where are you?

95
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,370
State Museum, Harrisburg.

96
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,922
It's okay. Job will back-door it.

97
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,889
Get back to him now.

98
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,088
Okay.

99
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,490
Job, I hear sirens.

100
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,085
One second.

101
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,081
I've got an override.

102
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,290
Nothing's happening. Come on.

103
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,886
- Wait for it.
- Come on!

104
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,570
Now would be good.

105
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,125
Done.

106
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,569
Dispatch, please advise
we're sweeping the east hallway.

107
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,440
Ladies.

108
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,966
Bitches.

109
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,041
Miller, that you?

110
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,565
Shots fired!

111
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,725
Suspect is on the move on foot,
heading down North Street to 83rd.

112
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,884
He's wearing Miller's badge.

113
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,441
Unit 3, respond.

114
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,688
Right there! Right there!

115
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,887
Cover the entrance!

116
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,568
Start moving through here.

117
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,727
Over there!

118
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,001
We got the exits. He's got nowhere to go.

119
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,286
Over there! Go! Go!

120
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,011
Move! Move! I see him.

121
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,684
I like that.

122
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,485
On three!

123
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,961
One, two...

124
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,970
three, three, three!

125
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,605
- Hi.
- Hi.

126
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,171
How much does he know?

127
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,006
Don't worry about Sugar.

128
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,810
He's one of us.

129
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,371
There is no us.

130
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,242
That was some solid driving.

131
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,368
You're still sharp.

132
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,768
Hey, I didn't ask you to come, you know?

133
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,649
I didn't do it for you.

134
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,167
If you go down,
we both end up on Rabbit's radar.

135
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,129
Well, I guess we're in it together, then.

136
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,848
This is my life you're risking.

137
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,095
I had it handled.

138
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,846
Yeah,
everything was going right on schedule.

139
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,570
- Mm-hm.
- Ha, ha.

140
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,966
What is it with you?

141
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,007
You're still the same reckless
thrill junkie you were 15 years ago.

142
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,208
This whole sheriff thing you're doing...

143
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,567
it's one long bungee
jump without a cord.

144
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,748
You're not so different.

145
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,520
I'm not risking
everything for the thrill.

146
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,927
I wasn't the one driving the getaway car.

147
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,086
- Shut up.
- I'm serious.

148
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,527
So am I. Shut the fuck up.

149
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,369
What, sheriff wasn't good enough?

150
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,885
Now you want to be a state-y?

151
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,963
I had to improvise.

152
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,929
You get the painting?

153
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,922
Once a job goes south...

154
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,650
always leave the take behind.

155
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,649
So all that work for nothing.

156
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,810
Maybe not.

157
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,327
What?

158
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,170
Nothing.

159
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,002
- Sheriff.
- Miss Moody.

160
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,605
Kat.

161
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,284
Are we on a first-name basis now?

162
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,442
The Moody boys are gunning for you.

163
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,604
You killed their brother
and they're not gonna let that sit.

164
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,561
Why would you warn me?

165
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,084
- That's not the right question.
- What is, then?

166
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,449
The question is why aren't you scared?

167
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,967
You have a good morning, Kat.

168
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,208
- What was that about?
- Just a friendly chat.

169
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,283
With the widow of the man you killed?

170
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,720
Yeah.

171
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,848
I'm funny that way.

172
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,606
Sheriff, you, uh, sure you wanna be...

173
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,728
showing up to work looking like that?

174
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,247
Pick your battles, Brock.

175
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,731
All right, fine.

176
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,690
Tell it to the senator.
He's in your office.

177
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,328
Senator Schumacher.

178
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,201
There's a lacrosse stick in my bed.

179
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,760
Excuse me?

180
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,887
Syracuse, Hopkins...

181
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,805
all the schools were all after Reed...

182
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,646
offering him full rides.

183
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,927
He was lightning on the field.

184
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,841
Now he's dead, and my wife...

185
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,484
she's got his lacrosse
stick in our bed...

186
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,447
holding onto it every
night as she cries.

187
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,251
I'm sorry for your loss.

188
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,811
I'm not here for your sympathy.

189
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,250
I want justice.

190
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,565
You made enough arrests
that ATF has practically closed the case...

191
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,963
never mind that this guy Hanson
seems to have disappeared into thin air.

192
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,885
- It's federal jurisdiction.
- Fuck jurisdiction!

193
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,287
This happened in your town, Sheriff Hood.

194
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,802
His blood is on your hands.

195
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,371
You sleep with that in your bed.

196
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,521
Alma, get me the number of the high school.

197
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,523
Who are you looking for again?

198
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,082
Your telling us about Hanson was helpful...

199
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,969
but he's disappeared.

200
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,691
So we're looking for anyone else
that might have been involved...

201
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,804
someone who might be able
to lead us to Hanson...

202
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,486
or tell us where that bad E came from.

203
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,728
Hanson was getting his
stuff from somewhere.

204
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,330
God, how can one town
have so many scumbags?

205
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,771
Hey, him.

206
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,562
- I know him.
- You know him how?

207
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,327
Hanson and his guys
beat the crap out of this guy.

208
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,609
I don't know why,
but it was the day before the rave.

209
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,529
Arno Webber. I played Pop Warner with him.

210
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,286
He's pretty small-time,
but no stranger to the penal system.

211
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,965
He lives over in Hitler's Bunker.

212
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,326
Hitler's Bunker?

213
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,960
Some run-down apartments
where the Aryan Nation guys hang out.

214
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,130
What the hell is this?

215
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,965
You have no right to bring her in here
without asking me.

216
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,043
Chillax, Mom. I'm not in trouble.

217
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,770
Deva was just helping us with...

218
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,003
If you want to see or speak to my daughter,
you ask me first.

219
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,129
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopewell.

220
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,808
Come on, baby, let's go.

221
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,883
Not for nothing, Mom...

222
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,082
but we're trying to catch a murderer.

223
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,401
Now.

224
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,244
Deva.

225
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,204
Thanks for your help.

226
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,088
Sure. I hope you catch the asshole.

227
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,489
So, what was all that with you
and Mrs. Hopewell?

228
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,449
She had a point, I guess.

229
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,126
That was it, huh?

230
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,489
- This the place?
- Yep.

231
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,964
This is where the master race
collect their unemployment checks.

232
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,886
They seem angry.

233
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,048
They don't like to see
a black man with a badge...

234
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,770
stepping into their white world.

235
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,883
- Oh.
- What you doing here, man?

236
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,486
Hey, it's okay, guys. He's one of us.

237
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,529
His wife is white.

238
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,368
- Nice.
- Just saying.

239
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,643
- That's Arno's door.
- Hey, cop!

240
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,963
What the fuck you doing here?

241
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,563
Whatever the fuck I want.

242
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,686
I'll go see Arno.

243
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,568
You stay here with the Hitler Youth.

244
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,930
Hey, Arno.

245
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,602
You stay the fuck back!

246
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,762
Penn State, right?
You're that all-star nigger running back.

247
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,328
Aah! Okay! Okay! Fuck, what do you want?

248
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,130
Why'd you run? Why'd you run?

249
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,281
Instinct, man.

250
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,084
Looking for a guy named Hanson.
Seems to have gone off the grid.

251
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,571
I'm not telling you shit.

252
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,450
Oh, God!

253
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,447
You're a two-time loser, Arno.

254
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,807
What are we gonna find
if we toss your apartment, huh?

255
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,281
- Ha, ha.
- Possession? An attempt to distribute?

256
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,771
Get a warrant, motherfucker.

257
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,922
- Wrong answer.
- Oh, God!

258
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,001
Off the grid. Ha, ha.

259
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,489
You wanna see Hanson?

260
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,167
Well, there he is.

261
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,040
That's Hanson's hand?

262
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,043
Fucking Addams Family, right?

263
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,445
How do you know it's Hanson?

264
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,926
From the tat, man.

265
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,643
I inked him myself.

266
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,009
- A crab?
- He was a Cancer, man.

267
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,162
He was into all this astrology shit.

268
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,604
- Where'd you get it?
- That I can't tell you.

269
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,604
Okay, then you're going down
for Hanson's murder.

270
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,489
What the fuck, man? I'm helping you.

271
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,642
No. You're annoying me.

272
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,845
Where'd you get the goddamn hand?

273
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,361
Okay, okay.

274
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,888
I work at the slaughterhouse
on the killing floor, all right?

275
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,125
Cleaning and shit.

276
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,887
Well, one day last week,
I sneak in a few pops on the job...

277
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,045
get a little loaded,
and fall asleep behind some crates.

278
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,044
I wake up around midnight, hearing things.

279
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,249
I peek out and there's
the boss himself...

280
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,291
and that weird, quiet dude
with the bow ties...

281
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,528
carrying something wrapped up in a tarp.

282
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,411
I hid while they fed it to the shredder.

283
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,087
And when they left,
I found that down in the blood gutter.

284
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,850
I kept it.

285
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,970
Kind of like insurance.

286
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,687
- You saw Proctor himself?
- Yeah, I did.

287
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,366
- And you'll testify?
- Fuck, no!

288
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,249
I'm kind of addicted to breathing.

289
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,289
- I can help you with that.
- Wait, wait.

290
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,169
This is bullshit. It's bullshit.

291
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,765
Proctor would never do it himself.

292
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,570
- Cuff him.
- No, man! Wait, wait, wait!

293
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,411
- Hey!
- Check it out! Check it out!

294
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,645
Uh, modern technology don't lie.

295
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,082
And the Oscar for Best Picture goes to...

296
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,169
Arno Webber!

297
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,650
You guys are gonna protect me, right?

298
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,686
You're a good citizen, Arno.

299
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,120
Dude, seriously, man,
you gotta keep my name out of this.

300
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,241
He'll kill me.

301
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,280
What a loss that would be
to the Nazi gene pool.

302
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,404
- We'll be in touch. Stay by the phone.
- You just took my fucking phone.

303
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,643
- Then stay here.
- Ugh.

304
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,929
Jesus Christ.

305
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,329
And you confirmed the hand's Hanson's?

306
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,084
Prints match.

307
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,841
So we don't get Proctor
for drugs or racketeering...

308
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,890
but we get him on murder
of one of his own.

309
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,650
Guess there's a poetry to that.

310
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,450
So we good to go?

311
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,365
Well, it's not a slam dunk,
but it's actionable.

312
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,681
Okay, then.

313
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,121
Get your, uh...
Get your witness locked up tight.

314
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,284
When his name goes to the grand jury,
he'll be an endangered species.

315
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,841
You got it. Thanks.

316
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,971
Sheriff, could I have a moment?

317
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,602
- It's good to see you, Gordon.
- Yeah, you, too. Thanks, Emmett.

318
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,242
So this guy Webber, Deva identified him?

319
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,243
- Yeah.
- Okay.

320
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,529
But that's as far
as her involvement here goes.

321
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,881
I don't see why it needs to go further.

322
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,208
My wife was pretty pissed.

323
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,528
Well, I'm sorry about that.

324
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,405
Poor judgment on my part.

325
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,164
Don't get me wrong. I get it.

326
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,891
The case was getting cold and...

327
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,802
I appreciate what you did for my daughter.
Carrie and I both do.

328
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,851
I just... I need to keep
Deva safe, you know?

329
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,923
She's only 15.

330
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,450
I understand.

331
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,970
Okay.

332
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,450
So, uh, go get him, huh?

333
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,491
What are you thinking?

334
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,768
I'm thinking
we should have brought backup.

335
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,888
You are the backup.

336
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,330
Sheriff, deputy.

337
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,683
What can I do for you?

338
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,965
You're under arrest.

339
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,365
What for?

340
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,246
Murder.

341
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,245
Who did I kill?

342
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,323
Christopher Hanson.

343
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,450
Yeah. I haven't seen Hanson
in quite some time.

344
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,007
Yeah, that's one of the side effects
of killing someone.

345
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,569
It saddens me that you continue
to hold me in such low regard.

346
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,131
You'll get over it.

347
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,164
Can we get on with this?
You stay right there.

348
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,410
Can we get on with this?

349
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,450
So, Sheriff Hood...

350
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,206
how are you finding the job so far?

351
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,207
Never a dull moment, Kai.

352
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,443
Yeah, you've been kind of busy
since you got here.

353
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,605
I imagine things were a bit quieter in...
Where was it, Oregon?

354
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,090
Deputy Yawners mentioned
your right to remain silent.

355
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,368
Oh, come on, sheriff.

356
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,321
If you're going to be arresting me
every time someone shows up dead...

357
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,121
- We might as well get to know each other.
- I already know...

358
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,327
Come on.

359
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,722
- Where's Emmett?
- The deputy fell out of the car.

360
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,167
We got no business with him.

361
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,891
If he's hurt and you just left him...

362
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,211
Right about now I'd be worried
about my own ass if I was you.

363
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,482
I got to admit...

364
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,367
didn't count on Proctor being with you.

365
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,965
Two birds, one stone.

366
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,924
Our lucky day.

367
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,690
I don't think so, Marcus.

368
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,410
You don't think so?

369
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,410
You knocked every one
of my brother's teeth out.

370
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,246
Looked like a fucking baby
when he opened his mouth.

371
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,687
Yeah, and he cried like a baby too.

372
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,491
Now I'm gonna take your teeth out...

373
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,530
one by one...

374
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,448
real surgical.

375
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,649
Then we'll see who's crying.

376
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,167
What the fuck you laughing at?

377
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,891
A dead man making threats.

378
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,869
Marcus, we need to talk about this.
You

379
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:07,005
didn't say nothing about
messing with Proctor.

380
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,366
Shut up, Dex!

381
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,205
We get the sheriff, that's fair.
An eye for an eye.

382
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,522
But Proctor? We got families.

383
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,927
What about our brother's family?

384
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,970
Huh? What about Cole's kids?

385
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,202
You didn't say nothing
about messing with Proctor.

386
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,489
We got Proctor in the deal!

387
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,560
God was just saving us a trip.

388
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,210
Get him up.

389
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,761
Get him up!

390
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,283
Get him up, Goddamn it!

391
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,971
Motherfucker!

392
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,088
You tore my fucking ear off!

393
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,527
Stop!

394
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,288
What, are you gonna kill a cop, Dex?

395
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,566
Huh?

396
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,087
I mean, how do you see this playing out?

397
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,571
Shut up.

398
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,200
What, you're...? You're gonna kill us both?

399
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,005
And then just go home...

400
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,846
kick back, fry up some fucking venison?

401
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,606
- I said shut up!
- No, you listen to me!

402
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,404
I was taking Proctor in
when you guys showed up...

403
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,601
and that's what I'm gonna do.
You and your brothers...

404
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,481
you came out for some redneck justice.
I get that.

405
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,361
But you got only one shot
at getting out of this.

406
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,966
That's the one I'm giving you right now.

407
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,884
Go home.

408
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,286
Take your brothers. You do it now...

409
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,410
- I might forget this ever happened.
- You'll let us go?

410
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,001
How do I know you're not bullshitting me?

411
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,243
If I was, you'd already be dead.

412
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,289
I meant what I said.

413
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,764
Get the fuck out of here.

414
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,769
No, no, no. Sorry, boys.

415
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,201
I'm gonna have to keep the truck.

416
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,931
You crashed my car. Fair is fair.

417
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,084
Once you hit the road...

418
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,641
I'm sure you can catch a ride
to the hospital.

419
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,525
You can come get the truck
from the Cadi tomorrow.

420
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,370
Oh.

421
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,651
Marcus.

422
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,921
Don't forget the rest of you.

423
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,248
You're really gonna let them go?

424
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,843
I'm prioritizing.

425
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,968
Help me get him down.

426
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,243
Jesus Christmas.

427
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,841
- What the hell happened to you guys?
- Car trouble.

428
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,207
What the hell is this?
What did you do to my client?

429
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,811
He's been assaulted? Kai, wait.

430
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,325
Have you been assaulted?

431
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,324
If you assaulted my client,
I will have charges brought up against you.

432
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,405
You, too, Yawners. I'll bring the
wrath of God down on this whole...

433
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,481
Quiet.

434
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,804
He's all yours.

435
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,722
Don't even ask.

436
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,971
Ha, ha.

437
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,043
Wait.

438
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,725
I got you something.

439
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,083
- Is it hot?
- No.

440
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,208
I paid for this one.

441
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,645
It's our house.

442
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,842
It's where we're going.

443
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,089
Where is it?

444
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,807
Far from here.

445
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,363
What's the matter? What is it?

446
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,449
Fuck me. Please, just fuck me.

447
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,162
Big day for you.

448
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,289
Why didn't you just shoot the Moody boys?

449
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,568
They gave you the perfect excuse.

450
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,329
Well, if I kill every dumb redneck
that crosses me...

451
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,087
it won't be long before people
outside Banshee start looking at me.

452
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,369
Yeah, you could lose your job.

453
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,647
And speaking of jobs...

454
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,004
I want in.

455
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,650
You want in on what?

456
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,970
Whatever comes next.

457
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,601
No.

458
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,848
- What do you mean no?
- I mean no.

459
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,525
You've been good to me.

460
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,604
You got a good thing going here.
I'm not gonna screw that up for you.

461
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,049
Heh. No, this is screwed up.

462
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,807
You think I wanna spend what's left of my
life pouring beers and breaking up brawls?

463
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,882
I got my life savings in this place.

464
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,123
It's not gonna give it
back to me when I'm done.

465
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,010
I'm 56 years old. That's 70 for a fighter.

466
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,969
I'm black, I got a criminal record.

467
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,487
You have an interesting way
of selling yourself.

468
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,324
Fuck you.

469
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,447
Look, I don't need much...

470
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,365
but I need more than I got.

471
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,127
You have a particular skill set?

472
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,723
You mean aside from saving your ass?

473
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,525
The doctors couldn't get Marcus' ear
back on his head.

474
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,366
Well...

475
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,603
I guess half deaf...

476
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,366
is better than all dead.

477
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,681
Why didn't you kill them?

478
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,045
I'm not a killer.

479
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,123
Ha, ha. I think my late husband
might disagree with that.

480
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,248
I guess he would.

481
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,324
They're gonna keep coming, you know?

482
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,401
Why are you here, Kat?

483
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,890
I don't know.

484
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,243
Oh, you...

485
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,648
Mr. Proctor!

486
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,283
Would you do me the profound courtesy
of shutting the fuck up?

487
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,169
Oh, God.

488
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,609
Hello?

489
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,604
I'm in here.

490
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,450
Got your babysitting duty, huh?

491
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,011
Yeah.

492
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,402
You mind if I have a quick word
with your prisoner?

493
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,484
If it gets him to stop
singing, I'm all for it.

494
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,488
The wunderkind mayor...

495
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,368
here to savor the moment.

496
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,122
Enjoy it, Mr. Mayor.

497
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,328
Because a moment is all you'll get.

498
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,927
Is something on your mind, son?

499
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,162
Don't call me "son."

500
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,130
Ah. I'm sorry.

501
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,601
Forgot about your daddy issues.

502
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,411
Did you know I had to put him in a home?

503
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,964
And when I go visit him there now
in that place and I see him...

504
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,125
and I smell him...

505
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,841
Enterprises fail, Kendall.

506
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,647
Or it dissolves to make way for progress.

507
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,724
- I'm not respons...
- You broke him.

508
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,765
And I'm gonna break you.

509
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,923
As long as it takes.

510
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,880
Hmm.

511
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,087
I admire your gumption.

512
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,806
Most men would just grab
a shotgun and come after me...

513
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,770
but you, you ran for mayor.

514
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,807
It's maybe a little,
I don't know, gutless...

515
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,322
but for someone like you...

516
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,244
a boy who will never really be a man...

517
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,528
You're a blight on this town.

518
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,129
And I'm gonna... Oh!

519
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,131
I was building this town
before you were born.

520
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,203
You have me to thank for all of it.

521
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,081
Your father was weak, barely a man.
And you're no different.

522
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,083
Break me?

523
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,730
You're a gnat on my ass.

524
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,327
You have no idea what real power is,
you little prick.

525
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,847
What the fuck is going on here?

526
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,684
I think he needs medical attention.

527
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,569
What happened? Dan?

528
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,482
Okay, the charge is murder in the first.

529
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,723
Will you be entering a plea now
or waiting on the grand jury?

530
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,451
My client is pleading
not guilty, Your Honor.

531
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,648
Very well.

532
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,167
I assume you'll want to discuss bail now.

533
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,084
- Yes, Your Honor.
- This is a murder charge.

534
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,483
We have an eyewitness, physical evidence.
Mr. Proctor's wealth is public record.

535
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,246
The DA pulls my client
into this courtroom on a regular basis.

536
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,828
If there was
ever a flight risk...

537
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,800
There's a larger political
agenda at work here.

538
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,769
We fully expect this case to fall apart...

539
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,571
as all the DA's cases
against my client have in the past.

540
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,206
Mr. Proctor has never fled before.

541
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,567
- He's not gonna start now.
- It's murder, judge.

542
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,563
Mr. Proctor has a business to run.

543
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,166
He can't do that from a jail cell.

544
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,164
Okay, in light of the defendant's
legal history here...

545
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,408
and the fact
that he's never been convicted...

546
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,848
I'm not going to remand him
until after an indictment.

547
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,810
Bail is set at $300,000.

548
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,611
Defendant will surrender his passport
before being released.

549
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,530
Thank you, Your Honor.

550
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,763
I brought a check with me.

551
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,884
- Eyewitness?
- Already working on it.

552
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,009
Fuck me.

553
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,764
You don't write, you don't call.

554
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,089
What do you want?

555
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,164
Hmm.

556
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,402
What do I want?

557
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,164
I want a steak, fries, and a Diet Coke.

558
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,961
I want the entire Jean Paul Gaultier
fall collection.

559
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:13,206
Oh, and I want $750,000
for my blown-up business.

560
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,162
I am sorry about that.

561
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,328
What did you expect to happen?
It's fucking Rabbit.

562
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,480
Well, I can get you the steak.

563
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,322
You can start with the steak...

564
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,962
then you can take me shopping
for new digs.

565
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,487
- Digs?
- Mm.

566
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,291
That's right, baby, digs.

567
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,286
You better brace yourself.
Here come the motherfucking neighborhood.

568
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,290
- You know you're gonna hate it here.
- Not true.

569
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,486
I already hate it here.

570
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,362
I know all about witness protection
and relocation.

571
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,602
I've seen it in shitloads of movies.

572
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,527
You gotta set me up with a whole new life
in, like, Topeka...

573
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,809
where I get to be whatever I want...

574
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,891
like a master electrician...

575
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,570
or a guidance counselor.

576
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,048
Don't judge, bro. I got shit to offer.

577
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,884
You are shit.

578
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,845
I'd make a great stone mason.

579
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,241
Is it possible for you to draw a breath
without speaking?

580
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,121
You're an uptight motherfucker.
What's your blood pressure like, man?

581
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,330
Fuck.

582
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,002
I gotta take a piss.

583
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,890
Well, put it back when you're done.

584
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,650
Who's there?

585
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,129
Hello?

586
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,763
What the fuck's going on?

587
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,004
What is it?

588
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,764
They're here for you.

589
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,809
Fucking hell.

590
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,766
Wait, are you just fucking with me?

591
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,851
Wait, wait! Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck away!

592
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,561
I didn't tell them anything!
Hey, cop, wake up!

593
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,960
Help!
