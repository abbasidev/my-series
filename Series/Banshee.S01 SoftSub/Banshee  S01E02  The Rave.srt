1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,563
- Come on!
- Hey, hey! Stick to the trees.

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,166
Run!

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,321
Baby!

4
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,444
I think he knows.

5
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,842
No, he doesn't know.
He can't.

6
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,409
By the time he figures out
we're not coming back...

7
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,722
we'll be long gone.

8
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,249
Hey.

9
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,923
We risk our lives
every time we steal for him.

10
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,048
Why not risk our lives for us?

11
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,206
No one's ever stolen from Rabbit.

12
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,081
He doesn't know.

13
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,531
Everything will be fine.

14
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,528
Are we back on track, Mr. Hanson?

15
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,206
We're still playing catch-up
after that power failure...

16
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,007
but I'll keep them late and we
should be caught up by Sunday.

17
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,369
Friday.

18
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,206
Okay. Friday. I'm on it.

19
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,442
I'm on it, motherfucker.

20
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,490
Get down here.

21
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,166
You know for a fact
the owners are out of town?

22
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,322
Yeah. Away till Tuesday.

23
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,650
Okay.

24
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,683
Get out of here.

25
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,648
- Good to go, boys.
- All right.

26
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,484
It's an original masonry house.

27
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,531
All the houses in this neighborhood
came up in the late 1920s.

28
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,128
If you wanted to paint over this green.

29
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,204
- But I'll be here...
- Excuse me just a moment.

30
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,850
Mrs. Hopewell, good morning.

31
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,445
What are you doing here?

32
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,007
Same as everyone else.

33
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,527
I'm looking to put down roots.

34
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,331
Oh, this room has great morning light.

35
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,162
- Would you like to see the kitchen?
- Sure.

36
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,924
What the fuck are you doing?

37
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,044
- You've been training.
- What the fuck are you doing?

38
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,645
This is my life.

39
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,161
- Ana.
- My name is Carrie.

40
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,085
Either way, I still love you.

41
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,523
If that's true,
then you'll leave here and never come back.

42
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,444
- No.
- Please.

43
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,131
Carrie?

44
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,690
Um, your phone.

45
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,446
Shit. Okay. Hello?

46
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,206
Nice kitchen.

47
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,601
Mrs. Hopewell, this is Principal Merrick.

48
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,730
I'm calling to let you know
Deva is not in school again this morning.

49
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,888
I wanted to check
if she was feeling ill.

50
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,761
No. No, she's not,
but I can assure you she's going to be.

51
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,321
I hope she's okay.
Please let us know. Thanks.

52
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,051
Hey, it's Deva. Leave a message. Or don't.

53
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,641
Deva, where are you?

54
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,242
Whoo!

55
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,848
How's it going?

56
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,687
Yo, man. Are we putting
the Skulls with these?

57
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,320
- Just sort it and show me.
- Reed?

58
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,488
- Hey, Hanson.
- Hey, Reed.

59
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,846
Who the fuck are they?

60
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,445
It's okay. They're cool.

61
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,411
Move.

62
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,089
Well, come here, cool girls.

63
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,249
Come on.

64
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,289
You ask and Arno delivers.

65
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,529
The Red Skull stamp as promised.

66
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,930
Heh, heh, heh. Pretty sweet, huh?
Now if we can just settle up our account...

67
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,684
- Hey.
- Ah! Ow, man!

68
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,730
Hey, fuckhead, you got high
while you're working for me?

69
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,326
- Are you fucking crazy?
- No way. I'm a professional.

70
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,127
- So you're not tripping right now?
- I'm straight, man.

71
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,890
Look at me.

72
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,446
Unh!

73
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,802
Fucking tweaker. Get
Move it.

74
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,281
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'm gonna kick your ass.

75
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,681
Fuck you. Chill out, man.
Get off of me.

76
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,769
Fuck off! Go!

77
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,844
Come here.

78
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,171
Come here.

79
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,564
Are you cool?

80
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,090
What is it?

81
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,481
Some of the pills aren't pure.

82
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,404
- There's caffeine in them.
- You know what?

83
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,326
How about you leave the chemistry to me and
just go back and make the fucking pills.

84
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,329
What's going on?

85
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,404
You're in.

86
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,763
Midnight tomorrow at Yoder's barn.

87
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,605
- You know it?
- Yeah.

88
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,720
And you girls will
spread the word, right?

89
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,241
Hells yeah, we will. Heh, heh, heh.

90
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,161
Let's go, Deva.

91
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,486
- Hey.
- Sheriff.

92
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,685
You're late.

93
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,810
- Do I need a note from home?
- Couldn't reach you on your radio.

94
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,530
I'm here now. What do you need?

95
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,368
What I need... What we need is a sheriff
that answers his radio. All right?

96
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,668
I'll take that under advisement.

97
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,520
I don't know how you
did things in Oregon...

98
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,722
- Shut up, Brock.
- What?

99
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,288
- What the hell did you just say to me?
- I won't tell you twice.

100
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,090
Mr. Proctor.

101
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,289
There he is.

102
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,771
- That looks painful.
- I'll survive.

103
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,204
May I have a word in private?

104
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,802
Kobe steaks. My best.

105
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,490
Thank you.

106
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,608
Well, you saved my life.

107
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,524
I was just doing my job.

108
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,811
I'm sure by now you've
gleaned that there are people...

109
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,281
in Banshee,
our young mayor among them...

110
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,841
who would have been happy
to see me go down.

111
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,523
- Yeah, why is that?
- Oh...

112
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,490
some people find my business
practices a little aggressive.

113
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,608
I don't deny it.

114
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,683
Not everyone shares
my vision for this town.

115
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,002
But that's a talk for another time.

116
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,802
The reason I stopped in
is to warn you about the Moody brothers.

117
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,481
Warn me?

118
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,723
Yeah, they might be swimming
in the shallow end of the gene pool...

119
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,042
but they're a fiercely loyal clan.

120
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,487
Been in this town
almost as long as my people.

121
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,007
And they will be out for blood.

122
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,409
I'll keep my eye out.

123
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,405
Sheriff, I wouldn't be bothering you...

124
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,291
if I didn't think you have
a serious problem on your hands.

125
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,367
I don't deny your abilities. It's just
that your hands are tied by this office...

126
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,169
whereas I have a talent for resolving
problems, like this one, quietly.

127
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,410
I appreciate your concern, but...

128
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,844
I think I'll just take things as they come.

129
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,404
It could be that I'm speaking
globally here, sheriff...

130
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,131
beyond the Moody situation.

131
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,363
You see, I've got a good number
of local business interests...

132
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,000
that need to be kept running smoothly.

133
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,164
These interests can occasionally
generate difficulties...

134
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,086
but they also generate revenues.

135
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,208
Significant revenues.

136
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,406
What do you want, Mr. Proctor?

137
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,203
I might ask you the same question,
Sheriff Hood.

138
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,250
I'm good.

139
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,804
But thank you.

140
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,801
You take care of that.

141
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,804
It could go bad pretty fast.

142
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,367
- Where's my fucking money?
- You'll get it.

143
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,041
- Where'd you land?
- In hell.

144
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,444
Do you have any idea
what I'm surrounded by?

145
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,122
Skee-fucking-Ball,
cotton-fucking-candy...

146
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,442
and sea-fucking-gulls.

147
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,648
Is that a cape?

148
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,242
This is Diane von Furstenberg, chica.

149
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,562
Shoo. Go get pregnant.

150
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,803
- So?
- Bitch, you got lucky on this one.

151
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,642
Lucas Hood had virtually
no living relatives...

152
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,451
an estranged ex-wife
and son he ain't seen in years.

153
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,648
I couldn't even find any close friends.

154
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,287
And he ain't into the grid, neither.
No Facebook, no Twitter.

155
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,647
Your cover is good for now.

156
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,971
- Except...
- Except what?

157
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,407
Except that being where you are...

158
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,887
makes you the dumbest
bitch that I know!

159
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,328
Oh, not you, Snooki.

160
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,085
So...

161
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,690
how's she look?

162
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,007
She looks good.

163
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,289
- Hyah!
- Hold it!

164
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,366
Sorry, it's been that kind of week.

165
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,761
- You okay?
- Yeah.

166
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,649
Then let's have some fun.

167
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,365
Unh!

168
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,211
You and your Hula Poppers.

169
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,165
If you're after serious game,
you'd better come ready.

170
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,850
Live bait is the way to go.

171
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,609
No. I've been winning fishing derbies
since you were a speck of sperm.

172
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,362
I hear you have the new sheriff
living over your garage.

173
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,163
Huh? Seems kind of strange for
an ex-con renting to a lawman.

174
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,842
Doesn't it bother you?

175
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,682
Apparently not as much
as it bothers you.

176
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,488
At some point, I might begin
to question your loyalty.

177
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,406
No, I'm just a broken-down ex-con.

178
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,567
I don't choose sides.

179
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,481
Kai.

180
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,606
You talk about serious game?

181
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,240
Hood is serious game.

182
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,529
Like you've never seen.

183
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,127
So if you come for him,
you'd better come ready.

184
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,882
You take care of yourself, Sugar.

185
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,524
Yeah, you too.

186
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,890
No, no, no. You can't be here tonight.

187
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,883
And yet I am.

188
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,565
Cole Moody's wake.

189
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,611
His brothers are drunker than usual,
if that's possible.

190
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,048
Now, we've already had two fistfights.
That's just between family members.

191
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,245
- Can I at least get a sandwich? Hey.
- All right.

192
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,283
All right, just...

193
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,128
Whatever it takes
to get you out of here.

194
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,930
Look, here. Come on, take them.

195
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,970
Come on, eat them. Plenty more
where that came from.

196
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,929
Go on.

197
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,969
All right?

198
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,969
Sheriff Hood.

199
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,730
Yeah?

200
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,002
- You don't know who I am, do you?
- Not yet.

201
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,083
I'm Kat Moody.

202
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,210
You killed my husband.

203
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,242
And now you're sitting here eating food...

204
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,449
prepared for his wake,
food that I paid for.

205
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,447
Well, I apologize about the food.

206
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,686
That was in bad taste.

207
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,408
But not for killing my husband?

208
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,168
He smashed me in the head with a pipe
and then fired a gun at a crowded party.

209
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,369
So while I am sorry for your grief...

210
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,961
He laid a good one on you.

211
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,210
He did.

212
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,686
- You're the second woman to hit me today.
- I bet that's a slow day for you.

213
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,887
Mmm.

214
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,450
Jesus Christ.
Marcus, Dex, put those away.

215
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,170
Shut up, Kat, and get inside.

216
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,569
You Moody boys sure do
like your six-shooters.

217
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,084
You got permits for those?

218
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,282
You won't be around
long enough to find out.

219
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,016
You're not gonna shoot a man
at your brother's wake.

220
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,169
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- We're doing this for Cole.

221
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,527
Cole was a mean drunk
and he got what was coming.

222
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,160
You watch your mouth, bitch.
I'll kill you too.

223
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,482
Hey, you're Marcus, right?
And you're Dex?

224
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,926
That's right.

225
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,367
Okay, Marcus, Dex...

226
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,246
- You have the right to remain silent.
- That's far enough.

227
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,051
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

228
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,646
- You believe the balls on this guy?
- He's arresting us.

229
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,768
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Shut up.

230
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,649
Why don't you make me.

231
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,450
Come on.

232
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,250
Marcus, Dex, your coffee is getting cold.

233
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,849
This don't concern you, Sugar.

234
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,765
All the same, I am concerned.

235
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,084
Come on.

236
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,245
Hmm?

237
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,810
If you can't afford an attorney...

238
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,282
the court will appoint one for you,
and he'll probably suck.

239
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,841
Sheriff Hood, they're drunk
and they're morons...

240
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,731
but they're grieving in their own way.

241
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,407
Get the fuck out of here.

242
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,684
Go on.

243
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,289
This isn't over, Hood.
We'll be looking out for you.

244
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,330
Well, I'll be the one in the car
with the flashing lights.

245
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,768
What you looking at?

246
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,966
And you are?

247
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,646
Let's go.

248
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,325
Hey, stick to the trees
for at least two miles. You'll be fine.

249
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,682
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna throw them off.

250
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,366
- No, I'm not leaving you!
- You were right about Rabbit.

251
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,761
- He knew. He knew.
- Don't do this.

252
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,094
Don't do this. Don't do this.
We can make it.

253
00:25:58,106 --> 00:25:59,641
Hey. Hey! I'll catch up to you.

254
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,125
I love you. I love you.

255
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,161
Take the diamonds. I'll catch up to you.

256
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,011
Go!

257
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,402
Right there! No, I got him!

258
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,609
Stay right where you are.
Get down on the ground right now.

259
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,165
Hands up. Don't do it...

260
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,205
Come on.

261
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,490
Copy. We have him.

262
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,927
Baby!

263
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,171
Hey.

264
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,169
You okay, baby?

265
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,926
Yeah.

266
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,609
Just a bad dream.

267
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,721
Is that the Moody report?

268
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,165
Yeah.

269
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,004
It's supposed to be.

270
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,124
But if I had known there was all this
paperwork, I never would have shot him.

271
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,005
Oh, come on, you must have had
to do this back in Oregon.

272
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,965
Uh, yeah, I wasn't any better at it then.

273
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,683
You filled out the incident report twice.
And you have to attach it to the SO sheet.

274
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,561
- SO?
- State oversight.

275
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,884
Have you already done
the weapons discharge form?

276
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,448
Uh, you know...

277
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,803
Sheriff Morgan used to have Alma
do all this stuff for him.

278
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,045
She enjoys it.
Just buy her a nice bottle of wine.

279
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,563
Look it over when she's done.

280
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,451
Sold.

281
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,367
You gave us your word that
you'd stop ditching school.

282
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,443
- My grades are fine.
- That is not the point.

283
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,364
So where were you this afternoon?

284
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,488
What's the difference? It's Saturday.

285
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,530
- My grades are fine too.
- Rock on, Max.

286
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,763
Deva, this isn't a joke.
Your mother and I are worried about you.

287
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,391
Well,
there's nothing to be worried about.

288
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,209
That's not what it looks like.

289
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,885
What...?

290
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,611
Well, that went well.

291
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,122
I can't do this right now.

292
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,409
Hey, we are not finished.

293
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,327
- Women, right?
- Heh. You little...

294
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:45,894
Dad...

295
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:48,882
If you turn into a teenager,
I will kill you.

296
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,242
- Mr. Bowman.
- Deputy Brock.

297
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,885
What can we do for you?

298
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,691
- You are the new sheriff?
- That's right.

299
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,004
Something is happening at the Yoder farm
tonight. Some kind of a barn party.

300
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,202
- A rave?
- Yes.

301
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,886
My son used that word.
He saw them setting it up.

302
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,401
A rave, in this town?

303
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,284
Emmett.

304
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,803
Yeah, thanks for coming in.

305
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,843
Sheriff, you'll keep
my family's name out of this?

306
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,889
Yeah, you were never here.

307
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,883
Thank you.

308
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,290
My daughter. Rebecca.

309
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,646
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Sheriff Hood.

310
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,245
Very nice to meet you.

311
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,605
You too.

312
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,567
Rebecca, get in.

313
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,162
What's going on?
Are we going to war?

314
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,561
These raves are highly
organized enterprises.

315
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,849
It's designed for the sole
purpose of selling drugs.

316
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,924
And where there are drugs,
there will be guns.

317
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,244
Usually by the time we hear about it, the
place is trashed and everyone is long gone.

318
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,606
Let's go.

319
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,210
Right?

320
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,007
Right. Ahem.

321
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,884
Like, oh, my God. There's so many people.

322
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,042
We're with Hanson. Beaty and Deva.

323
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,850
Oh, like that's gonna help.

324
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,241
- Why don't you wait like everybody else?
- VIPs? Nice.

325
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,611
Hey, Hanson!

326
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,560
Yeah, police band all quiet?
Okay, people, let's get paid.

327
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,410
- Hey!
- You made it. Hey.

328
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,881
What's up? Oh, my God.

329
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,520
- Snacks, anyone?
- Oh, Skulls!

330
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,002
- What is it?
- It's E.

331
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,850
Whoo!

332
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,289
Hey, baby.

333
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,090
You okay?

334
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,850
- Yeah.
- Okay.

335
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,604
Deva.

336
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,566
Deva.

337
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,410
Deva!

338
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,321
Deva.

339
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,005
So, what's the plan?

340
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,925
All right, there's only two ways
in and out of here:

341
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,323
That front entrance and there's
a utility door around back.

342
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,244
Should be pretty easy
for us to cover.

343
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,404
Yeah, but God only knows how
many kids are actually in there.

344
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,485
Start a panic, this thing could go
from bad to worse fast.

345
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,087
- What are you doing?
- We need to see inside.

346
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,242
If I can find the guy in charge...

347
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,563
we can shut this down
without starting a riot.

348
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,963
So you're just gonna wander in there
and ask who's in charge?

349
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,770
- That's your plan?
- Yeah.

350
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,809
Oh, great.

351
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,319
Aren't you kind of old
to pass for a teenager?

352
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,485
I'm young at heart

353
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,162
Can't be out of uniform, Hood. You are
legally required to identify yourself.

354
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,527
Is he always this much fun?

355
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,405
- Yeah, I'm here for the rave.
- There's no rave here.

356
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,528
Come on, guys, what's it gonna take?

357
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,888
Shit. You kidding me?

358
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,084
Uh... He can't...
He can't just do that, right?

359
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,768
- He's waving.
- Yeah.

360
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,650
What do we do?

361
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,530
Moore, what's your count on the gate?

362
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,489
Moore, are you hearing me?
I asked what's your count.

363
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,927
Moore, what the fuck? Respond.

364
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,761
Someone get me eyes on Moore.

365
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,967
Someone get me eyes on Moore.
You got nothing?

366
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,723
Hey, it's Deva. Leave a message. Or don't.

367
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,205
Reed? Reed.

368
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,570
What is it? Reed! Reed!

369
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,924
Help! Somebody help me!

370
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,770
Reed!

371
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,160
Somebody!

372
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,247
Beaty!

373
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,884
Help!

374
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,941
Something's wrong.
Call the paramedics and

375
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:57,487
get in here.
We've got to shut this down fast.

376
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,287
Everyone clear out. It's going south.

377
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,330
Five-O. Move out now!

378
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,566
Somebody help! Help!

379
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,763
Help!

380
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,924
- Somebody help me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

381
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,491
Come on. Come on.

382
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,044
Move!

383
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,441
Look at me. Look at me.
You okay?

384
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,285
- Are you okay?
- Uh...

385
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,727
Are you okay? Deva?

386
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,323
This is the BSD. Please start exiting
in an orderly fashion.

387
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,486
You stay here. Do not move. Stay there.

388
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,602
- Get out! Get out!
- Get out.

389
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,604
You good?

390
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,130
I'm good.

391
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,689
Is it charged?

392
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,006
Anything? All right.

393
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,969
Ready? Charge.

394
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,687
- No.
- All right, we gotta call it.

395
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,761
No. No! No! Oh, no!

396
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,685
Reed! No!

397
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,169
- Oh, my God!
- Shh. It's okay.

398
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,481
Oh, my God.

399
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,451
Shh.

400
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,091
Sit tight. Turn around.

401
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,485
Look at this. Reed Schumacher.

402
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,291
State Senator Schumacher,
that's his son.

403
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,405
- What the fuck are you looking at, bitch?
- Hey, shut your mouth.

404
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,403
I asked you a question, bitch.
What the fuck are you looking at? Unh!

405
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,003
Sheriff! Sheriff! Hood!

406
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,250
Get the fuck off me.

407
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,648
Come on, I'll take you both home.

408
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,810
- Hood, hey, what the fuck was that?
- Hey, leave it, Brock.

409
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,042
You beat the shit
out of a handcuffed perp...

410
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,160
- In front of 10 witnesses.
- He had it coming.

411
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,083
I don't know how you did things out West...

412
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,891
but you can't make up the rules
as you go along here.

413
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,010
You're putting the rest of us
in an impossible position.

414
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,811
Get in.

415
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,361
And what the hell
am I supposed to do, huh?

416
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,965
You know what?

417
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,009
I'd seriously consider resigning.

418
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,881
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

419
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,365
You know what? I was here long before you,
and I'll be here long after you're gone...

420
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,091
which, by the looks of it,
is gonna be pretty damn soon.

421
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,685
- Maybe.
- Mm-hm.

422
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,289
But right now the smartest career move
you could make...

423
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,011
would be to get
the fuck out of my way.

424
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,522
Wait! Aah!

425
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,127
What...? You cut my fucking finger off.

426
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,249
Our ecstasy trade generates revenues...

427
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,450
of a quarter of a million dollars a week
in Philadelphia and D.C.

428
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,444
I spent years and serious money
developing that network.

429
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,447
And because I'm not a fucking idiot,
I never sold a single pill in this county.

430
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,728
I don't shit where I sleep, Mr. Hanson.

431
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,531
You, on the other hand,
have just taken a steaming dump...

432
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,763
right in the middle of my fucking bed.
You stole my Skulls.

433
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,527
You cooked up a tainted batch that
killed a boy. But not just any boy...

434
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,082
the boy of a state senator.
Do you understand?

435
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,165
- You've unleashed a shitstorm on me.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Proctor.

436
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,491
Now...

437
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,410
I want you to look
over here at Preacher.

438
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,046
Preacher now has a taste for you.

439
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,801
I'll give you 60 seconds.

440
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,248
What? Are you fucking serious?

441
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,369
Starting now.

442
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,370
Please!

443
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,480
It's a hard thing to see someone die.

444
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,805
First time, I was younger than you.

445
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,209
A kid from my neighborhood
tried to run across the rail road tracks.

446
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,723
He tripped on some gravel and...

447
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,490
And, uh...

448
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,449
You know...

449
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,930
Thing is...

450
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,685
you can't make sense out of it.

451
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,730
All right?

452
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,682
It doesn't make sense.

453
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,049
You hear me?

454
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,570
You just...

455
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,403
I don't know.

456
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,124
You accept it at some point.

457
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,447
Was he a friend of yours?

458
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,928
The kid on the tracks.

459
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,565
No.

460
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,290
No, he was just some asshole
from the neighborhood.

461
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,645
And I was an asshole who dared him
to beat the 5:15 Amtrak.

462
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,371
Now you listen to me. Hey.

463
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,207
You're gonna be okay.
