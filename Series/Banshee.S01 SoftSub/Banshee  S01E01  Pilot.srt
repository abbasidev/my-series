1
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,404
Fuck me.

2
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,564
Hi, Job.

3
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,690
- You're out.
- I'm out.

4
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,606
Listen, I know why you're here,
but I cannot help you.

5
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,524
Hey!

6
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,050
Just give me the address, Job.

7
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,371
Why are you even assuming I know how to...

8
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,568
No, no, no! Motherfucker!

9
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,571
Quit breaking my shit.

10
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,650
Baby, you know how this works.
The trail is cold.

11
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,130
Okay, okay, okay!
Just stop the carnage.

12
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,564
You've got the whole
world in front of you...

13
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,725
and you're going to the one place
you absolutely should not go.

14
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,165
What, are you crazy?

15
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,324
Hey!

16
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,488
Morning, everyone.

17
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,805
I've reviewed the defense's
motion to dismiss.

18
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,009
And based on the evidence,
or the lack thereof...

19
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,682
it's my opinion that the prosecution
cannot sustain the burden for a trial...

20
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,856
- Are you kidding?
- So I'm finding for the defense.

21
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,211
Case dismissed.

22
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,925
You can't take this to trial, Gordon.

23
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,007
You should be thanking me
for saving you the embarrassment.

24
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,084
- Gordon.
- Jackson.

25
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,011
That a judge in your pocket
or you just happy to see me?

26
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,765
Mr. Mayor.

27
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,726
- Jesus Christ, Gordon.
- Oh, pace yourself, Dan.

28
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,682
Our day will come.

29
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,729
Guys like Kai Proctor
don't go down easy.

30
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,488
Carrie.

31
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,045
Hey.

32
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,725
You'll get him next time, counselor.

33
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,770
Yeah, I am ready for this day to be over.

34
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,611
Again?

35
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,410
Yeah.

36
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,484
It's nothing to freak out about.

37
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,927
We're not freaking out.
We're just talking to you.

38
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,731
My point is we don't solve
our problems with violence.

39
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,769
I just completed another level.

40
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,843
Yeah, it happens every day, Dad.

41
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,048
I just can't believe that you
kicked your teacher.

42
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,521
- Substitute teacher.
- Oh, well, it's okay, then.

43
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,682
He's a perv, Mom.
He tried to see down my shirt.

44
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,968
With a shirt like that,
it doesn't take much trying.

45
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,645
- So it's my fault?
- Gordon.

46
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,565
So if I get molested by a teacher,
you'll just blame it on my shirt?

47
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,131
- Deva, come on.
- Okay, all right.

48
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,971
Max, honey, you have your inhaler?

49
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,601
Dr. Welling referred Max
to another pulmonologist.

50
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,205
We have an appointment next week.

51
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,091
Okay. Great.

52
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,847
- Is your shoulder bad today?
- Ah, it's just the usual.

53
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,809
It'll be all right.

54
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,485
I think I might grab a shower.

55
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,284
- Okay.
- Okay?

56
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,088
That's Beaty. Later.

57
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,444
- You're late, bitch.
- Whatever, skank.

58
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,329
So, are you in shit with your parents?

59
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,364
- Yeah, when am I not?
- Ha, ha.

60
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,090
Howdy.

61
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,802
I'm gonna go with shitty day...

62
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,204
- And whiskey neat.
- Whiskey's fine.

63
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,168
And one for yourself.

64
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,643
Are you coming or going?

65
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,361
I'm still working that out.

66
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,202
That's me, Sugar Bates...

67
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,368
in the cruiserweight years.

68
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,682
When'd you drop him?

69
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,649
Fifth?

70
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,529
Eighth.

71
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,206
He was a southpaw. They take longer.

72
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,048
See, it was a title fight.

73
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,362
I held the belt for 18 months.

74
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,285
I used to hang it right up there.

75
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,601
You know?

76
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,047
A good conversation piece.

77
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,328
But with this tough economy,
I had to pawn it...

78
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,246
a little while back
to pay for the leaking taps.

79
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,608
That's a shame.

80
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,603
Where are you from?

81
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,929
Different places.

82
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,289
Where'd you sit?

83
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,570
Roscoe.

84
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,241
I did eight years at Allenwood.

85
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,044
You look fresh.

86
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,484
Freedom.

87
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,444
Freedom.

88
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,560
Always this quiet around here?

89
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,530
Well, let's stimulate
the local economy.

90
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,444
Next round's on me.

91
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,090
Ha, ha. All right.

92
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,403
All you tourists buying me drinks today.

93
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,206
I'm not a tourist.

94
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,569
My name is Lucas Hood.

95
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,560
And come Monday, I'm being sworn in
as the new sheriff.

96
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,649
Congratulations.

97
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,202
Or should we say good luck?

98
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,203
I'll take both, thanks.

99
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,488
I spent nine years as sheriff
up in Church, Oregon.

100
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,722
You ever heard of it?

101
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,770
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
It's the armpit of the West.

102
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,048
This is my first day east.

103
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,487
I just drove clear across the country.

104
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,210
There's less to see than you'd think.

105
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,331
I thought the sheriff had to be elected.

106
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,882
Usually, but under certain circumstances,
the mayor can bring in a ringer.

107
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,924
He and Sheriff Morgan
are the ones who hired me so...

108
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,367
I was looking forward to meeting
them when I got here.

109
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,320
Yeah, well, that'd be quite a trick
since he died last Tuesday.

110
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,845
Liver cancer.

111
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,445
I think he thought he had more time.

112
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,204
Aw, shit.

113
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,044
Your boss know you're here?

114
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,966
Don't worry about him. You know the drill.

115
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,207
Look at this guy.

116
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,924
Excuse me.

117
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,048
Are we disturbing you?

118
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,885
No, not at all.
This is just a very good steak.

119
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,050
And I know that once I stand up
to deal with you fellas...

120
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,885
well, maybe you'll come quietly
or maybe I'll have to kill you...

121
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,000
but either way,
this steak is gonna get cold...

122
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,548
And you can always reheat a steak...

123
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:42,772
but it's never quite the same. Hmm?

124
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,771
You got some balls on you, motherfucker.

125
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,167
Sheriff's Department.
I'll take that gun now.

126
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,163
No, you drop your fucking gun.

127
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,961
That's the new STI, isn't it?

128
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,361
- That's a hard gun to get.
- Who the fuck is this guy?

129
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,171
- You sit your ass down.
- All right, hear me out, sheriff.

130
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,448
- They got you outgunned.
- Damn straight we do.

131
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,326
While on the other hand, if he shoots,
one of you boys is dead...

132
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,444
or shitting in a bag the
rest of his life. For what?

133
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,047
The 200 bucks Sugar has in the register
at 4 p.m. on a Tuesday? Come on.

134
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,363
So, Sheriff, why don't you
let them take the cash?

135
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,851
Just let them take it.

136
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,843
I'll buy enough drinks to make him whole.

137
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,844
Everyone goes home happy.
What do you say?

138
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,880
Come on.

139
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,721
Oh, God!

140
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,001
Am I dead?

141
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,401
Yeah.

142
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,281
It's my first day in town.

143
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,601
Shit!

144
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,325
Sorry.

145
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,724
I hope my mother was right about God.

146
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,442
Jesus ripshit Christ.

147
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,286
This is what you call in the Bible...

148
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,967
a "clusterfuck of epic proportions."

149
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,003
Two cons, three corpses,
one of them a cop.

150
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,283
I don't like that math.

151
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,883
You'd better get out of here.

152
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,200
Well, they would have killed me
same as him.

153
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,364
The least I can do is
give you a head start.

154
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,810
What about you?

155
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,088
I got a few tricks.

156
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,329
Go on, now. Get out of here.

157
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,850
Hi, Ana.

158
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,928
How did you find me?

159
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,529
It was Job.

160
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,244
It's a nice house.

161
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,322
Yeah, it seems, um...

162
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,801
uh, solid.

163
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,323
So, what do you have, two kids?

164
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,127
- Yes.
- Yeah?

165
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,491
How old?

166
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,688
My son is 8.

167
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,523
My daughter is 13.

168
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,085
Hmm.

169
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,685
She looks older.

170
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,522
I can smell your perfume from here.

171
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,450
Please, you're gonna have to leave.

172
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,490
Please. Please.

173
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,085
Ana.

174
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,402
I'm not Ana anymore.

175
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,050
My name is Carrie.

176
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,007
Where were you?

177
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,288
- I tried to visit.
- No. 15 years.

178
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,080
- I drove up to those gates.
- You were here playing fucking house?

179
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,520
- You have no idea how many times.
- Don't you tell me that.

180
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,928
- Where the fuck were you?
- I don't have to justify myself to you.

181
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,287
I have responsibilities.

182
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,289
I have children.

183
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,605
Okay?

184
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,922
I have a husband who loves me.

185
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,886
Hey.

186
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,843
- It's me.
- Don't. I can't.

187
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,331
You could have led Rabbit straight to me.

188
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,520
What the fuck were you thinking?

189
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,010
Okay.

190
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,166
You moved on. I get it.

191
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,523
So give me my cut
and you'll never see me again.

192
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,005
I don't have the diamonds.

193
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,289
What? What?

194
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,364
After we screwed Rabbit like that
and you had gotten caught...

195
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,205
No, no, I did not get caught.
There were two of us there that night!

196
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,200
- Shh, shh! I know.
- I led them away from you!

197
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,211
Listen, I tried to fence them.

198
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,161
The guys I found,
these real bottom-feeders, Serbians...

199
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,045
they saw me coming.

200
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,002
You're telling me you got rolled?

201
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,321
Does it look like I'm
sitting on $10 million?

202
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,249
Mm.

203
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,363
I don't get the girl.

204
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,969
I don't get the money.

205
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,122
I spent 15 years picturing this day...

206
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,727
and I gotta tell you,
this is not how I saw it playing out.

207
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,043
I'm so sorry. I am so fucking sorry.

208
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,804
- Hey, babe, you out here?
- Shit.

209
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,487
Yeah. Hey, honey. Raccoon.

210
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,367
Christ.

211
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,170
You trying to kill me?

212
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,650
Have you picked a spot yet?

213
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,567
You one of them complicated types.
Is that it?

214
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,164
No, some people just don't know
simple when they see it.

215
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,163
Don't seem right...

216
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,289
burying the sheriff with that pond scum.

217
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,761
What, do you wanna dig him his own hole?

218
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,366
Yeah, that'd be the Christian thing to do.

219
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,045
That you?

220
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,363
- Hello?
- Sheriff Hood...

221
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,251
it's Mayor Dan Kendall.
Am I catching you at a bad time?

222
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,650
Sheriff?

223
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,531
Are you there?

224
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,726
- Yeah, this is Hood.
- How's the drive going?

225
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,969
A lot less to see than you'd think.

226
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,801
Well, I just wanted to confirm tomorrow.
You'll be in town by then?

227
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,284
- Should be, yeah.
- Great.

228
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,966
So that's 1:00 at Miles' Diner.

229
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,327
I look forward to finally
meeting you in person.

230
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,086
Great. I'll see you then.

231
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,926
Now tell me you got some kind
of master plan here.

232
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,927
Well, I usually just get by with my charm.

233
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,922
- Hishi Salon.
- I need a favor.

234
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,521
And I need $5000 for all
the shit you broke.

235
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,570
- I'll make it 10.
- Fuck you!

236
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,684
- Speak.
- I need to become someone else.

237
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,450
Honey child, don't we all?

238
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,329
Someone specific.

239
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,367
- Name?
- Lucas Hood...

240
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,965
of Church, Oregon.

241
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,122
Shouldn't be a problem.

242
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,363
Unless he's a motherfucking cop.
Are you kidding me?

243
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,005
I need it quick, Job.

244
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,969
Baby, you just sat for 15 years...

245
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,125
because you were the most notorious thief
in the country. Now you want to play cop?

246
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,560
Can you do it?

247
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,927
I mean, I have to hack
law-enforcement databases

248
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,764
swap out fingerprints and photo IDs...

249
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,160
find any news article that
might have run a picture...

250
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,248
- So you can't do it?
- Suck my tit, bitch!

251
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,323
Of course I can do it.

252
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,768
Take a couple days.
As for the credentials...

253
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,008
I can get you the papers,
but the badge itself...

254
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,730
I got the badge.

255
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,207
I don't even wanna know.

256
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,971
You know, some cons,
the minute they get out...

257
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,771
they're just trying
like hell to get back in.

258
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,160
I'm not going back.

259
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,764
Yeah, well, you got a revolutionary way
of staying out of trouble.

260
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,526
Here.

261
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,967
The pickup belonged to the sheriff.

262
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,291
Thanks.

263
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,805
Hey.

264
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,163
You got a place to stay?

265
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,364
No one's ever stolen from Rabbit.

266
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,126
Okay.

267
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,971
Hey, go in back and stay out of sight.

268
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,600
- What for?
- Go now.

269
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,483
Morning, Sugar.

270
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,130
Kai.

271
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,964
How are the headaches?

272
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,047
Did those Mexican painkillers
I got you help?

273
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,851
They did. Thanks.

274
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,083
What brings you around?

275
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,401
Randall and Munson.

276
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,881
Munson, the bald one?

277
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,712
One of the boys thought
they might have been

278
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:58,328
headed out this way
yesterday afternoon.

279
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,289
Well, they didn't come here.

280
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,363
If they did, I'd have taken notice.

281
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,566
If any of my employees
ever stepped out of line...

282
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,008
hassled you in any way,
I'd expect you to call me.

283
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,846
What I mean is I wouldn't want you
to take matters into your own hands.

284
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,685
Ha, ha. Look at me.

285
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,367
Nobody runs from a fight
faster than an old fighter.

286
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,368
What happened to your title fight?

287
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,842
Oh, I knocked it off the hook the
other night, busted up the frame.

288
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,604
I'm having it redone.

289
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,483
Ah. Thanks for the drink.

290
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,442
You let me know if you need
any more of those painkillers.

291
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,444
That's some car.

292
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,044
Look, if you're thinking
of stealing from Kai Proctor...

293
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,771
you may as well take a bullet
and put it in your head now.

294
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,485
Kai Proctor.

295
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,287
There is a name.

296
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,647
What the man doesn't own, he runs.

297
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,371
What he doesn't run,
he burns to the ground.

298
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,371
He seemed to like you well enough.

299
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,971
We go back a ways.

300
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,042
- Uh-huh.
- Listen.

301
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,364
You don't seem like the kind of guy
who takes advice...

302
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,281
but I'm gonna try anyway.

303
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,606
There's $400. Take it and go.

304
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,681
- I can't.
- Look around.

305
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,922
You're free, man.

306
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,442
Pay you back in a few days.

307
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,848
Good to meet you. Lucas Hood.

308
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,731
Lucas Hood. How are...? How...?

309
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,688
It's a legitimate concern
and I promise I'll talk to the school.

310
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,765
Excuse me.

311
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,040
- Say hi to Amy.
- Thank you.

312
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,443
- Sheriff Hood?
- That's right.

313
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,923
It's great to meet you.

314
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,407
Yeah, you too.

315
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,570
I know, I look young,
but that's just because I am.

316
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,531
Have a seat.

317
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,802
Job, two suits, badly tailored.
They're looking for you.

318
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,524
Cops?

319
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,609
Let's hope so.

320
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,611
I want all the backup
drives in the car now.

321
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,007
Keep the engine running.

322
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,283
Gentlemen, we don't
actually open till 10...

323
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,286
but if you'll follow me back upstairs, I'm
sure we can find somewhere to fit you in.

324
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,570
Down here might be better for
the private nature of our inquiry.

325
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,166
Inquiry? Hmm.

326
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,569
May I see some ID?

327
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,965
This ain't a badge.

328
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,164
No. it's not.

329
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,169
Fucking slope cunt!

330
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,967
We work for Mr. Rabbit.

331
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,691
Sweet fuck.

332
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,083
The guy you're looking for came
in a couple of days ago.

333
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,720
- And what did he want?
- Just the usual, man.

334
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,605
Credit cards, ID's.

335
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,690
- Where is he now?
- I'll tell Mr. Rabbit whatever he wants...

336
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,842
but I've no idea.

337
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,966
Okay, okay, okay!

338
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,168
I'll get the file! It's in the safe.

339
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,724
That would be helpful.

340
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,525
Love me

341
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,887
Love, love, love Love me

342
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,806
I'll be anything you want me
To be, baby

343
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,846
Drive.

344
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,207
So I pissed off some people
when I hired you.

345
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,011
But every sheriff that we've had,
including Morgan...

346
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,289
ended up on Proctor's payroll,
so I needed an outsider.

347
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,124
So you brought me in here to take down
this one guy? This Proctor?

348
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,607
He's not just one guy, all right?

349
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,844
There's not a criminal
enterprise around here

350
00:38:30,856 --> 00:38:32,765
that doesn't start or
end in his pockets.

351
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,883
Now, I know you don't work till Monday...

352
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,447
but I wanna show you the Cadi.

353
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,681
The Cadi?

354
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,651
The old Sheriff's Department
burned down three years ago.

355
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,126
City Hall was pretty strapped.

356
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,806
Froemer's Cadillac had just gone under,
so we got creative.

357
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,928
Girl, you're gonna leave that man...

358
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,242
- And you're gonna leave that man tonight.
- Mm-mm.

359
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,606
Alma.

360
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,161
Um, I'll call you later.

361
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,765
Meet Lucas Hood.

362
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,207
- Good to meet you, Alma.
- Sheriff Hood.

363
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,084
Great to meet you.

364
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,410
Mm-hm.

365
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,167
- Afternoon, mayor.
- This is Lucas Hood.

366
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,686
This is Emmett Yawners.

367
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,127
He's one of the top 10 rushers
of all time at Penn State.

368
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,248
- Good to meet you.
- Welcome to the B.S.D.

369
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,643
This is Brock Lotus, our
longest-serving member of the department.

370
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,690
- That right?
- How are you doing, sheriff?

371
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,042
You fucking fascist!

372
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,531
I didn't even do anything.

373
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,041
Oh, yeah, you're a model citizen.

374
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,404
You try and fight me again,
I remove your fucking testicles.

375
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,040
- Hi.
- Hi.

376
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,806
This is Lucas Hood. It's your new boss.

377
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,807
Well, shit, Danny, you could have
said so sooner. I'm Siobhan Kelly.

378
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,962
- My name's Peter.
- Shut the fuck up!

379
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,805
I was thinking maybe you could show
the sheriff the town of Banshee.

380
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,089
Oh, I'd love to, but, uh, I have
to write up Charlie Sheen here.

381
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,042
Actually, uh, I'd love a tour...

382
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,521
from the longest-sewing member
of the department.

383
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,601
All right, so why don't we start
on the outskirts of town?

384
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,166
There's an Indian casino.
Work our way back.

385
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,524
Did I catch you on a bad day
or you always this cheerful?

386
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,802
AW, shit.

387
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,725
What's going on?

388
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,722
Moody boys build furniture and the Amish
mills have been driving down their prices.

389
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,247
We've, uh... We've had incidents.

390
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,806
They won't hit back.

391
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,849
Oh, you've seen Witness.
Yeah, that's great.

392
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,525
Why don't you let me handle this, huh?

393
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,286
- Yeah, sure.
- Hood, Hood!

394
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,485
Whoops!

395
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,088
We don't work, you don't work.

396
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,163
- The fuck up, punk.
- Hey!

397
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,400
Why don't we all just take a moment...

398
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,364
talk about this?

399
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,164
Who the fuck are you?

400
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,529
Lucas Hood. I'm the new sheriff.

401
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,767
Hey, Lotus, I thought you were supposed
to take over when Morgan kicked.

402
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,282
Yeah, well, you and me both.

403
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,204
Hey! Cole. That's enough.

404
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,403
I'm sure your wife's got better things to
do than bail your ass out of jail today.

405
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,167
- I'm not through messing with them.
- Yeah, you are.

406
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,688
If you're the sheriff,
why aren't you in uniform?

407
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,962
I don't start till Monday.

408
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,287
So there's nothing stopping us
from fucking your shit up today, then, huh?

409
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,962
Yeah. I hoped you'd make that connection.

410
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,408
- All right, boys.
- Easy, deputy. I got this.

411
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,849
So, come on, Cole...

412
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,410
fuck my shit up.

413
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,486
All right, just to be clear,
we'll be pounding a civilian...

414
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,806
Come on, motherfucker. Get up!

415
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,604
Get his ass, Cole. Get his ass!

416
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,211
That's enough, Cole.

417
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,691
Mr. Proctor.

418
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,082
Your four-on-one advantage
wasn't enough?

419
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,170
You needed this?

420
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,810
Come on, guys.

421
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,604
Hold on.

422
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,764
These men are on a schedule.

423
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,208
Why don't you boys help them
load their wagons?

424
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,848
Yes, sir. Come on.

425
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,288
You are?

426
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,047
- Lucas Hood.
- The new sheriff.

427
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,842
Fucking Dutchie. This isn't over.

428
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,644
Kai Proctor.

429
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,451
Sorry if I stepped on your toes there.

430
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,286
- Mr. Proctor, what exactly do you do?
- I'm in meats.

431
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,769
Why don't you stop by
the slaughterhouse?

432
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,400
I'll set you up with some nice steaks.

433
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,967
Father...

434
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,121
it's good to see you.

435
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,731
Hey, Lotus, I'm gonna walk.

436
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,482
You're welcome, by the way.

437
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,041
I have to go.

438
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,089
Come on, stay with me.

439
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,522
- See you later.
- What?

440
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,730
But I love you.

441
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,610
- Whoa! You okay?
- Yeah, my bad.

442
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,047
Okay. It's all right.

443
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,491
Thirteen years old, my ass.

444
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,371
Hey. Sorry, you dropped this.

445
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,801
- Thanks.
- Shouldn't you be in school?

446
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,889
Yeah, I should.

447
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,362
Can't your boyfriend take you back?

448
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,404
Who says he's my boyfriend?

449
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,562
Well, I hope he's not your brother.

450
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,369
P&Ls.

451
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,847
Our numbers are down
at both strip clubs?

452
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,811
With the economy what it is...

453
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,405
Men will pay for tits
until they're broke or dead.

454
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,721
Fix that, Burton.

455
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,202
You said you wanted to see me?

456
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,808
It's a relatively humane procedure.

457
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,804
We stun the beasts
with a pneumatic captive bolt gun...

458
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,610
One of these.

459
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,361
One bolt to the brain does the trick.

460
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,401
Then we cut them
and they quietly bleed out.

461
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,611
- Listen, um...
- The Old Order Pennsylvania Dutch...

462
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,564
don't like being called "Dutchies."

463
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,966
It's derisive.

464
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,966
I believe I heard you call my father
a "fucking Dutchie."

465
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,882
I was just running my mouth.

466
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,520
I didn't know he was your father.

467
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,887
Now you take your teeth
and put them back...

468
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,401
in your fat, bigoted mouth
and get the fuck out of here.

469
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,128
Back in your mouth, I said.

470
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,807
Why don't you see Mr. Moody out?

471
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,087
You.

472
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,202
- They get your size wrong?
- No, I'm good.

473
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,328
Bring the pants to the Martinizing over
by the diner. They'll take them in for you.

474
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,648
All right, thanks. I'll do that.

475
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,842
Ha, ha. You got any family
coming to the swearing in?

476
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,004
No, I don't have any family...

477
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,290
coming or not.

478
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,242
Well, we'll all be there...

479
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,443
and at Proctor's reception after.

480
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,806
Reception?

481
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,086
Say what you will about Proctor,
but the man knows how to throw a party.

482
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,731
There. Now that's what
a sheriff looks like.

483
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,326
- I do solemnly swear...
- I do solemnly swear...

484
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,165
that I will support,
protect, and defend...

485
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,045
that I will support,
protect, and defend...

486
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,449
the Constitution
and government of the United States...

487
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,126
the Constitution and government
of the United States...

488
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,602
and of the State of Pennsylvania...

489
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,206
that I have no knowledge
of any circumstance...

490
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,840
that I have no knowledge
of any circumstance...

491
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,446
past or present past or present.

492
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,444
That would disqualify me
from the assignment of this office...

493
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,410
that would disqualify me from
the assignment of this office...

494
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,649
- That I have neither given...
- That I have neither given...

495
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,441
nor will give any person
any gratuity, gift, fee, or reward...

496
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,331
in consideration of
support for this office...

497
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,605
nor will give any person
any gratuity, gift, fee, or reward...

498
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,048
in consideration of support
for this office...

499
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,164
that I am duly
qualified to hold office...

500
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,482
that I am duly qualified
to hold office...

501
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,440
- Under the Constitution of the state...
- Under the Constitution of the state...

502
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,126
and that I will well
and faithfully perform...

503
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,282
and that I will well
and faithfully perform...

504
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,522
the duties of Banshee County Sheriff...

505
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,364
the duties of Banshee County Sheriff...

506
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,249
the office of which I now enter...

507
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,050
the office of which I now enter...

508
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,124
so help me God.

509
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,804
Understated as usual.

510
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,088
You just charged the man
with racketeering.

511
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,409
Now you're at his party.
Only in Banshee.

512
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,845
Sheriff Hood.

513
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,171
Mr. Proctor.

514
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,286
This is some shindig.

515
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,920
You'll find that Banshee
is not the backwater town...

516
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,367
it sometimes pretends to be.

517
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,410
You enjoy yourself.

518
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,483
I'll check in on you soon.

519
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,806
Sure.

520
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,329
Sheriff Hood. Gordon Hopewell.

521
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,848
- We met at the swearing in.
- The DA, right?

522
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,288
Honey, come over
and meet our new sheriff.

523
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,170
Hi.

524
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,681
Lucas Hood. Great to meet you.

525
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,084
Carrie?

526
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,129
I'm sorry. I'm not myself tonight.

527
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,442
No? Who are you, then?

528
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,328
Good to meet you, Mrs. Hopewell.

529
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,887
I'm telling you,
there's something wrong with that guy.

530
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,283
He went through the Moody boys
like they were cardboard.

531
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,161
So you're upset that our sheriff
knows how to fight?

532
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,970
It wasn't just fighting, Emmett.

533
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,965
It was fucking combat.

534
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,564
Sheriff Hood...

535
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,407
I'd like you to meet
Chief Benjamin Longshadow...

536
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,244
of the local Kinaho Tribe...

537
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,244
a good friend and a great man
revered in Banshee.

538
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,802
- Good to meet you, chief.
- Likewise, Sheriff Hood.

539
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,247
My son Alex.

540
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,765
- Hi.
- Hey, Alex.

541
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,720
When you get settled, my tribal council...

542
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,247
wants to honor you with a dinner.

543
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,448
On the reservation, of course.

544
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,285
Yeah, um, that sounds great.

545
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,528
Uh, you'll... You'll excuse me?

546
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,889
A sheriff?

547
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,963
Are you kidding me?

548
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,521
They have a great health plan.

549
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,200
You're not gonna need it in prison.

550
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,201
You used to have more faith in me.

551
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,046
- Why are you doing this?
- You know why.

552
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,289
Come here for a sec.

553
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,291
- I don't believe this.
- It's an old Sargent safe.

554
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,125
I can't get in there,
but you could do it in your sleep.

555
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,521
- Jesus.
- Come on, it's the least you can do.

556
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,210
No.

557
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,727
What you're doing is crazy.
If you don't end it, I will.

558
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,886
Yeah? You're in no position
to blow any whistles, Mrs. Hopewell.

559
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,080
You're insane.

560
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,330
Honey...

561
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,924
I'm feeling pretty tired.

562
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,129
You're preaching to the choir.
I think we've stayed long enough.

563
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,242
Kai, thanks for having us.

564
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,120
Sure.

565
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,203
Glad you stopped by.

566
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,249
This isn't awkward at all.

567
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,047
- Oh, my God!
- Proctor!

568
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,409
- Get out of here.
- Just stay there.

569
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,049
Get down, get down.

570
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,521
- Please.
- Dutchie motherfucker!

571
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,082
Taxi!

572
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,529
Knight to rook four.

573
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,281
Yours.

574
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,288
Pishak to queen three.

575
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,925
Yours.

576
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,405
So, no documents...

577
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,521
no software, no hardware.

578
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:32,363
Everything in this hairdresser's, burned?

579
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,010
Yes.

580
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,170
Queen to knight two. Checkmate.

581
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,450
You will find them both...

582
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,090
quickly.
