1
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,121
Mama?

2
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,046
No, no, no. Mama!

3
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,168
No.

4
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,845
Don't let them do this.

5
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,123
Mama, please! Please, Mama, please!

6
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,924
Don't do this, Father.

7
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,049
You did this.

8
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,570
Daddy!

9
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,051
You did this!

10
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,610
Mama!

11
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,411
Mama, don't do this to me!

12
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,291
Mama.

13
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,568
Please.

14
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,526
Don't go.

15
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,330
Please don't.

16
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
- Ana.
- Don't.

17
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,484
We can leave.

18
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,120
Ana, we... We can go anywhere.

19
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,401
This is my anywhere.

20
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,601
Carrie Hopewell is not real.

21
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,649
She's a hiding place.

22
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,128
You have to let me go.

23
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,689
There's nothing in this world that
makes sense if there's no you and me.

24
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,763
Nothing.

25
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,082
You know that, the same way I do.

26
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,811
You're still in there. I know you are.

27
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,449
The whole time I was in prison,
you know what kept me alive?

28
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,649
You, not Carrie Hopewell.

29
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,127
- Ana, your Ana, is dead.
- No.

30
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,009
What we had back then, that's dead.

31
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,764
- That's what's not real.
- No.

32
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,763
- This is what's real.
- You're wrong!

33
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,888
Things change.

34
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,361
I changed.

35
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,130
I know how much you loved me.

36
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,884
I loved you, but I don't anymore.

37
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,008
- I'm not Ana anymore.
- Yes, you are!

38
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,731
You were last night and
I fucking know that!

39
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,121
Last night?

40
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,002
You and I never got a chance
to say goodbye.

41
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,567
That's what last night was, it was goodbye.

42
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,087
And now you have to move on.

43
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,083
What, just like that?

44
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,480
I went to prison for you.

45
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,529
I know. It's not fair.

46
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,001
I'm sorry, but I have a family to protect.

47
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,845
It's my family!

48
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,651
I knew she was mine
the first moment I saw her.

49
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,889
Say it.

50
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,089
She's yours.

51
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,724
She is.

52
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,451
She's yours. I'm sorry.

53
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,241
What did you tell Gordon?

54
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,805
Well, he must have known she wasn't his.

55
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,967
I told him you were dead.

56
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,728
- Perfect.
- Hey.

57
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,442
I was broke and I was pregnant
and I was all alone.

58
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,011
I couldn't fence the diamonds.

59
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,970
If they hit the street,
Rabbit would have been all over me.

60
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,967
Job had given me Carrie,
but I had to find a safe place to stop.

61
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,085
And Gordon,
he just got out of the Marines...

62
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,846
and I was a waitress,
he always came to my restaurant.

63
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,627
I don't wanna hear this shit.

64
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,011
I had to find a safe
home for your daughter!

65
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,887
I didn't fall for him.

66
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,849
I was waiting for you.

67
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,802
Deva came, this beautiful little girl.

68
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,485
My little girl.

69
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,010
He raised her like his own.

70
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,811
She's not his.

71
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,530
She's mine.

72
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,967
It's not about you and me anymore.

73
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,643
How many lives are you willing to destroy
to take back yours?

74
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,964
Look...

75
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,249
do you honestly think Deva
would be better off with you?

76
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,570
I think she deserves to know the truth.

77
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,001
Look at you.

78
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,005
Look at me.

79
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,767
The last thing any of
us needs is the truth.

80
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,889
You say you love me.

81
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,329
If that's true...

82
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,763
the best thing you could do is leave
and forget about Deva and me.

83
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,687
If I don't?

84
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,209
Then what?

85
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,324
You've already turned me into Rabbit.

86
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,641
If you don't, I'll kill you myself.

87
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,641
Stop following me, damn it. You can't...

88
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,010
Hello, Ana.

89
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,127
Olek.

90
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,129
Your father would like to see you.

91
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,921
But he did say
I could kill you if you became a problem.

92
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,163
Are you going to be a problem?

93
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,488
No.

94
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,408
You look good, Ana.

95
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,767
- He has missed you terribly.
- He's insane.

96
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,445
He loves his daughter.

97
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,284
Olek, you can't bring me to him.

98
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,808
- Please.
- We'll take my car.

99
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,570
- Get in.
- I'm not getting in there.

100
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,960
- Olek...
- Yes, you are.

101
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,084
Hey, Olek.

102
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,127
You can stay here as long as you like.

103
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,845
Thank you.

104
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,163
I really didn't have anywhere else to go.

105
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,608
I'd have been offended
if you went anywhere else.

106
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,681
I was just 19 when I left.

107
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,451
These men, thugs, really...

108
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,841
were preying on our farmers'
produce wagons.

109
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,049
They wanted us to pay protection money.

110
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,330
But anyway, I got tired of turning the
other cheek, so one day, I didn't.

111
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,809
I took three of them apart
with an old ball-peen hammer.

112
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,646
You should have seen the looks on their
faces when this Amish kid came at them.

113
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,847
Not what they expected.

114
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,686
But the elders condemned my actions...

115
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,367
wanted me to show contrition
for defending them.

116
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,289
I guess I wasn't built for contrition.

117
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,561
Whatever happens,
you'll always have a home here.

118
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,491
Thank you.

119
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,287
Why don't you get yourself settled?
I'll leave you some lunch downstairs.

120
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,090
I've got to run out for a few hours.

121
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:33,514
When I come back,
we can talk all this through.

122
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,405
- Okay?
- Okay.

123
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,808
He's going to torture you.

124
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,803
You will beg to be killed.

125
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,587
Why don't we, uh,
skip all the ominous threats

126
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,684
and macho bullshit,
stick to the facts?

127
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,764
Good.

128
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,050
- Is Rabbit here?
- No, but he's coming.

129
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,361
Well, he hasn't made any calls today.

130
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,091
No texts, nothing.

131
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,844
He knows where I am.

132
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,647
He gave you everything...

133
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,882
and you pissed all over him.

134
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,769
He's a sadistic fuck and a murderer.

135
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,207
He loved you. We all did.

136
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,806
I was his prisoner and you
were his goddamn warden.

137
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,246
Okay, English, please.

138
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,441
Fuck you!

139
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,131
That's better, thanks.

140
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,286
Great.

141
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,727
Now look what you've done.

142
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,846
What the fuck are you hiding?

143
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,408
Bullshit!

144
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,729
I asked you to leave. I begged you.

145
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,888
He's gonna kill all of us.

146
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,601
- Not if I kill him first.
- Oh, please.

147
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,529
Think about it.

148
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,085
Olek, he put you in the trunk.

149
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,200
He didn't kill you.
He was here to bring you back.

150
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,203
Rabbit must want you before me.

151
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,930
Olek hasn't checked in yet.

152
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,606
- That buys us some time.
- Okay. Time for what?

153
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,161
- We go to New York, we take him out.
- Jesus Christ.

154
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,966
- It's the last thing he's going to expect.
- It's suicide.

155
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,726
- He's gonna be waiting for us.
- So is staying here, Ana.

156
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,726
Oh, my God, my babies, Gordon...

157
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,729
- I've put them all in danger.
- You have.

158
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,604
We were safe until you got here.

159
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,161
How many other mothers
carry guns in their purse?

160
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,369
Or fake license plates in their car?
You knew this day was coming.

161
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,682
You've known it
since the day you landed here.

162
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,289
And every one of those days
you lied to your family, not me.

163
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,562
Carrie Hopewell was never built to last.

164
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,325
You've been on borrowed time
since you got here and you know it.

165
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,880
I love my family.

166
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,963
I'll die to keep them safe.

167
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,004
I won't let anything happen.

168
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,123
I promise.

169
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,082
This room smells of sex.

170
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,129
I wonder...

171
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,729
is it still adultery
if your marriage is a lie?

172
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,848
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

173
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,924
Always sneaking around, you two.

174
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,846
Even back then,
always this forbidden love...

175
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,286
like Shakespeare.

176
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,244
- So romantic.
- We're getting off topic.

177
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,126
I wonder, how do you think he knew?

178
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,367
What?

179
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,047
How did he find out? Rabbit.

180
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,289
You were so careful all the time.

181
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,688
The way you met in his apartment...

182
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,084
the hours you kept,
the special phones you had.

183
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,564
Oh, yeah, I knew about the phones.

184
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,804
You're the one who told him.

185
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,161
Yes.

186
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,408
You were like a brother to me.

187
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,046
And he is like a father to me.

188
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,247
I loved you.

189
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,765
You betrayed us.

190
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,921
Us?

191
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,366
What are you talking about?

192
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,760
How did I betray you?

193
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,127
Who's here?

194
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,926
- Who's here?
- Uh-oh.

195
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,245
- Who is it?
- Shit.

196
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,129
Uh, it's no one. It's no one.

197
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,486
I'll take care of it.

198
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,881
Keep an eye on him, all right?

199
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,321
- Hey.
- Hey. I was just coming to see you.

200
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,006
Yeah, listen, um,
I'm kind of busy right now.

201
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,004
- Can we do this later?
- I really need to talk to you.

202
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,925
Okay, look,
you just can't be here right now.

203
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,970
I've been hearing that a lot today.

204
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,926
Aw, shit.

205
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,170
- I'll give you a lift. Come on.
- To where?

206
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,370
I know it may not seem this way,
but your father loves you very deeply.

207
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,281
He will still kill you, I think.

208
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,684
But this is what love does, right?
It kills us.

209
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,442
- It's gonna kill you.
- What?

210
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,725
You think I don't remember
how you used to look at me?

211
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,645
How you would hug and kiss me
every time you saw me?

212
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,451
That's bullshit.

213
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,523
That's why you told Rabbit about us.

214
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,443
Because you thought it would
clear the field for you.

215
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,251
And that's why you came here alone.

216
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,688
Because you wanted to see me alone.

217
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,009
That's insane.

218
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,409
You're crazy.

219
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,326
Olek, it's okay.

220
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,010
It is.

221
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,802
I know you love me.

222
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,843
I would have been good to you.

223
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,646
You bastard.

224
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,081
- I should kill you right here.
- Kill me.

225
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,802
Help me.

226
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,209
Help me.

227
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,001
I can't.

228
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,122
You should run.

229
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,607
I've been running my whole life.

230
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,201
You should run now.

231
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,885
You don't belong here.

232
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,681
How is he?

233
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,131
This is a sacred ritual.
It's not for outsiders.

234
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,285
I just want to say goodbye.

235
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,602
Please?

236
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,811
He was a great man...

237
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,122
and a good friend.

238
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,051
I know you will continue his work.

239
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,641
Goodbye, Mr. Proctor.

240
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,403
Fuck.

241
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,086
You've been training.

242
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,288
You knew you would have to
face me one day.

243
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,090
Sure, make it all about you.

244
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,809
Your punches are sharp.

245
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,885
You have speed and your balance is good,
but you're still a woman.

246
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,568
So it's not dangerous, not really.

247
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,802
It's just cute.

248
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,442
Cute enough for you?

249
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,723
Why can't we talk at your place?

250
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,442
No, that's... That's, uh, not a good idea.

251
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,726
What, are you married?

252
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,969
No, no. It's, um...

253
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,250
This is not a good time to be around me.

254
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,528
It was a good time
when you were fucking me.

255
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,842
You, uh... You got enough money?

256
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,689
I'm not a whore.

257
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,604
No, no, no. No. Hey, hey, hey.

258
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,366
Oh!

259
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,449
What the hell is wrong with you?

260
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,324
Take the boy and go.

261
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,931
No.

262
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,890
Stay here.

263
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,209
You should hear this.

264
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,805
It's your family too.

265
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,245
Do you know who I am?

266
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,851
I'm your uncle.

267
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,321
Your mother's my sister,
just like Rebecca's yours.

268
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,207
Your mother treats me like trash,
like a stranger.

269
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,567
- Kai!
- Oh, shut up, Miriam.

270
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,690
You haven't spoken my name in 20 years.
There's no reason to start now.

271
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,769
You asked me to speak to her,
and then you shunned her before I could.

272
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,043
When we spoke, I did not know
the full extent of her transgression.

273
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,091
What kind of father turns his back on his
daughter at the time she most needs him?

274
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,722
- Our church is very clear...
- Fuck your goddamn church!

275
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,530
Kai.

276
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,526
Suddenly, everyone remembers my name.

277
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,205
This is not your business.

278
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,882
- Take the girl back.
- She is not a girl.

279
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,280
She is a woman.

280
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,885
And we did not reject her.

281
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,410
You should know as well as anyone
that it was she who rejected our ways...

282
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,800
just as you did.

283
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,442
Yeah.

284
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,725
And now in the absence
of true contrition...

285
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,922
you'll toss her out like garbage.

286
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,526
What about your own contrition?

287
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,445
Who calls you to account
for these inquisitions of yours?

288
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,490
What do you feel when you see me?

289
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,529
Hmm?

290
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,045
Does it even hurt you at all?

291
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,401
My son is dead.

292
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,883
And I finished mourning him years ago.

293
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,808
You are a criminal and a trespasser.

294
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,567
I insist you leave our land at once.

295
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,087
Or what?

296
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,969
Hmm? Or what?

297
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,248
Be careful, Father.

298
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,971
I have swallowed your insults for years...

299
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,522
but don't mistake
my tolerance for weakness.

300
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,884
You all live here
because I choose to allow it.

301
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,090
Not God. It's me, your dead son!

302
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,969
I allow it!

303
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,600
And if I decide I don't
want you here anymore...

304
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,570
there's no God that'll be able
to protect you from me.

305
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,644
I'll show you all what it feels like
to be cast out.

306
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,561
Fuck.

307
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,762
Come on, Anastasia.

308
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,208
You were always such a stubborn girl.

309
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,646
You can't be finished yet.

310
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,441
Sheriff.
I was just coming to see you.

311
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,611
- Listen, I gotta go.
- I was hoping that we could talk.

312
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,337
About what?

313
00:29:57,349 --> 00:29:59,525
My superiors are
starting to take an interest.

314
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,748
I just got word there's
going to be a formal

315
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,651
investigation into
yesterday's shooting.

316
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,007
What, are you fucking kidding me?

317
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,810
They were career criminals.

318
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,086
They're murderers.

319
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,011
That's what you get for making news
during an election year.

320
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,964
Politicians, they love their hearings.

321
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,605
But me, I'm like you.

322
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,888
- See, I like results.
- I really do have to go.

323
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,720
I thought we might combine resources
to figure out what happened...

324
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,202
to that evidence against Proctor.
How it found its way out of a locked room.

325
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,567
- Because that was a tough...
- Okay, listen.

326
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,809
Call Alma, set something up, okay?

327
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,442
- I can't do this right now.
- No, we're gonna talk right now.

328
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,165
I'm starting to wonder about you.

329
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,846
I keep coming up against these walls
everywhere I go...

330
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,955
but I can feel them
starting to crumble.

331
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:42,130
Something tells me
it's gonna be worth it...

332
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,683
to stick around and watch
them all come tumbling down.

333
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,524
Nola.

334
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,240
Hi, Mom.

335
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,370
- When did you get back?
- Just now.

336
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,966
There's still time. You should go to him.

337
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,249
I didn't come here for him, brother.

338
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,841
- Well, he'd be glad to know you're here.
- Which is why I'm not gonna stay.

339
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,407
I'll be crashing at your place.

340
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,644
Let me know when he's dead.

341
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,362
You look just like her.

342
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,921
- What?
- Your mother.

343
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,321
You have her face.

344
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,327
Almost exactly.

345
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,450
I was only a boy when she died...

346
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,847
but I remember her very well.

347
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,411
She was a beautiful woman.

348
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,683
So sad you never got to meet her.

349
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,764
He never got over her death.

350
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,922
When a woman dies in childbirth...

351
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,686
It wasn't my fault.

352
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,128
You were all he had left.

353
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,086
But you were also the
thing that killed her.

354
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,491
Maybe he made mistakes...

355
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,328
but everything he
did, he did out of love.

356
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,687
- It breaks my heart to hit you.
- Then stop.

357
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,564
I can't do it anymore.

358
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,446
Olek, he's gonna kill me.

359
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,688
- He's gonna kill me.
- No.

360
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,845
He will kill you and your family.

361
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,362
You betrayed your family.

362
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,841
You don't deserve to have another one.

363
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,207
You're right...

364
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,084
I did love you.

365
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,607
But there are things in
life bigger than love.

366
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,411
You fight with passion.

367
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,526
Your father would have
been proud to see it.

368
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,082
Don't worry, I will tell him all about it.

369
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,326
Daddy.

370
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,205
Hey.

371
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,330
Hey, I thought that you and Max
were over at the Frears' pool.

372
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,482
Yeah, I got bored.

373
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,042
Max is fine. He's playing with Sammy.

374
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,320
Dad, what is going on?

375
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,051
Well, that...

376
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,851
That's not an easy question to answer.

377
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,048
Did you and Mom have a fight?

378
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,487
No, no, no, baby.

379
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,201
No, nothing like that.

380
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,890
Jesus, you're smoking pot?

381
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,963
Yes, I am.

382
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,689
You know, sometimes when
the pain in my shoulder gets bad...

383
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,602
the only thing that works
is a little bit of really good weed.

384
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,442
It's not something that would help me
get reelected so I'm careful about it.

385
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,689
Your Iraq wound?

386
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,525
Yeah.

387
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,449
Hey.

388
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,491
Here's the thing.

389
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,163
I don't want you to lie to me...

390
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,568
but I'm not really dying
for you to tell me the truth either.

391
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,442
Just...

392
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,166
Just promise me
that everything's gonna be all right.

393
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,209
Shh, shh, shh.

394
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,721
Everything's gonna be all right.

395
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,403
Mm.

396
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,046
What does that mean?

397
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,851
It means "With God's help"
Mm-hm.

398
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,889
"we will drink together again."

399
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,010
When will you learn to speak Ukrainian? Eh?

400
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,811
I'll speak Ukrainian when you sing
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

401
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,201
- Ooh.
- I can sing "The Star-Spangled Banner."

402
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,050
- Listen to this. Listen.
- Do it.

403
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,886
Oh, beautiful America

404
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,850
God bless thee, America

405
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,968
- "God Bless America."
- That's fucking, um...

406
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,605
That's "America the Beautiful."

407
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,730
- You're not trying to speak Ukrainian.
- Listen. America.

408
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,484
A toast.

409
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,004
- Hey.
- Hey.

410
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,690
Hey!

411
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,520
Hey!

412
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,644
What does "budmo" mean anyway?

413
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,407
It means:

414
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,848
"We shall live forever."

415
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,843
I'll drink to that.

416
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,365
Get out.

417
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,047
- Get dressed and get out.
- Why are you doing this?

418
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,651
Get out.

419
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,484
Stop it. You're hurting me!

420
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,246
I'm hurting you? You fucking whore.

421
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,485
- I opened my house to you. I took you in.
- No. Why are you doing this?

422
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,565
You're not here two hours and you're
already out there fucking someone.

423
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,960
That's not what happened.

424
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,209
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying.

425
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,569
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying!

426
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,603
Uncle Kai, wait. Please.

427
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,126
I'm sorry.

428
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,244
I lost my home today.

429
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,410
I miss my family.

430
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,406
I know I don't
belong there anymore, but still...

431
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,402
I don't know where I belong anymore.

432
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,081
I know you know how that felt.

433
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,488
I do.

434
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,401
And there's a part of you
that will never stop feeling like that.

435
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,767
The sheriff...

436
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,684
You can have nothing to do with him.

437
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,810
He's no one to me.

438
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,641
I'm so sorry.

439
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,321
I just... I've never been on my own before.

440
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,164
You're not on your own.

441
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,604
Hello, Anastasia.

442
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,489
I've missed you.

443
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,121
Leave me alone.

444
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,169
You are alone.

445
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,167
You have been alone
ever since you betrayed me.

446
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,721
And now you have betrayed
your husband, your children.

447
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,043
Tell me, is there anyone in your life
you have not betrayed?

448
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,567
No, that's not true. That's not...

449
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,691
My sweet, lost daughter.

450
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,683
You have been lying for so long...

451
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,447
you have no idea what truth is anymore.

452
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,321
You've always been such a stubborn child...

453
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,131
so certain you knew best.

454
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,288
Yes?

455
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,488
And look at you now:

456
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,564
broken, bleeding, finished.

457
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,324
No.

458
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,482
Even now you fight...

459
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,486
when the fight is already lost.

460
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,406
My poor, broken Anastasia.

461
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,929
- My name is Carrie
- No!

462
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,447
Olek.

463
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,681
Ana.

464
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,208
Hey.

465
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,567
Hey.

466
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,321
Come on, Ana, pick up.

467
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,724
Goddamn it.

468
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,448
Ana!

469
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,131
Ana.

470
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,884
Ana. Ana, baby.

471
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,445
Open your eyes.

472
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,965
No, no, no, no.

473
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,487
Baby. Come on. Come on.

474
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,008
Fuck. Jesus. Ana, open your eyes.

475
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,767
Ana. Oh, Jesus Christ,
don't you fucking do this to me.

476
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,288
No. You come back to me now.

477
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,646
You come back.

478
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,041
Ana. Open your eyes. Come on.

479
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,806
Yes.

480
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,041
Ana, Ana.

481
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,720
- Ana.
- It's Carrie.

482
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,570
You're okay. You're okay.

483
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,927
Come on. Come on.

484
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,765
Oh, Jesus.

485
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,641
Okay, okay.

486
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,409
Ana!

487
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,442
Just hold on, baby.

488
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,611
We shall live forever.
