1
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,041
Anastasia?

2
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,606
Stop.

3
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,921
Cuff yourself to the bedpost.

4
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,680
Don't bother.

5
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,721
You look good. Healthy.

6
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,450
Pale, though.

7
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,649
I think maybe you live on the East Coast.

8
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,886
For years I've been
thinking, "Where is she?

9
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,130
Is she close or half the world away?

10
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,443
Is she still nervous when it thunders?

11
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,371
Does she remember our walks
in Coney Island?

12
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,967
Getting borscht from Alexa's?"

13
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,330
They're all there, every last one.

14
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,646
And what do you want in exchange for this?

15
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,484
Just let me go.

16
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,122
He found you faster than I thought.

17
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,401
He did in one week
what I failed to do in 15 years.

18
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,803
True love, huh? Ha, ha.

19
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,440
Just take the diamonds
and consider me dead.

20
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,404
Or what?

21
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,570
You've only given me half of what I want.

22
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,962
I want him.

23
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,929
I can't do that.

24
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,050
If you could, you would be free.

25
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,490
Your word?

26
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,689
My word.

27
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,403
Now, how are you going to get away?

28
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,608
There's something else in the bag for you.

29
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,048
Clever girl.

30
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,530
Bye, Daddy.

31
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,681
- Say, champ. Say, champ.
- Champ!

32
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,882
- Banshee, PA! What's up, baby?
- Mr. Sanchez...

33
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,856
what can you tell us
about this upcoming fight?

34
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,080
What can I tell you about...?
I can tell you'd better...

35
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,761
Benjamin, this fight will cement your
credibility with the Gaming Commission.

36
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,801
Give me another week, and I'll have us
cleared to break ground on the hotel.

37
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,320
I must admit I had my doubts, Kai,
but you pulled it off.

38
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,369
It's our casino.
We're putting up the purse.

39
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,046
- He was just the middleman.
- Alex, enough.

40
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,966
The champ is in the building, ladies and
gentlemen. The champ is in the building.

41
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,088
Mr. Sanchez, Kai Proctor.

42
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,004
- Welcome to Banshee.
- Glad to be here.

43
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,925
This is Benjamin Longshadow.
His tribe runs the Kinaho Moon.

44
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,082
- Chief.
- It's an honor to have you here.

45
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,925
Alex Longshadow. Hey.

46
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,173
Mr. Sanchez,
if you would do us the honor...

47
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,290
a few shots with the
casino in the background.

48
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,927
- Man, of... Come on, man, of course.
- Right this way.

49
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,811
Mr. Proctor, Douglas Dern,
Damien's manager.

50
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,160
- We spoke on the phone.
- We did. Pleasure to meet you.

51
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,363
You said the place was old.
You didn't say ancient.

52
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,922
The Kinaho feel
a powerful connection to their past.

53
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,488
In the case of the Kinaho Moon,
a little too powerful, in my opinion.

54
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,225
I would have preferred
to have the new

55
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:23,087
casino built before we
hosted Mr. Sanchez...

56
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,722
but rest assured the money is real.

57
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,890
Yeah, it had better be.

58
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,486
He's gonna look worse soon, I promise.

59
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,562
Nice casino. Not bad.

60
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,285
Not bad at all.

61
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,686
There it is, baby.

62
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,080
That's where I do my thing.

63
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,850
This way, Mr. Sanchez.

64
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,925
You don't approve.

65
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,243
The hotel. The revenue
it will earn should be for our people.

66
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,626
We shouldn't be including
a man like Proctor.

67
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:12,601
A man like that gets
things done quickly.

68
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,408
We're building something that will
sustain our tribe for years to come.

69
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,681
When I go to the spirits,
I want to have seen the start of it all.

70
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,331
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer a hotel?
It's just a quick call.

71
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,926
- I can have you in the presidential suite.
- No, no, no.

72
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,009
My trailer goes wherever I go.

73
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,288
I don't like to be too pampered
before a fight.

74
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,160
Besides,
there'll be plenty of time for

75
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:30,126
that after I put
Hollister's noose up there.

76
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,487
As agreed.

77
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,164
Thank you.

78
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,524
I think I like this town.

79
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,007
We also made
some improvements on your bedroom.

80
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,686
I think you will be pleased.

81
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,761
Amazing Grace

82
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,809
How sweet...

83
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,691
Now I know I like this town.

84
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:06,960
That saved a wretch like me

85
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,170
I once was lost

86
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,448
But now am found

87
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Was blind, but now I see

88
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,402
'Twas Grace that taught...

89
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,526
Senator, you have the department's
deepest sympathies.

90
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,770
- Mrs. Schumacher, I'm so, so sorry.
- Sorry for your loss.

91
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,565
Sorry, ma'am.

92
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,571
- Sheriff Hood.
- Gordon.

93
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,766
Hi, Deva.

94
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,571
It's a pretty tough day for everyone.

95
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,563
Yep.

96
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,051
Say, why don't you join us
for dinner tonight?

97
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,811
Nothing fancy.
I'm just gonna grill out some burgers.

98
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,407
- Oh, honey, you know...
- That sounds great.

99
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,164
Thanks, Gordon.

100
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,686
Why don't we say about 6?

101
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,411
- Sure. See you there.
- Good.

102
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,844
So how do you like your burger, sheriff?

103
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,968
Uh, medium rare, thanks.

104
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,449
- Can I see your gun?
- Yeah, sure.

105
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,082
No. Thank you.
You don't need to see his gun.

106
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,891
Hey, hon, why don't you, uh,
grab the sheriff another beer?

107
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,122
I'll get it, Mom.

108
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,721
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

109
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,567
Here you go.

110
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,007
- Thank you.
- Yep.

111
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,361
So, Deva, how are you doing?

112
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,204
I don't know.

113
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,284
I still can't believe it.

114
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,841
It takes some time.

115
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,969
- Deva, honey, would you go get...
- Yeah.

116
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,122
Hold on, Maxie.

117
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,608
Nice and deep, bubba.

118
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,210
You okay?

119
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,408
That's the way.

120
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,364
You good?

121
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,721
What's wrong with him?

122
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,048
It's been happening
since he was a toddler.

123
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,571
Is he...? Is he okay?

124
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,330
He has good days and bad days.

125
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,883
Huh.

126
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,240
Hey, Max, why don't you go ahead
and touch the gun, just for a second.

127
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,286
Yeah. Ha, ha.

128
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,326
You know, sheriff,
we never got a chance to thank you...

129
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,801
for pulling Deva out of that mess
the other night.

130
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,851
Ah. So how did the arraignments go?

131
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,169
Well, all the men you arrested
identified this guy Hanson...

132
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,924
but apparently he's long gone.

133
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,367
And either they don't know
or won't talk about...

134
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,329
where the Skulls came from.

135
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,130
It's not that I can't guess.

136
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,045
Whores, gambling, drugs.

137
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,330
All crooked roads in Banshee
lead to one man, and that's Kai Proctor.

138
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,882
I'll get us some more drinks, eh?

139
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,762
Great.

140
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,444
- Alone at last.
- Shut up.

141
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,807
What happened?

142
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,565
Heavy bag workout.

143
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,127
Unh, not unless it was a bag of bones.

144
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,765
Ana...

145
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,524
it's me.

146
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,406
Mm, no, you're different.

147
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,721
How?

148
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,402
You used to be kind.

149
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,806
You know...

150
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,570
you get locked up...

151
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,688
forgotten about for 15 years...

152
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,405
see how kind you feel after that.

153
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,609
- Now, I know you're angry, but...
- Angry?

154
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,882
You have no fucking idea.

155
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,441
- Hey, where are you going?
- Uh, I got a call. Thanks for the food.

156
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,642
Look, um, you wanna talk about it?

157
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,925
Drinking alone?

158
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,526
To keeping secrets.

159
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,523
Hey, um...

160
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,210
Rebecca.

161
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,724
Rebecca.

162
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,129
I think you should go home.

163
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,521
No, you don't.

164
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,287
What, are you saving yourself for someone?

165
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,641
- Rebecca, we can't...
- Shut up.

166
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,642
Look, you told me to call
if she came back again.

167
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,007
Well, she's back.

168
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,768
Hi, Uncle Kai.

169
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,084
Don't you think you're getting a little
too old for this rebel streak of yours?

170
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,321
That's rich coming from you.

171
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,247
Whatever you may think,
my choices have cost me dearly.

172
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,325
Yeah. You're really hurting.

173
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,370
My mother lives just 10 miles
away from me.

174
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,569
I haven't seen or spoken to her
in over 20 years.

175
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,685
My father, when I run into him,
won't even fucking look at me.

176
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,481
My sister, your mother,
denies I even exist.

177
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,883
Yeah, well, that's why
they call it being shunned.

178
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,087
Show some respect!

179
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,369
I'm sorry, uncle.

180
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,524
You can't begin
to understand how alone I am.

181
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,562
I've lost count of the people I hurt
and still I hurt people every day.

182
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,963
You have no idea
what that does to you inside.

183
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,886
It's like a blade in your belly
that has gradually scraped you raw.

184
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,406
I'm not buying it, uncle.

185
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,161
You have everything
you've ever wanted.

186
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,809
You're free.

187
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,889
Why don't you just admit
that you like being bad?

188
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,408
Do you realize
no one else can talk to me like that?

189
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,485
You're the only person
who isn't scared of me.

190
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,802
The only one.

191
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,843
I'll drive you home.

192
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,568
I want to welcome
our Camp Genoa Marines...

193
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,963
to view a private sparring session
with the champ.

194
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,770
All right, ladies and gentlemen...

195
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,169
let me introduce a man
who needs no introduction.

196
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,891
Two-time cruiservveight
champion of the world...

197
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,327
honorary referee for
this weekend's fight...

198
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,927
Banshee's own Sugar Bates!

199
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,170
Now, a special gift for Mr. Sanchez...

200
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,369
from our sponsors
at Stark-Himmel Timepieces:

201
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,002
A solid gold watch
with a one-of-a-kind diamond bezel...

202
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,128
designed especially for the champ.

203
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,005
This is yours. Wear it well.

204
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,091
You got my invitation for the cocktail
party tomorrow and the fight on Saturday?

205
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,244
- I did.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

206
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,483
Hey, listen, man, I wanna give
a semper fi to all my jarheads...

207
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,405
- From Banshee's Camp Genoa, all right?
- Ooh-rah!

208
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,245
Seems like you're always
hosting something around here.

209
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,964
Y'all ready to see me whup some ass?

210
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,009
Yeah!

211
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,049
You just came in to see him train?

212
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,601
No. Actually, I came to see you.

213
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,245
You heard about the Schumacher boy
OD'ing, right?

214
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,287
Yeah, I did. It's terrible.

215
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,488
Proctor, you told me you had a talent
for resolving problems here in Banshee.

216
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,440
I was kind of hoping
you could help me with this one.

217
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,651
I found these in the dead boy's pocket.

218
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,042
The kids call them Skulls.

219
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,646
You ever seen pills like that before?

220
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,161
Are you asking me or accusing me?

221
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,687
Heh. Why, I'm asking you, Kai.

222
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,442
Just don't play games with me, sheriff.
I'm well aware of Mayor Kendall's agenda.

223
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,210
Oh, this has nothing to do
with Kendall.

224
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,761
The boy means well, but he's an idiot.

225
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,127
On that at least I'm sure we can agree.

226
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,521
So if you'll excuse me...

227
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,687
I'm busy trying to bring
good things to Banshee.

228
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,290
Thanks for your time.

229
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,210
Oh!

230
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,801
- Asshole.
- What?

231
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,247
You gotta watch me.
If you blink, it's over.

232
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,404
He didn't have to hit him that hard.
They're just sparring.

233
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,922
Damn, I'm out of partners.

234
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,650
Here! Sarge will take you on!

235
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,284
Hey, hey, hey.

236
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,363
Ahem. 5-0.

237
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,204
Yeah, sheriff.

238
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,210
You want a shot at the title?

239
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,329
Huh? You can't throw a few punches?

240
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,809
Go easy on him.
I'd be scared of me too.

241
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,485
You're the champ!

242
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,646
The sheriff too smart.
He don't wanna step in the ring.

243
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,404
He don't want none of this.

244
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,725
Excuse me, excuse me.

245
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,450
Hey. Can you come here?

246
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,045
Hey, hey. Hey, doll.

247
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,521
- How you doing? What's your name?
- Chloe.

248
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,126
Hey, uh, Chloe,
can you bring me a bottle of champagne?

249
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,049
Sure. I'll be right back.

250
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,730
No, doll.

251
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,564
Can you bring it to my trailer?

252
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,926
Say, tonight around 11?

253
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,769
- All right, Mr. Sanchez.
- All right, Chloe.

254
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,246
All right.

255
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,005
Come on in.

256
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,680
Hmm.

257
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,524
Must be 11.

258
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,962
They're all there.

259
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,563
Just take them and go.

260
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,246
You can start a new life somewhere.

261
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,964
You deserve that after everything
you've been through.

262
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,966
You think you can buy me off?

263
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,406
Huh?

264
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,728
You listen to me.

265
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,562
I'm not going anywhere.

266
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,922
So take your fucking diamonds
and get out.

267
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,765
You want a bump?

268
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,210
I never have.

269
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,245
I'll try.

270
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,644
Yeah, fuck me harder.

271
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,651
Heh. No, no, no, no.

272
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,929
No, doll, no. Not like that.

273
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,482
Like this.

274
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,924
You like it like that?

275
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,447
Fuck me harder!

276
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,044
Ah, you're hurting me.

277
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,724
No! Get off me!

278
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,123
- Stop it!
- Shut the fuck up!

279
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,801
- Fucking bitch!
- Ah!

280
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,005
Oh, my head!

281
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,169
We have combed the entire building,
reviewed all security footage.

282
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,846
She left absolutely nothing behind.

283
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,401
But she came.

284
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,165
She walked right into the lion's den.

285
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,404
He has become a threat to her.

286
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,682
He has been locked up for 15 years.

287
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,160
He's sick with love.

288
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,322
He is reckless.

289
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,608
And rusty.

290
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,563
He'll make a mistake.

291
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,848
He already did.

292
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,526
He scared her.

293
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,767
I thought this was your day off.

294
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,646
I don't have much of a social life.

295
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,602
Do you miss being home?

296
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,048
You don't really talk about it.

297
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,011
It must be hard coming to a new town
not knowing anyone.

298
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,285
I'm used to being alone.

299
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,685
I'll never get used to it.

300
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,084
- Sheriff.
- Yeah.

301
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,720
You need to get over to the hospital.

302
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,804
Chloe, I'm so sorry
I have to ask these questions.

303
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,087
I'm almost done, okay?

304
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,722
So you and Mr. Sanchez,
being in bed together was consensual?

305
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,527
Until it got rough.

306
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,329
I did something wrong and he just...

307
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,562
Chloe, look at me.

308
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,769
You did nothing wrong, okay?

309
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,489
He kicked me and then he punched me.

310
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,567
I was crawling. I was trying to get
away, but he... He wouldn't let...

311
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,165
Then he took the champagne bottle...

312
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,124
Okay.

313
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,607
I'm gonna go, uh, talk to your nurse, okay?

314
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,887
Hey, hey, hey. We've got nothing.

315
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,929
Even the overflow lot is filled.

316
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,970
You're gonna wanna try down the way... Hey!

317
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,929
Found a spot.

318
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,608
Oh, crap.

319
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,169
Sheriff Hood.

320
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,726
I've heard about the girl.

321
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,445
How is she?

322
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,967
Well, she looks like she
was hit by a train.

323
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,030
I know this is a delicate situation,

324
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,025
but I'm going to ask you to arrest
Sanchez after the fight tomorrow night.

325
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,082
- What?
- Yeah, I know how it sounds...

326
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,130
but Banshee needs this fight to happen.

327
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,851
Too many people and businesses
stand to lose if it doesn't.

328
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,880
- Are you out of your mind? That girl...
- Hey, deputy, give us a minute.

329
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,485
- You're gonna discuss this...
- Hey.

330
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,921
- You saw what he did to that girl.
- Calm down right now.

331
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,327
Are you just another one
of Proctor's yes-men now? That it?

332
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,766
"Meet the new boss,
same as the old boss."

333
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,527
Sheriff, I just wanted to thank you
for your discretion.

334
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,409
These things can always be handled.

335
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,403
"These things"?

336
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,130
So this has happened before?

337
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,884
You know the deal.

338
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,320
Tomorrow I'll go visit the girl.

339
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,522
She'll put on a show, but ultimately...

340
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,486
it always comes down
to the number in their

341
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,400
mind from the moment
they decided to fuck him.

342
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,528
- Yeah? Dern, right?
- Yeah.

343
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,923
Yeah, you need to go somewhere
I can't see you and stay there.

344
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,526
Hey, I mean, come on...

345
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,411
- Hood.
- Hey, hey.

346
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,411
Five-O, that was not cool.

347
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,369
Benny was just doing his job.
What the fuck?

348
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,005
You're under arrest
for rape and aggravated assault.

349
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,649
I'm under arrest?

350
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,405
Okay.

351
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,410
Yeah, I'm under arrest. All right, yeah.

352
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,204
Come and get me.

353
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,448
Sheriff.

354
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,250
Sheriff.

355
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,366
Gotta watch me.

356
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,448
That is cute. I like that.

357
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,129
Looks like you're not too smart after all.

358
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,247
This what you wanna do?

359
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,765
Ladies and gentlemen, amateur hour.

360
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,763
Let's go.

361
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,528
Come on, sheriff, let's go.

362
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,043
Get up, bitch!

363
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,844
Get out of my way. Move! Move.

364
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,331
Hood.

365
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,248
Get the fuck off of me.

366
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,562
Come on, Champ.

367
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,688
Fuck.

368
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,048
You like hitting little girls?

369
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,129
Huh?

370
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,121
You motherfucker!

371
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,643
Oh. my God!

372
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,121
Hood, enough!

373
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,607
Meet the new boss.

374
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,681
This is Deputy Kelly. We need
an ambulance at the Kinaho Moon Casino.

375
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,521
Sugar here. Come on.

376
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,244
I got you.

377
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,643
All right. Let's walk, hmm?

378
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,806
All right.

379
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,766
So you're just the kind of guy
who makes friends wherever he goes, huh?

380
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,048
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah, it's all right.

381
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,724
- Shit.
- Just open the door.

382
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,083
Come on.

383
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,043
Whoo.

384
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,720
Whoa. I always wanted
to drive one of these.

385
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,004
You cost me a referee gig tonight, brother.

386
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,845
And I could have used the scratch.

387
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,484
Ha. Alrighty.

388
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,331
Here we go.

389
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,926
- What's going on, Kai?
- He in there?

390
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,165
Yeah, but, uh, he's not fit for a visit.

391
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,765
So now you're his gatekeeper?

392
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,763
It's okay, Sugar.

393
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,362
It's all right.

394
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,966
You cost a lot of people
a lot of money tonight.

395
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,049
You cost me a lot of money tonight.

396
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,528
Why don't you take it up with Sanchez.

397
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,762
Can I help you with something, Mr. Proctor?

398
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,967
I always had very good relations
with your predecessors.

399
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,805
Yeah, you bought them.

400
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,080
Sometimes laws need to be bent or broken
for the greater good.

401
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,083
I know you agree with that.

402
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,005
No. No, you know nothing about me.

403
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,084
Well, clearly not as much as I should.

404
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,842
There's a lot you don't know as well.

405
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,766
My family's been here for 160 years.

406
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,082
I've lived here my entire life.

407
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,322
I am this town.

408
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,883
I helped build it and I bled for it.

409
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,322
Have you ever loved anything like that?

410
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,129
I have.

411
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,047
You see, people here don't always approve
of the way I go about things.

412
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,204
But from what I've seen
since you got here...

413
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,440
you're not very different
from me in that regard.

414
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,565
So what puzzles me is why you seem
to hold me in such contempt.

415
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,691
I have no contempt for you.

416
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,088
I'm just not afraid of you.

417
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,160
I think maybe you're not used to that.

418
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,444
See, you call yourself a businessman...

419
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,887
and you dress well, you speak well...

420
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,089
but you're still
nothing but a petty thug.

421
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,084
You've been doing it so long,
you actually think it makes sense...

422
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,120
to show up here
in the middle of the night...

423
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,528
and ask me why you can't own me
like you own everyone else.

424
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,042
That makes you delusional...

425
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,961
which makes you dangerous.

426
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,929
Why would I want to get in bed
with someone like that?

427
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,641
Sheriff, do you know why
they're afraid of me?

428
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,369
Why is that?

429
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,326
Because they should be.

430
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,887
And maybe you should be too.

431
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,724
Why don't you show me why right now?

432
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,285
Nah.

433
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,964
I haven't given up on you just yet.

434
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,921
You have a good night.

435
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,921
You're not understanding me. He's done.

436
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,484
He's done permanently!

437
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,689
The sheriff fucked him up really bad.

438
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,043
I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it myself.

439
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,926
No, look, look.
They already arrested him.

440
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,570
I'm cutting my fucking losses.

441
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,161
I never should've come
to this jerkwater town.

442
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,731
I gotta call you back.

443
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,360
- Mr. Dern.
- I'm a little busy here.

444
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,403
I imagine so. I won't waste your time.

445
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,130
I'm here to pick up the satchel.

446
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,562
What the fuck are you talking about?

447
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,401
You were paid an agreed-upon sum of cash
to deliver the fight to the Kinaho Moon.

448
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,369
Clearly, the fight is off.

449
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,040
And while Mr. Proctor does not hold...

450
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,205
Mr. Sanchez's reckless behavior
against you personally...

451
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,170
he does expect his money to be returned.

452
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,243
Well, listen to me, little man.

453
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,767
Proctor assured me
that he'd buy us enough time...

454
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,163
to pay off that little skank,
so he's the one that didn't come through.

455
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,765
And as far as the money...

456
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,048
tell him it's the
cost of doing business.

457
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,126
And if he knows what's good for him,
he'll leave it at that.

458
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,009
Now I'm gonna go finish packing...

459
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,369
so I can get the fuck out of this shithole!

460
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,089
What are you doing here, asshole?

461
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,449
I told you... What the fuck is that?

462
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,120
Hey, wait. Now, now, don't.
Come on. Just back off.

463
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,886
Hey... Ow! Ahh! Ahh!

464
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,201
Ahh, don't! Stop!
