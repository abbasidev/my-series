1
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,769
- Yeah?
- I'm at the county line.

2
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,610
Seventeen minutes since they got off 80.

3
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,882
You should have them
in about 30 seconds.

4
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,008
- No stops?
- Same route four days running.

5
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,527
Does this entire town
smell like cow shit?

6
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,768
Yeah, you got to stay upwind.

7
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,084
Okay, I have them.

8
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,409
And they're waiting.

9
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,210
And there he is.

10
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,091
- The old man?
- And the son. Same drill.

11
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,528
Sounds like somebody
got micromanagement issues.

12
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,042
Wherever we do hit them, it won't be here.

13
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,283
Baby, before they see you
is always your best bet.

14
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,364
Not with all that hardware.
We're gonna have to take them on the road.

15
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,727
Who the fuck is that?

16
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,089
That's Sugar. He's with us.

17
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,327
And when did we become
a motherfucking committee?

18
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,285
- Did I miss a vote?
- You'll meet soon enough. Don't worry.

19
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,563
Sounds older than God and you
call him Sugar. Why should I be worried?

20
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,929
I'm sorry. All the other
potty mouth drag queens were busy.

21
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,447
Hmm, repartee.

22
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,568
How motherfucking exciting.

23
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,644
Do you have any idea
what it takes to crack a truck like that?

24
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,802
No, none at all. That's why you're here.

25
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,047
This sucks. All right?

26
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,567
Can't we go back
to the city, man? Any city.

27
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,802
We could do a bank, do diamonds.

28
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,610
Something more suited to our skills.

29
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,564
This is a stagecoach.

30
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,047
It's the motherfucking
Wild West up in here.

31
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,851
Hey, we're rebuilding. Raising capital.

32
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,128
- We're slumming.
- You wanted in, Job.

33
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,442
Only because I had to torch my salon...

34
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,284
thanks to you, motherfucker.

35
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,847
Cost of doing business.

36
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,530
Fuck you.

37
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,650
Fuck each and every one of you.

38
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,726
- There you go.
- Thank you.

39
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,208
Come on. Let's go, you guys.

40
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,931
- Don't fall behind.
- Hurry up!

41
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,321
Hey, Mom.
Why do they wear those masks?

42
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,806
They're banshee masks.

43
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,008
The evil spirit of a murdered Kinaho bride.

44
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,969
- Deva.
- What, Mom? He can take it.

45
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,202
Yeah, Mom, I can take it.

46
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,721
- It's just a legend.
- What's the legend?

47
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,042
Just that the spirit
of the murdered Kinaho bride...

48
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,607
stayed behind to haunt
the white men who killed her.

49
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,411
So naturally we turned it into a festival.

50
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,530
That is one sweet-ass MILF.

51
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,648
- Fuck off, douchebag.
- Deva!

52
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,165
What? They're being assholes.

53
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,970
Yes, and we don't need
to encourage them.

54
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,043
- Here you go, Mrs. Moody.
- Thanks.

55
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,010
- Their pies are so good.
- Yeah.

56
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,163
Hi. Last year
you had some terrific peach cobbler.

57
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,724
- How much?
- Five dollars.

58
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,722
Only 20 and she's had problems.

59
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,724
Mr. Proctor.

60
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,885
Oh, hello, Alex. Good to see you.

61
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,441
- Can I get you a sandwich?
- Oh, no, thank you.

62
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,370
I haven't seen Benjamin.

63
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,562
My father's not feeling well today.

64
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,645
But he did hear about your legal issues
and asked me to look in on you.

65
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,290
You tell him I appreciate that...

66
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,602
but I fully expect the case
to be dropped shortly.

67
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,240
Maybe so, but it is a murder charge.

68
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,971
So I'm sure that you can understand...

69
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,607
that your involvement in the casino
expansion is now an impossibility.

70
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,524
It's too much exposure for us.

71
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,251
I'm a silent partner,
as you like to point out.

72
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,243
So I don't really follow your logic.

73
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,767
Banshee's a small town.

74
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,922
These things have a way of coming out.

75
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,607
We simply can't allow you to be involved.

76
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,570
But I already am involved, Alex.

77
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,568
No.

78
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,882
I don't think so.

79
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,610
If that were true, I'd know about it.

80
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,842
After all, I'm next in line to be chief.

81
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,328
I'll give my father your best.

82
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,806
- Sorry I'm late.
- Sheriff Hood, we're just getting started.

83
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,484
This is, uh, Special Agent Dean Xavier
with the FBI.

84
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,286
What's the FBI's interest in Kai Proctor?

85
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,887
I coordinate with the DEA
and the Philadelphia P.D. on narcotics.

86
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,964
Every few years,
Proctor's name comes across my desk...

87
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,804
but we can never tie him to anything.

88
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,564
Now we've got him for murder.

89
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,961
Are you still going forward
with the grand jury?

90
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,485
I am.

91
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,802
Can't say the case
hasn't been compromised...

92
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,456
but we've still got the victim's hand
and Webber's cell phone.

93
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,244
Your case was circumstantial at best.

94
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,528
Even with the eyewitness.
Now that you've lost him...

95
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,887
The goddamn wall
was brought down with C4.

96
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,909
Please,
you couldn't have done any better.

97
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:45,721
I wouldn't have been
there to begin with.

98
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,082
A roadside motel? Seriously?

99
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,005
Hey, did you come here
to piss on my department?

100
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,888
I apologize, Deputy Lotus.

101
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,202
I didn't mean to imply
that you were at fault here.

102
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,330
Yeah? Well, I was the only one there.

103
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,845
And that's why I'm here now.

104
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,842
Look, I'm sure you're all
very good at your jobs.

105
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,649
Sheriff,
you've been here less than a month,

106
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:09,096
you've got Proctor
by the short hairs.

107
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,521
Frankly, the Bureau
should steal a page from your book.

108
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,762
Is that why you're here?

109
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,570
To steal a page?

110
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,208
Your lost witness
raised some eyebrows in my office.

111
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,441
This is bullshit.

112
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,207
I've been sent here to monitor the
situation until the grand jury is in.

113
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,283
You want to keep an eye on things,
that's your business.

114
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,168
Just do it at a safe distance.

115
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,766
From what I hear about you,
that'd have to be pretty damn far.

116
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,643
We're all on the same side here, right?

117
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,730
- That it?
- Ahem.

118
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,724
Look, this doesn't have to be a thing.

119
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,770
Yeah, well, it is to me.

120
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,287
Don't worry, Gordon.

121
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,289
It's not.

122
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,210
You believe this shit?

123
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,840
Don't worry about Xavier.
He'll be gone in a few days.

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,889
- Grand jury won't take long.
- Hey.

125
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,168
You think I fucked up here?

126
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,685
I think we fucked up.

127
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,410
And by we, you mean me, right?

128
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,683
No, we should've had Webber
on lockdown at the Cadi.

129
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,808
- That's on me.
- So let's go find him.

130
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,964
Whoever took out that wall
didn't do it to leave Webber alive.

131
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,360
So, what, we do nothing?

132
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,569
You heard Hopewell. The physical
evidence is enough. We're okay.

133
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,441
Proctor's out on bail, our witness is gone,
we're not okay.

134
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,011
Webber got taken from me.

135
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,771
You got rolled, Brock.
It happens. Shake it off.

136
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,729
That the sum total
of your reaction to this?

137
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,245
It is.

138
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,562
- Shit happens, huh?
- Yup.

139
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,406
Hello, Mr. Bates.

140
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,403
How you doing there, Mrs. Hopewell?

141
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,961
- How's the cider this year?
- Oh, it's got some kick to it.

142
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,770
- Yeah?
- Mm.

143
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,083
- Mm. That's pretty good.
- Heh.

144
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,720
Mom, Max wants a buggy ride.

145
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,769
- Oh, I don't know.
- Come on, it's a fair.

146
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,729
I'll take him. It'll be fine.

147
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,726
- You have your inhaler?
- I left it in the car.

148
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,891
Okay, you guys go and have fun.
I'll grab it and catch up with you.

149
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,691
Okay. Cool. Come on, buddy.

150
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,564
Nice kids.

151
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,166
- Mr. Bates.
- Call me Sugar.

152
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,810
Okay, I'll call you Sugar.

153
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,611
Listen, Sugar, about the other night.

154
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,762
You got nothing to worry about.

155
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,486
I have plenty to worry about.

156
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,326
Yeah, well, I suppose you do.

157
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,323
But what I'm saying is...

158
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,324
you ain't got nothing
to worry about with me.

159
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,326
Thank you.

160
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,806
No.

161
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,122
On the house.

162
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,560
Aw, she got some treats for us.

163
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,769
Hey, is that our friendly
neighborhood MILF?

164
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,922
Wait a minute, baby.
Where you going?

165
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,561
- Excuse me.
- Mm-mm.

166
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,804
You want to smoke some weed with us,
honey?

167
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:26,730
Get out of my way.

168
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,848
- You're making a mistake.
- Yeah?

169
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,725
She put you down, man.

170
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,769
Let go of me!

171
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,048
- Get her over there.
- Fuck you!

172
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,248
No, fuck you.

173
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,046
- Get away. Unh.
- Come on, girl.

174
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,002
You don't want to do this.
Back the fuck off.

175
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,488
- Man, this bitch is in shape.
- Fuck you!

176
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,686
I guess you picked
the wrong street to go down.

177
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,723
Don't fucking move, bitch.

178
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,649
What's going on here?

179
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,571
Mind your business, old man.

180
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,927
What say we let this lady join her children
and I'll buy you all some cider?

181
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,771
I asked you once nicely to get the fuck...

182
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,048
- Leave him alone.
- Shut your mouth, bitch.

183
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,966
All right, let her go now.

184
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,646
Heh. That's it, man.

185
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,608
All right. All right. No.

186
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,762
No, no, no. I don't want no trouble now.

187
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,082
So we got ourselves a fighter.

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,286
Are you any good?

189
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,171
In my day.

190
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,645
My companion Schroeder here boxes.

191
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,649
What do you say?

192
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,081
Come on. Get them up, old man.

193
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,447
Get them up, motherfucker.

194
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,160
All right, look...

195
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,964
Impressive, old man.

196
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,843
What do you say we just, uh, let her go...

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,809
and we call it a day? We call it a day.

198
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,965
Sugar!

199
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,525
Get back over here.

200
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,523
Lie still, bitch.

201
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,160
I'm not finished with her yet.

202
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,961
- Tally craves some intimacy.
- Ow!

203
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,002
You sick fuck.

204
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,083
Shh.

205
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,289
- Relax, baby.
- I said get the fuck off of me!

206
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,251
That man needs an ambulance.

207
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,526
We all have needs, baby.

208
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,250
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

209
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,084
Yeah? Maybe later, baby.

210
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,050
But right now, this ass is mine.

211
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,846
Police! Drop the gun!

212
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,966
I said drop the gun.

213
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,805
You okay?

214
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,088
- Hey, is she okay?
- I'm fine.

215
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,402
I'm fine.

216
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,680
Jesus. You look like shit.

217
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,764
Yeah, I've been hit worse.

218
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,321
Look, uh, call Oakey, will you?

219
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,847
The number's on the back of the register.

220
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,606
He can look after The Forge
till I get back.

221
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,489
Sure. Okay.

222
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,128
Hey, what happened?

223
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,726
He tried to...

224
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,445
He had a gun...

225
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,728
and she showed up
before I could take him out.

226
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,651
- One guy?
- No.

227
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,882
There was like four of them. Five.

228
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,327
Sugar took out two
before this other guy showed up.

229
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,567
Mom!

230
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,764
Yeah. Hey.

231
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,766
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

232
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,688
He had a gun. He was on top of her.

233
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,649
No, it's all right. It's fine.

234
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,565
It was him or you. You're good.

235
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,927
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

236
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,531
It's just... He didn't drop it.

237
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,284
He was assaulting a woman.

238
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,761
He was armed. You did your job.

239
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,487
Hey, none of us here would have
done it any differently, all right?

240
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,005
Yeah, get her out of here.

241
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,407
Come on.

242
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,286
I did a quick canvass,
in case you were wondering.

243
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,330
They, uh, all cleared out
pretty quickly after it all went down.

244
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,047
- All right. We know them?
- Yeah, they've been through before.

245
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,240
Itinerant, town to town.
You know, looking to party.

246
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,240
We book one or two
of them from time to time...

247
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,280
on a D and D,
they spend a night in the tank.

248
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,289
But nothing like this before.

249
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,842
- How do I find them?
- I or we?

250
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,727
We can put out an APB,
but by the time we get a hit...

251
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,168
they could be all the way to Pittsburgh
or out of the state, so...

252
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,207
Let me know if you get anything back.

253
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,090
Will do.

254
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,447
Fuck Tally.

255
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,927
He decided to go for the broad
and he got burned.

256
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,401
- Now they'll be looking for our asses.
- Yup.

257
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,281
That woman and the boxer guy,
they can finger us.

258
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,444
- Oh, bullshit.
- I'm with Biggs. We need to get gone.

259
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,364
We need to fucking roll.

260
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,682
Listen to you guys.
We took an oath, man.

261
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,491
- What are you talking about?
- Hey, fuck Tally.

262
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,290
Will you shut the fuck up?

263
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,329
Just shut the fuck up.

264
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,007
Tally went down for it
and now they're gonna be looking for us?

265
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,686
Maybe so. But Tally was our brother.

266
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,484
He wore the ring.

267
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,450
And all we have is the road and each other.

268
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,171
- That's it. That is fucking it, right?
- He's right.

269
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,564
So nobody is going anywhere
until our brother is avenged.

270
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,921
Look, Tally is dead...

271
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,321
and they're having
their little festival?

272
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,170
No.

273
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,601
I don't think so.

274
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,969
- To Tally.
- Tally.

275
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,730
- To Tally.
- To Tally.

276
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,407
- Hey.
- Hey.

277
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,607
How you doing?

278
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,848
You know, just trying to
get this report done.

279
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,016
You shoot one guy,
they want you to write a book about it.

280
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,804
Tell me about it.

281
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,087
I've never killed anyone before.

282
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,722
He had a gun pointed at you.

283
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,922
I know. I know.

284
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,248
Look, killing someone
shouldn't be easy.

285
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,241
But don't let that
make you doubt what you did.

286
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,289
You won't forget the guy you killed.

287
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,602
That's yours.

288
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,366
But don't forget the
woman you saved either.

289
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,284
It's not just that.

290
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,805
There's something else.

291
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,724
It's like the way she was fighting him.

292
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,649
And then we found
his gun's clip ejected.

293
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,087
I don't know. It's like...

294
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,726
It was like she...

295
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,329
I got to head out on patrol with Emmett.

296
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,369
Why don't you stay around here today?

297
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,966
Let things settle.

298
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,282
Sounds good.

299
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,723
Fuck!

300
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,001
- What happened?
- A flat.

301
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,640
I only saw one of them.

302
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,170
Any idea where they might be?

303
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,368
No. But I'll start looking.

304
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,249
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm coming with.

305
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,368
No, that's not a good idea.

306
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,763
I'm the only real native here and I know
this county better than either of you.

307
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,924
Hey. I'll join Brock at the festival.

308
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,970
Stay in touch.

309
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,081
Hood, look out!

310
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,441
Hey, you okay?

311
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,806
(Hey. He)'

312
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,367
Ladies and gentlemen.

313
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,610
- Please settle down.
- We'll settle down when you tell us...

314
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,649
what you're going to do
to protect this town.

315
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,191
Yeah!

316
00:26:05,203 --> 00:26:07,849
Everybody's gonna have
a chance to be heard.

317
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,486
They trashed my fruit stand.
Who's gonna pay for that?

318
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,041
They haven't been arrested.
What if they come back?

319
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,565
You need to cancel the festival.

320
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,927
There's no need to cancel the festival.

321
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,242
My office is going to be
processing any and all...

322
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,846
reasonable claims of property loss.

323
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,282
- Look...
- Ladies. Ladies, gentlemen.

324
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,051
If I may.

325
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,566
What are you doing here, Proctor?
You know you're out on bail.

326
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,008
And innocent until proven guilty.

327
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,567
Which is a good thing, uh I must admit...

328
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,690
considering how often
our young mayor here has me arrested.

329
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,686
You all know me.

330
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,763
And whatever you might think of me...

331
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,281
you know that I look out for this town.

332
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,121
My own business was victimized today
by those lowlifes.

333
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,124
It's damn hard to sell prime rib
with tire tracks on it.

334
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,442
But you know I'm gonna try.

335
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,411
The Spirit Festival is our
hallowed tradition...

336
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,921
stalled by our Native American brethren...

337
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,367
over 100 years ago.

338
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,602
It now belongs to all of us.

339
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,003
And I'll be damned if a few vagrants...

340
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,685
are gonna ruin our cherished event.

341
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,763
- Yeah!
- So I'll be at the festival.

342
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,448
I'll be at the festival tomorrow barbecuing
as much free meat as you all can eat.

343
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,921
And... And I can assure you that my own
security personnel will be on hand as well.

344
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,124
No, he's talking about hired
thugs with criminal records.

345
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,328
I understand that Betsy Denton...

346
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,209
was dragged behind a motorcycle.

347
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,488
That her jaw is broken in three places.

348
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,765
You ask me, we could have used
a few thugs out there today.

349
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,843
Huh?

350
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,287
Settle down.

351
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,801
If you don't settle down,
I'm gonna have to clear the room.

352
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,967
We've already taken one of these guys down.

353
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,370
If they come back, we'll be ready for them.

354
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,170
Yeah, you and what army?

355
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,163
Two deputies and the cheerleader?

356
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,168
- What's your name?
- George Gutterson.

357
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,448
Yeah, well, George,
why don't you shut your mouth?

358
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,524
The festival stays on.

359
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,200
What happened today will not happen again.

360
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,930
They have you outnumbered.

361
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,320
It's true.

362
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,683
Well, I'll tell you what, Mr. Proctor...

363
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,605
I won't tell you how
to slit a cow's throat...

364
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,808
you don't tell me
how to police this town.

365
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,688
Fair enough.

366
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,366
The festival stays on.

367
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,885
- I'll be at the Cadi.
- Yeah.

368
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,371
Emmett, follow her home.

369
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,329
For Christ's sake, boss.
I'm an armed deputy.

370
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,881
Yeah, good point.
Emmett, follow her home.

371
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,124
- Sheriff Hood.
- Yeah?

372
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,087
Oh, hey.

373
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,924
Sheriff Hood...

374
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,844
I attacked a man in town today.

375
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,287
One of the bikers, with this.

376
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,283
Give it to him.

377
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,765
You stabbed one of them?

378
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,527
I'm ready to face the legal
consequences of my actions.

379
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,608
What, are you serious?
She was defending herself.

380
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,286
No, that is not for us to decide.
You are the lawman.

381
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,805
Okay, well, consider it decided.

382
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,122
No, you keep that.

383
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,288
Come.

384
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,642
- Hey.
- Hey.

385
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,921
You checking up on me?

386
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,447
Nope, I came to get you.

387
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,329
You shouldn't stay here.

388
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,927
Are you kidding me?

389
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,849
What, do I have a curfew now too?

390
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,725
No.

391
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,082
Well, this is my house and I'm not leaving.

392
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,211
Well, I guess I'm staying too, then.

393
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,080
When the time comes for you to spend
the night, it won't be to protect me.

394
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,882
You can let yourself out now, boss.

395
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,367
I'll have the deputies
pass by throughout the night.

396
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,443
You got a deputy right here.

397
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,604
Okay.

398
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,560
I guess you could give me
a quick call before you turn in.

399
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,922
I'll be up.

400
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,930
Sure.

401
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,322
Nurse Davis to Pharmacology.

402
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,602
Nurse Davis to Pharmacology.

403
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,928
Hey.

404
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,726
How you feeling?

405
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,448
I feel like I've been hit in the
back of the head with a damn stick.

406
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,081
I'm gonna fucking find them.

407
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,165
No, no. Let it go, man.

408
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,802
Guys like us, we get hit sometimes.

409
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,123
You go trying to settle accounts
for every cheap shot...

410
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,482
you'll never get any sleep.

411
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,281
What, do you have a speech for everything?

412
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,807
I'm a bartender.

413
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,407
Wisdom is an occupational hazard.

414
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,522
Well, I'll let you get some rest.

415
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,802
Hey.

416
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,487
I don't suppose you're
gonna take my advice.

417
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,008
That would make us both wise.

418
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,961
Where's the fun in that?

419
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,930
Yeah. Heh.

420
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,962
Hey.

421
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,647
That's a good look for you.

422
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,642
I want my knife back.

423
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,129
Hey.

424
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,128
You bastards!

425
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,250
Motherfuckers!

426
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,602
No!

427
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,921
God damn it!

428
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,330
No!

429
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,727
No!

430
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,249
No!

431
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,687
Fuck you.

432
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,889
Fuck you!

433
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,122
You motherfuckers!

434
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,527
Fucking kill you!

435
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,890
So those elders...

436
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,520
your father...

437
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,126
they wanted me to arrest you.

438
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,809
I wish you had.

439
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,970
Now I have to openly repent
or I'll be shunned.

440
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,888
For defending yourself?

441
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,850
The knife was kind of my last straw.

442
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,771
"Turn the other cheek and do not resist him
who is evil, sayeth the Lord."

443
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,481
My people don't believe in violence.

444
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,009
What about you?

445
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,645
What do you believe?

446
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,567
Well, I don't know much about religion...

447
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,291
but this right here
doesn't feel like repentance.

448
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,647
It's not a joke.

449
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,524
Fuck.

450
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,725
Hey, hey.

451
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,200
I'm sorry.

452
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,088
It's like I'm trying to be two people.

453
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,482
I've been there.

454
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,761
Yeah?

455
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,570
So there's nothing she could've done.

456
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,688
Fire Department's got it under control.

457
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,888
She's over there.

458
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,003
You okay?

459
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,927
What time is it?

460
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,090
Um, a little after 1.

461
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,168
Today's my birthday.

462
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,122
I was born in that house.

463
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,726
You're staying with Emmett
and Meg until this is over.

464
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,325
Emmett.

465
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,284
Take her home. She's staying with you.

466
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,610
Hey.

467
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,842
I heard about your deputy's house.

468
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,322
What are you gonna do about it?
What's your plan?

469
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,689
Well, what's it to you?

470
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,684
Where'd you find him?

471
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,521
One of my guys spotted him
at a liquor store in Danville.

472
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,444
He tell you where they're holed up?

473
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,124
He's been extremely forthcoming.

474
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,842
Hmm.

475
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,564
So what now?

476
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,403
You arrest these guys,
they'll make bail, stick around.

477
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,847
I'm not planning on arresting them.

478
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,362
What's in it for you?

479
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,769
You motherfucker!

480
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,001
And where am I dumping these?

481
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,686
They got warrants in Cleveland.

482
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,207
- You sure they're alive?
- They're sleeping it off.

483
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,727
Oh, as requested, Officer Paul Hibbert.

484
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,129
Oh, no, it was easy. Podunk cage like that,
bitch, took me five minutes.

485
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,248
Uh, thanks.

486
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,164
I am legit worried about you,
motherfucker.

487
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,561
- Carrie?
- Hey, Marjorie.

488
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,529
Honey, I heard about what happened.

489
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,160
- How are you holding up?
- I'm fine.

490
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,685
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

491
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,962
I'd hoped you would
have called me by now.

492
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,067
I really don't think you
should underestimate

493
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,647
the trauma that
you've been through.

494
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,244
I really recommend
that you get some counseling or...

495
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,847
I appreciate that, Marjorie.
I'll certainly consider it.

496
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,924
Yeah, no, I just mean
with everything else you're going through.

497
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,491
Everything else?

498
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,246
Well...

499
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,569
I mean, I heard that Deva's
having a little bit of trouble in school.

500
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,564
- Skipping classes and whatnot.
- Where'd you hear that?

501
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,848
Oh, no, sweetie, please don't be upset.

502
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,130
I mean, really, kids this age,
they live to test us, right?

503
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,727
My point is that these
are the years as moms...

504
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,241
we got to be at the top of our game.

505
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,325
So I just don't want you
to sweep this under the rug.

506
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,484
You know, the sooner that the victim
of a violent crime...

507
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,847
- I wasn't the victim.
- No, I know.

508
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,368
He's the one that got carted off
in a body bag with a slug in his chest.

509
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,803
And since you've been so generous with the
friendly advice, here's some for you:

510
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,807
If I hear that you and your PTA twats
have been talking shit about my daughter...

511
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,931
there will be more
than enough trauma to go around.

512
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,809
Enjoy the fair, Marjorie.

513
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,564
- Were you just hearing them?
- Put it on.

514
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,481
No, no, no.
You're not putting that on me.

515
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,643
She's a great kid.

516
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,723
Yes, she is.

517
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,011
So walk me through this.

518
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,528
How do a frozen hand
and a bagged cell phone...

519
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,523
disappear from your evidence locker?

520
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,365
Everything was here
when I checked out last night.

521
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,602
I'm told there was an authorized entry...

522
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,286
at 7:03 this morning.

523
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,681
A security clearance card was used...

524
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,922
by Officer Paul Hibbert.

525
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,804
That's right.

526
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,247
- Who is that?
- I have no idea.

527
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,882
He's in our system as an evidence officer
with a clearance card for this room...

528
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,600
but I'm telling you,
nobody by that name has ever worked here.

529
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,122
And I've been the chief property clerk
for going on 13 years.

530
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,250
Well, then you would know.

531
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,289
Hello, sir. This is Special Agent Xavier.

532
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,687
Yup, gone.

533
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,887
It's no surprise, really.

534
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,611
With the systems they got here,
all it took was a routine hack...

535
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,967
and somebody with the balls
to walk in and take it.

536
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,247
Well, there's something in Banshee
that stinks worse than the cows.

537
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,200
With your permission, I'd like to stick
around for a bit and follow the stench.

538
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,409
Yes, sir.

539
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,324
I'll keep you posted.
