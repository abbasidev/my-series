1
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,886
Get out of here!
Come on!

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,289
Get up!
Come on, up.

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,131
You should have told me.

4
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,049
You and Anastasia...

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,767
I could have come
to terms with it.

6
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,240
But you turned her against me.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,765
- I think he knows.
- He doesn't know.

8
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,202
I treated you like family...

9
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,488
and you turned
my daughter against me?

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,722
No.

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,888
You did that yourself.

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,842
You won't tell me where she is?

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,008
I don't know where she is.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,368
You gave up your freedom for her.

15
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,210
And now you will die for her.

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,044
Yes.

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,806
No.

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,281
You will not die.

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,484
You will suffer.

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,768
You will know fear...

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,641
and pain and despair...

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,885
every single day
you are in here.

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,966
This much I promise you.

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,482
You're not begging.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,325
You have always been so proud...

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,884
so much like me.

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,564
I will never be like you.

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,602
We'll see.

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,608
- Shh.
- Ugh! Ugh!

30
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,844
I know just how deep to go
without killing you.

31
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,931
Every single day.

32
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,928
Now you can go to sleep.

33
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,522
Fifteen minute rest stop, folks.

34
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,842
We'll be in Pittsburgh before noon.

35
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,529
Hey, ladies.

36
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,166
I'm a sinner.
Will you pray for me?

37
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,171
Guess a blow job
would be pushing it, huh?

38
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,368
Huh, fucking bitches.

39
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,926
- I gotta go.
- All right, I'll see you later.

40
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,769
I don't fucking believe it.

41
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,485
Heh. No fucking way.

42
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,770
My father wants a word with him.

43
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,728
Alex tells me
you're still mad at me.

44
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,810
Yes, I am.

45
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,327
I cleared the way for the hotel
with the zoning board.

46
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,443
I got all the permits
fast-tracked.

47
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,046
I made sure the environmental impact report
wasn't an issue...

48
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,611
Burton, get the man a chair.

49
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,685
It was a murder charge.

50
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,683
It's a political vendetta.

51
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,285
It won't amount to anything.

52
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,571
I apologize
if I offended you, friend.

53
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,445
Apology accepted.

54
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,080
How've you been feeling?

55
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,161
Cut the bullshit, paleface.

56
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,642
We all know the spirit horse
is coming for me.

57
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,929
I already heard its hoof beats.

58
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,365
And...

59
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,921
you have concerns.

60
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,764
Your word is
the only bond I need.

61
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,965
But your son...

62
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,681
With all due respect, Benjamin,
he doesn't share our past.

63
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,051
My son will fulfill my promises.

64
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,369
Then I'll treat Alex with the same respect
I've treated you.

65
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,848
I'll consider your promise
his to keep.

66
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,244
But if he breaks it...

67
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,602
it won't be a good day
for the tribe.

68
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,481
I Will talk with Alex.

69
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,770
Now, the landowners
at the site...

70
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,925
I understand there's one
that doesn't want to sell out.

71
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,043
Yeah, it's the reverend.

72
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,722
He's a decent man, stubborn.

73
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,081
He'll sell.

74
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,131
He just doesn't know it yet.

75
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,761
Hello, Deborah.

76
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,563
What do you want?

77
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,131
Is your husband home?

78
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,842
Arthur's around back.

79
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,889
Thank you.

80
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,689
Morning, Reverend Ramsey.

81
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,320
Thought I would've
heard back from you by now.

82
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,722
I want you to taste something.

83
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,929
The pipes in my house, they draw
the water from the aquifer...

84
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,846
but I prefer to drink it
straight from here.

85
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,890
Same well my great-grandfather
drank from.

86
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,690
Same bucket, even.

87
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,322
When my son was born,
the entire congregation...

88
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,528
of First Methodist came out here.

89
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,330
We baptized him with the water...

90
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,050
from that very well.

91
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,843
I understand your attachment,
Mr. Ramsey.

92
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,048
I even admire it.

93
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,806
But you're not
a 19th century homesteader.

94
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,607
You have a Prius, a Facebook page
and a 401 k.

95
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,242
We'll double the payout.

96
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,210
We'll secure you equal acreage
within the district.

97
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,328
You can dig a new well.

98
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,649
I'd be worried that any land
you secured for me...

99
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,531
would involve forcing
someone else out.

100
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,286
Now listen to me, reverend.

101
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,403
You're gonna leave.

102
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,723
You can do it with grace
and some cash in your pocket...

103
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,848
or you can do it broken.

104
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,525
But it's gonna happen.

105
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,606
I'm gonna have to pray on it.

106
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,323
If God was looking out for you...

107
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,051
I wouldn't be
at your door now, would I?

108
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,565
Huh?

109
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,364
Hood.

110
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,403
I've been trying to get you on the radio.

111
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,207
- Where the hell are you?
- Serving the people.

112
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,687
Well, look, I got a guy here
in the cage for shoplifting.

113
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,411
He's got a...
Got a long sheet.

114
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,846
A really long sheet.

115
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,684
Well, I'm sure
you can handle it.

116
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,002
Leonard Vanderwick. Does that mean
anything to you?

117
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,931
- Nope. Why?
- Well, the guy says he knows you...

118
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,963
and he won't talk to anyone else.

119
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,682
What do you mean he knows me?

120
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,605
I don't know.
He just... Get down!

121
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,489
He won't tell me anything else.

122
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,007
I was gonna take him over
to the court for processing...

123
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,289
but he insisted that he use his right
to one phone call to contact you.

124
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,603
- Leonard Vanderwick?
- Yep. What do you want me to do?

125
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,603
You want me
to get him processed?

126
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,202
Yeah, no.
I'll be right over.

127
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,649
I gotta go.

128
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,689
Sounds that way.

129
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,963
Is it okay if I just
stay here and maybe nap?

130
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,930
It's quiet.

131
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,364
The Moody boys becoming
a problem for you?

132
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,965
What, are we going steady now?

133
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,283
I can handle Cole's idiot brothers.

134
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,321
This is Deputy Lotus in Banshee.

135
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,603
I'm just wondering how soon
we'll get the... Yeah.

136
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,846
The file number, it's 00170455.

137
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,409
Can you get it to me today?

138
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,010
Do I know you?

139
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,128
I don't know, sheriff.

140
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,963
Do you?

141
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,403
How you doing there, champ?

142
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,925
You're not up
to solid foods yet, hm?

143
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,525
Come on, let me
get you to sit up.

144
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,291
Leave it.

145
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,522
All right, all right.

146
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,284
I just didn't want it
to go to waste.

147
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,050
Here you go.

148
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,570
Here. Looks like you're having
some trouble there, brother.

149
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,082
Just hold that right there.

150
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,641
I'm Wicks.

151
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,163
You want some water?

152
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,080
Whoa, easy, easy. Easy there.

153
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,128
You won't wanna heal too fast.

154
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,722
The Albino, man...
This and solitary...

155
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,531
the only two places
he can't get to you.

156
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,804
The Albino.

157
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,927
Yeah.

158
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,048
He already put the word out.

159
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,646
You're his property.

160
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,808
I don't know what you did, man...

161
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,528
but your chances of survival
just took a nosedive.

162
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,326
What do I do?

163
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,285
I suggest you get
really good at sucking cock.

164
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,090
I'm serious.

165
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,004
The Albino's
a crazy motherfucker...

166
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,844
but he's also full-on queer.

167
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,843
You're young, good-looking.

168
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,288
You show him some love, maybe
you don't end up in a wheelchair.

169
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,727
It's not gonna happen.

170
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,211
You need to accept
that it will happen, man.

171
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,522
Every single day you are in here.

172
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,127
You got no place to hide.

173
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,683
But how it happens, you might
be able to put a spin on that.

174
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,764
You give it to him
before he takes it...

175
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,843
and curry some fucking favor.

176
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,002
That's your best shot.

177
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,801
Listen, are you gonna
eat that sandwich?

178
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,570
Hm?

179
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,441
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sheriff.

180
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,009
So, uh, how long you been out?

181
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,088
A little while.

182
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,889
You?

183
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,088
Been out about two years.

184
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,360
Did some work for my sister's husband
down in Florida.

185
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,129
It's nice there.

186
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,284
You could work outdoors
all year round.

187
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,206
But her husband, he didn't like me
being around the kids.

188
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,840
He thought I was poisoning
their minds or some shit.

189
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,367
He said he was letting me go
on account of the economy...

190
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,841
but the fucker
just wanted me gone.

191
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,408
Mmm.

192
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,167
Hey, enough about me, man.
Heh.

193
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,171
How the fuck did you pull off
this little miracle here?

194
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,290
It's complicated.

195
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,330
- No shit, it's complicated.
- And temporary.

196
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,722
What are you gonna have?

197
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,564
Don't know yet.

198
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,043
- You're setting up a job.
- No.

199
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,089
Now, listen, man.
You know you can trust me.

200
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,806
And right now,
I'm what you'd call highly available.

201
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,009
No, Wicks, it's not like that.

202
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,522
Come on, man.
You owe me.

203
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,250
Keep your fucking voice down.

204
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,131
Listen, man, I'm not gonna
fuck this up for you.

205
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,011
But I'm tapped out.

206
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,369
You have no idea.
I'm not living right.

207
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,124
I know what I look like.

208
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,567
I've been sleeping
on the fucking streets, man.

209
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,127
I just need a break.

210
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,086
Or I'm gonna be back
in the cage in a month.

211
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,844
At least I get fed there.

212
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,968
Look, order whatever you want.

213
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,088
I'll be back.

214
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,564
I see you made a new friend.

215
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,529
Yeah, I'm a friendly guy.

216
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,160
- Give me an apple pie.
- Coming right up.

217
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,924
He's wall-to-wall prison tats.

218
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,408
I think you're the last guy who'd want
to be seen keeping that kind of company.

219
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,166
- Mrs. Hopewell, I didn't know you cared.
- Be smart.

220
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,163
What, are you worried about me?

221
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,370
- I'm worried about me.
- No. No, that's not it.

222
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,888
You're worried about me.

223
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,928
Just be smart.

224
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,322
Ow! Ha, ha, ha!

225
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,609
Nice.

226
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,569
Here you go.

227
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,405
A clean bed.
You can take a hot shower.

228
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,364
- Yeah, all right.
- Yeah.

229
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,040
I'll come by tomorrow
with some clean clothes for you.

230
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,449
Then what?

231
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,684
Uh...

232
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,922
we'll talk.

233
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,763
All right.

234
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,649
Hey.

235
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,087
Thank you.

236
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,284
Sure.

237
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,888
None of them will come near you.

238
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,491
But you will?

239
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,802
Well, now...

240
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,770
see, me, I make myself
indispensable.

241
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,005
I'm a purveyor of certain goods,
mostly pharmaceutical.

242
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,403
And the Albino,
he likes his narcotics.

243
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,085
Where is he?

244
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,571
He don't come out in the yard.

245
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,449
You seen his eyes?

246
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,410
Stays out of the sun
like a fucking vampire.

247
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,449
How do I get to see him?

248
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,807
You don't.

249
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,884
What are you,
some kind of masochist?

250
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,408
- He'll find you soon enough.
- Come on.

251
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,966
You see blondie over there
with the football?

252
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,963
- Yeah.
- That's Billy B.

253
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,851
That's the Albino's main squeeze.

254
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,048
If you want in, that's your access.

255
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,089
But I'm telling you...

256
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,282
I wouldn't do that.

257
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,923
You know how to throw a ball.

258
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,686
Yeah, I won
two state championships.

259
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,361
Oh, it's you.

260
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,761
Almost healed up, huh?

261
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,322
What the fuck you want?

262
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,409
I'm sorry, man.

263
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,002
I told him he didn't
have an appointment.

264
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,124
He insisted.

265
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,286
I can always make time
for an old friend.

266
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,005
You see?

267
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,640
Prison can be very liberating.

268
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,161
Billy B here...

269
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,164
he was as straight
as they come on the outside.

270
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,324
Son of a minister,
star quarterback...

271
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,330
fucked the prom queen,
all of that.

272
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,530
Then one day,
he went and got drunk...

273
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,569
ran over some old lady
and her grandson...

274
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,291
and ended up in here.

275
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,371
And now he's in love.

276
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,241
Well, the heart wants
what the heart wants, right?

277
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,886
They did a good job
with you, huh?

278
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,724
I mean, fuck, you were a mess...

279
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,002
What was it, a month ago?

280
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,764
About that.

281
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,685
So you found me
before I could find you.

282
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,524
I appreciate that.

283
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,041
It shows gumption.

284
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,929
I wanna make a deal.

285
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,924
- What kind of deal?
- The kind that keeps me healthy.

286
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,527
Heh, heh, I really can't do that.

287
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,923
See, my deal with Mr. Rabbit
makes that a conflict of interest.

288
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,651
- You understand.
- Rabbit doesn't need to know.

289
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,447
And now you're insulting me.

290
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,407
But I know a way
you can make up for that.

291
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,047
Gotta be honest, uh...

292
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,884
I just don't feel
that close to you yet.

293
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,688
It's gonna happen.

294
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,008
I could make it happen right now,
but I'm not gonna.

295
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,487
Because when you do it...

296
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,008
you're gonna do it willingly...

297
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,362
gratefully.

298
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,042
And while you're
greedily sucking me off...

299
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,682
like a babe suckling
on its mother's tit...

300
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,601
that's when you'll understand...

301
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,684
that I own your ass.

302
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,961
Get him out of here.

303
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,361
And the next time we meet's
gonna be something special.

304
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,761
Mr. Rabbit has requested
a small piece of you...

305
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,928
something to prove to him
that I'm holding up my end.

306
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,445
- So how long are you in for?
- Twenty.

307
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,604
That's a long time to be anyone's bitch.

308
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,882
You know, whatever you're thinking...

309
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,122
you can just forget it.

310
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,443
- You belong to him now.
- We can take him down.

311
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,130
Together.

312
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,730
Fuck you.

313
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,527
You're his bitch now,
just like me.

314
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,931
Stay down! Stay down!

315
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,764
Oh, fuck.

316
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,410
Fighting in the yard...

317
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,891
buys you 30 days in the hole.

318
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,531
The shiv gets you another 90.

319
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,882
Keep it up,
you'll be an old man...

320
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,122
by the time you see
a real bed again.

321
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,445
Yeah, looking sharp!

322
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,049
I feel like a new man.

323
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,970
Fuck, yes.

324
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,363
Mr. Vanderwick is walking tall,
motherfucker.

325
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,725
- You look great.
- I know.

326
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,807
He says he'll take you
to Pittsburgh.

327
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,571
Then you can make
your own way from there.

328
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,490
Here.

329
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,968
That's 2500 bucks.

330
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

331
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,282
And, uh, thanks
for my new wardrobe.

332
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,965
Yeah.

333
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,770
All right.

334
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,609
- All right.
- Been great, man.

335
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,047
Thanks.

336
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,567
Hey, Wicks.

337
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,043
Don't come back.

338
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,045
Morning, reverend.

339
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,010
No, no, no, no.
Look, you can just turn right around.

340
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,605
I'm not signing.

341
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,250
I've spoken to my lawyer.

342
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,607
He said what you're doing
is considered extortion.

343
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,889
I assure you
that was not the case.

344
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,571
What's this?

345
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,961
This? This is extortion.

346
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,406
This is...
This is not my wife.

347
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,889
Oh? Oh, no, it's her. It's her, all right.

348
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,811
I should know. See?

349
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,604
I never forget a great piece of ass.

350
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,286
Where did you get these?

351
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,250
Oh, I didn't get them.
I took them.

352
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,131
Yeah, I took that one too.

353
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,725
You fucked my wife?!

354
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,089
Of course not.
She wasn't your wife then.

355
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,926
She danced in my clubs for years
before she found you and God.

356
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,401
Or was it God, then you?
I don't know.

357
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,921
Either way, I found her first.

358
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,691
- Arthur...
- Shut up.

359
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,322
- Let me... Listen to me...
- I said shut up!

360
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,131
But my offer still stands.

361
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,322
I'll double the payout.

362
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,529
As far as I'm concerned,
you've earned it.

363
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,967
At least one of you did. Heh, heh.

364
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,006
- I'm so sorry.
- Just sign the papers.

365
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:00,287
We'll relocate you
and these pictures disappear.

366
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,489
Now, if you don't sign,
tomorrow morning...

367
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,166
they'll be in the in-boxes
of every member of your church...

368
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,810
along with a link to the video.

369
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,960
Video?

370
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,771
Oh, come on, Ramsey.
There's always a video.

371
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,081
- Shut up.
- Dude, you know you like her.

372
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,969
You don't know what
you're talking about.

373
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,522
- Dude, she kisses her dog.
- She does not.

374
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,886
Like, tongue kisses.

375
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,331
Max.

376
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,766
Max!

377
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,531
Max.

378
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,807
Mrs. Hopewell!

379
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,248
Mrs. Hopewell! Max. Max.

380
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,246
Come on, baby boy.

381
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,448
It's fine.
Mommy's right here.

382
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,570
Mommy loves you.

383
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,768
- Hey, how is he?
- Where were you?

384
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,127
- I called you over an hour ago.
- I was in court.

385
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,648
They had to come and get me.
I'm... I'm sorry.

386
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,608
- What did the doctor say?
- They haven't said anything yet.

387
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,166
Gordon, Carrie.

388
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,721
He's, uh, stable now.

389
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,890
Can we speak privately
for a minute?

390
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,249
I'm not a child.

391
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,765
Right here's fine, doctor.

392
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,086
We'd been hoping that
the therapies we had Max on...

393
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,408
would keep his lungs going
for a few more years...

394
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,528
until he reached puberty...

395
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,167
at which point surgery
would be a more viable option.

396
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,121
But his asthma is being complicated
by that scarred lung...

397
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,681
and I don't think we can
take that approach anymore.

398
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,169
You're the lucky man.

399
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,081
Oh.

400
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,323
Five hundred, yo.

401
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,249
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.

402
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,251
I need another fucking drink!

403
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,930
Oh.

404
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,446
Whoo!

405
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,328
- Come on.
- Come on, lucky nine.

406
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,844
Motherfucker!

407
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,401
Yeah, son of a bitch!
Pay me!

408
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,566
Bet is midnight.

409
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,529
Bet is boxcars.

410
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,049
All right, hands off
the layout, please.

411
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,606
The dice are out. Seven.

412
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,250
Craps.

413
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,686
Shit, shit, Shit.

414
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,524
No more bets, please.

415
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,210
- Shit, shit.
- Come on, baby.

416
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,522
- You should really stop.
- No, no, no. I got this.

417
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,200
- You're gonna lose it all.
- Fuck off!

418
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,891
- Hey, man.
- Yeah? Fuck you too.

419
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,286
Where the fuck are you going?

420
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,010
- Come here.
- You're being an asshole.

421
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,004
Take your hands
off the lady now.

422
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,924
Yeah, dickwad,
take your hands off the lady.

423
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,570
- All right, all right.
- Thank you.

424
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,240
Everybody calm down.
It's good, it's good.

425
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,764
Get up, ass-wipe.

426
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,688
Hey, free money!

427
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,683
Who's the ass-wipe now, motherfucker?

428
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,611
Who's the ass-wipe now?
Oh, shit.

429
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,727
Not a fucking word.

430
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,727
So this is the guy who tore up my casino?

431
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,724
It was all a misunderstanding, chief.

432
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,042
Did you really just call me "chief"?

433
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,168
Are you really that fucking dumb?

434
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,004
I... I didn't mean anything by it.

435
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,482
Shut up and listen so there's no
further misunderstandings.

436
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,291
If you ever walk
through my doors again...

437
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,808
we won't bother the Banshee
Sheriff's Department with our troubles.

438
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,644
This is Kinaho land you're standing on...

439
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,326
and we'd be well within
our rights to handle it internally.

440
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,091
Nod if you understand.

441
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,688
He's all yours.

442
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,922
Thanks.

443
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,891
- Here, babe.
- Shit.

444
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,050
- Jesus Christ, Carrie.
- I'm sorry.

445
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,289
- No, no. Leave it, leave it.
- Let me get it.

446
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,681
I got it... I got it, honey.
I got it.

447
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,091
I'm sorry.

448
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,483
It's okay, it's okay.

449
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,085
Max will be okay.

450
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,567
They'll figure this thing out.

451
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,610
They have it figured out.

452
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,967
We just don't want
to believe them.

453
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,602
You know,
the asthma's one thing...

454
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,809
but he's gonna need a new lung.

455
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,404
He had a bad attack.
I know that, but...

456
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,922
You know, so long as we're here
for the night...

457
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,242
why don't we just...

458
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,250
Why don't we just get everything out
on the table?

459
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,361
What are you talking about?

460
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,409
I don't know...

461
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,324
but I know it's something.

462
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,485
- Max is getting worse.
- I'm not talking about Max.

463
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,051
Honey, I'm talking about us.

464
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,804
I'm talking about you.

465
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,684
When I catch you
sitting in the kitchen...

466
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,889
staring out the window,
and the look in your eye...

467
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,927
it's like this look of total despair.

468
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,128
And the kids are picking up on it too.

469
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,361
What do you mean, the kids?

470
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,010
Deva has asked me
more than once...

471
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,128
why you seem so distant.

472
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,322
Did you tell her that
seeing the man who...

473
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,207
tried to rape me,
shot and killed on top of me...

474
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,607
might be a reason for me
to feel a little bit thrown?

475
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,200
- I did. I said exac...
- You just...

476
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,964
Yeah, I said exactly that.

477
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,129
Okay, good.

478
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,047
Tell me about the sheriff.

479
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,163
He got Deva out of that rave
and I'm very grateful.

480
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,208
And that is it.

481
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,011
I need you to let me in, Carrie.

482
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,401
We can beat this thing with Max.

483
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,564
I know we can, but we have to be
operating at full strength.

484
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,848
And... And right now...

485
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,128
You're right. You're right.

486
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,009
Have I done something
to upset you?

487
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,369
- Because if I have, I don't know...
- No, honey, no.

488
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,923
It's all me.

489
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,522
I'm just having...

490
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,686
I've been having a hard time
finding my balance right now.

491
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,161
What can I do for you?

492
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,522
Don't give up on me.

493
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,363
Mm.

494
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,965
Ah.

495
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,168
Thank you, brother.

496
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,005
That is some choice sirloin.
You know your cuts.

497
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,165
- Thank you.
- Mm-mm, thank you.

498
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,123
You got yourself
a sweet setup here.

499
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,126
Most cons I know
can't get minimum wage.

500
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,410
Look at you. Sole proprietor.

501
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,569
What is it about this town?
It's like heaven for cons.

502
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,290
Hey, man!
Where you been?

503
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,603
Well, I had to make sure your mess
was cleaned up properly.

504
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,416
Thanks.

505
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:16,566
Yeah, look,
I'm real sorry about that, man.

506
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,245
That was my bad.

507
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,210
But in my defense, that hooker
gave me some bad coke.

508
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,086
I told you not to come back.

509
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,848
Yeah, well, you know what?

510
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,240
I believe the power dynamic
here's all fucked up.

511
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,323
Come again?

512
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,047
I mean, knowledge is power, right?

513
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,488
I have some knowledge about you
that nobody else in this town has.

514
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,801
So, the way I see it...

515
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,883
I'm not the one
who should be taking orders.

516
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,485
We had a deal.

517
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,165
Yeah.

518
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,641
And we're renegotiating.

519
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,406
- Wicks...
- Listen.

520
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,365
You got a great situation here.

521
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,887
I'm not looking to fuck it up...

522
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,441
but you better believe
I want a piece.

523
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,525
Been on the road for two years.

524
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,124
And nothing... I mean
nothing has panned out.

525
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,011
You give me some fucking hush money,
send me on my way.

526
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,844
We both know I'm gonna
end up back inside.

527
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,286
And you know what?

528
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,767
I'm not going back.

529
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,930
This is my only play, and I'm making it.

530
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,685
I'm not asking for a handout.

531
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,490
You're gonna give me a chance...

532
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,211
and I'm gonna earn my keep.

533
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,769
And that's how it's gonna be, sheriff.

534
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,765
Man, this is some
fucking grade-A beef.

535
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,730
Well, well, well, look who's back.

536
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,326
Got a special delivery for you.

537
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,527
He's coming for you
tomorrow in the yard.

538
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,330
Watch the yard guards.

539
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,165
When they disappear, it's time.

540
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,484
Why are you helping me?

541
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,047
I consider it an investment.

542
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,364
It's a long stretch in here.

543
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,368
You only get one chance.

544
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,482
The sky is always bluer
than I remember.

545
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,803
I've been waiting
for you, my friend.

546
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,803
What you did to Billy B,
that was uncalled for.

547
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,088
That was a hate crime, man.

548
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,442
Bring him.

549
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,571
Come on, tough guy.

550
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,609
Nice try, smart-ass.

551
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,526
Get on your fucking knees.

552
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,688
Get on your
fucking knees, bitch!

553
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,608
Ask for it.

554
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,882
What?

555
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,683
Ask for it.

556
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,162
Whoa.

557
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,163
Okay, so...

558
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,887
I do this...

559
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,883
and we're good?

560
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,530
Fuck, no.

561
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,160
I'll probably still kill you.

562
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,209
But if you show
some serious skills...

563
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,767
you may have a future.

564
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,203
I'd better come quick and hard...

565
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,442
or you won't stand up again.

566
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,803
Now, ask for it.

567
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,444
Okay.

568
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,530
Give it to me.

569
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,409
- What?
- Ah!

570
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,883
Give it to me.

571
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,282
Motherfucker!

572
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,841
Are we good?

573
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,851
Yeah, we're good.

574
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,290
I knew guys like Wicks in prison...

575
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,286
guys that never stop digging graves
for themselves...

576
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,721
and then trading
everything and everyone...

577
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,689
to keep from getting buried.

578
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,209
Hey, Hood, I never saw the paperwork
on that Leonard Vanderwick guy.

579
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,846
That get filed or...?

580
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,525
He wasn't worth the effort.

581
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,170
I sent him packing.

582
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,846
Guys like that don't go down...

583
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,283
without taking everyone close
down with him.

584
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,602
That's their game.

585
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,967
How did he know you anyway?

586
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,849
He didn't.

587
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,450
Not really.

588
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,321
Knew of me, I guess.

589
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,960
And you just, uh, just let him go?

590
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,168
Yeah.

591
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,970
I didn't want to waste
any more time...

592
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,963
on a vagrant who tried
to steal some dinner.

593
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,811
So now you decide which laws
are worth enforcing?

594
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,811
That's why they gave me the badge.

595
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,210
Yeah,
but the rules are different out here.

596
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,462
No. Same rules.

597
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,603
Same rules they had since the first man
picked up the first stick...

598
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,570
and beat the second man's
ass with it.

599
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,121
Mm.

600
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,720
You have an interesting way
of looking at the world.

601
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,204
Yeah, I've lived an interesting life.

602
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,131
Yes?

603
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,481
Tell him it's me.

604
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,450
It's her.

605
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,806
Anastasia.

606
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,603
I'm ready...

607
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,929
to bring him to you.

608
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,170
When?

609
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,647
By the end of this week.

610
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,330
Where?

611
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,922
I'll let you know.

612
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,362
She will bring him.

613
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,971
And just when things finally...

614
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,451
seem to be nice and boring,
you came along.

615
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,365
You're welcome.

616
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,761
I guess I'm just not cut out for...

617
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,569
boring. Heh, heh, heh.

618
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,926
Hey, Dad, uh, it's Jason.

619
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,651
Um...
I got your message.

620
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,363
I know we haven't talked
in a long time...

621
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,642
but I've got some
real trouble here.

622
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,202
I called a few times
and I haven't heard back from you.

623
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,882
I just wish I knew
where the hell you were.

624
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,407
I really need to talk to you.

625
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,769
Anyway, please call me.
Bye.
