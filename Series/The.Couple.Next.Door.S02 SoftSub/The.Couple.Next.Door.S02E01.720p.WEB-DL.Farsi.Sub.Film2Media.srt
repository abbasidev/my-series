00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,480
This programme contains strong
language and scenes of surgery

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,760
RUMBLE OF THUNDER

3
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,000
LAUGHTER

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,480
Oh!

5
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,000
Argh!

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,720
THEME MUSIC

7
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,000
FEARFUL: Why did
you move next door?

8
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,480
HAMMERING

9
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,240
DOG BARKS

10
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,000
Keep coming around by me

11
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,480
Keep coming out of nowhere

12
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,000
Keep coming around by me

13
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,720
Keep coming out of nowhere

14
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,000
Keep coming around by me

15
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,880
Keep coming out of nowhere

16
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,320
Keep coming around by me

17
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,000
Keep coming out
of nowhere...

18
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,880
Are you OK for drinks? Erm,
yeah, we're both good, thanks.

19
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,480
Yeah, I'm fine.

20
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,000
FAINT: How long is
this going to last?

21
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,480
Oi! What?

22
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,240
If Gemma found out we'd invited his
bit on the side... Hey, be nice.

23
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,480
Come on.

24
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,480
Wow, OK, Lotts,

25
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,880
what culinary delights have
you made for us tonight?

26
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,880
We're having spelt-battered
pollock in a satay sauce.

27
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,800
Oh, my God. It looks
amazing. Thank you so much.

28
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,720
It's all Lottie's handiwork.
I'm only the humble sous-chef.

29
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,000
Lottie is an insane cook.
You are in for such a treat.

30
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm allergic to gluten
and I don't eat fish.

31
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
What?

32
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,960
I... I didn't know that.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,480
No, I, erm...

34
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,520
Well, perhaps you could
pick the vegetables out.

35
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,000
We can... We can make you something
else, Alyssa. It's no problem.

36
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,480
No, it's fine. It's
totally my fault.

37
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,400
Sorry, I keep forgetting.
It's quite a recent diagnosis.

38
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,720
No, of course, yeah. It
must be a right pain.

39
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,160
What happens when you eat it?

40
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,640
Well, it's more of an intolerance.
I just... It don't feel good.

41
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,560
Yeah, but, darling, you've got
to... You've got to eat something.

42
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Honestly, I ate earlier. I'll
just drink wine. I'm good.

43
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
OK.

44
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,720
So, Ben says you work
together. That must be intense.

45
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,160
JACOB CHUCKLES

46
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,080
We try to avoid it
as much as possible.

47
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,600
But it's not always possible.

48
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,480
Do you even do
operations together?

49
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
Like, how does that
work? Who's in charge?

50
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, erm... CHARLOTTE LAUGHS

51
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,480
What? A surgeon and an anaesthetist
are equals on the surgical team.

52
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,240
BEN LAUGHS

53
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,440
Like all anaesthetists, Jacob
is very touchy about his status.

54
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,800
Well, yeah, it's no big
deal. We're just in charge

55
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,800
of whether you live
or die. Yeah, sure.

56
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,000
But, no, seriously, I mean, my
job is 99% boredom and 1% panic.

57
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,160
In answer to your question, yes,
a surgeon is always in charge

58
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,160
during an operation and, yes,
he does exactly as I tell him.

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,400
Wow. At home and at work.

60
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,400
Well, you see, the
key to our marriage is

61
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,160
I let Lottie think she's in
charge, but really it's me.

62
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,400
Don't seem like it
to me. BEN LAUGHS

63
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,720
All right.

64
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Mm! Oh, my God.

65
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,640
Mm.

66
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,000
So how long have you
two been together?

67
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,880
Well, our 20 year anniversary is
coming up. Oh, God, he's remembered.

68
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,480
Probably about the same year
you were born, isn't it?

69
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,240
Not quite.

70
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,000
The fish is sensational.

71
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,160
Can you hand me
the wine, please?

72
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,720
I'm, erm... I'm sorry
if I was a bit rude.

73
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,240
Oh, it's fine.

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,000
Look, it's not personal. You
seem like a really nice girl.

75
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,120
I'm not a girl.
I'm a grown woman.

76
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,680
Not in his eyes.

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,800
Who pissed on your chips?

78
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,480
You know, if you don't eat carbs
because you don't want a fat arse,

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,640
you should just be
honest and say so.

80
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,640
Ladies, hey, how's
everything going?

81
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,000
Mm.

82
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,240
Oh, Lotts, come on, let me...
Please, let me do the washing-up.

83
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,480
You've spoilt us so
much this evening.

84
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,000
It's all going in the dishwasher.
We're all good, Ben. Really? Yeah.

85
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,680
OK. Erm...

86
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,000
OK.

87
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,320
All right? Yeah. Charlotte
and I were just discussing

88
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,000
her forthright views
on fat arses and carbs.

89
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,000
HENRY: What's all
the bloody noise?

90
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,320
Oh, Dad, I thought
you'd gone to bed.

91
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,000
Come on, Henry. Let's get
you back upstairs, all right?

92
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,400
Don't you tell me
what to do, young man!

93
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
Hello, Henry. It's...
It's me. It's Ben.

94
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,840
Who?

95
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,920
Ben. How are you?

96
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,640
Oh, I've never been better.

97
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,360
How are the girls, Gemma?

98
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,720
Such lovely daughters.

99
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,800
Oh, Henry, sorry, no, this...
Actually, this is Alyssa.

100
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,560
Is she, 'eck!

101
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,320
Her name's Gemma
and you're married

102
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,240
and you have two
beautiful daughters.

103
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,520
Ben had a roving eye, but you
tamed him, didn't you, Gemma?

104
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,800
OK.

105
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,640
I think we're going to... Yeah,
yeah... get you up to bed, Dad.

106
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,720
Come on, let's get you all
comfy. Be back in a sec. Sure.

107
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,800
God, she was awful.

108
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,480
Lottie, we've got to accept the
fact that he's moved on, all right?

109
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,000
Here you go. Thanks.

110
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,120
Why? Do you think he's in love?

111
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,280
I don't know. Maybe he is.

112
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,040
I'm sure I'm taking things
extremely personally,

113
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
but Gem's my best friend.

114
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,880
I don't know why you're being
so moralistic about an age gap.

115
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,880
I mean, who cares? Is this
you laying the groundwork

116
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,000
so you can hook up
with a younger model?

117
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,480
God, no. Can't be arsed. I'm
exhausted enough as it is.

118
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,200
Well, I hope you're
not too exhausted.

119
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,720
Lottie, it's not
even sex Wednesday.

120
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,640
Don't mock my sex schedule.
I'm a very busy woman.

121
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Unless you've got
a better offer.

122
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh, I couldn't possibly comment.

123
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,720
Hmm? Mm.

124
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,240
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

125
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, God.

126
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,720
Shit.

127
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,000
Hi, Brandon.

128
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,360
WHISPER: Hi, Brandon.
CHARLOTTE CHUCKLES

129
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,480
What's his blood oxygen level?

130
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,240
Yeah, OK. Yeah, I'm coming in.

131
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,520
Yeah, I'll be there
as soon as I can. Bye.

132
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,000
Sorry.

133
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,760
It's OK. Here you go.

134
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,360
Ooh. You have a nice
time with him. Thank you.

135
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,320
Sorry.

136
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,000
It's all right.

137
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,000
I didn't hear you get
back. Was it a late one?

138
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,000
Isn't it always? Tricky
patient, but we got there.

139
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,240
Looks like they're keeping
the street pervert busy.

140
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,280
I don't know. I feel
quite sorry for him.

141
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,240
He must be pretty lonely.

142
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,000
Thanks, Amber.

143
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, please tell me
I don't have her.

144
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,720
Bad news. Oh, God.

145
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,880
Who the hell is Mia Eldegard?

146
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,400
She's probably some agency
nurse who doesn't know

147
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,160
how to hold a scalpel.
See you in theatre. Yep.

148
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,000
Thanks.

149
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,720
JACOB HUMS

150
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,720
Oh, this is Leo
Pandian, Viraj's son.

151
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,240
Hi. Pleasure to meet you.
Hello. Pleasure to meet you.

152
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,560
Pleasure to meet you.

153
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
And this is SPOC.

154
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,480
SPOC? Single point of contact.

155
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,240
This is where you'll get
your schedules for your day,

156
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,000
liaise with colleagues,
deal with admin queries.

157
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,640
It's entirely your
responsibility to know when

158
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,720
and where you're needed,
are we clear? Of course.

159
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,800
Oh, and down there on the right
are the consultants' offices.

160
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,720
Please do not disturb the doctors
in their office unless it's urgent

161
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,000
or you have an appointment.

162
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,560
Are you listening?

163
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,960
Do not disturb doctors in
their office unless it's urgent

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,880
or I have an appointment.

165
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,480
Where was it you
were from? Sweden?

166
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,000
Norway.

167
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,640
Well, you might think
that makes you exotic,

168
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,000
but we have all sorts in here, so
don't go thinking you're special.

169
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,720
I wouldn't do that.

170
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,600
Everybody, this is Mia, our
new scrub nurse from Sweden.

171
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,480
Hello. Hi. There is tea
and coffee available,

172
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,720
but you will have to
bring in your own mug

173
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,400
as we are trying to cut
down on our use of plastic.

174
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,240
Unwashed mugs will
be confiscated.

175
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,760
Hello. Hi. I'm Yvonne.

176
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,480
Mia. Would you like
a nice cup of tea?

177
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,640
I'm more of a coffee girl,
but I don't have my own mug.

178
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,480
We've got plenty to go 'round.

179
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, hello fair
Scandi maiden. Hi.

180
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,520
I'm Jaden. Ignore the
hideous old windbag.

181
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,480
So, you're from Sweden? No,
I'm actually from Norway.

182
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,320
A city called Trondheim.

183
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,240
And you? Oh, I'm a Londoner born
and bred, but I have been...

184
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,880
NORTHERN ACCENT: .. "up
north" for a long time now.

185
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,000
Nice accent. And you,
where are you from?

186
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,720
Christ, sorry!

187
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Oh, sorry. It's
fine. It's OK. Erm...

188
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,440
Go and get changed.

189
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,760
It's fine. Sorry.

190
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,720
Hi. Morning.

191
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm Mia.

192
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,000
Mia Eldegard.

193
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,720
Mm-hm. You're in
my theatre today.

194
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,240
Do you have experience
as a cardiac scrub nurse?

195
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,720
Plenty. Back in Norway.

196
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,480
Sure, but I imagine our
systems are different, so...

197
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,360
Norwegians have hearts, too.
Can't imagine it's that different?

198
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,480
Well, I will see you in
theatre for the team brief,

199
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,000
preferably with some clothes on.

200
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,320
Sure.

201
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,480
Please do not address
your surgeon in that tone.

202
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,720
Particularly not
in your underwear.

203
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,120
Morning, Gloria.

204
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,720
DOG BARKS

205
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,880
Come along, Mr Snuffles.
Nothing to see here!

206
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,480
DOG BARKS

207
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,240
You missed a load.

208
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,720
Henry.

209
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,480
I'm only ribbing you.
You're doing a grand job.

210
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,720
Well, my supervisor will be
along soon to tell me different.

211
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,960
HENRY LAUGHS How much
more of this nonsense?

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,480
Another 19 hours.

213
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,720
And then I'm a fully
rehabilitated citizen.

214
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,040
Not that thE street
will see it that way.

215
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,960
Well, more fool them.

216
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,720
How about a sarnie? Did
you make me one this time?

217
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,720
Ham and piccalilli, you said.

218
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,240
Oh, ruddy marvellous!

219
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,560
Don't tell your daughter
I'm feeding you.

220
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,960
She won't take kindly to you
wandering the streets to see me.

221
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,720
I'm so bloody bored, Alan.
Bored out of my mind!

222
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,480
I know that feeling.

223
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,560
I just wish our Sally would
hurry up and come back.

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,560
Sally's not here
any more, Henry.

225
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,240
Do you remember?

226
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,720
Oh.

227
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,880
That's awfully sad, isn't it?

228
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,720
It is.

229
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,240
Do you fancy a cup of
tea? I've got a flask.

230
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,240
Now you're talking.

231
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,480
Brandon, this is Mia,
the new scrub nurse.

232
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,840
Hi.

233
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,240
I'm assisting Her Majesty.

234
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,600
Watch yourself. She's a
bit of a ball breaker.

235
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,320
Surely you're not scared
of strong women, Brandon.

236
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,320
Is that how nurses talk
to doctors in Norway?

237
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,720
Is this how male doctors talk
about female doctors in England?

238
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,480
Morning, team. Have
you all met Mia?

239
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,120
Morning, all.

240
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,960
Hi. Nice to meet you.

241
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,560
We have three patients today. First
up, coronary artery bypass grafting,

242
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,720
followed by an aortic
valve replacement,

243
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,560
and finally a pericardiectomy.
Any patient concerns?

244
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,720
Yeah, I'm a little concerned about
the airway of the last patient.

245
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,960
He has COPD grade three, so it
might be a difficult airway.

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,640
I might be needed on site post-op,
so if we could move him to first up?

247
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,720
I'm afraid not. Sorry if that
means you need to work late.

248
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,960
Why not? Because I would like
Brandon to lead on the bypass

249
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,200
grafting, so I think it's important
we get that one out of the way.

250
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,880
What do you think, Brandon?
Are you ready to lead?

251
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,360
Absolutely.

252
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,960
Great.

253
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,480
I am needed in ITU. You
know what you're doing?

254
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,640
I'll be back to discuss the
grafting plan we made with angio.

255
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,240
Got it.

256
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,680
So, Mia, let me show you how
it's done. Suction, please.

257
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,960
How was your weekend?
Yeah, not bad.

258
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,280
Smashing marathon training.
Did an 18-miler on Sunday.

259
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,240
MACHINE BEEPS FASTER

260
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,880
What do you need?

261
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,720
More gauze, please.

262
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,400
Shit.

263
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,720
ALARM SOUNDS

264
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,240
Doctor?

265
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,240
Do you need the liga clip?
The patient looks oozy.

266
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,720
Erm...

267
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,240
Doctor?

268
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,080
Suction, please.

269
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,240
I need more light. I
can't see what's bleeding.

270
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,840
Get me two units
of blood. Be quick.

271
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,800
His mean pressures are low.

272
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,000
Giving a small bolus of
adrenaline to try and get control.

273
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,720
Get Ms Roberts back
here, and immediately.

274
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,720
You really should
try the liga clip.

275
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,120
Diathermy won't work.
It's suprasternal vein.

276
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,560
Shit.

277
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,280
Where's the bleed?

278
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,960
What's going on?

279
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,040
Bleeding from the
suprasternal vein.

280
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,720
Or it could be anomalous
vein. Diathermy made it worse.

281
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,560
Can we cut the alarms, please?

282
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,040
Don't do anything.

283
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,720
More gauze and hold pressure.
Yeah. Orange liga clip.

284
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,960
You burned the vein
and then retracted.

285
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,640
You should have clipped it.

286
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,320
Mia, get me two 0 Vicryl.

287
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
Mia, next one.

288
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,480
When you cut a vessel...

289
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,720
..you must always remember
there are two parts.

290
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,960
Great, Mia. Help me
retract the incision.

291
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,960
I see you've kept the
orange clips. Good thinking.

292
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, we're looking good here.

293
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,520
Mean pressure is good.

294
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,200
Really great work.

295
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,040
Thanks, surgeon.

296
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,600
More suction.

297
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,960
Hi.

298
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,640
Oh, cheers.

299
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,160
Is he seeing someone?

300
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,480
He's got a really
smug look on him.

301
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,400
What's happening with the
divorce? Is it definite? Oh, yeah.

302
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,120
He's on the fast track
out of a 15-year marriage.

303
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,360
The girls are so upset.
God, I'm so sorry.

304
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,240
You see the corporate types
sniffing around the department?

305
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,880
Yeah, yeah, I certainly did.
Investors for the new wing.

306
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,320
Thank you. Thanks.

307
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,960
The Pandian Foundation.

308
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,800
I'm afraid we're going be seeing
a lot more of them. Great.

309
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,240
Why? Do you know them?
One of the sons vaguely.

310
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,640
Really?

311
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,640
Oh, well, look, in that case,
let me introduce you, because...

312
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,720
..well, strictly between you and
me, the new wing is going to need

313
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,480
a technical director.

314
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,040
Would it mean working
with the Pandian family?

315
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,880
In an ideal world, yeah.
Why? Would that be a problem?

316
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,480
You know, I appreciate the
thought, but I don't think

317
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,120
I could be bothered with
the extra paperwork. Really?

318
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,240
OK. I thought you'd
jump at that chance.

319
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,120
Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me.

320
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,480
Hi.

321
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,240
Who's that?

322
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,960
Mia. She's a new nurse.
Very talented, actually.

323
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
Is she indeed?

324
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,680
Right.

325
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,960
Hi.

326
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,680
Hi.

327
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,120
I'm Mia.

328
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,240
Gemma. Senior management.

329
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,240
So watch what you say.

330
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,200
We just had our
first op together.

331
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
You were very good. Saved
you-know-who's bacon.

332
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,800
It was nothing.

333
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,480
So, are you settling in then?

334
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,480
Yeah, but I'm desperate
to find a place to rent.

335
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,000
Do you know anywhere good?
There's that house next to you,

336
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,960
where the gun toting school
teacher used to live. Gun toting?

337
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,280
You should tell you the whole
story one day. It's a wild ride.

338
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,480
And it's definitely available?

339
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Erm, not on a nurse's pay grade.

340
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,760
What she means is it's quite
fancy 'round her way. No offence.

341
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,600
None taken.

342
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,240
I feel like she's
giving me the eye.

343
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,880
Doctors and nurses tend to
stick to their own socially.

344
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,280
So, I'm not supposed
to sit here?

345
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,840
I wouldn't get on the wrong
side of Annette. Oh, I... Sorry.

346
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,080
You're fine. Stay where you are.

347
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,960
Thanks.

348
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,240
She broke my heart and
now she mends them.

349
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,480
Dr Charlotte Roberts.

350
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,960
Look at you. Oh, my God. Leo.

351
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,040
Wow. It's been how long?

352
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,040
A little while.

353
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,240
I always meant to get in
touch. Let's not go there, eh?

354
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,240
So, consultant surgeon hotshot.

355
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,720
Oh, you can talk. You live quite
the life, you big globe trotter.

356
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,240
I've seen the pictures. Ooh, so
you've been stalking me on socials.

357
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,960
Ah! I might have.

358
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,120
Well, anyway, I'm back.

359
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,960
How come?

360
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,480
Dad's ill. Like, properly ill.

361
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,120
On the way out.

362
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,200
Oh, Leo, I'm so sorry.

363
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,560
He's just been admitted
here, actually.

364
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,840
Getting the best care, of
course. Oh, that's good to hear.

365
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,240
Well, I'll, erm...
I'll let you get on.

366
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
You've got lives
to save, no doubt.

367
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,040
I'll see you soon.

368
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,520
You will.

369
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,480
Bye. Bye.

370
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,480
How are we feeling?

371
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,960
MUMBLING OK.

372
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,240
It's OK, you'll be
fine for a minute.

373
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,800
On a scale one to ten, how
much pain are you in right now?

374
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,720
Eight, eight-and-a-half.

375
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,720
OK, well, let's see if we
can get that down a bit.

376
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,640
I'm going to look after you.

377
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,040
Ah.

378
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,960
Mm.

Mm-hm.

383
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,960
Yep.

384
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,120
And this is for the front? Yeah.

385
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
OK.

386
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,560
All right! Thank you. Bye.

387
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Hi!

388
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Hi.

389
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,080
Thank you SO much for the
recommendation, I love it.

390
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,240
You... you don't mind, do you?

391
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,200
As soon as I saw it, I
knew I have to have it.

392
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,680
It's perfect.

393
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Oh, well...

394
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,640
Welcome to the street. Thanks.

395
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,800
Can I give you a
hand with anything?

396
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,600
Oh, no - I only
have one suitcase.

397
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,000
Uh, I left most of
my stuff back home.

398
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,680
OK, well I will
let you settle in.

399
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
Thanks.

400
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Hi!

401
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
I am Mia.

402
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,800
I just moved in to 49.

403
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
I'm Alan.

404
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,760
Number 37.

405
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,040
It's really nice of
you to be doing that.

406
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,600
Do you fancy a coffee?

407
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,120
You look like you
could use a break.

408
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,440
No.

409
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,640
I'd better... better get on.

410
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
I won't bite, I'm
just being friendly.

416
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,080
It's community service.

417
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,040
NEARBY: I know.

418
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,160
I saw it on your vest.

419
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,880
I don't need to know why.

420
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,200
HER FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

421
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,760
We've all done things.

422
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,600
It's like Fort Knox in here.

423
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Locks everywhere.

424
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,760
Is that Pete's doing?

425
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,240
No, I've just had them fitted.

426
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Very sensible.

427
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Keep people out.

428
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,000
Anything I can keep
an eye out for?

429
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,720
It's all right. Thanks, Alan.

430
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,360
Glad to have made my first
friend on the street.

431
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,760
Bloody hell. I know, right?

432
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,120
That's a bit keen.
It's totally weird.

433
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,560
She barely knows me, and
Gemma was just joking.

434
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,280
Hmm, I don't know.

435
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,960
Maybe we're just being buttoned
up and British about it.

436
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,160
Maybe it's totally normal
behaviour back in Norway.

437
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,960
Yeah, maybe.

438
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,440
I don't know. I'm not impressed.

439
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,960
Anyway, how the hell can she
afford that on a nurse's salary?

440
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,240
Hmm... Well, I guess we'll find out
more now that she's our neighbour!

441
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,640
Yeah.

442
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,200
Anyway, you won't complain.

443
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,680
A hot young nurse to
ogle at next door.

444
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,600
Oh, I'm too classy to ogle.

445
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,280
Ha - you are not!

446
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,960
What if she's actually
obsessed with you?

447
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,000
She's a stalker who's run away
from the icy fjords to haunt you.

448
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,040
Shut up.

449
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,520
Can you see if
dad wants a cuppa?

450
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,560
Damn, I think I've left
the teabags in the car.

451
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,200
Can you get them? Mm. Yep.

I am so sorry, we thought
he was in his room.

462
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,520
Oh, no, it's fine.
I'm just glad he's OK.

Dad? Oh...

464
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Hey.

465
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,280
I thought it was our house!

466
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,760
No, it's fine,
Dad. Nobody minds.

467
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,280
Come on... Uh, can I offer
anyone anything to drink?

468
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,960
No, thank you. We
need to get him back.

469
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,200
Come on, Dad. Mm. Yeah.

470
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,880
Well, you know, why don't you
stay and have a drink? And I'll...

471
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,480
I'll get him back. Yeah. Come
on, Henry. Let's get you home.

472
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,400
Don't you tell me
what to do, lad!

473
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,760
I'll see you back there, all right?
Dad, I'll be there in a minute, OK?

474
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,280
I'm so sorry about all of this.

Oh, don't be. DOOR CLOSES

476
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,040
You must be really
worried about him.

477
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Yeah.

478
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,440
The good days were outweighing
the bad until recently,

479
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,040
but he's definitely
getting worse.

480
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
I'm sorry.

481
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,320
I never got you anything,
what would you like?

482
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,680
Uh, just a glass
of water. Thanks.

483
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,000
So, what brought you here?

484
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,320
Just wanted a change,

485
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,760
and I've always fancied
living in the UK.

486
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
Why Leeds?

487
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,800
Actually, it was the first hospital
that accepted my application.

488
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,720
Thanks. But also, fun fact...

489
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,200
..my dad was a big
Leeds United fan.

490
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,440
SHE CHUCKLES Ah.

491
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,320
So, I grew up hearing about all
the players like Harry Kewell,

492
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,920
Lucas Radebe.

493
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,640
Well, you can catch a
match when he visits.

494
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,280
Yeah, no. That
won't be happening.

495
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,840
Wow, that's vintage. Do
they still make those?

496
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,560
Yeah, I don't do modern tech.

497
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,520
Really? Yeah, I hate it all.

498
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,480
I'm not on social
media or anything.

499
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,440
That's pretty unusual
for someone your age.

500
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Come on. There can't be that
much of an age gap between us.

501
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Please!

502
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
I will take the
compliment. SHE LAUGHS

504
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
You were gone a while.

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,880
Just being friendly.

506
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,200
So, is she a stalker
or not? SHE LAUGHS

507
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,360
Haven't worked that out yet.

508
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
How's Dad?

509
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
He's gone to bed.

510
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,920
I think he had a bit of a fright

511
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,760
when he realised he'd
gone to the wrong house.

512
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Lottie... Don't.

513
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,440
HE SIGHS We can't
avoid it any longer.

514
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,480
You've never liked him, you
just want him out of the way.

515
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,240
Hey, that is not fair!

516
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,320
You know it's the
other way around.

517
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,440
I've always liked your dad.

518
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,280
He just thinks you
could have done better.

519
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,920
SHE SIGHS He doesn't
mean all that.

520
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,760
