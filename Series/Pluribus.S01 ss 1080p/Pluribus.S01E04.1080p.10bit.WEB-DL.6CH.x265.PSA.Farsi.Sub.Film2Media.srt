00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,224
To all of our customers:

2
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,018
Management was
obligated to open your units.

3
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,712
Restitution will be made. Apologies.

4
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:24,922
Hola, señor.

5
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,132
Me llamo...

6
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,252
Hola, yo soy Carol sturka.

7
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,980
Estoy de los… United States...

8
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,424
leave me alone, you sons of bitches!

9
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,995
Fuck your mother, asshole!

10
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,182
Hi, Carol.

11
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,977
Can you hear us?

12
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,083
If you feel like responding,

13
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:16,570
all you have to do is pick up
the handset and speak into it.

14
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,426
It's got a push-to-talk button on the side.

15
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,594
Hey, Carol!

16
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:26,723
Works just like on Adam-12. Remember
how you used to love that show?

17
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,807
What?

18
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,143
Hi, Carol.

19
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:34,063
You left the hospital kind of
quickly. Is everything okay?

20
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,524
- Yep. Yes.
- Hey, Carol!

21
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,218
Just… just headed home.

22
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,156
Would you be more
comfortable in your range rover?

23
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,723
We can deliver it to you.

24
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:49,245
Also, we're happy to remove
the alcohol interlock device.

25
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,270
No.

26
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,788
Hey, Carol.

27
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:10,874
What are you doing here?

28
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,606
You're in my house? What the
hell are you doing inside my house?

29
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,899
Patching shrapnel holes.

30
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,443
Plus, there was a lot of
broken glass to clean up.

31
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,488
Well, who gave you
permission to be in my house?

32
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,989
You did.

33
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,909
Remember? When you were
riding with us in the ambulance

34
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,578
and we were applying a
pressure bandage to zosia's back.

35
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:34,082
And we asked you if you'd like
us to tidy up your house a little bit

36
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,625
and you sort of nodded absently.

37
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,045
Okay. Jesus, fine. Whatever.
Is everyone out now?

38
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,798
Yes. And we're almost done here, Carol.

39
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:45,969
But we could leave the finishing touches
for later and clear out now if you'd like.

40
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,077
Give you some space.

41
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,330
Do I know you?

42
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:51,957
Hi.

43
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,044
You're the fucking mayor.

44
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,088
Thank you for your vote.

45
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,900
I need a volunteer.

46
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,843
Not a politician.

47
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,281
You. Shorty.

48
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,827
Rest of you just take a… coffee
break, or whatever floats your boat.

49
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,453
Come with me.

50
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,478
Happy to.

51
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:46,321
Have a seat… what's your name?

52
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,032
Your name?

53
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,034
Well…

54
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:55,515
This individual went
by Lawrence j. Kless.

55
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,144
Or Larry to his friends,
of which he had many.

56
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,044
Whatever. Just… have a seat.

57
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,408
Do you like my books?

58
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,451
We love your books.

59
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,162
What do you love about them?

60
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:21,940
Everything. Your books are an
expression of you. And we love you.

61
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:27,922
Need you to be more specific.
Character arcs. Plot turns.

62
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:31,783
Yes. Yes. We love the
character arcs and the plot turns.

63
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,220
Which ones?

64
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,412
All of them.

65
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,810
No offense, Larry, but I
think you're bullshitting me.

66
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,629
Sounds to me like you haven't
even actually read my work.

67
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,382
But we have.

68
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,385
Gosh, where do we even begin?

69
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,239
In your first novel,

70
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:57,601
we greatly admire the description
of lucasia's gown on page two.

71
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:03,815
"Gossamer threads of the finest
shang silk shimmered like spun gold,

72
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:07,795
as if the sun itself were
showering lucasia's shoulders

73
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,988
"with resplendent kisses."

74
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,867
That made quite a few of us tingle.

75
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,828
Okay.

76
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:20,874
Ha.

77
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:30,527
How would you say my work
compares to… Shakespeare?

78
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,655
Equally. Equally wonderful.

79
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,558
You love my books as much as…

80
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,476
Macbeth?

81
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,329
Or much ado?

82
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:45,041
Yes. And Henry vi,
parts one, two and three.

83
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,628
Well, I mean, what about a
crowd-pleaser? Romeo and Juliet?

84
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:52,674
Wonderful. Have you read
the first quarto of 1597?

85
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:56,302
No, you haven't, but you
must. We'll bring you the original.

86
00:17:56,326 --> 00:18:01,015
So, Larry, you are telling me
that you love the wycaro series

87
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,395
as much as the most famous
English language play of all time?

88
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,795
Carol.

89
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:10,233
When we think about a passage
from one of your wonderful...

90
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,383
stop using that word.

91
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,386
From one of your books.

92
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:19,933
We experience it through
many eyes. Many hearts.

93
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,312
Do you remember a woman
named moira McAllister?

94
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:28,567
Crazy moira from Kansas City that
sends me these dumb crocheted hats?

95
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,904
Right, of course. She's one of you now.

96
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,572
Yes.

97
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:38,911
Before she found your books,
moira was deeply depressed.

98
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,955
In fact, she was going to…

99
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,978
You gave her something to live for.

100
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,795
You made her life better.

101
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:54,468
That's how we see your work,
and you. Through moira's eyes.

102
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,183
What did Helen think of my books?

103
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,415
Tell me.

104
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,667
Helen loved you very much.

105
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,109
Not what I asked, Larry.

106
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,907
Spit it out. What did Helen
think of the wycaro books?

107
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:20,970
Carol, you expressly told
us that Helen is off-limits.

108
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,390
Yeah, but you know what?
Special dispensation this one time.

109
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,960
What did Helen think
of my wycaro books?

110
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,005
Larry?

111
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,051
She thought they were… harmless.

112
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:40,639
Harmless?

113
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,746
"Cotton candy" was the phrase
she used in her mind. Mostly.

114
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,980
Cotton candy.

115
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,291
Yes.

116
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,711
And as you know,
Helen loved cotton candy.

117
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,631
I don't actually recall Helen
ever eating cotton candy.

118
00:19:56,655 --> 00:20:00,468
No. She consumed it four
times in her life, and each ti…

119
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:04,037
Yeah. You weren't there. But really…

120
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,629
Helen thought you knew
how to please your audience.

121
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:16,943
And she was so grateful for the
beautiful life the two of you shared,

122
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,135
that wycaro provided.

123
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,554
She was so proud of you.

124
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,891
What did Helen think of
my unpublished novel?

125
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,186
Bitter chrysalis.

126
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,023
What did she think?

127
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,072
Carol. This line of inquiry isn't…

128
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,492
- Can we talk about something else?
- I wanna know.

129
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,206
If you tell me, it'll make me happy.

130
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,592
Helen thought it was fine.

131
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,304
Fine as in good?

132
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,349
Or fine as in…

133
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:07,976
"Meh"?

134
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:10,729
Yeah, "meh."

135
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,690
What about the last 200 pages?

136
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,028
Helen stopped on page
137, paragraph three.

137
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,674
It's 489 pages long.

138
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,493
She read the last two pages.
Thought it wrapped up nice.

139
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,514
- If she hated it so much…
- she didn't hate it.

140
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:30,642
If she hated it so much, why
did she tell me to publish it?

141
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:34,813
Because she talked to val, and they
agreed that it wouldn't hurt your career.

142
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,463
And it would make you happy.

143
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,512
Out.

144
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,284
Hi, Carol.

145
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,418
Here.

146
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,132
Thank you.

147
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,218
You want this?

148
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,937
Do you like your police car?

149
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,624
Sure.

150
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:21,336
Fun fact, the police officer
who drove that vehicle,

151
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,880
his son's third-grade
teacher's husband's sister

152
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,466
was a chartered member
of the wycaro fan club.

153
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,242
Wow. Chills.

154
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,748
Listen, about the…

155
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:44,442
It wouldn't have happened if I had
had the foresight to understand that

156
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:51,533
you people are… generous enough to
give me actual explosives, and I regret it.

157
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,784
Please don't.

158
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,768
Well, I'm sorry you got hurt.

159
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,401
Are you up for answering
some questions?

160
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,029
Certainly.

161
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:14,806
About a week ago, the
undersecretary of ag…

162
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,309
Well, I mean you. I know
you're all one. I get the basics.

163
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:22,087
Anyway, all of you, in the
form of the undersecretary of…

164
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,404
You told me that you don't really
understand how all this works.

165
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:34,766
This joining. So my question
is, do you understand it now?

166
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,038
We have quite a bit more
insight into it now, yes.

167
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:43,942
So… is there a way to reverse it?

168
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,528
The joining?

169
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:56,496
Is there not a way to reverse it?

170
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,727
Zosia?

171
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:03,504
We want so much to
please you, Carol, but we…

172
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:06,816
We can't answer questions like that.

173
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,053
Right. Except your
non answer is my answer.

174
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:17,518
'Cause I don't think you can lie to me.
I don't think it's something you can do.

175
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:21,355
But you would definitely
tell me if the answer was no.

176
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:26,944
- We're sorry you're so troubled by this.
- Do I seem troubled?

177
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,113
This is me happy.

178
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,116
I mean, congratulations. You did it.

179
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,829
Soon enough you'll
understand everything.

180
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,291
And you will feel so much better.

181
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,088
Freedom falls.

182
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,386
You know what that means, don't you?

183
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:55,990
Of course you do. You know everything.

184
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:59,393
Tell me about it. Tell me about
camp fucking freedom falls.

185
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:12,465
You were sixteen. Beginning to understand
yourself. And your mother, she sent…

186
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,032
Yeah, go on. What'd she do?

187
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:21,307
She sent you to… a conversion
therapy camp in Covington, Tennessee.

188
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,978
Camp freedom falls.
You never forgave her.

189
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:28,046
Well… it was a terrible
experience for you.

190
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:30,608
The counselors there were some...

191
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,260
some of the worst
people I have ever known.

192
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,573
And they smiled all
the time. Just like you.

193
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:41,619
We're sorry, Carol. As for us, we
love and accept all beings equally.

194
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:46,249
Okay. If you're so accepting, then what
about what you're trying to do to me now?

195
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:49,085
Make me just like you. Even
though you know I do not want that.

196
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,254
You want to change us too, don't you?

197
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,739
Didn't you just ask if it's possible?

198
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:56,909
There is something else to consider.

199
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,120
We know what it feels like to be you.

200
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:04,499
To be alone. To suffer. We've been you.

201
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,336
But you've never been us.

202
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:41,072
- Everything all right, Carol?
- Yeah.

203
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,598
Can we help you find something?

204
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,642
Do you have any heroin?

205
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:51,231
Are you sure that's a good
idea? Remember last time?

206
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:54,610
What can I say?
Sophomore year was tough.

207
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,714
Course it doesn't hold
a candle to this shit.

208
00:28:57,738 --> 00:29:01,050
Carol, you should know. We
have a whole wing of bodies here

209
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,052
recovering from physical addiction.

210
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,828
Some might not make it.

211
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:08,057
Just… food for thought.

212
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,809
What are you, my Nana?

213
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,479
Yesterday, you people
gave me a hand grenade.

214
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:14,981
Are you seriously gonna
begrudge me some h?

215
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:17,984
Unfortunately, this hospital
doesn't stock heroin.

216
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,195
We have other opioids.

217
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:23,781
Ones that were manufactured
under more regulated conditions.

218
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,516
Would oxycodone suffice?

219
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:31,063
The closest unadulterated
heroin is eight miles from here.

220
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:33,273
It's on its way.

221
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:37,569
See? Put your mind to it, and
you guys are better than domino's.

222
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:41,424
Where are the hypodermic needles?

223
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,802
Might we suggest
snorting the heroin instead?

224
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,930
It's been quite a number of
years since you've injected.

225
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:49,349
No. In for a penny, in for a pound.

226
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:52,960
I'm gonna sid vicious this shit
like it's the Chelsea fucking hotel.

227
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:53,825
It's just…

228
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:58,247
It's absolutely ineffectious.

229
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,726
- Ineffecti…
- what?

230
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,420
This just… this shit does not work.

231
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,679
I'm on my own.

232
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:33,574
I miss you. I miss you.
I miss you. I miss you.

233
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:48,439
"'Don't', it said.

234
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:54,178
Dark slips and falling from
his clothing, a shadowy figure."

235
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:56,638
I think this could be a movie.

236
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:03,020
"She slowly turned to
face the raspy voice."

237
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:15,157
Listen. I'm not that bad.

238
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:28,003
And that fuckin'…

239
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:32,233
lady… lady pirate they sent?

240
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:35,945
Raban. I'm… I'm sorry. I mean zosia.

241
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:39,616
It's zosia. You didn't catch her
name because I knew her name. Zosia.

242
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,950
You're a fucking idiot.

243
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:41,975
Whatever.

244
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,811
How annoying is that chick.

245
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:51,318
Very, very fucking annoying. All smiley.

246
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:56,841
"Hey. Hi. Hey, Carol, we just…
we just wanna make you happy.

247
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:58,325
Blah, blah, blah."

248
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:05,582
She's like. "We're the whole
wide world, and we're stoked."

249
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:10,980
It's just life is one big, long
sunshiny walk in the park

250
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:13,298
"when you're one of us. Whoo."

251
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:21,723
No way. Nobody sane is that
happy. I call bullshit on that.

252
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:28,981
And why she gotta be
so goddamn fuckable?

253
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,091
We have a winner.

254
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:11,315
Hey, Carol.

255
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:41,512
Carol.

256
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,180
Hey.

257
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:45,682
You look…

258
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,661
Yeah.

259
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:51,372
Got a lot more color in your face.

260
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:52,957
Thank you.

261
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,334
We feel much better today.

262
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:58,153
Good. That's good. How
about some fresh air?

263
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,344
How was the heroin?

264
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:05,619
I threw it away.

265
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,372
Yeah. I wasn't in the mood.

266
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:11,458
Well, chickened out, actually.

267
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:13,293
Maybe for the best.

268
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,231
So…

269
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,901
When do they let you out of here?

270
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,405
I mean, when do you let you out of here?

271
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,285
Probably in a day or two.
Sooner if we need an extra bed.

272
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,055
That's great.

273
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,416
Hey, you know everything.

274
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,627
Whatever happened
to music in elevators?

275
00:38:57,546 --> 00:39:00,316
- When did they stop doing that?
- Would you like some?

276
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,633
Sure.

277
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,002
Nice day.

278
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:22,297
It is. Thank you for bringing us outside.

279
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:25,324
Well, I know how much it
sucks being in hospitals.

280
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:28,452
Better out here, right? Little…

281
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:30,621
little sunshine?

282
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:39,546
Really, really nice.

283
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,179
What do you think the
temperature is? About…

284
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:49,908
80?

285
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:54,120
Well, it's currently
27.778 degrees celsius,

286
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:55,896
or 82 degrees fahrenheit.

287
00:39:56,855 --> 00:40:00,317
The winds are three
kilometers per hour from…

288
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:04,112
From where?

289
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:08,200
From south… south-east…

290
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:13,330
Any chance of precipitation?

291
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,226
Percec…

292
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,295
Zosia, you with me? I need you to
answer some more questions, okay?

293
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:27,344
How do I reverse all this?
How do I reverse the joining?

294
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:29,864
No.

295
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:35,829
Zosia, how do I end this thing?
You… you already told me it's possible.

296
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:37,604
- We… no.
- Yes.

297
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:43,545
- Yes. Yes. You did. You pretty much did.
- No. No.

298
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,880
So, the hard part's over, right?

299
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:51,261
Now, all you have to do is tell me how to
put things back the way they used to be.

300
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:53,912
Come on. Tell me, tell
me. Come on, zosia.

301
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:57,517
Is it making you sad not
giving me what I want?

302
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,770
Is this making you sad? Don't be sad.

303
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,963
Tell me what I want to know.

304
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:22,191
Yeah.

305
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:27,154
Zosia, zosia.

306
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:33,178
Is there something I can do? Is
it something one person can do?

307
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:36,705
No, stop! Stop! Let go of her.

308
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:39,958
You can't touch me.

309
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:42,920
I have agency!

310
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:46,298
I have agency, and you can not interfere!

311
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,718
Back away from us!

312
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:07,236
Zosia, zosia. What is it?

313
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:11,865
Zosia, tell me what it… is it…
is it some kind of chemical?

314
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,887
Some kind of medicine?
Zosia, tell me what it is!

315
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:20,916
Please, Carol. Please,
Carol. Please, Carol. Please…

316
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,844
Zosia, tell me.

317
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:35,305
Tell me!

318
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:39,434
What is it? Tell me.

319
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:43,105
Tell me what it is.

320
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:47,234
Tell me. Tell me!

321
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:54,300
What… what's happening?

322
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:57,911
She's dying, Carol.
She's in cardiac arrest.

323
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:00,038
May we save her?

324
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:02,332
Yeah.

325
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:04,835
Excuse us, Carol.

326
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:37,701
Analyzing. Analyzing.

327
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:41,705
Shock advised. Stay clear of pa…
