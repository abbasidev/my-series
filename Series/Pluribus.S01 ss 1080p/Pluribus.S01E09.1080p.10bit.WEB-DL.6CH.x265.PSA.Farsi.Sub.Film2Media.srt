1
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,930
Kusimayu!

2
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,517
Sweetie, lunch is ready.

3
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,187
We made your favorite.

4
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,114
Is that it?

5
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,825
That's it.

6
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,077
Not much longer now.

7
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:22,499
Are you excited… or nervous?

8
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,712
Excited.

9
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,965
Except I've been sweeping this one spot

10
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,967
for half an hour.

11
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,928
We noticed.

12
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,931
It's very clean.

13
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,899
The sky is such a deep blue today.

14
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,152
And the air smells good.

15
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,071
It feels hopeful.

16
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,015
Is it here?

17
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,099
Yes.

18
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,937
Don't be scared, love.

19
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,482
I'm not.

20
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,813
Will it hurt?

21
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:58,066
No, Kusimayu. Not one bit.

22
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,821
We would never hurt you.

23
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,783
Are you ready?

24
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:24,134
Three… two… one…

25
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,652
How long till he gets here?

26
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,945
About two hours.

27
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,286
This is the guy I yelled at
when we were on the plane?

28
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,830
You had a lot on your mind.

29
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,170
And he's in an ambulance?

30
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,508
Long story.

31
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,430
What does he want?

32
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,683
He won't talk to us. So…

33
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,271
He did receive your first video.

34
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,772
Yeah?

35
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,359
Maybe he's heeding your call?

36
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,949
We're thinking…

37
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,492
I'm thinking…

38
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,289
I probably shouldn't be here
when he arrives.

39
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,291
It would upset him.

40
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,963
You don't have to be here either, Carol.
It's completely up to you.

41
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,764
All the way from… Paraguay?

42
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,684
Well, hell. I owe it to him, don't I?

43
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:46,313
I'll just hear him out
and send him on his way.

44
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,192
I mean, it's not like
he's dangerous, is he?

45
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,991
Is he? Dangerous?

46
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,081
We don't think he'd ever hurt you.

47
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,927
My name is Manousos Oviedo.

48
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,281
My name is Manousos Oviedo.

49
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,368
I am not one of them.

50
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,787
I wish to save the world.

51
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,293
Hola. Me llamo Carol Sturka.

52
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,589
Bienvenidos to… to… mi casa.

53
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:22,553
Hi.

54
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:24,888
Hablamos?

55
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,768
Yes. Yes, we talk.

56
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:34,773
Pe… Pero… No, no machete.

57
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,026
I no dangerous.

58
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,035
It's safe.

59
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,804
Okay. Aquí?

60
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,315
We talk in here.

61
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,194
Let's hablamos en mi casa.

62
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,364
Maybe better? Mejor?

63
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,784
We talk in the ambulance.

64
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,996
No. We talk in the casa.

65
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,569
Sorry, but I'm not getting into
some creepy ambulance with a--

66
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,780
Hey! What are you doing?

67
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:05,864
Give me that.

68
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,745
Are you crazy? They are listening.

69
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,372
They will find out about our plan.

70
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:18,293
I'm not an idiot. It's in airplane mode.
Airplane mode.

71
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,546
No signal. Give it to me. Give it.

72
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,799
No. Give it! Give… it!

73
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,634
- No!
- No.

74
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,762
Goddamn it.

75
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:33,934
Are you kidding me?

76
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,230
You know what?

77
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,276
You can get back in your
ambulancia and fuck right off.

78
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,527
I'm finito.

79
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,453
- Carol Sturka.
- Unknown word or name.

80
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,038
Bye.

81
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,725
Well this is going just great.

82
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,235
This sucks.

83
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,632
Nine thousand kilometers for this shit.

84
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,842
Shut your trap.

85
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,679
Okay. You win.
Telephone, yes. Ambulance, no.

86
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,013
But I need an umbrella.

87
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,249
Come. Here.

88
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,463
Y por qué? Big time por qué.

89
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,972
These weirdos have eyes up above.

90
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,518
They can read lips from space.

91
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:24,605
So, let's go inside.
The drones can't spy on us there.

92
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,448
Of course they can.
With microphones. Spy microphones.

93
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,450
You think they planted a bug in my house?

94
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,207
- An insect? With an insect?
- Ins… no, not a… not a ins…

95
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,875
not an insect. A bug.

96
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,294
Wait. Stop. Not you.

97
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,760
Why would they spy on us inside my house?

98
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,685
You are against them, no?
I watched your video.

99
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,192
Why would the weirdos send me that video?

100
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,276
I asked them to.

101
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:14,947
Carol Sturka.

102
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,327
Unknown word or name.

103
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,621
Why would they help two humans
come together to destroy them?

104
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,623
Destroy, I… Wait, I never said "destroy".

105
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:30,963
These weirdos are evil.

106
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,716
They have stolen everyone's soul.

107
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,472
If we can't fix them,
they are better off dead.

108
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,101
- They're still human beings.
- They are not human.

109
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,728
Yes, they are. They are… They are.

110
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,606
They're human. They're just…
They're just… They're different.

111
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,067
I mean, they're weird, yes.

112
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,445
- Too nice, yes, but they're not--
- Slow, slow.

113
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,075
They are not evil.

114
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:03,996
They wouldn't even kill an ant.

115
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,880
And isn't it evil to value a man
the same as an ant?

116
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:17,384
Have you even tried talking to them?
You could learn a thing or two.

117
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,553
They can't lie. Did you know that?

118
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,648
You said the weirdos abandoned you?

119
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,569
Yep. For 40 days.

120
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:41,992
Why they come back?

121
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,124
I don't know.

122
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,918
Why can't they pick an apple?

123
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,882
- This is estúpido.
- Esto es stupid.

124
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:57,966
I'm going inside.

125
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,252
Told ya. No micro-fono.

126
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,295
Happy?

127
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,397
I don't speak snap.

128
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:08,829
Please?

129
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:27,097
What about the 11 other survivors?
Did they respond to your video?

130
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,432
- Nope.
- No.

131
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,272
They didn't even want to talk?

132
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,940
Not to me.

133
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,819
But I bet they'd love
your sparkling personality.

134
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:48,994
You're not gonna find anything.

135
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,497
I need a drink.

136
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:55,501
You need a drink? You need a drink.

137
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,468
Hey. Do you mind?

138
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,429
What the hell?

139
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:14,228
Okay. Buddy, I don't know
how guests behave in Paraguay,

140
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,646
but here in Albuquerque,

141
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:20,025
you cockblock someone
from their booze, it's un grande mistako.

142
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,277
You're not even listening.

143
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:28,825
Unknown word or name.

144
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,035
What the hell is that?

145
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,083
A sensor maybe.

146
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,966
- Hi, Carol.
- Have you been spying on me?

147
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:47,010
- Spying?
- There is a thing in my liquor cabinet.

148
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:48,554
What kind of thing?

149
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:53,183
I don't know. A plastic, rectangular…
kinda tacky-looking…

150
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,769
like something out of a James Bond movie.

151
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:58,772
It sure as shit
didn't come with the cabinet.

152
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,649
Did you put it there?

153
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:03,610
Right. It wasn't us, Carol.

154
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:07,823
Do you remember May of 2011?
You were freezing your eggs.

155
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,157
Yeah. So?

156
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,410
The device is a movement sensor.

157
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:15,414
It detects when the cabinet is opened,
then records it.

158
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,792
Again, we didn't put it there.

159
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:22,963
Helen.

160
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:24,923
Sorry, Carol.

161
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,389
No, no, no.

162
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:34,808
It's all right.

163
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:38,270
I'll call you later.

164
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:50,824
It wasn't them.

165
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,454
No "weirdos."

166
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,080
Who?

167
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,501
Mi esposa.

168
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:02,961
She didn't like my…

169
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,549
Now I really need a drink.

170
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,762
Who you talk to on the teléfono?

171
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,766
Them. Always them.

172
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,144
The "Others."

173
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:26,527
I'm tired.

174
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:28,820
We save the world mañana.

175
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,387
So…

176
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,850
the kitchen has plenty of food.

177
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:05,732
There are fresh sheets on the bed,
towels in the bathroom.

178
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:16,493
We'll talk more tomorrow. Good night.

179
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,912
Sleep tight.

180
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:22,833
Who is this house?

181
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,881
I think their name is Wilson.

182
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,429
Look, I'll square it up with them
if they ever come back.

183
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,848
Jesus, that would be
a great problem to have.

184
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:42,186
This is not your house.

185
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:46,481
It's no me house, no? I no stay.

186
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:51,195
So that big yellow thing
parked outside is your ambulancia?

187
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,988
Go sleep in that for all I care.

188
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:55,866
My vodka is getting warm.

189
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,284
And you're welcome.

190
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,483
Hello, Manousos.
We are so happy to hear from you.

191
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,401
What can we do for you?

192
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,987
Am I speaking with the same
weirdo who Carol Sturka was talking to?

193
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:36,490
No. That was another individual.

194
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:41,119
What is the name of this individual?

195
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,080
Zosia.

196
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,959
I want to speak with Zosia.

197
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,278
The fuck?

198
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,680
Hi, Carol.

199
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:27,434
What the hell is going on here?

200
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:29,520
What are you doing?

201
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:33,607
- You say I need talk. I talk.
- Not to her.

202
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:35,692
What did you talk about?

203
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:39,821
Zosia? What did you tell him?

204
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,785
Todo. ¿Cómo se dice?

205
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:46,328
Everything.

206
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:48,664
Everything.

207
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:51,708
I know what todo means.

208
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,002
Come on, we're going.

209
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:00,050
Zosia. Now.

210
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,702
Send me another one.

211
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:44,887
Todo.

212
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:46,889
Todo, todo?

213
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,559
What kind of everything did you tell him?

214
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,102
- Sorry, Carol.
- Did you tell him…

215
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:56,064
What exactly did you tell him?

216
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,026
We didn't volunteer anything.

217
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,738
He asked us specific questions,
detailed questions.

218
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:05,199
He was very thorough and insistent.

219
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:06,283
And…

220
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:09,912
It's our nature. We had to answer him.

221
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:13,624
Yeah. You had to. Right. I know.

222
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,251
Why do you have to be so fucking honest?

223
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:19,630
- It's just not in us to lie to you.
- Yeah, but to me, not to him.

224
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:27,346
I know this is hard to understand,
but we love him the same as we love you.

225
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,267
No.

226
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:37,940
You can't love him the same.
It's not the same. It's different.

227
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,567
He is a stranger.

228
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:43,237
You barely know him.
You told me so yourself.

229
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,530
And we… we're…

230
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:48,033
You're my…

231
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:50,994
You are my…

232
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:55,541
You're my chaperone.

233
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:58,252
Mine.

234
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:01,088
Yes.

235
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:03,632
That's true.

236
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:06,176
- But--
- I want you to stay away from him.

237
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,511
All right?

238
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:09,805
I mean, did you see that machete?

239
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:14,935
And you should hear the things
he says about you. Weirdos. Evil so--

240
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,854
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, Carol.

241
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:18,397
Something's about to happen.

242
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,523
What?

243
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,567
Please. Don't be alarmed.

244
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:24,444
Zosia?

245
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,700
Zosia?

246
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:31,952
Jesus. Zosia! Zos…

247
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,832
Hey. Hey!

248
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,919
What's happening? I didn't even…
I wasn't… How…

249
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:47,259
Shit.

250
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:59,396
Jesus.

251
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,191
Get the hell away from him.

252
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:04,526
Hey.

253
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,611
Hey.

254
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,030
Hey!

255
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:12,910
Hey.

256
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,451
You're a psycho, you know that?

257
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:57,329
Do you have any idea how many people
you've probably just killed?

258
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:02,626
Hey.

259
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,962
You're okay. You're okay.

260
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:06,755
Just take it easy.

261
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,973
What the fuck?

262
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:47,379
Rick.

263
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:50,382
I know you are there.

264
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:53,260
I help you.

265
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:56,929
I am here.

266
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,436
Listen, Rick. I am here.

267
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:08,692
You come back. Yes?

268
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:11,069
You can do it.

269
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,909
Listen, listen. Listen, Rick.

270
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:19,995
You remember. Remember?

271
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:28,879
You are there. You are there.
But you come back.

272
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:32,925
Rick. I know you are there.
But you can remember. You…

273
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:35,761
You can come back. You can come back.

274
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:37,971
I am here.

275
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:41,266
Listen to me, Rick. Rick, look at me.

276
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:55,239
Back away. Now.

277
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:09,127
Hey.

278
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,346
Here. Lean up against the chair.

279
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:33,986
You all right?

280
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:36,530
Yeah.

281
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,617
Could we have some water?

282
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,286
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

283
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:54,256
Thank you.

284
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:06,101
Slow. Go… Go slow.

285
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:17,988
You sure you're okay?

286
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:21,658
Yeah. Thirsty, is all.

287
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:23,327
We'll…

288
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:28,081
I'll be fine. Thanks.

289
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,632
Would you like to know who that is?

290
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:38,258
I know who that is.

291
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:00,531
It wasn't me this time.

292
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:06,495
Screw you too, Laxmi.

293
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,840
Carol, I'm so sorry.

294
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,259
You know what we have to do.

295
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:56,670
Where's Manousos, Carol?

296
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,922
He is fine. Don't worry about him.

297
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:04,219
For what it's worth, you should know
he did warn us first.

298
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:05,888
Before he…

299
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:08,807
did what he did.

300
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:24,198
Please tell him
we're sorry it came to this.

301
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,580
They're leaving again.
All of them, the whole city.

302
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,750
I tried to tell you.

303
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,466
So what?

304
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,391
It was worth it. Completely.
Now I know much more.

305
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:40,858
You were right. I think there's a way
to put things back in their place.

306
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:44,403
Come on.

307
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:47,155
Now the work begins.

308
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:55,372
Carol Sturka.

309
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:56,540
Unknown word or name.

310
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:00,919
There's water and power.

311
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:05,549
If you need anything else,
food or whatever, dial zero.

312
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:13,932
Carol Sturka…

313
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:18,812
Unknown word or name. Do you want to
save the world or get the girl?

314
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:03,620
Thank you.

315
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:05,622
Here you go.

316
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:07,082
Okay.

317
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,341
That's good.

318
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:24,641
You seem pretty quiet.

319
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:25,851
No. I was just thinking.

320
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:27,686
Whatcha thinking?

321
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:28,770
Nothing.

322
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:33,192
No, I was…

323
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:40,240
I was just wondering if you,
the first you,

324
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:42,326
- the unjoined Zosia you…
- I understand.

325
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:43,744
…if she…

326
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:49,875
Did she have someone? In her past?

327
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,921
She did. It was a long time ago.

328
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:58,217
And what happened to them?

329
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:03,889
Are they in there?
Like, with you right now?

330
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,141
No.

331
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:08,519
They're not.

332
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:16,026
Man, I'm sorry.

333
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:22,324
I don't think I'm good at
just feeling good.

334
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,411
What does that to you?

335
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,916
- Does what?
- Like, makes you happy.

336
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,627
Like in our bodies. What chemicals?

337
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:36,421
There's a mix.

338
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:43,011
Serotonin, dopamine,
vasopressin, oxytocin of course.

339
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:45,097
Fun fact.

340
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:50,602
A study of zebra fish seems to imply
that oxytocin is responsible

341
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:53,856
for the development of empathy
in vertebrate species

342
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:55,983
about 200 million years ago.

343
00:46:58,277 --> 00:47:02,197
I must have every happy chemical
flowing in my bloodstream.

344
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:07,411
I keep thinking it's gonna go away,
but then it doesn't.

345
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:11,790
And I don't want it to.

346
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:13,542
I'm glad.

347
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:16,670
And it only gets better.

348
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:23,635
Better?

349
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:31,143
You're not talking about
the joining, are you?

350
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:35,230
That's not even…

351
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:38,192
You told me that you needed my stem cells.

352
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:40,319
What, did that change?

353
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:42,529
No. That's right.

354
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,115
So without my stem cells,
you can't convert me.

355
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:51,330
And if I don't expressly give you my
consent to jam a giant needle in my ass,

356
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:55,334
then you can't take them,
and I stay me. Right?

357
00:47:58,504 --> 00:47:59,963
That would be correct.

358
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:02,716
Would be.

359
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,682
There's no other way
to get my stem cells, is there?

360
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:20,901
If there wasn't, you'd say so.

361
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:27,950
So there is a way.

362
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:49,763
My eggs.

363
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:52,349
The ones I froze with Helen.

364
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:56,812
You have them, don't you?

365
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:04,319
We do.

366
00:49:05,404 --> 00:49:07,656
And you can make those
into stem cells, can't you?

367
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:10,409
It takes time and patience,
plus a bit of luck.

368
00:49:10,492 --> 00:49:11,660
But you're working on it.

369
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,581
We are.

370
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:18,959
You have to understand
how beautiful it is, Carol.

371
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:21,920
You'll see why we have to share it.

372
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:25,757
As happy as you've been,
that's only the tip of the iceberg.

373
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:30,637
In fact, Kusimayu.
You remember the young Peruvian girl?

374
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:32,472
She just joined us.

375
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:38,187
And I promise you,
she's happier than she's ever been.

376
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:42,024
You can hear that
straight from her if you like.

377
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:43,317
How long do I have?

378
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,779
Induced pluripotent stem cells
can be very fragile,

379
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:49,489
- and we're dealing with haploid--
- How long?

380
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:54,536
A month.

381
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,122
Hopefully no more than two or three.

382
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:09,426
If you loved me, you wouldn't do this.

383
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:12,179
Carol.

384
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:19,603
Please understand we have to do this
because we love you.

385
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:25,150
Because I love you.

386
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:33,992
Carol.

387
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:49,540
You win.

388
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:54,878
We save the world.

389
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:00,467
Carol Sturka.

390
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:04,930
What is this?

391
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:07,307
Atom bomb.
