1
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,168
You're back with us!

2
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:51,385
Manousos, can you hear us?
How are you feeling?

3
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,514
Do you remember what happened to you?

4
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,766
You gave us quite a scare.

5
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:03,021
The good news is that the infection
is responding to antibiotics.

6
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:08,694
However, you'll probably need
to stay here awhile.

7
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,656
You have to regain your strength.

8
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:20,664
Manousos.

9
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,501
We understand this is a lot to process.

10
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:30,090
But you need more time to heal.
Your body, it needs rest, it needs...

11
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,633
I am leaving.

12
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,511
What do I owe?

13
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,889
The bill! What do I owe?

14
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,349
You owe us nothing.

15
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,768
Not you.

16
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,272
The real people who were here before.

17
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,735
The hospital. Stitches, medicine.
Everything costs something!

18
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,111
Before The Joining,

19
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:55,324
your treatments from this
particular hospital would have cost…

20
00:01:55,407 --> 00:02:00,662
$8,277.53 in either
Balboas or American dollars.

21
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,997
Balboas?

22
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,918
I'm in Panama?

23
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:11,173
Will you be requiring an itemized receipt?

24
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,854
I, Manousos Oviedo,
owe this hospital $8,277.53.

25
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,565
Plus one ambulance.

26
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,705
Please don't get up.

27
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,248
- Sorry.
- Our pleasure.

28
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,542
Thanks.

29
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,682
Thank you.

30
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,061
Cheers.

31
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,145
Cheers.

32
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,447
It's not too sweet?

33
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,991
I always worry I don't add enough water.

34
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,743
- It's perfect.
- Yeah?

35
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,872
'Cause I can add more if you want. Water.

36
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,755
The O'Keeffe looks good in here.

37
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,511
I was about to return that.

38
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,930
We think it looks wonderful right there.

39
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,431
I was

40
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,478
just keeping it safe, really.

41
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,439
There's been a lot of animals
roaming around here.

42
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,483
Wolves.

43
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,903
Buffalo. Buffalos.

44
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,242
And if they were to wander
into the museums

45
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,078
and start rubbing up
against the paintings, it's gonna be…

46
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,830
Yeah.

47
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,915
That could be problematic.

48
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,713
We can secure all those buildings
if you like.

49
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:38,797
Great.

50
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,465
That would be great.

51
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,730
Don't want a buffalo eating the Mona Lisa.

52
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,784
I don't know what to talk about.

53
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,456
Who says we have to?

54
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,920
How about a board game?

55
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,926
- Seriously?
- Could be fun.

56
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:29,515
All right.

57
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,658
So, what are we feeling?

58
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,955
Bananagrams?

59
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,166
No. That wouldn't be any fun.

60
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,251
You know all the words.

61
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,547
Chess. No.

62
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,881
Jesus, no.

63
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,717
Also, you're missing
a white rook, remember?

64
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,262
But we can get you a new one.

65
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,432
What else we got?

66
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,813
Risk. World domination. That's hilarious.

67
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,524
Not sure why we even have that one.

68
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,696
What about the one you used to play
with your cousins?

69
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,749
Too slow.

70
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,629
Are you letting me win?
Or do you just suck at this?

71
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,465
Keep playing and you'll find out.

72
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,722
I have not thought
about this game in years.

73
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,602
My nana had a blue deck and a red deck,

74
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,814
and she used to make us put 'em all back
in the right boxes before we put 'em away.

75
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,233
Loser has to sort.

76
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,447
Would you like your cousin Henry
to come visit?

77
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,658
You haven't seen him since Christmas 2005.

78
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,747
It would be exactly
like talking to you, right?

79
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,459
Then, nah.

80
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,420
He didn't wanna see me these past 41 days,
why bother now?

81
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,301
So why do they call it spit?

82
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,887
We don't know exactly.

83
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,639
What do you mean? You know everything.

84
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,097
- Right? Spit.
- Uh-huh.

85
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,227
We know it originated
in the UK during the '80s.

86
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:43,273
There's different theories as to
who named it, but no clear answer.

87
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,026
Ready? Spit.

88
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,987
In 1986, a man named…

89
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,491
Wow.

90
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,285
It's like playing cards
with fucking Google.

91
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,501
Is everyone back now?

92
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,880
Mostly. Another hour or two should do it.

93
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:14,805
Do you…

94
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,101
You think you guys could maybe
power wash that up?

95
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,937
Absolutely.

96
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,064
Thanks.

97
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,486
Well, have a good night.

98
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,657
Carol, we can stick around if you like.

99
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,867
As long as you want.

100
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,160
What? No. No, no.
I'm sure you have things to do.

101
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,622
And I've got, like,
a bunch of chores, whatnot.

102
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,467
It just occurred to me,

103
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,761
I never even thought
to ask you where you live.

104
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,890
There's no such thing
as ownership anymore.

105
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,808
No private property.

106
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,854
Wherever we hang our hat is our home.

107
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,480
Right, but…

108
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,733
I mean, where do you sleep at night?

109
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,526
We can show you.

110
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,837
Everybody sleeps together?

111
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,591
Why?

112
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,219
It saves on electricity.

113
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,386
Natural gas.

114
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,141
It's more efficient to heat and cool
one big room than hundreds of small ones.

115
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,896
This isn't gonna turn into the orgy scene
at the end of that Matrix movie, is it?

116
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,397
Not unless you want it to.

117
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,743
We make use of spaces
like this all over the world.

118
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,538
Malls, churches, convention centers.

119
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,832
Wait, this dog is not one of you, is it?

120
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:06,959
Definitely not.

121
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,961
Though he is a very good boy.

122
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,963
His name is Bear Jordan.

123
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,257
Hey. Hey, Bear.

124
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,217
Hey.

125
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,097
- I didn't realize you kept pets.
- We don't.

126
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,643
But when an animal refuses to leave its
former owner's side, we take care of them.

127
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,355
Bear is fond of Malcolm over there.

128
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,155
Would you like to stay with us tonight?

129
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,369
We can make you your own bed,
if you'd like.

130
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,704
- No, no.
- In private.

131
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:47,499
That's okay. I'm gonna head home.

132
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,418
Whatever makes you happy.

133
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,630
We can drive you.
Or you're welcome to take our car.

134
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,215
I'll figure something out.

135
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,302
Do you mind if we lie down?

136
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,554
Please.

137
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,183
We had a wonderful time with you.

138
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,811
We're very happy to be back.

139
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,230
Yeah.

140
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:41,530
Would you like us to make you breakfast?

141
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,158
No, no. I can manage.

142
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,707
I had a nice time too.

143
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,298
Hard to beat this view.

144
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,685
Man, I love trains.

145
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,982
There's just something about
the sound of a train horn, you know?

146
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:41,567
What about it?

147
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,197
Come on, I must've told some human being
at some point that I love train horns.

148
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:54,246
I thought you knew everything about me.

149
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,455
Not this.

150
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,254
It is…

151
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,257
the loneliest sound in the world.

152
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,857
How do you do that?

153
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:26,695
Something to do with
the body's electromagnetic field.

154
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,364
Our natural electric charge, so to speak.

155
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:33,118
You have one too, just unused.

156
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,622
So… like radio?

157
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:37,789
Sort of.

158
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,250
But radio transmission is like talking.

159
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,585
It's conscious.

160
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,712
Our communication is unconscious.

161
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:44,880
Homeostatic.

162
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:46,965
Like breathing.

163
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,426
So…

164
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,096
No. No.

165
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,350
There's still a lot
we don't really understand.

166
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,022
Why do you still need trains anyway?

167
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,986
Food distribution.

168
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,842
Carol, you okay?

169
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,261
Yeah. I'm great.

170
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,638
Sorry. Carry on.

171
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,351
Does this feel good to you too?

172
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,478
Absolutely.

173
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,146
So…

174
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,275
Like… how?

175
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,069
I mean, I know you're getting
a massage right now,

176
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,865
but technically it's you
giving it to yourself.

177
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,533
Yes.

178
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:59,121
Meanwhile, you're simultaneously
giving me a massage.

179
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,915
- So, I mean…
- That's true.

180
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,505
How does that work?

181
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,135
Does everyone feel
what you're feeling right now?

182
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,096
Is the whole world getting a massage?

183
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,682
No. Not exactly.

184
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,518
It's kind of like…

185
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,397
In the last ten minutes,

186
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,695
there's been 1,674 deaths and 965 births.

187
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,906
And…

188
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:40,037
Just as we said this, a man in Bulgaria
was accidentally impaled on an iron fence.

189
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,413
Oh, Jesus.

190
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,497
It's okay.

191
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,542
We don't think he pierced anything vital.

192
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:50,380
To feel everything all at once
would be unbearable.

193
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,759
But we know it as it happens.

194
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,428
We're aware.

195
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:02,059
Like we're aware
that you just got goose bumps.

196
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,650
Having said all that,

197
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:16,114
this massage feels… good.

198
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,004
So, that's where it came from.

199
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,089
That's it.

200
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,007
Its star, anyway.

201
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,010
- Kepler-22.
- Uh-huh.

202
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:40,597
And the planet, which you can't see,
is Kepler-22b.

203
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:44,768
That's our name for it.
We have no idea what they call it.

204
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,438
It's got a radius
roughly twice that of Earth,

205
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,650
and we think their planet
may be one enormous ocean.

206
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,909
Sometimes we close our eyes
and try to picture it.

207
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,007
I'm not sure I'm looking
in the right spot.

208
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,384
I mean, I see the…

209
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,220
the Swan, I think.

210
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,848
Do you see a star
brighter than the others?

211
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,642
Yes.

212
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,102
That's Deneb.

213
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:30,772
Then if you trace a straight line up
from the first section of wing,

214
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,900
you should see a tiny dot of light.

215
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,319
I can't tell one dot from the next.

216
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,988
There's a lot of light pollution
coming from the city.

217
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,657
Let's see what we can do about that.

218
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,083
Wow.

219
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,463
Try it now.

220
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,012
We could place it in the center
of the eyepiece for you.

221
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,639
Might make it easier for you to spot.

222
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,099
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

223
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,351
Yeah, I think I see it.

224
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,186
- I see it.
- Yeah?

225
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,270
I do.

226
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:16,735
Yeah.

227
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:24,743
So, what are the people like
on Kepler-22b?

228
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,448
We'll probably never learn
the first thing about them.

229
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,249
They're too far away.

230
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,918
But we know we love them.

231
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:34,795
And we're grateful to them.

232
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,423
And we'll pay it forward,
however long that may take.

233
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,300
What does that mean?

234
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,512
We have to share their gift.

235
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,265
With whoever else might be out there.

236
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:54,231
Just to be clear, out there, "out there"?

237
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,653
How exactly will you do that?

238
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:47,242
Can you do me a favor?

239
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:51,872
Hey.

240
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,667
Thanks. Thanks.

241
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,002
Our pleasure.

242
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,796
Does this mean what we think it means?

243
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,883
- What?
- You're writing again?

244
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:04,968
Writing…

245
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,013
Wycaro. Yeah.

246
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,640
Yeah.

247
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:13,560
I had an idea and just started
filling up the whiteboard,

248
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,604
and suddenly my marker ran dry.

249
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,940
So, yeah. I'm writing again.

250
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,817
Well, don't let us keep you.

251
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:25,405
We are just so excited
to have something new to read.

252
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,698
And another Wycaro.

253
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,910
That's only if you want to
share it with us, of course.

254
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:31,411
Absolutely no pressure.

255
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,164
Sure.

256
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,167
Happy writing, Carol.

257
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,234
That was good.

258
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:46,987
It was close.

259
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,238
Whoopee.

260
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,032
Don't patronize me.

261
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,283
I'm telling you.

262
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,952
I swear to God, when I was a kid,
I used to crush this game.

263
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,120
We know.

264
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,336
Are you frickin' kidding me?

265
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:03,420
Jesus.

266
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,839
You told me you never played before.

267
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:07,007
Zosia's never played.

268
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,553
But we have the combined knowledge
of every living croquet champion,

269
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:14,556
so that's, you know,
a bit of an advantage.

270
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,767
Yeah. I get that with, like,
chess or whatever,

271
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,727
but hitting a ball is muscle memory.

272
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:21,772
You guys all share that too?

273
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:26,818
Maybe. Or maybe you just suck.

274
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,451
We're doing that.

275
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,037
Okay. Okay.

276
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:43,293
Well, just for that,
I'm gonna beat all seven billion of you.

277
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:45,003
Yep. So,

278
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,549
seven billion butts about to get kicked.

279
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,301
May we ask you a question?

280
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:52,386
Sure.

281
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:55,472
What was your best day writing?

282
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,349
No such thing.

283
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,684
Really?

284
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,561
Come on, you have other writers in there.

285
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,604
You should know. That's like asking,

286
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:05,128
"What's the most fun you ever had
getting your teeth drilled?"

287
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,944
You poor, tortured artist.

288
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,613
By the way, it's still my turn.

289
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:16,827
Why are you asking?

290
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,936
This place has been closed for years.

291
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,989
I never thought I would be back here.

292
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,079
May we join you?

293
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,331
Please, please.

294
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,376
Thanks.

295
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,378
Would you tell us what you're feeling?

296
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:10,631
We'd be honored to share it with you.

297
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:16,595
Well…

298
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,141
It all started right here.
As you obviously know.

299
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:29,441
I used to write longhand
on yellow legal pads.

300
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,693
That I stole from my temp job.

301
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:37,741
I had like 20 of 'em, and I'd have to go
back and forth, scratch stuff out.

302
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:41,453
The whole time, I'm just dreaming
of saving up enough money for a laptop.

303
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:43,789
And then I'd rip the pages out,

304
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:47,251
clip them all together
with this giant metal clip,

305
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,335
which I also stole,

306
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:52,506
which took both hands to pry it open

307
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:56,969
just enough
that I could add a single page.

308
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:02,057
It would give me huge dents in my palms.

309
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,059
The whole thing was a fuckin' nightmare.

310
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:11,108
And there was this waitress, Bri.

311
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:14,278
I loved her.
She kept my coffee topped off.

312
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:17,239
She never hassled me
about hogging the booth all day long.

313
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,246
Oh, my God.

314
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,959
Take all the time you need, hon.

315
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:41,388
This place.

316
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:43,640
This place…

317
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,395
was my escape.

318
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:51,982
I was devastated when it…

319
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,362
it… Wait, it burned down.

320
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,283
You rebuilt it?

321
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,745
From… Wait. From nothing?

322
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:06,330
From an empty lot?

323
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:08,457
We did.

324
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,635
God, I miss those days.

325
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:24,556
Working all night, so I could write
all morning, and then…

326
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,935
I mean, those were the best days.

327
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,574
Is everything okay?

328
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:53,585
Carol?

329
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:10,704
You left us kind of quickly today.

330
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,623
Is everything all right?

331
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:14,249
Yeah, peachy.

332
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,084
Sarcasm.

333
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,711
Yes.

334
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:20,797
You want a drink? You want a drink.

335
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:23,091
We'll have one if it pleases you.

336
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:24,676
"We."

337
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,345
"We think. We want."

338
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:29,181
Would it kill you to say "I"?

339
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,100
- Would it?
- Of course not.

340
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:34,770
We…

341
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:39,566
I… find it odd, semantically,

342
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,943
but, of course, she could…

343
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,569
We c…

344
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,197
Wow.

345
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,116
All the brains in the world,
and you can't navigate a fucking pronoun.

346
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,577
Is this why you're upset?

347
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:55,958
Where was that waitress living?

348
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,042
Bri.

349
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:00,963
On "Joining Day,"
back when she was she, not you.

350
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:02,256
Where was she?

351
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,340
Miami.

352
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:05,926
Working? Vacation?

353
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:09,012
Working. As a cosmetologist.

354
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,056
Recently married.

355
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,141
But not anymore.

356
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:17,896
So, she had moved on with her life,
and then, what?

357
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:23,944
You dragged her back here to do
a little playacting? Waitress theater?

358
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,781
Carol, we're not sure we understand
what's troubling you.

359
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:30,492
Can you be more specific?

360
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:33,245
You are trying to distract me.

361
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:35,581
Knock me off course.

362
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:40,002
You rebuild my favorite diner,

363
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:44,089
you jump for joy
when I tell you I'm writing again,

364
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:45,382
but it's all an act.

365
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:49,261
It's manipulative bullshit
because you know I haven't given up.

366
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:50,971
Admit it.

367
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,224
Tell me you know I won't give up.

368
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:56,643
We know.

369
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:00,939
We wish you would.

370
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:06,737
But it's also true we love Wycaro.

371
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,864
All right, honesty.

372
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,325
Let's go for it. Cards on the table.

373
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,118
I like you.

374
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:15,329
You people. You… whatever.

375
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:17,206
You're…

376
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:20,876
There's a lot of things
that I like about you,

377
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,086
but this?

378
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:27,007
This is a train wreck.

379
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:29,718
This is unsustainable.

380
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:33,514
It's mental illness. It's psychosis.

381
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:37,142
You are starving, and you can't even
pick a goddamn apple off a tree?

382
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:38,477
I… How…

383
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:46,985
Someone has to put the world right,
even if it means you all leave me again.

384
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:49,571
Even if it means that I'm…

385
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,495
- Morning.
- Hey.

386
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,709
How long have you been awake?

387
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:27,794
Long enough.

388
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:36,887
Do you want to read chapter one?

389
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,555
Don't leave me hanging.

390
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:21,890
Raban…

391
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:24,977
is a woman now.

392
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,144
Long overdue.

393
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:29,815
But I figured, now, why not?

394
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:31,400
Makes sense.

395
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:34,528
So, are you going to just retcon it?

396
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:37,406
No need.

397
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,241
- It can happen canonically.
- How?

398
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,660
The Font of Truth from the second book?

399
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,412
No.

400
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:44,872
No, that wouldn't work.

401
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:48,250
- No, yeah, you're right.
- The Shapeshifters of Gollinbray.

402
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:53,565
I was thinking of the Caverns of...

403
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:55,090
- The Caverns of Aevalor.
- Yeah.

404
00:36:55,174 --> 00:36:58,802
- But weren't those lost to time?
- Well, sure.

405
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:02,097
But what is time to someone like Raban?

406
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:04,850
They just have to get their hands
on Captain Virgil's

407
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,852
- temporal compass and…
- Temporal compass!

408
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:09,563
- Wow.
- I thought about Lucasia

409
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,398
using the compass for

410
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:13,376
something, for the life of me
I can't remember what,

411
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,236
but it just…
it makes more sense for Raban.

412
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,781
Yeah.

413
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,161
So, you like it so far?

414
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:27,247
Carol.

415
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:28,916
We…

416
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:32,419
I love it.

417
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:40,302
Joe Pass on guitar.

418
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,804
Ray Brown holding it down on bass.

419
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:45,057
Mickey Roker on that blazing snare,

420
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,144
and of course, the incomparable
Dizzy Gillespie on trumpet.

421
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:50,521
And now here's a real treat.

422
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:56,235
Miles Davis "All of You" on KHNM, 92.4 FM.

423
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:05,577
I hope you're making
enough for both of us.

424
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,663
You're eating too.

425
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:14,294
You like omelets, right?

426
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:16,213
We do.

427
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,465
We love all breakfast food.

428
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,801
Sure. Sure.

429
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,720
But you… you.

430
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:24,972
Like lowercase "you"…

431
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:27,766
Does Zosia like omelets?

432
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,227
Zosia likes…

433
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:33,397
I like omelets.

434
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:36,733
Never had many chances to try them.

435
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,656
What is your favorite food?

436
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,332
Mango ice cream.

437
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:56,378
I love mango ice cream.

438
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:02,134
There was an old man in my neighborhood
who sold it out of a little cart.

439
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:08,557
I would watch the ships leaving Gdańsk.

440
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,059
Brand new. First voyage.

441
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,979
I was maybe… ten years old?

442
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:17,983
And I was fascinated by these giant ships.

443
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:19,651
Who built them?

444
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,486
What for?

445
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,530
Where were they going?

446
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:26,992
And now I know.

447
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,871
Sometimes, the man with the cart

448
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:34,958
would hand out ice cream bars to us
when he had too many to sell.

449
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,545
He knew we didn't have
two coins to rub together.

450
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:40,839
It was just after
the country had opened up,

451
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,550
and suddenly he had new flavors.

452
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:45,636
Mint, coffee, peach.

453
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:50,015
But mango,

454
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:53,018
that was my favorite.

455
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:02,945
Thank you for sharing that.

456
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:13,413
Zosia?

457
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,585
You're going to have a visitor.

458
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,312
Okay.

459
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:38,856
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
