1
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,615
I found a phone.

2
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:34,327
It looks like it's from 1967,
but I think it will work.

3
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:36,371
Just a second, Jimmy.

4
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:38,915
Excellent.
Thank you for being so careful.

5
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:41,918
- Sir, we have to get in your attic.
- For what?

6
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:43,253
The hookup.

7
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,922
- That's all right. Don't bother.
- Only take 20 minutes.

8
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:49,509
- You can't use it if I don't do it.
- No, it's all right. We're not gonna.

9
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:52,512
When you're done, would you get
some more lamps in the garage?

10
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:54,556
Thanks.

11
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:56,599
- So you got a phone.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,894
Yard's half-mowed.
Sockets and stuff are looking A-okay.

13
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,272
I'm gonna check again
just to make sure.

14
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:05,392
- We're almost there.
- Good, good.

15
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:09,779
What do you think? On? Off?

16
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,574
I think off.

17
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:13,825
Yeah. You're right.

18
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,368
Off, it is.

19
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:18,496
Chuck,
are you sure this is the right play?

20
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:19,914
I mean, in my experience...

21
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,584
the bigger the lie,
the harder it can be to dig out.

22
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,755
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

23
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:32,510
Hey, guys, think we're set with the lamps.

24
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:35,054
Can someone give me a hand
with this phone?

25
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,549
It's open.

26
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:01,891
Rebecca.

27
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,310
- Chuck.
- You look lovely.

28
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:06,396
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- And you.

29
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:10,525
- You look...
- Hey, what's with the candles?

30
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,486
- Why are you sitting in the dark?
- Wondering the same thing.

31
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,030
Oh, my God. The afternoon I've had.

32
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,825
Two hours ago,
I take the sea bass out.

33
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:22,412
No sooner is it prepped
and resting then, boom...

34
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,122
power goes down.

35
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,748
I get on the phone to the city.

36
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:31,004
To make a long story short, those bozos
at PNM mixed up my payment.

37
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,550
The deadbeat at 512 San Cristobal
hasn't been paying his bills.

38
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:38,428
- And of course, I'm 215.
- 215.

39
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:39,562
Exactly.

40
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,056
They say they'll have it on
again by tomorrow.

41
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:45,560
In the meantime, I borrowed
some camping gear from my neighbours.

42
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,103
Hence, the rustic flair.

43
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,523
- Jeez. So, what do we do?
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,317
Get out and go to a restaurant?

45
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,236
We could hit Seasons. Your treat.

46
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,572
We could. Yeah.

47
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,909
But, you know, dinner's almost ready.
And the fish...

48
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:04,120
would've had to throw it out.
Just have to toss it in the pan.

49
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:06,331
How about we just rough it?

50
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,358
Are you okay with that?

51
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,543
Well...

52
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,048
Why not? It'll be fun.
We'll do an haute-cuisine campout.

53
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,175
Great, then it's settled.
Let me take that.

54
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,844
- Take your coat.
- Oh, yeah. Here. Thank you.

55
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,434
Oh, my God.

56
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:27,894
I can't eat another bite.

57
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:32,106
Cheers.

58
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,292
To the Galloping Gourmet.

59
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:36,019
Yeah.

60
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:42,367
- The Calvados is perfect.
- You always liked it.

61
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,078
Here...

62
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:46,454
- Let me get this.
- No, no.

63
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:49,499
- You don't have to.
- The least I can do is the dishes.

64
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,250
Thank you.

65
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:53,252
Thanks, Jimmy.

66
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:59,250
This turned out better than I thought.

67
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,011
I'm so sorry about the lights.

68
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:05,056
Oh, it's nice. Atmospheric.

69
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:09,018
I mean,
I still can't get over Jimmy being a lawyer.

70
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:12,939
Neither can I. He's got his own shingle
out and everything.

71
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:16,734
I mean, a real, responsible citizen.
I mean, who would've thought?

72
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:24,450
This place is the same.

73
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,828
I mean, I would've thought you'd...

74
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,457
change things up,
move things around.

75
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,627
You've got great taste,
and if it ain't broke...

76
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:37,422
- How's the tour going?
- It's good.

77
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,091
Good. The Far East this fall.

78
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:43,511
China, South Korea and Vietnam.
That's gonna be exciting.

79
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,181
- Yeah.
- And then, after Santa Fe this week...

80
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,517
- we're back to Central Europe.
- And it's good?

81
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,102
Well, it's a lot of hotels.

82
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,311
I mean, in Budapest...

83
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,982
I think I saw mostly the inside
of a concert hall and the Marriot.

84
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,152
But, you know, I shouldn't complain.

85
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,612
You're not complaining.
You're observing.

86
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,493
Did you finally get to see Salzburg?

87
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:10,329
Not yet, but next month after Vienna.

88
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,124
Do you remember
when we tried to go to Salzburg?

89
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,376
And that crazy old lady on the scooter...

90
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:18,087
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Chased us out of the train station.

91
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,630
Yeah, and then...

92
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,049
And then we went and got...

93
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:25,011
It was a raspberry Linzer torte
in Innsbruck...

94
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,346
to make ourselves feel better.

95
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,058
- You said, we'll never finish this.
- And then we did.

96
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,314
So what's after Asia?
Any plans for stateside?

97
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:39,692
Oh, you know, hopefully next year.
You know, maybe a residency.

98
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,069
That would be sweet.

99
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,030
I mean, you know,
I like the buses and trains and flying...

100
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,491
but I...

101
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:50,745
I miss having one...
One place to hang my hat.

102
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,586
Oh, God.

103
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,880
I'm sorry. I... I hate that thing.

104
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,465
I feel like I'm on a leash.

105
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,178
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:12,850
Oh, it's my conductor.
I have to take this.

107
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,811
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,521
Hi, Andre.

109
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,023
No, I'm just at dinner. What's up?

110
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:23,069
Well, I could do that at rehearsal.
Yeah, no problem. Yeah.

111
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:26,989
No, I know that they're coming in late
on bar 16.

112
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:31,661
Yeah. Got it. Got it.
I will make sure that...

113
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,497
Can you hold on one second?
Let me just get a pen.

114
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,252
Yeah, no, I... I...

115
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,212
Yeah, hold on one second.

116
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,332
Yeah, we could do it whenever you need.

117
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,384
Okay. All right, shoot.

118
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,512
Okay. Haydn.

119
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:51,889
Okay...

120
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:54,475
- Chuck.
- I'm all right.

121
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:57,770
Well, do you want me
to rehearse the cellos separately?

122
00:07:58,062 --> 00:07:59,105
Rebecca. Rebecca.

123
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:01,816
Just one minute.

124
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:05,278
Well, no. It's not just him.
It's the whole section, actually.

125
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,614
- Rebecca.
- Yeah, yeah. No.

126
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,742
That's fine. Yeah.

127
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,369
Chuck, what the hell?

128
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,082
Andre?

129
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,711
I'll have to call you back. I'm sorry.

130
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,423
What is your problem?

131
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,678
Say something.

132
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:39,937
It is incredibly bad manners
to answer a cell phone in company.

133
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:41,689
It's very rude.

134
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:46,319
I... I'm sorry. I...

135
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,987
I didn't know you felt that way.

136
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:50,406
I didn't mean to offend you, Chuck.

137
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,368
I may have overreacted.
That was very abrupt.

138
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,538
No. I understand.

139
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:02,793
It's getting late.

140
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,506
Thank you for a lovely dinner,
but I should be getting back to the hotel.

141
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,258
Just give me a minute and we can...

142
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:12,428
No. I'll just get a cab.
I don't want to put you out anymore.

143
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,263
- Please, let me.
- No, really.

144
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:17,225
A cab is the easiest.

145
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:22,104
You gotta do something.
You can't let her leave like this.

146
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,232
- Just tell her what's going on.
- No.

147
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,484
She'll understand.

148
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:30,238
Would you rather she think
you're a raging prick than know the truth?

149
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,781
No.

150
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:33,866
Look, if you won't tell her, then I will.

151
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:37,536
No, no, no. You will not tell her.

152
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,165
You will not tell her.

153
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,709
All right.

154
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:48,422
Hi, Andre. Yes. Oh, I'm sorry about that.
I dropped the phone.

155
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,041
Jesus, what are you doing, man?

156
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,169
There's barely any oxygen in that bag.
You're suffocating her.

157
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,337
Her?

158
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,506
Just because
you don't see swinging dicks...

159
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:33,509
doesn't mean you can't tell
a boy fish from a girl fish.

160
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,971
Oh, yeah. See.
Now I can see the lipstick.

161
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,931
This is a living creature.

162
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:40,558
It's not a piece of furniture.

163
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:43,769
So after this, you take her home,
you put her in a big bowl.

164
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,939
At least a gallon. Get a good bubbler.

165
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:48,441
Maybe a plecostomus.

166
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,402
And don't feed her too much.
People get fat.

167
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:55,281
- Fish, they drown in leftover food.
- All right already, Jacques Cousteau.

168
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,534
- Point made.
- Good.

169
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:05,583
I'm guessing our friend didn't refer you
to me to get ichthyological advice.

170
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,837
I'm looking for someone
with a light touch.

171
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:13,674
I'm not talking some teenager taking
a five-finger discount of string cheese...

172
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,885
at the Stop & Shop. I need...

173
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:19,638
highly skilled, high-end, discreet.

174
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:20,890
A real pro.

175
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:23,768
You gotta fit him in a tight space?

176
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:26,896
I don't think so.

177
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,067
I got just the guy then.

178
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,415
That's what... That's what happens.
It was just a bad swing.

179
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,709
It's gonna get better.

180
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,045
That's why I say golfing
is a contact sport.

181
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:56,258
Great job, Ms Wexler. Very refreshing.

182
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,178
Believe me,
we're happy to get this one off the docket.

183
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,930
Not as happy as we are.

184
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:03,766
- Again, great job.
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.

185
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,939
Ladies...

186
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:12,024
dinner's on me.

187
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,152
Kim, I knew you were good,
but I didn't know you were this good.

188
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,280
- I'm glad you're happy.
- We couldn't have done it without you...

189
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,826
and I hope you realise this means
a whole lot of work coming your way.

190
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,912
Well, that's... That's great.

191
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,957
Well, you don't sound like it's great.

192
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,752
Hate to be a buzzkill.
There's something you need to hear...

193
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,629
before we get any deeper in.

194
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:35,506
It's about your former attorney...

195
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:38,259
- Charles McGill.
- What about him?

196
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:43,389
Charles has been making some very ugly
allegations about his brother, Jimmy...

197
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:45,808
with whom
I happen to share an office space.

198
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:48,978
Allegations of what?

199
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:55,109
Charles thinks Jimmy took control of
your documents while working on them.

200
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:58,154
He believes Jimmy transposed
the address numbers.

201
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,656
Transposed the numbers?

202
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:03,159
How would he even do that?

203
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,663
Charles contends Jimmy took documents
pertaining to the Rosella branch...

204
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,458
and while Charles was indisposed...

205
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,585
photocopied and doctored them.

206
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,171
That's pretty baroque.

207
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:19,717
The important thing here is I think
it could make some noise in public.

208
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,887
Soon. I wanted to tell you this
in the spirit of full disclosure.

209
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,723
I thought it was better
if you heard it from me.

210
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,561
If you have any reservations
at this point...

211
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:35,941
or if you are not comfortable
staying with me, we can discuss options.

212
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,157
If there's one thing I cannot abide...

213
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,951
it's a man who won't own up
to his mistakes.

214
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:51,248
Now whatever mud McGill is slinging
is not gonna screw me out of the best...

215
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,168
outside counsel I've ever had.

216
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,338
That's...

217
00:13:57,505 --> 00:14:00,174
- I'm so glad to hear that.
- We appreciate the heads-up...

218
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:04,011
but you can call this baby put to bed.
Now the most important thing, dinner.

219
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:05,554
Seven good for you?

220
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,473
- Works for me.
- Great.

221
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,891
We'll talk strategy.

222
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,727
We move on to Colorado or Utah first.

223
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,020
See you at 7.

224
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,689
This McGill thing...

225
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,193
you're sure
it's not gonna be a problem?

226
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,320
I am.

227
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:24,490
Mesa Verde isn't involved
in any way, shape or form.

228
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,327
Okay. Good.

229
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:29,870
Then I'll see you tonight.

230
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,581
Okay, great. See you then.

231
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,474
Okay, this is it.

232
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,227
We can run without lights and mikes.

233
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:56,230
We'll collect cell phones
and hold them for your testimony.

234
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,856
The court reporter...

235
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:01,443
would it be possible to move him
or her farther from the witness stand?

236
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,155
Yeah, I think we can arrange
having them in the back of the court.

237
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,451
I'm sorry. There's nothing I could do
about the exit signs. It's code.

238
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,454
I appreciate all you're doing.
Thank you.

239
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:17,960
Mr Alley, I wonder if you could give us
a moment. I'd like to go over something.

240
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,671
No problem.
I'll be outside when you're ready.

241
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,632
Howard.

242
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,302
How are you feeling, Chuck?

243
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,637
I'll muddle through.

244
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,556
Because this is a lot to ask.

245
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:33,434
And if you're not up to it,
just throwing this out there.

246
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,061
- Maybe you don't need to testify at all.
- No. I do.

247
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:40,065
I'm the only person who can adequately
explain the context of that tape.

248
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:42,109
Or the defence will tear it to shreds.

249
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,571
It's already a solid case.
We have Jimmy's statement...

250
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:50,409
from the Pre-Prosecution Diversion,
my testimony and the private eye's.

251
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,912
Maybe there's no need
to put you through the ringer like this.

252
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,497
This isn't about me...

253
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,915
or my health.

254
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,834
This is about PR.

255
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:01,462
We lost a client.

256
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:05,841
That happened because
while you were incapacitated...

257
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:09,803
your brother accessed documents
that should have been secured at HHM.

258
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,974
What Jimmy did
is unconscionable, yes...

259
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,186
but one of my jobs
is to safeguard the firm's reputation.

260
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:20,356
This is not the time
to worry about how we look.

261
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,359
This is about
what's right and what's wrong.

262
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,487
I'm not gonna risk Jimmy getting,
what, a year of suspension?

263
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:28,572
Maybe two?

264
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,366
He deserves disbarment.

265
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,034
Not some slap on the wrist.

266
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:36,288
No, Howard,
there's only one way forward.

267
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:40,584
Let justice be done
though the heavens fall.

268
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,089
Sorry to keep you waiting.
This will do nicely.

269
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,925
Extend my thanks
to the committee for their flexibility.

270
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,722
Good morning.
I'm Robert Alley for the State Bar.

271
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,891
In the matter of James M. McGill...

272
00:16:56,058 --> 00:17:00,729
the State Bar intends to prove the
following violations of the ethical code.

273
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:06,527
16-102, engaging in conduct
the lawyer knows is criminal.

274
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:11,323
Mr McGill knew that breaking down
his brother's door was criminal behaviour.

275
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:15,744
16-804, committing a criminal act...

276
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:18,330
that reflects adversely
on the lawyer's honesty...

277
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:21,291
or trustworthiness as a lawyer.

278
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,461
Any reasonable person would agree
assaulting a lawyer...

279
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:29,550
in his own home reflects badly
on Mr McGill's fitness as an attorney.

280
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:35,514
16-304, unlawfully altering, destroying...

281
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:39,810
or concealing material
having potential evidentiary value.

282
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,814
Mr McGill broke into his brother's home
and destroyed an audio cassette...

283
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:47,067
which contained a recording
of a conversation between himself...

284
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,528
and his brother, Charles McGill.

285
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:53,449
We will show this recording
was evidence on an ongoing legal case.

286
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:57,703
The State Bar believes that
once we have presented the facts...

287
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,666
the committee will agree that disbarment
is warranted for James McGill.

288
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,376
Thank you very much.

289
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,838
Thank you, Mr Alley.

290
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,590
Ms Wexler.

291
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,555
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

292
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,474
Good morning.

293
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,186
I'm Kim Wexler, co-counsel
with James McGill, for the defence.

294
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:26,023
You've already read
Mr McGill's Pre-Prosecution Statement.

295
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,734
We don't dispute
he broke into his brother's house.

296
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,361
An act he regrets...

297
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,322
deeply.

298
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,407
But there is another side to this story.

299
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,660
One not about calculation...

300
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,622
or ill intent.

301
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,208
But about two brothers...

302
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,045
whose relationship
after years of strain...

303
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,297
finally broke.

304
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,802
We believe that
after you have the complete picture...

305
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:59,264
you'll understand James McGill
is an asset to our legal community.

306
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:03,101
And he should remain
a full member of it in good standing.

307
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,562
Thank you.

308
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,274
Thank you, Ms Wexler.

309
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:16,114
Okay. If everyone's ready to...

310
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,367
begin testimony.

311
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,327
Mr Alley, call your witness.

312
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,664
Bang, bang, bang.
Then he kicked down the door.

313
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,375
Jimmy was very agitated.
He was shouting.

314
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,419
He demanded Charles
turn over the evidence he...

315
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:33,131
Objection. We haven't established
the tape is evidence of anything.

316
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,051
The defence has only acknowledged
it is a piece of property.

317
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,970
Allow me to rephrase.

318
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:42,224
Jimmy demanded an audio cassette
in Charles' possession...

319
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:46,562
which Jimmy proceeded, with the help
of an iron fireplace implement...

320
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,772
to pry from Charles' desk.

321
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:52,860
He then broke the cassette into pieces
and went on to confront his brother.

322
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,071
What happened after
the defendant smashed this tape?

323
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,949
- Mr Brightbill and I...
- That's the private investigator...

324
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,326
- that Charles hired?
- That's correct.

325
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:05,497
He and I were concerned that
Jimmy might strike his brother.

326
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,082
So that's when we stepped in.

327
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,834
- Thank you, Mr Hamlin.
- Certainly.

328
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,335
Nothing further at this time.

329
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,504
Ms Wexler.

330
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,632
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

331
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:27,352
You testified you've known my client
for some time.

332
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,854
How long exactly?

333
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,939
Nearly 10 years.

334
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,108
How did you come to know him?

335
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,944
His brother asked to hire him
in the mailroom at our firm.

336
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,113
- And you did?
- Yes.

337
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,407
What was your opinion of him then?

338
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,785
I thought...

339
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,581
he had a lot of get up and go.

340
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,209
- He was a hard worker.
- You had a nickname for him, didn't you?

341
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:53,462
Charlie Hustle.

342
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:55,422
Charlie Hustle?

343
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,091
How'd you feel when you found out
he'd become a lawyer?

344
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,719
Surprised.
He had put himself through law school...

345
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,764
and taken the bar exam
without telling any of the partners.

346
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,057
Even Charles.

347
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:09,102
He bootstrapped his way into a law
degree while working in your mailroom.

348
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,605
Did you consider taking him on
as an associate?

349
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,148
We did.

350
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,151
- Briefly.
- Sounds like you didn't hire him.

351
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,779
Why not? With that kind of grit?

352
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,616
The partners decided it would be best
to avoid the appearance of nepotism.

353
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:26,578
We felt hiring Jimmy
might damage morale.

354
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,122
Nepotism.

355
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,583
Your firm is
Hamlin Hamlin & McGill, right?

356
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,336
Who's the other Hamlin?

357
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,173
My father.

358
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,056
Which partner was the
most concerned with nepotism?

359
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,308
Charles McGill.

360
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,228
- So Jimmy's own brother blocked him?
- Objection.

361
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,690
How are the hiring practices
of Hamlin Hamlin McGill relevant here?

362
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:58,568
It's relevant to understand
the relationship between these brothers.

363
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:03,407
We'll give you some leeway,
Ms Wexler...

364
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,743
but don't stray. Charles McGill
isn't the subject of this hearing.

365
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:08,537
Thank you.

366
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:12,624
Did Jimmy know his brother was the one
that prevented you from hiring him?

367
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,210
No. He did not.

368
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,755
Eventually,
he was hired by the firm of Davis & Main.

369
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:22,134
I'd be happy to say more
about that if you'd like.

370
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,012
No. Thank you.

371
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:28,557
When Charles' condition appeared,
Jimmy took care of him, didn't he?

372
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,851
I believe so.

373
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:35,897
Jimmy was struggling to build his solo
law practice, yet every day, without fail...

374
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:39,026
he brought his brother food,
supplies...

375
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,486
even his favourite newspapers.
Isn't that right?

376
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:42,946
He did.

377
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:47,284
Could you speak to the terms
of Charles' leave of absence?

378
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:48,785
You know I can't.

379
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,954
It was an FMLA leave.

380
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,914
Anything more is confidential.

381
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,250
You can confirm it
was due to mental illness?

382
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,462
Objection. Charles McGill's
mental health isn't at issue.

383
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:02,382
This is a smear job on the State Bar's
upcoming witness. Nothing more.

384
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,426
This is not a competency hearing.

385
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,803
Mr Hamlin
is not a psychiatric professional.

386
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,682
Do you have any questions that would
be more germane to his experience?

387
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,517
No.

388
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,686
I have nothing further.

389
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,190
The witness is excused.

390
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,954
At this time, the State Bar would like
to enter Exhibit 5 into evidence.

391
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:36,541
- We ask Charles' recording be played.
- Respectfully renewing my objection.

392
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,087
Probative value of playing this
is outweighed by how prejudicial it is.

393
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,882
All due respect, but the State Bar
feels this is fundamental to hear.

394
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:47,219
Don't wanna leave any question
as to the intentions of both parties.

395
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:51,681
We already ruled this was fair game
when we denied your motion to suppress.

396
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,227
I'll add, the rough and tumble
of your client's conduct aside...

397
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,771
we need to know if one lawyer
attempted to tamper...

398
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,731
with another's evidence.

399
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,954
Come here.

400
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,456
- What are you doing here?
- Flight's delayed.

401
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:17,916
How delayed?

402
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,128
- Forty minutes, last I checked.
- Shit.

403
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:24,005
Okay. Keep me posted.

404
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,468
Here we go.

405
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,391
Thank you for your patience.
The State Bar is ready to proceed.

406
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:35,725
I'm begging your pardon.

407
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:39,271
The defence requests a moment
to review, if we could.

408
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,484
All right. When you're ready.

409
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,695
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

410
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,036
What are we doing?

411
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,080
We're stalling.

412
00:24:58,665 --> 00:24:59,875
Yes.

413
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,753
Yes, my brother
has many admirable qualities.

414
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,133
In some ways,
I can say I admire him.

415
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,343
Too cold.

416
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,680
I love my brother.

417
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:17,392
But Ted Kaczynski's brother
loved him too.

418
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,394
And he wanted to help.

419
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,022
That's sanctimonious.

420
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:24,733
I love my brother.

421
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,109
He's a good person.

422
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,402
He has good in him.

423
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:32,365
But the law is too important.

424
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,373
Be right there, Howard.

425
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:49,257
The law is too important.

426
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:54,804
I sure as shit
wouldn't be telling you otherwise.

427
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,723
But yes.

428
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,350
It's the truth.

429
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:02,312
You'd go to such lengths
to humiliate me?

430
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,564
I did it for Kim.

431
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,943
She worked her butt off
to get Mesa Verde...

432
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:12,113
while you and Howard sat around
sipping Scotch and chortling.

433
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,242
Hamlin Hamlin McGill.
More like Scrooge and Marley.

434
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:19,663
Kim deserves Mesa Verde.
Not you, not HHM.

435
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:24,042
She earned it, and she needs it.
I did it to help her.

436
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:27,545
But I honestly didn't think
it would hurt you so bad.

437
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,215
I thought you'd just say,
oh, crap. I made a mistake.

438
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,634
And go on with your life
like a normal person.

439
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:33,969
But, oh, no.

440
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,845
Wishful thinking.

441
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,016
So can I...

442
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:44,437
tell Howard you're not quitting
or retiring or whatever?

443
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,734
And can we take all the shit
down off the walls?

444
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:54,072
I'm gonna go call Howard.

445
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,615
Jimmy.

446
00:26:56,032 --> 00:27:00,036
You do realise you just confessed
to a felony?

447
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,913
I guess.

448
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:04,499
But you feel better, right?

449
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,295
Besides, it's your word against mine.

450
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:24,352
All right, Mr Alley, we need to make
accommodations for your next witness.

451
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,521
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Mr Chairman.

452
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:29,232
All right. For those who don't know...

453
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,192
we need to prepare the room.

454
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,654
The clerk is going to collect
your cell phones, watches...

455
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,448
key fobs, anything electrical.

456
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:41,119
If you prefer not to, please secure
your items outside this room.

457
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,413
Thank you for understanding.

458
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,666
- Your phone, sir?
- I left it in the car.

459
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:37,467
- Excuse me. That's yours.
- Sorry.

460
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,526
Please raise your right hand.

461
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:59,239
Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

462
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:00,865
I do.

463
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:06,830
Could you state your name?

464
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,706
Charles L. McGill.

465
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:13,378
I'm a senior partner
at the law firm of Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

466
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:16,756
- Can the court reporter hear me?
- Yes, sir. I can hear you fine.

467
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,800
Mr McGill, I'll try to be brief.

468
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:22,303
We don't need to dwell on the burglary
or the assault that you suffered.

469
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,805
Thank you. I appreciate that.

470
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,141
What I would like to hear about
is this tape.

471
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:27,851
What compelled you to make it?

472
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:29,144
I had a suspicion...

473
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,480
my brother had tampered with
documents in a case I was working on.

474
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:33,898
Now, why would he do that?

475
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:38,486
- Doesn't sound particularly brotherly.
- I believe his hope was the documents...

476
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:42,740
would cause the client to become
disillusioned with my representation...

477
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,410
and return to their previous attorney,
Ms Wexler...

478
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:49,414
which, I should note,
is precisely what happened.

479
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:50,623
Objection.

480
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,836
I'm not saying Ms Wexler knew what
Jimmy was doing or had any involvement.

481
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,713
I'm only stating that it happened.

482
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,216
Did you have evidence to support
your suspicions about James?

483
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:01,718
No.

484
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:05,305
My brother, whatever else can be said
of him, can be quite clever.

485
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,557
Did an excellent job
of covering his tracks.

486
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:11,144
Objection. Witness has admitted
there's no corroborating evidence...

487
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,104
the supposed crime even occurred.

488
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,690
I'd like to hear what he has to say.

489
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,359
We're going to continue.

490
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:22,280
We'll extend you the same latitude
on cross, Ms Wexler.

491
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,782
Go on, Mr McGill.

492
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,911
Without physical evidence,
I felt that a recorded confession...

493
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,038
if I could get one, was my best bet.

494
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:33,208
On its own, I knew the tape
would be somewhat flimsy...

495
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,878
but it was a start.
A foundation for a more ironclad case.

496
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:41,716
I suppose Jimmy must have felt the tape
was decisive evidence on its own.

497
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:44,093
Or he wouldn't have broke in
to destroy it.

498
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:46,137
Objection. More speculation.

499
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:48,056
How can he know
what's going on in Jimmy's head?

500
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,351
Sustained. We just need to hear
what happened, Mr McGill.

501
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,269
I... I apologise.

502
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:56,314
I recorded my brother
to build a case against him.

503
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,609
At the time, would you say
you were in possession of your faculties?

504
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,152
All due respect...

505
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,863
but you do sound somewhat unhinged
on the recording.

506
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,281
Yes, I understand that.

507
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,993
But what you heard was theatre.
A performance. Play-acting.

508
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:14,457
I exaggerated the symptoms
of my disease to extract the truth.

509
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,960
Can we talk about your disease
for a moment?

510
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,462
I'd like everybody
to be on the same page about it.

511
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:22,715
Of course.
It is sometimes referred to as EHS.

512
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,842
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

513
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,846
I describe it as an acute allergy
to electromagnetism.

514
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,683
It's not a common condition, is it?

515
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,060
I know it sounds strange. I do.

516
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:37,313
But 30 years ago,
no one had heard of peanut allergies.

517
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:39,065
But you admit that no one...

518
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,693
No doctor has ever diagnosed you.

519
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:45,697
AIDS was not identified until 1981.

520
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,700
HIV wasn't known
as the cause until '83.

521
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:52,078
These things take time to unravel,
even for doctors.

522
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:55,498
Would you say that your illness
affects your ability to think clearly?

523
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,834
No, it affects me physically.

524
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:01,170
It causes me great pain.
However, I'm perfectly lucid.

525
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,505
Thank you.

526
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:06,342
Mr McGill, I have only one
more question for you.

527
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,429
Do you hate your brother?

528
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,765
Absolutely not.

529
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,435
I love my brother.

530
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:18,479
There's nothing malicious in Jimmy.

531
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:24,402
He has a way of doing the worst things
for reasons that sound almost noble.

532
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:30,658
But what I know for sure is that
the law is too important to be toyed with.

533
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:32,493
It's mankind's greatest achievement.

534
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,954
The rule of law,
the idea that whoever you are...

535
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,999
your actions have consequences.

536
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:41,544
And the way my brother treats the law...

537
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,130
it breaks my heart.

538
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:46,674
That's why I did what I did.
Not to hurt him...

539
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:49,761
but to protect something
that I hold sacred.

540
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,763
Thank you, Mr McGill.

541
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,139
The State Bar rests.

542
00:32:57,268 --> 00:33:00,438
I think we need to put on the brakes.

543
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,652
I'm sorry. My co-counsel and I
need a moment to confer.

544
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:08,821
Please be brief, counsellor.

545
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,032
Yes, of course.

546
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,578
She'll be here.

547
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,122
Do you have anything for cross?

548
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,208
Could I look at your notes?

549
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:23,753
- Yeah, of course. Can you...
- Can you read the writing?

550
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,463
Yeah.

551
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:44,357
Mr Chairman. I'm sorry...

552
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:47,276
might I have a moment
to get a breath?

553
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,570
Well, of course, Mr McGill.

554
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,115
Folks, let's call this 15.

555
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:56,828
Everybody, please be back
and ready to go on the hour.

556
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:06,504
- Rebecca.
- Chuck.

557
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:10,550
- It's good to see you.
- I have to say, I'm a bit surprised.

558
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:14,053
Did Jimmy subpoena you?
You're not on the witness list.

559
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,849
- You don't have to testify.
- No, no, no. I'm not here for that.

560
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,934
Well, what then?

561
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,394
Chuck, I wish you'd told me.

562
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:26,149
I... I can't believe what
you've been going through.

563
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,143
How long has it been?

564
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,154
You're here to help...

565
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,198
because all this is so stressful for me.

566
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:37,410
- Is that what Jimmy told you?
- He's worried about you, Chuck.

567
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:40,580
In spite of everything that's happened
between you two, he cares.

568
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:41,873
What exactly did he say?

569
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,375
Well, that you had been sick.

570
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,085
Allergic to electricity?

571
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:50,089
He sent pictures of the house.
Chuck, my God.

572
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:52,675
Why didn't you tell me?

573
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:55,344
I didn't wanna upset you.

574
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,930
Worry you unnecessarily.

575
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,017
But now you're here.

576
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:03,102
And now you know.

577
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,315
I came because
I thought it was the right thing.

578
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,401
I thought,
I don't know that you'd want me to.

579
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:14,030
But I guess that
I'm more of a distraction.

580
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:17,617
So I'm gonna be in town for a few days.

581
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:20,703
And I would love to spend
some time with you.

582
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,538
But right now, I think I should go.

583
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:25,166
- No, no. Please. I want you to stay.
- Really?

584
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,252
- You don't seem happy to see me.
- I am.

585
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:31,172
I'm just surprised. That's all.

586
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,216
Please stay.

587
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:36,010
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm sure.

588
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:39,680
You've been sold a bill
of goods, Rebecca.

589
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:42,225
I want you to see what's what.

590
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:53,653
She's not what I expected.

591
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,906
Oh, yeah? What'd you expect?

592
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:58,866
I don't know. Just...

593
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:01,007
Not her.

594
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,834
You know,
she's gonna hate you when this is over.

595
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:10,753
Yep.

596
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:25,601
All right. Mr McGill, I'll remind you
you're still under oath.

597
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,645
- I understand.
- At this time...

598
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:31,440
I'd like to turn cross-examination
over to my co-counsel, James McGill.

599
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:43,578
There's been a lot of fuss about it,
but we never really talked about this tape.

600
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:48,124
We lost the opportunity when
you burglarised my house to destroy it.

601
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:51,002
Fair enough.
And I was in the wrong there...

602
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:56,549
but still, I'd like to follow your story
of why and how you recorded it.

603
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,427
Oh, is this where you claim
the tape is spurious?

604
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,722
- That it's not really your voice?
- No. That's me on the tape.

605
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:06,142
Still, I have some questions.
Like the recorder...

606
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:09,312
it must have hurt like hell
for you to touch that.

607
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:12,440
There was a degree of discomfort.
That's true.

608
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:13,941
And where did you hide it?

609
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,278
The sound's pretty clear, so
it wasn't in the couch cushions, was it?

610
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:20,072
Tucked under a space blanket.
Out of sight.

611
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:24,702
So no chance I'd see it,
not with the state your place was in.

612
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:26,412
- Isn't that right?
- I suppose.

613
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:29,498
Would you like to set the scene
for the disciplinary committee?

614
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,627
Tell them what your house
looked like at the time of recording?

615
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,087
Objection. Relevance?

616
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:38,549
Well, the circumstances of the recording
are materially relevant.

617
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:40,509
How can you know
what the tape means...

618
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:42,803
unless you know what was going on
when it was recorded?

619
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,389
Overruled.
The witness can answer the question.

620
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:49,727
I covered most of the walls with
Foil-Scrim Kraft insulation.

621
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:52,605
I also hung a number
of space blankets.

622
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:55,524
Compact Mylar sheets.

623
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:59,987
They insulate and protect against
mild electromagnetic radiation.

624
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:02,615
All right, so shiny insulation...

625
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:05,868
and space blankets
all over the walls and ceiling.

626
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:08,579
It was like being inside of a disco ball.

627
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,414
Do you have a point?

628
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,459
Well, I'm impressed...

629
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:16,212
by how much work
went into entrapping me.

630
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:17,588
You went all out.

631
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:18,923
I didn't entrap you.

632
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,592
I provoked an admission
in adverse interest.

633
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:23,344
That's not the same thing.

634
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,598
How did you know it would work?

635
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,308
What do you mean?

636
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:32,228
How did you know
your provocation would work?

637
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:36,607
Why'd you think a bunch of shiny plastic
would make me say anything?

638
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:42,071
Isn't it because you knew that it was
precisely the thing that would worry me...

639
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:44,824
so much that I'd say anything
to talk you down?

640
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,158
Objection.

641
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,910
Okay. Withdrawn.

642
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,913
Let's get back to your house.

643
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,749
Every surface covered in tinfoil.

644
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:57,169
- Nothing crazy about that, huh?
- As I've said...

645
00:38:57,336 --> 00:39:02,800
I was playing up my condition.
Usually, it's a perfectly normal house.

646
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:06,804
You think your house is normal?
Can I call your attention to Exhibit 9?

647
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,144
This is your house, right?

648
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:14,937
Yes.

649
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:17,356
Exposed wires.

650
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:20,651
There's a camp stove.

651
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:24,989
There's a lantern
on top of newspapers.

652
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:26,282
You call this normal?

653
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,701
I call them adaptations.

654
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:31,996
A prophylactic measure
for a physical medical condition.

655
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:34,248
Did the doctor who granted me
guardianship...

656
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:36,250
think this was a physical condition?

657
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:39,336
Objection.
You can't introduce a TEG as evidence.

658
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:43,924
Besides, the panel has already ruled
Mr McGill's mental health is not at issue.

659
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,552
No, the State Bar
opened the door to this on direct...

660
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,388
when the witness talked
about his supposed play-acting.

661
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:52,808
Allowing me to follow up
on cross is only reasonable.

662
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:55,352
We discussed a physical allergy.
Not a mental disability.

663
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,481
Potato, potato. It comes down to this.

664
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,858
In order to understand
what I was thinking...

665
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,943
you need to see Chuck
through my eyes.

666
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:07,323
You need to know
if I believe that tape was evidence.

667
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,533
And I say it was evidence
of only one thing.

668
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,869
My brother hates me.

669
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:16,332
Now, he claims that he lied to me
to get me to tell the truth.

670
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:17,583
And I'm telling you...

671
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:20,377
I lied to my brother
to make him feel better.

672
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:21,962
Which of us you believe...

673
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:26,550
depends on how we all understand
the mind of Charles McGill.

674
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:31,055
We did promise
the defence some leeway.

675
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,558
- You may proceed.
- Thank you, Mr Chairman.

676
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:36,602
But watch yourself.

677
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:46,112
Chuck, I'd like to go back a little further.

678
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,823
Talk about when
these symptoms first started. It was...

679
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:52,493
shortly after you were divorced,
is that right?

680
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:56,914
- Yes.
- You think the stress of the divorce...

681
00:40:57,123 --> 00:40:58,916
- brought on the illness?
- Doubt it.

682
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:02,545
It was an amicable split.
My ex-wife and I are still on good terms.

683
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:05,798
In fact, your ex-wife is present
with us today. Is she not?

684
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,801
- When was the last time you saw each...?
- Objection.

685
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:10,136
This is not family court.

686
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,680
We're not here
to re-litigate the witness's divorce.

687
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:15,933
- I can't see what purpose this serves.
- I can.

688
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,436
I'll tell you why my brother
brought my ex-wife to this hearing.

689
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:21,981
Four thousand miles, she came.

690
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:24,733
Lured by concern for me.

691
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:29,697
What Jimmy's driving at is the last time
I saw her, I covered up my illness.

692
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,074
I'd been suffering
from it for some time.

693
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:36,120
But I went to great lengths
to conceal that fact from her.

694
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:40,207
I'm sorry I deceived you, Rebecca.

695
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:44,170
I didn't want you to think less of me.

696
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:49,175
Now Jimmy's outed me in front of you.

697
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,510
You know why?

698
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,095
To rattle me.

699
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:55,764
He knows I still have...

700
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:59,685
a lot of feeling for my ex-wife.

701
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:02,146
He's hoping this will break me down.

702
00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:05,065
Split me apart at the seams
like a murderer confessing...

703
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:07,318
on an episode of Perry Mason.

704
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:12,072
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you, Jimmy.

705
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:17,912
Have I answered your questions
to your satisfaction?

706
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:20,247
Do you have anything else?

707
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:24,001
Yeah, I do.

708
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,253
Earlier,
you talked about other diseases...

709
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:30,299
physical conditions,
you said, so, okay...

710
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:33,135
if you'd had,
I don't know, lung cancer...

711
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:35,512
would you have told Rebecca then?

712
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:40,226
If that had been the case, maybe.
I might have.

713
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:42,228
- So how is this different?
- Mr McGill.

714
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:45,022
- Move it along.
- You don't have to answer that.

715
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:48,901
I wanna get down to brass tacks.
I wanna be very, very specific here.

716
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:51,612
This illness, what does it feel like?

717
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:53,239
You mentioned it's painful.

718
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,032
It is.

719
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,825
There's a tightness in my chest...

720
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,661
difficulty breathing...

721
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,287
and pain.

722
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:02,539
Burning pain.
Pain spreads everywhere.

723
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,918
Sounds horrible.
Does it hurt right now?

724
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:08,671
There's always some discomfort, yes.

725
00:43:09,213 --> 00:43:12,299
Electricity's everywhere
in the modern world.

726
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,803
But I very much appreciate
the indulgence of the panel...

727
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,680
for their accommodation today.

728
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:20,557
I can handle this fine.

729
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:26,563
Right. So with the lights out,
you don't feel them.

730
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,607
If the current's not flowing, no.

731
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:32,403
Sorry about the exit signs.
I guess they couldn't kill those for you.

732
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:35,656
Well, they're not drawing much current,
and they're far away.

733
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:39,743
Intensity drops off with distance
per the inverse-square law.

734
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,371
Oh, yeah, whoa.
Inverse-square. I'm not a physicist.

735
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:44,748
Could you dumb that down
a shade for me?

736
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:46,083
The farther away it is...

737
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,253
the stronger the source
needs to be to have an effect.

738
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,089
Got it. Got it.
So if I had a small battery, say...

739
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:54,800
from a watch,
and I got up close to your skin...

740
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:56,051
you'd know?

741
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:57,469
I would feel it, yes.

742
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:01,348
Can you feel more current coming
from any particular direction right now?

743
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:04,393
From that back wall or...?

744
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,229
From over there
or up through the floor?

745
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:11,400
Can you tell us
where the nearest source is right now?

746
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:17,072
Jimmy, do you have
something in your pocket?

747
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:23,120
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

748
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,333
My cell phone.

749
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:31,128
From this distance, you should feel it,
and you don't, do you?

750
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:34,256
Mr McGill, you were warned
to leave your electronics outside.

751
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:36,842
It's all right.

752
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:38,677
It's all right.

753
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,804
May I?

754
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:48,145
Just as I thought.

755
00:44:48,312 --> 00:44:49,730
There's no battery in here.

756
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:52,274
You removed the battery.

757
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:56,737
That's a sorry little trick, isn't it?

758
00:44:56,904 --> 00:44:59,156
Yeah, you got me, Chuck.
Dead to rights.

759
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:01,075
I removed the battery.

760
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:03,869
- Objection.
- Sustained.

761
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:07,122
You've taken all the leeway
you're getting, Mr McGill. Wrap it up.

762
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:10,209
God, Jimmy.

763
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:12,544
Don't you know by now this is real?

764
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:13,921
I feel this.

765
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:18,801
It's a physical response to stimuli.
It's not a quirk.

766
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:22,888
What do I have to do to prove it to you?

767
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:25,307
I don't know, Chuck.

768
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:28,894
Could you reach into your breast pocket
and tell me what's there?

769
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,481
What now?

770
00:45:38,946 --> 00:45:41,281
Can you tell the court what that was?

771
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:44,952
- A battery.
- Mr Chairman.

772
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,745
- Please.
- You recognise that man?

773
00:45:46,954 --> 00:45:49,456
His name is Huell Babineaux.
He's on our witness list.

774
00:45:49,665 --> 00:45:51,458
You bumped into him in the stairway.

775
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:54,503
He'll testify he planted this
fully-charged battery on you...

776
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,255
over an hour and a half ago.

777
00:45:56,422 --> 00:45:59,007
- An hour and 43 minutes ago.
- An hour and 43 minutes.

778
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,342
Thank you, Mr Babineaux.

779
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:03,011
And you felt nothing.

780
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,681
- No. It's a trick. It has to be.
- Enough is enough.

781
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:08,976
I submit that Mr McGill's mental illness
is a non-issue.

782
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:11,562
If he were schizophrenic,
it wouldn't take away...

783
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:13,272
I am not crazy!

784
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:19,736
I am not crazy.

785
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:21,780
I know he swapped those numbers.

786
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:23,490
I knew it was 1216.

787
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:25,367
One after Magna Carta.

788
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:27,911
As if I could ever make such a mistake.
Never.

789
00:46:28,078 --> 00:46:31,707
Never. I just couldn't prove it.

790
00:46:31,874 --> 00:46:33,125
He covered his tracks.

791
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:35,586
He got that idiot at the copy shop
to lie for him.

792
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:38,922
- Mr McGill. You don't have to...
- You think this is something?

793
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:41,842
You think this is bad? This chicanery?

794
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:43,302
He's done worse.

795
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:44,803
That billboard.

796
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,681
Are you telling me
a man just happens to fall like that?

797
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:49,725
No. He orchestrated it.

798
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:51,226
Jimmy.

799
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:55,522
He defecated through a sunroof.

800
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:57,191
And I saved him.

801
00:46:57,357 --> 00:47:00,652
I shouldn't have.
I took him into my own firm.

802
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,905
What was I thinking?

803
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:04,823
He'll never change.

804
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:08,744
He'll never change.
Ever since he was 9, always the same.

805
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:11,455
Couldn't keep his hands out
of the cash drawer.

806
00:47:11,622 --> 00:47:13,207
But not our Jimmy.

807
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:15,667
Couldn't be precious Jimmy.

808
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:18,003
Stealing them blind.

809
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,922
And he gets to be a lawyer?

810
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,382
What a sick joke.

811
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:25,260
I should've stopped him
when I had the chance.

812
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:28,388
And you... you have to stop him. You...

813
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:52,621
I apologise.

814
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:56,959
I lost my train of thought.

815
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,589
I got carried away.

816
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:09,805
Do you have anything else?

817
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,559
No.

818
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,477
Nothing further.
