1
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,640
You can move the red five up.

2
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,059
Oh, yeah.

3
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:41,394
Thank you, sir.

4
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,482
Why do the cards have holes in them?

5
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:47,233
Oh, they're...

6
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,736
These are used cards from the casino.

7
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:52,489
Once the casino pulls
a deck of cards out of action...

8
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:55,784
they drill a hole through them
and sell them to the public.

9
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,204
Just a buck or two.

10
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:01,080
Look at that.

11
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:05,543
I suppose that's to prevent
people from cheating with them.

12
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,212
Yeah.

13
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,172
Makes for a good souvenir.

14
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,341
These are from Caesars.

15
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:14,302
I've never been.

16
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:22,811
Getting dark.

17
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:27,816
I hate to say it,
but I think it might be time to kill the lights.

18
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,276
Oh, yes, sir. Of course.

19
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,405
You sure I can't make you a cup of tea?

20
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,574
I'm fine, sir. Thank you.

21
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,409
All right then.

22
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:17,717
Just what I needed.

23
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:21,220
Drink up, guys.
Don't need you falling asleep.

24
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,599
Hey, you take care of that battery?

25
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,268
Oh, yeah. It finally shit the bed...

26
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:30,063
but we swapped it out
a couple of hours ago.

27
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,899
Okay, how'd it go?

28
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,484
No problem.

29
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:38,154
- Anyone see you?
- No. Dead over there.

30
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,283
All right.

31
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,077
Stay awake.

32
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,045
Hello?

33
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,089
Oh, hey. Come on in.

34
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,299
Hi. I'm Francesca Liddy.

35
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:40,386
- I'm here for the interview.
- Jimmy McGill.

36
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:42,847
Hey, are you running early,
or am I running late?

37
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,682
No, sorry. I'm a little early.

38
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:47,351
It's not a problem.
Never bad to be early...

39
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,812
except in death and taxes...

40
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:51,272
and some other things.

41
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,401
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

42
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,862
Does that look straight to you?

43
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,658
I think there... That side...

44
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,661
I think you're a little crooked.

45
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,913
The bottom of the M there.

46
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,961
Yeah. A little crooked.

47
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,632
So you're coming off
of seven years at the MVD?

48
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,801
- I am, yeah.
- Here's a question.

49
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,472
How come New Mexico doesn't call it
the DMV like every other state?

50
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,057
Well, that's a great question.

51
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,517
Just like in Arizona...

52
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,896
the Motor Vehicles Division
is part of the DOT, a division.

53
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,315
Whereas, in most other states,
the DMV...

54
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:37,067
or Department of Motor Vehicles
is its own entity.

55
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:41,864
I don't know if that answers the question,
but that's the government for you.

56
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:45,993
You got that right. Well, I for one,
am not calling it the MVD.

57
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,621
DMV all the way.

58
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:51,540
What do you think you learned
the most working there?

59
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,709
Patience. Diplomacy.

60
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,545
You meet all sorts of people down there.

61
00:13:56,754 --> 00:14:00,883
And most are really great, really friendly,
but you encounter some who are upset...

62
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,843
- belligerent.
- What about old folks?

63
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,222
- You get your fair share of them?
- Oh, lots of elderly drivers.

64
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:10,184
After 75, they need to take their test again,
so if they don't pass...

65
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:13,938
you have to explain why their licence
isn't being renewed, which is hard.

66
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,898
What do you say then? Do you ever...

67
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:18,192
yell at them? I mean, geezers, right?

68
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,277
How can you not?

69
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,073
No, I would never. No.

70
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,700
Nor should you.
That was a trick question.

71
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,286
You passed with flying colours.
Very good.

72
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,163
Heh, okay. Well, then...

73
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,166
so Jimmy and I
have very different needs.

74
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:38,337
His practise is mostly
wills for senior citizens...

75
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,882
while I'm focused on a single client
at the moment, Mesa Verde...

76
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,927
with banking regulations
that generate a ton of paperwork.

77
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:48,389
So I'm looking for someone
with an eye for organisation...

78
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,599
- and detail.
- Well, DMV's great for that.

79
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,726
Tons of detail
in those driver's licences.

80
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,728
We did see hundreds of people
every day.

81
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,982
And you'd never want to let a mistake
slip through on their forms.

82
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:02,152
- You'd just have a cascade of problems.
- Sounds challenging.

83
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,572
So why the law?

84
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,283
I mean, why leave the DMV or MVD?

85
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,578
I have to imagine you'll be giving up
a good benefits package.

86
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,330
Good healthcare and retirement plans...

87
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:19,044
but there's a bureaucracy to
government work that was too frustrating.

88
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,463
I guess what you'd call it,
too much red tape.

89
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,008
I just wanna be somewhere
I can make a difference.

90
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,510
That's us.
We're all about making a difference.

91
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,471
And I see here both Word and Excel,
you're comfortable with?

92
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,181
- Absolutely.
- Excel and Word, wow!

93
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,267
Well, you had me at old people.

94
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,477
Hey, here's a question.
Can you start today?

95
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,563
- I...
- Can...

96
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,940
- Yes?
- Fantastic.

97
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,360
Can you just
give us a second, Francesca?

98
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:47,197
Absolutely. I... Of course...

99
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,958
Thank you.

100
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,040
What are you doing?

101
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,625
What? I like her.

102
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,961
Can you start today? Don't you think
we should see more rÃ©sumÃ©s...

103
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,212
like, a lot more?

104
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,423
She is our first interview.

105
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,217
- We haven't checked her references.
- So we'll check them.

106
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,262
Kim, you've been taking forever
searching for a paralegal.

107
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,056
- We need help.
- Haven't found the right fit.

108
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:16,727
Because you're searching for perfection,
and perfection is the enemy of adequate.

109
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,438
- That's the bar? Adequate?
- She's more than adequate.

110
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:20,814
She worked at the DMV.

111
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,900
That's like the fifth circle of hell.

112
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:25,694
Look, she's overqualified.
If it doesn't work out...

113
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,613
we can fire her. It's no big deal.

114
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,033
Don't you think someone with
actual legal experience would be better?

115
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,952
I've got a commercial
airing in 11 minutes...

116
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,538
so the phones are gonna be ringing.
I need help.

117
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,707
Can we give her a test run, please?

118
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,668
I got a good feeling about this.

119
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,254
Come on, Kim.

120
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,762
Now, getting these oldsters to call,
that's half the battle...

121
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,932
- so they need to hear a friendly voice.
- Friendly? Absolutely.

122
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,351
Speak loudly and clearly...

123
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:01,230
but be careful with the loud and clear
because it can come off as angry.

124
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:02,606
Be folksy.

125
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,067
- Put a little sunshine in your voice.
- Got it.

126
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:08,570
Okay. You need coffee or water?
You need to hit the head before things...

127
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,065
There it goes.

128
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,744
Offices of Jimmy McGill.
How may I help you?

129
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:18,914
I'm sorry. May I put you on hold?

130
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,666
Thank you.

131
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,877
Offices of Jimmy McGill. Please hold.

132
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,338
Sorry about that.

133
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,632
What can I do for you?

134
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,386
That's right.

135
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,139
Jimmy McGill from the commercial.

136
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,142
Would you like to
come in for a consultation?

137
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,393
Folksy. Be folksy.

138
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,564
Say, is that a dog I'm hearing?

139
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:47,484
It is? What's her name?

140
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,612
Yeah, Cracker Barrel.
It always helps to mention Cracker Barrel.

141
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:55,200
Well, I think it's great you let Margaret
play inside. It's a hot one out there.

142
00:17:55,367 --> 00:18:00,289
I thought I'd go over to Cracker Barrel,
they've got such great air-conditioning.

143
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:04,084
Well, yes, I love their biscuits too.

144
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,045
Well, that's wonderful.

145
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:10,174
Yes, I think a will is really important.

146
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,510
When would you like to
come in and meet Mr McGill?

147
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,387
Jimmy. Jimmy.

148
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,097
Always Jimmy.

149
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,767
This Friday is open.

150
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,187
Yes. Jimmy has a 9:00 free.
Will that work?

151
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,190
Fantastic. Can you spell your name
for me?

152
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:30,527
And a number we can reach you at?

153
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,619
Okay, Dorothy.
Look forward to seeing you.

154
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,496
You betcha.

155
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,289
Bye, now.

156
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,335
I am so sorry. Thank you for holding.
How may I help you?

157
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:52,216
I can set you up with an appointment.
Jimmy is busy right now, but if you'd...

158
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,594
You sound like you're outdoors.

159
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:59,014
Are you staying out of the sun?
It's a hot one today.

160
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:03,143
I'm sorry,
but Jimmy is unavailable at the moment.

161
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,187
If you'd like to leave a message, Mr...

162
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,856
Ehrmantraut?

163
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,901
Trout, like the fish?

164
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:16,448
I hear Cracker Barrel
has excellent air...

165
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,493
This one don't wanna talk
about Cracker Barrel.

166
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,703
Yeah, patch that one through.

167
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,332
Mr McGill will take your call.

168
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,713
- Hey.
- Your new assistant's a real pip.

169
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,383
Yeah, thanks for crushing her spirit
on the first day.

170
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,886
Thank you, sir. You drive safe.

171
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,889
You the only one on this line?

172
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:43,475
Yeah, only me. What's up?

173
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:46,228
You free for breakfast tomorrow?

174
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,197
All right. This is what you're gonna do.

175
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:02,035
You'll go inside, buy a cup of coffee,
a meal, whatever, and sit in a booth.

176
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,246
Sometime in the next 10 to 15 minutes...

177
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:08,500
a guy in an old green Chevy Blazer
is gonna pull into that parking lot.

178
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,336
He'll take a knapsack,
and he'll go inside.

179
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,630
I need you to
keep an eye on the knapsack.

180
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,465
Let me know what he does with it.

181
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:19,553
Does he take anything out of it?
Does he switch the bag with someone?

182
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,930
Does he leave something
from the bag inside?

183
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,057
Right, right, right. I got it.

184
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,018
Green Chevy Blazer, black top.

185
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,312
Yeah, what's in the bag?

186
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,813
Is it money?

187
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,732
It's gotta be money.

188
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,650
Drugs? Is it drugs?

189
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:37,279
Something else?
Well, I'm guessing money.

190
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,865
- Tell me I'm right.
- He is gonna be here any minute.

191
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:41,700
Now, I need you inside.

192
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,619
You gonna do the job or not?

193
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,662
Fine. I'll do the job.

194
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,707
You charmed me into it.

195
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,228
Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.
May I take your order?

196
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:13,774
I'll have a Pollos Classic
and a coffee, black.

197
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:16,193
Would you like the bonus size
for 50 cents more?

198
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,778
No. Normal.

199
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,363
Dining in or to go?

200
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:20,739
Dining in.

201
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,783
- Will that be all today?
- Yeah.

202
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,243
Your total's 3.19.

203
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,705
Thank you.

204
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,001
- Do you want any extra salsa?
- No. Ketchup.

205
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,215
One eighty-one.

206
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,100
Hi. What can I do for you?

207
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,894
Can I get a number four, please?

208
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:52,688
Yes, sir.

209
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,573
Here you go, sir.

210
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,068
- Have a great day.
- Yeah. You too.

211
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,071
Yeah, I'll just take a diet.

212
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:10,122
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.

213
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,957
What can I do for you?

214
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,753
- Can I get a number four, please?
- Yes, sir.

215
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:20,465
- Is that for here or to go?
- It's for here.

216
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,515
Classic.

217
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,979
Sure, if there's one open.

218
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,605
Oh, yeah.

219
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,066
Yeah.

220
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,405
Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.
May I take your order?

221
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,504
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.
May I take your order?

222
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:13,477
- Will that be all today?
- Is that for here or to go?

223
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,228
Thank you. Have a great day.

224
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,406
- Really?
- Yeah.

225
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,626
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.
Can I take your order?

226
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,796
Give me a number three.
Potatoes, coffee.

227
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,840
Would you like
a bonus size for 50 cents more?

228
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,051
- No.
- Dining in or to go?

229
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,803
In.

230
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:50,222
- Is that all? Four eighty-nine.
- Yeah.

231
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,225
- You get behind the eight ball...
- I know. You're right.

232
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,937
Yeah, no problem.

233
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:00,232
- Do you need any extra salsa?
- Yeah. Give me that.

234
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,454
Here's a number three.

235
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,958
Here you go. Have a great day.

236
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,139
Manuel, where's my 22?

237
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:34,891
Coming up.

238
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,349
Pick it up.

239
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:21,062
Thank you for coming to Los Pollos
Hermanos. Have a great day now.

240
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,745
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.

241
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:46,356
- Are you ready or still looking?
- I'm sorry. Still trying to decide.

242
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,942
Okay, just let me know when.

243
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,980
Can I help you?

244
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:34,487
My watch, clasp is loose. It...

245
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,782
falls. I tried to reach it.

246
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,117
Well, I'm sorry.

247
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:40,744
Allow me.

248
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,875
You know, they say a nice watch band
is as important as the watch.

249
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:49,210
That's what I get for cheaping out.

250
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,005
We'll find it for you.

251
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,801
Where the heck is it?

252
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:59,804
Oh, don't worry.
If it's in here, I'll...

253
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,098
There it is.

254
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,895
May I clean this for you?
We have alcohol wipes.

255
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,314
No, it's been in worse places.

256
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,691
Thank you. That was very nice of you.

257
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:14,152
No problem. It's my pleasure.

258
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:17,781
- Is there anything else I can do for you?
- No.

259
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,074
Thanks.

260
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,909
You take care.

261
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,829
- Tell me again.
- Jesus.

262
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:28,666
- How many ways you want me to say it?
- Just tell me what you saw.

263
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,835
He came in, like you said he would.

264
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:35,298
He ordered the number three
with potatoes and coffee...

265
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,133
went bold with the extra salsa...

266
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:40,887
and he paid cash
out of his left front pocket.

267
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:44,724
Took his tray of food, sat in a booth
on the east side of the restaurant...

268
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:47,727
- and put the knapsack on the floor.
- Where on the floor?

269
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:49,896
Under his seat, between his legs.

270
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,732
Nobody touched it.

271
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:56,236
He didn't talk to anybody.
He didn't even look at anybody.

272
00:28:56,403 --> 00:29:00,740
Finished his meal in five minutes tops,
and skedaddled. Didn't leave anything.

273
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:04,786
- And you're sure of that?
- I literally checked the trash can.

274
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:07,705
There was nothing in there but trash.

275
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,418
So...

276
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,628
what's our next move, huh?

277
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,547
Are we gonna follow this guy?

278
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:19,843
Because you... you got some real
James Bond stuff in here.

279
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,928
Car doesn't have
an ejector seat, does it?

280
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:24,889
I think we're done for today.

281
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:27,434
- That's it?
- That's it.

282
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,479
I mean, I cleared my morning.

283
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:35,024
What, we're not gonna do, like...?

284
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:37,068
Tail him to a new location?

285
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:39,571
Or, I mean, we gotta sit on him,
at least, I...

286
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,407
Thanks for your time.

287
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,709
Hey.

288
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,545
Who's got your back, huh?

289
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,047
Me. That's who.

290
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,428
I'll keep that in mind.

291
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:02,607
Oh, Kim, the conference call
with the Arizona regulator...

292
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,692
needs to be rescheduled.
Thursday okay?

293
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,153
- Oh, yeah. That's fine.
- Okay.

294
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:11,324
Francesca, have we got any more
of those dietetic butter cookies?

295
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,201
- I can check.
- Thanks.

296
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:15,453
Welcome, folks.

297
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,801
Hey, Ernie. What's up?

298
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:35,848
Can't you just come inside?

299
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,489
Sorry.

300
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:54,450
Thanks.

301
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,577
What are we doing out here?

302
00:33:57,036 --> 00:34:00,123
I didn't wanna call you because
then it would leave a phone record.

303
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:05,253
I was gonna come in, but then I thought
maybe Jimmy shouldn't see me.

304
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,964
- So...
- But you just called me.

305
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,468
Guess I screwed up already.

306
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:15,972
Ernie, screwed what up?
Why don't you want to see Jimmy?

307
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,558
Well, it's just...

308
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:24,105
- I'm not sure how to start.
- You can start by just telling me.

309
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,816
Here's the thing.

310
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,819
I have some information,
but I don't wanna get in trouble.

311
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,738
Trouble with Jimmy?

312
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:32,905
No.

313
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,240
HHM.

314
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,869
I think I'm bound
by confidentiality, maybe?

315
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,663
I'm a little hazy on the legal points...

316
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,876
but if I tell you what I heard
and not Jimmy directly...

317
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,669
like...

318
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:48,296
like we have a buffer...

319
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,257
- then legally, I'm safe?
- Ernie.

320
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:54,051
What the hell are you talking about?

321
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:57,305
I'm... I'm just worried about Jimmy.

322
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,557
But if I tell him...

323
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,894
I don't wanna get in trouble too.

324
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,355
Tell Jimmy what?

325
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,360
Lily, I wanna thank you
for bringing your mom down.

326
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,946
It was a delight to meet you,
young lady.

327
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:17,533
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- Tell your friends, if they have a will...

328
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,203
it's important to get it updated,
just like you did.

329
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:22,538
- I'll tell them.
- Now, you remember Francesca.

330
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:26,042
She'll take care of you the rest of the way.
All right, who's next?

331
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,212
Mr Witchell.
Mr Witchell, come on down.

332
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,672
You're the next contestant
on The Price is Right.

333
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,382
Jimmy, can I have a moment?

334
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,802
- Excuse me, sir.
- Looks like everything is...

335
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,221
Apologies, Mr Witchell.
Just be a second, folks.

336
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:41,557
Oh, my gosh. Have you
had the soup over at Cracker Barrel?

337
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,062
What?

338
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:47,480
What?

339
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:50,608
Hey, come on. I got people out there.

340
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,527
- Hello. I can't...
- Give me a dollar.

341
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,529
- Give you a dollar?
- Hand me a dollar.

342
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:56,239
- Come on.
- Okay.

343
00:35:57,532 --> 00:35:59,534
- All I got's a twenty.
- Fine. Whatever.

344
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,993
All right.

345
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,537
I'm your lawyer now.

346
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:05,206
If anyone asks me what I know,
we have confidentiality.

347
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:07,458
- Why do we need confidentiality?
- Jimmy...

348
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,210
what did you say to Chuck?

349
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:14,006
Here it comes.

350
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,509
Howard, right? Did Howard call?

351
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,636
Relax. No. Let me explain, please.

352
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:20,513
Please.

353
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,057
Kim, let me set the stage for you, okay?

354
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:27,728
When I went to Chuck's last week, it was
like the inside of a Jiffy Pop wrapper.

355
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,272
There was Mylar on the walls.

356
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,899
There was Mylar on the ceiling.
The ceiling.

357
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:36,988
He thought his brain wasn't working
because of the Mesa Verde event and so...

358
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:39,365
I kind of told him that he was right...

359
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:41,117
about everything.

360
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,035
I had to. He... He...

361
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,538
Kim, he was broken.
He was a broken man.

362
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:49,959
I couldn't leave him in crazy town like that,
so I told him just to make him feel better.

363
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,795
Doesn't matter what he says.
Doesn't matter who he tells.

364
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:56,090
- Because it's my word against his.
- Jimmy, there's a tape.

365
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,971
- What?
- There is a tape of you talking to Chuck.

366
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,016
What do you mean? Who?

367
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:07,476
Who... He... He taped me? How?

368
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:08,811
I don't know how.

369
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,646
He just did, okay?

370
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:13,274
- Ernie told me.
- Ernie told you?

371
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:17,236
Chuck has a tape recorder wrapped in
a space blanket in his desk drawer.

372
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:19,238
Ernie was putting new batteries in it...

373
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:22,158
and the tape rolled for a few seconds
and he heard you.

374
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:26,120
Your voice saying something
about switching 1261 to 1216.

375
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:30,291
So clearly,
it was this confession of yours.

376
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,253
He taped me?

377
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,099
Yes, Jimmy.

378
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:53,898
But I'm not sure
what he can do with it...

379
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:58,152
legally, anyway.

380
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:02,365
I'm gonna have to do some research.

381
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:05,785
He made that tape for a reason...

382
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:08,079
and we just have to figure out why.

383
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:16,504
Jimmy?

384
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,467
I gotta get back to it.

385
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,260
The lobby's full of clients.

386
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:24,720
Okay.

387
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:28,349
We'll figure this out.

388
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,227
Yeah. I know.

389
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,900
Sorry for the delay, everyone.
Mr Witchell, thank you for your patience.

390
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:39,360
I see you brought paperwork.

391
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,115
I gotta say...

392
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:47,243
I would never have
thought to collect bottle caps.

393
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,287
Oh, it's a wonderful hobby.

394
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:52,882
What excites me is the hunt.

395
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:55,084
I can imagine.

396
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:58,921
- Pleasure doing business, Mr Tiller.
- Why, thank you, Jimmy.

397
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:02,508
- All right, then. You drive safe.
- Oh, I do.

398
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:12,643
Is that the last one,
or we got any stragglers coming through?

399
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,936
Last one.

400
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,648
Well, hey, thanks, Francesca.

401
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,316
You were great today.

402
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,818
You too.

403
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:22,403
Those folks love you.

404
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,242
Who doesn't?

405
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:38,085
And that's U.S. vs McKeever?

406
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:40,755
Right. No, it makes sense.

407
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:45,426
You were a tremendous help, professor.
Thanks for finding the time.

408
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:49,263
You too.

409
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,973
Thanks again.

410
00:39:58,022 --> 00:39:59,732
Francesca, could you do me a favour?

411
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,403
Can you check the Mesa Verde files,
pull ones labelled CRA evaluations...

412
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,073
and sort them by date?
Need to have the most recent.

413
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,408
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

414
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:12,161
- I'll join you in a minute.
- Okay.

415
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:16,123
So...

416
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:19,335
just got off the phone
with my old Crim-Pro professor.

417
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:20,836
Oh, yeah? What'd he say?

418
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,046
Well, as we know...

419
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:26,050
New Mexico is one-party consent, so
Chuck had a right to make the recording.

420
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:29,595
But you went to him worried
for his mental health.

421
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,932
You said the things
you did to make him feel better...

422
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,393
which mitigates the admission of guilt,
at the very least.

423
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:39,772
We can poke holes in the custody...

424
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:42,650
throw doubt the voice
on the tape is even yours.

425
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:46,612
Even failing that, its probative value
doesn't outweigh how prejudicial it is.

426
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:50,074
I think we can get the whole thing
bounced under 403.

427
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:52,493
Probably get it excluded outright.

428
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:55,955
So then...

429
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:59,250
outside the courts, what can he do?

430
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:03,295
Play the tape for Kevin at Mesa Verde?

431
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:06,423
He hasn't up to now.
I'd have heard something, for sure.

432
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,469
Know what? Don't think he will. Howard
won't let him near Mesa Verde with that.

433
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:14,056
Howard knows
it would make HHM look terrible.

434
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:23,607
If Chuck has a plan for this tape,
I don't know what it is.

435
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:28,654
At this point, all we can do is wait for
his move, then act accordingly.

436
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:34,869
All right, then.

437
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,413
Thanks.

438
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,415
Sure.

439
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,007
Oh, hey, what do you think?

440
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:47,381
It's Etude in Blue
over Daydream Harvest.

441
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:51,051
I wanted it to look like
morning over the Sandias.

442
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:54,597
- I like it. It looks nice.
- It doesn't look like a stock-market crash?

443
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:58,809
No. It doesn't look like
a stock-market crash.

444
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:00,811
It's nice.

445
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:02,229
Thanks.

446
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,528
You okay?

447
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:14,825
Kim, I'm good.

448
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:58,238
Yeah.

449
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:58,275
- Howard, what are you doing here?
- Chuck, do you have a second?

450
00:46:58,442 --> 00:47:00,694
Did you... You parked
over on the next block?

451
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:03,113
- Oh, yeah. Way over.
- Yeah.

452
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:04,990
Phone. Keys.

453
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:08,702
Hey, you have to hide them.

454
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:22,424
Everything okay, sir?

455
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:24,009
Yes, thank you, David.

456
00:47:24,176 --> 00:47:26,094
- Give us a moment.
- Yes, sir.

457
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:31,308
- What's up?
- Chuck...

458
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:36,396
this has been going on for eight days,
and no indication that it's going to work.

459
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:38,148
It will work.

460
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:40,359
I think I've been very patient...

461
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:45,739
but the cost of these
around-the-clock private investigators...

462
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:48,033
- is really starting to add up.
- Howard.

463
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,826
This is our duty.

464
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,870
As officers of the court...

465
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:54,456
- we have an ethical obligation to...
- Yes.

466
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,458
My brother broke the law.

467
00:47:56,625 --> 00:48:00,462
- We can't just sit back and do nothing.
- I'm not talking about doing nothing.

468
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:02,631
I just want to...

469
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:04,132
free up our minds...

470
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:08,011
and be open to
alternate strategies, please.

471
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:10,681
Meet me halfway here.

472
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:16,353
I suppose...

473
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:20,399
I suppose we could limit
the investigators to just nighttime hours.

474
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:22,150
- Nighttime.
- Yes.

475
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:25,529
Jimmy will most likely break in
while he thinks I'm sleeping.

476
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:29,408
I mean, I wouldn't put anything past him.
It just makes the most sense...

477
00:48:29,575 --> 00:48:33,453
- he'll try to steal it under darkness.
- Really think he's going to do that?

478
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,497
I do, indeed.

479
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:37,291
How can you be so sure?

480
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,751
Howard...

481
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:42,713
I know my brother.

482
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,632
Chuck!

483
00:48:47,134 --> 00:48:48,594
Chuck.

484
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:51,263
Open the damn door, Chuck!

485
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:54,224
Open the door, damn it.
Open it. Chuck.

486
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:56,435
- Jimmy, go away.
- Open the door! Open it now!

487
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:59,730
- I'm not opening the door. I am not op...
- I swear to God, Chuck.

488
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:01,398
Jimmy. Jimmy.

489
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:02,899
You taped me?

490
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:04,484
- You asshole.
- Jimmy.

491
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:06,820
You pulled that
heartstrings con job on me?

492
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:09,406
You piece of shit!

493
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:13,577
My brain used to work. I'm sick.
I don't know what to do.

494
00:49:13,744 --> 00:49:15,495
Asshole!

495
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:17,164
No wonder Rebecca left you.

496
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:20,667
What took her so long?

497
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,921
There it is!

498
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:32,054
Here we go. Here we go.

499
00:49:32,262 --> 00:49:34,139
Here we go.

500
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:42,064
Is this it?

501
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,176
Is this it? Is this it?

502
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,403
For this, you destroyed our family?

503
00:49:48,612 --> 00:49:50,447
You happy now? For what?

504
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:52,658
For nothing!

505
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:56,620
Is that all there is, Chuck?

506
00:49:57,245 --> 00:50:00,483
It's all the... all there is?
Or did you make copies? Chuck?

507
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:04,419
You tell me, or I'll burn this
whole goddamn house to the ground.

508
00:50:04,628 --> 00:50:05,921
Jimmy. Jimmy.

509
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,090
That's enough.

510
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:10,425
You need to step away.

511
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:14,012
Howard...

512
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:18,225
- You were a witness to what happened?
- I was.

513
00:50:18,392 --> 00:50:19,601
And you?

514
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:21,603
I'm a witness.
