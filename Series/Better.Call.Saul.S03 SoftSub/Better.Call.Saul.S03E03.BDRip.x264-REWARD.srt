1
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,019
Yeah?

2
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:26,356
May I assume that you're armed?

3
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:28,274
Yes.

4
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:30,944
I do not wish to see your gun.

5
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,529
And if I don't...

6
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,281
I promise you won't see mine.

7
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,158
Are we in agreement?

8
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,285
We are.

9
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:42,163
Expect two cars momentarily.

10
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,981
You care to elaborate?

11
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:56,404
It's not in my interest
for Hector Salamanca to die.

12
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,573
At this time.

13
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:00,408
Who is he to you?

14
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:04,006
An associate of an associate.

15
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:06,706
How very specific.

16
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:09,417
Who is he to you?

17
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,503
We had a disagreement.

18
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,132
He threatened my family.
I'm not gonna let that go.

19
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,926
But...

20
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,677
you had let it go.

21
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,387
You'd taken his money.

22
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,057
Your family was no longer in danger.

23
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,101
And yet, still, you robbed his truck.

24
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,396
Shouldn't that have settled the matter?

25
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,732
Most men would've walked away.

26
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:35,276
But instead...

27
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:38,613
you made an attempt on his life.

28
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:40,949
Why?

29
00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:46,996
I understand...

30
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:52,043
that a civilian found the driver
after you robbed the truck.

31
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,714
Hector murdered this civilian.

32
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:57,882
Correct?

33
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:07,642
He wasn't in the game.

34
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,896
I can't allow you to kill Hector.

35
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:15,066
However, I'm not completely
unsympathetic to your...

36
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,485
sense of justice.

37
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:21,364
You hurt Hector
when you robbed that truck.

38
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:23,825
You hurt his business.

39
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:25,410
His pride.

40
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,703
Quite effectively.

41
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:32,166
And if you were to hurt him
in the same manner again...

42
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,003
I would not stand in your way.

43
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,006
You want me to rob another truck.

44
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,633
If you feel so inclined.

45
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,052
I'm done with that.

46
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,640
Then our business here is finished.

47
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,392
That's it?

48
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,560
That's it.

49
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:54,522
No more tracker,
no more of your minions following me...

50
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,233
Just like that.

51
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,860
Just like that.

52
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:00,570
Of course...

53
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:04,240
I trust that you are done
with Hector Salamanca.

54
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,963
Goodbye, Mr Ehrmantraut.

55
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,175
Wait.

56
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:31,434
You want his trucks hit because
you wanna disrupt his supply line.

57
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:34,604
Hector's your competition.

58
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,981
Why do you ask?

59
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:41,652
Because I'm not done
with Hector Salamanca.

60
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,169
Offices of Jimmy McGill.
How may I help you today?

61
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:00,588
- Hey, it's me.
- Oh, hey, Jimmy.

62
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:01,923
Listen...

63
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,883
something's come up...

64
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,512
and I need you to reschedule
all of my appointments for tomorrow.

65
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,306
Oh, okay. When do you want me
to reschedule for?

66
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:13,309
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

67
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:14,519
Sure thing.

68
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:19,607
Oh, and do me a favour.
Tell Kim I won't be back in tonight.

69
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:20,858
Will do.

70
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:26,572
Okay, that's it.

71
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,157
Have a great night.

72
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,356
You know you can wait inside.

73
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:06,821
You won't wanna hear it,
but this is for the best.

74
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,241
Please, Jimmy.

75
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,080
Whatever you think of me,
whatever names you're calling me...

76
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,499
in your head right now...

77
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,043
please understand
I'm trying to help you.

78
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,922
Here's what's going to happen.

79
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:29,886
The police will arrest you and I'm sorry,
but I will be pressing charges.

80
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,306
I told you
there would be consequences.

81
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,435
But I have to believe
you'll face those consequences...

82
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:40,354
and you'll come out the other side
a better man.

83
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,982
I know it's hard to see right now.

84
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,902
But, Jimmy, this is an opportunity.

85
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,404
That's why I'm doing this.
Not to punish you.

86
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,239
To show you...

87
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:54,202
truly show you,
that you have to make a change.

88
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,329
Before it's too late.

89
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:59,624
Before you destroy yourself.

90
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,958
Or someone else.

91
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,920
And I believe you can change.

92
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,463
You'll find your path.

93
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,758
And when you're ready...

94
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:12,053
I will be there
to help you walk that path.

95
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:18,601
Here's what's gonna happen.

96
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,020
One day, you're gonna get sick...

97
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:22,563
again.

98
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,944
One of your employee's is gonna
find you curled up in that space-blanket.

99
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,362
Take you to the hospital.

100
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:34,242
Hook you up to those machines
that beep and whirr...

101
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,535
and hurt.

102
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,205
And this time, it'll be too much.

103
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,666
And you will...

104
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,126
die there.

105
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,670
Alone.

106
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,012
There's my ride.

107
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:18,035
Sir, I need all your personal property.
Belt, tie, phone.

108
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:19,996
Ring, wallet.

109
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,759
Need your socks and shoes
placed in that bag.

110
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,181
Put these on your feet.

111
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,019
Follow me this way.

112
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,021
Turn to the right.

113
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:49,942
Turn to the left.

114
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,696
Face me.

115
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,740
Left hand.

116
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,631
- Right hand.
- Holy hell.

117
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,343
I thought they were bullshitting me.

118
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,470
How the mighty have fallen.

119
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:19,972
What the hell happened, man?

120
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,391
Nothing, just family trouble.

121
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:24,810
You're married?

122
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,105
No, disagreement with my brother.

123
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,441
That hard-ass, I don't blame you.

124
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:33,611
- So who you got representing you?
- I'll be representing myself.

125
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,447
- Sign here.
- You moron.

126
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:40,993
Of course, I knew that when you
left that sweet Davis and Main gig.

127
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,370
This way.

128
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,621
Hey, speaking of...

129
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:46,874
- Still trying to replace you over there?
- Arms up.

130
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,168
How's Omar?

131
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,128
Why? You looking to make a change?

132
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,339
And leave all this glamour behind?

133
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:56,926
- Hey, who do you think gonna catch this?
- Depends on who's available.

134
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:58,761
- Face me.
- You think it might be you?

135
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,304
- Run your hands through your hair.
- Come on.

136
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:03,641
Don't you wanna throw the book at me
for old times' sake?

137
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,684
I'll see if I can work some magic.

138
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,812
But those decisions
are above my pay grade.

139
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,357
- Yeah? When did they start paying you?
- This way.

140
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,692
Sit here.

141
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,070
- I gotta run anyway.
- Left hand.

142
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,656
Just had to see it for myself.

143
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,701
Jimmy McGill getting fingerprinted
with the hoi polloi.

144
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,371
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed the show.

145
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,420
I'll check and see if I can get
your first appearance moved up.

146
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,879
Thank you.

147
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:35,131
It's pretty late.

148
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,967
Chances are you're spending the night.

149
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:40,845
You gonna be okay?

150
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,097
Beats the back of a nail salon.

151
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,092
I do not doubt that, my friend.

152
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,856
Pick the biggest guy,
punch him as hard as you can.

153
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,816
Okay? Show dominance.

154
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:55,943
Right, got it. Dominance.

155
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,571
You do know how to throw a punch,
right?

156
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,865
Yeah, all right. Goodbye.

157
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,483
Hey, Kim.

158
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,818
Can I talk to you?

159
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,706
Sure, Ernie. What's going on?

160
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,865
Mr McGill fired me.

161
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,994
- Why? What happened?
- I don't...

162
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:14,081
It doesn't matter.

163
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,166
I just...

164
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,418
Is Jimmy okay?

165
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:20,212
I feel bad, like it's my fault.

166
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:23,882
- I didn't mean for this to happen.
- What happened to Jimmy?

167
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,320
- McGill.
- Yeah.

168
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,786
You're up.

169
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:14,391
We've got CR-2003113081.

170
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,521
James McGill.

171
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,065
Yes, Your Honour.

172
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,318
Not how I'm used to
seeing you in here, Mr McGill.

173
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,721
Not how I'd like to be seen.

174
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:29,740
You had quite the day yesterday.

175
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,076
Okay, Mr McGill.

176
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,454
You've been accused of fourth degree
felony breaking and entering...

177
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,290
which carries
a maximum sentence of 18 months...

178
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,542
and a $5000 fine.

179
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,920
We've also got
petty misdemeanour assault.

180
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,924
Maximum six months jail time
and a $500 fine.

181
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,426
Plus, criminal damage to property.

182
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:54,098
Also misdemeanour with a maximum
six months and a $500 fine.

183
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,391
Victim is...

184
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,853
your brother Charles. Seriously?

185
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,525
I assume you're prepared
to enter a plea at this time.

186
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:09,738
Yes, Your Honour.
I wish to enter a plea of not guilty.

187
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:13,283
The court accepts and enters
the defendant's plea of not guilty.

188
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,078
Now, Mr McGill,
have you secured counsel?

189
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:19,998
Yes, Your Honour. Kim Wexler, I'll be
representing Mr McGill in this matter.

190
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,460
Just in time. Let's enter Ms Wexler
as the attorney of record...

191
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:27,840
Your Honour, if I may,
I'll be representing myself.

192
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:31,009
I strongly advise against that,
Mr McGill.

193
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,387
You know what they say
about a man who represents...

194
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,347
I'm... I'm aware, but, as you know...

195
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,474
I've defended many people
in the system.

196
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,935
Your Honour, may I have a moment
with my client?

197
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,062
Sounds like he's not your client.

198
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,901
Mr McGill, would you like to
take a moment to discuss this with your...

199
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,361
potential counsel?

200
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:54,783
No, Your Honour, I'm all set.
I'm gonna represent myself.

201
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,869
- Your Honour.
- Not your client, Ms Wexler.

202
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,913
Sorry, moving on. You two
can work this out on your own time.

203
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,208
I was gonna call you,
but then I thought I'd tell you in person.

204
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,918
Mr McGill.

205
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,464
So on to the issue of bond.

206
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:13,427
You have no priors
and no outstanding warrants.

207
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,888
And where are
you currently practising law?

208
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,223
I haven't seen you
in my court in a while.

209
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,893
Elder law.

210
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,561
What a noble pursuit.

211
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,022
One I hope you get back to very soon.

212
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:28,275
Given your ties to the community,
I see no reason to deny you bond.

213
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:32,112
Which I set now at $2500.

214
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,642
I fucked up.

215
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,274
Chuck bamboozled me again.

216
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,277
That tape? He made sure that
Ernie heard it, right?

217
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,155
Because he knew Ernie, bless him,
would tell me about it...

218
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,283
and I'd come over,
try to destroy it or steal it or whatever.

219
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,912
Howard was there, and a PI.
If you can believe that.

220
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,249
Just waiting for me to lose my shit
and bust in.

221
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:30,504
Chuck played me like a fiddle,
and schmuck that I am, I fell for it.

222
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,339
Moron.

223
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,716
I'm sorry.

224
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,928
Then I didn't call you, which is stupid,
and sorry about that too.

225
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:42,140
But I didn't call you for a reason, okay?
Because this is my screw-up.

226
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,434
I own it, okay?

227
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,687
It's my responsibility to fix it.

228
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:50,399
And I know you wanna help, of course
you do, because you're wonderful.

229
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,900
But...

230
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:58,156
you're up to your ears in Mesa Verde,
and I can't, I won't, load this onto you too.

231
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:02,286
We have worked too hard
to let Chuck's bullshit vendetta...

232
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,288
threaten everything we're building.

233
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:08,125
I won't allow him
to endanger our business, no.

234
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:12,838
I will fix this.
Myself, me, Jimmy McGill, okay?

235
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:15,966
You have
gotta let me do this on my own.

236
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,180
Okay.

237
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,063
Thank you.

238
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,875
I... I finished it.

239
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,712
I... I mean, I just touched up the edges...

240
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,464
a little.

241
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,717
Is... Is that okay?

242
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:04,431
Sure.

243
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,225
It looks nice.

244
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,648
You mind driving me to my car?

245
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,150
Sure, no problem.

246
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,197
Just so you know...

247
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:23,825
this isn't a typical week around here.

248
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,995
Yeah, totally.

249
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,539
I didn't think that it was.

250
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,235
Good.

251
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:02,698
Very good.

252
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,122
How long has he had the fever?

253
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,540
Three days.

254
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:15,293
Good.

255
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,130
Heart and lungs sound good.

256
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,465
No redness in his throat.

257
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,428
So I don't think it's strep.

258
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,979
You think if we ask mama nicely...

259
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:37,399
she'll let you have this?

260
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,070
Very good. Bye.

261
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:47,826
What's left?

262
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,245
Some stomach cramps...

263
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,999
a sinus infection,
and a possible ankle sprain.

264
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,752
What about the gringo?

265
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,212
The revenge.

266
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,883
I'll take him next.

267
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,179
Mr Clark.

268
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,556
The doctor's ready.

269
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,480
And how may I help you
today, Mr Clark?

270
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,858
I believe our mutual acquaintance
called ahead.

271
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,359
He told me what...

272
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,000
but not how much.

273
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,114
Well, I need a package...

274
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,075
yea big.

275
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,244
And what's that in grams?

276
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:35,123
I don't know. This big.

277
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,974
Hey.

278
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:17,934
Hey.

279
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,769
Is somebody sitting here?

280
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,521
No.

281
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,404
So how was it?

282
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,448
How was what?

283
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:34,492
Your night in MDC.

284
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,205
- I caught up with a few old clients.
- Yeah?

285
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,498
Want one?

286
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,836
Yeah, this whole thing is...

287
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,496
a big misunderstanding.

288
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,549
There's absolutely no way
it's going to trial.

289
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,968
Who wants that hassle?
Not me.

290
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:55,347
Whichever lucky soul
at the DA's office catches this...

291
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,307
looking at an easy clear.

292
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,851
There's a felony in there, right?

293
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,937
Well, it'd be a classic... Go ahead.

294
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,022
Classic case of overcharging.

295
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,066
No offence.

296
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:10,111
Happy to have a civil conversation,
and I'm always ready to make a deal.

297
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,988
Just call me Monty Hall.

298
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:15,116
So you're looking to
plea out on this then, Monty?

299
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:17,786
If it's the right plea.

300
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:21,289
I'm not perfect. I made mistakes,
I'm willing to own up to them...

301
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:25,627
in a way that is satisfying
to both myself and the state.

302
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,547
Well, good luck with that.

303
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:33,802
Good luck with that, as in,
I wish you well...

304
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,971
or I accept your challenge?

305
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,722
I wish you well.

306
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,600
Play your cards right, they may go for it.

307
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:41,768
They?

308
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,186
Not you?

309
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,273
Prosecuting your case?
No, man, it's not me.

310
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,319
You never catch a lucky break, do you?

311
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:54,155
- Bad timing?
- No, conflicted out.

312
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:55,615
Conflicted out?

313
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,284
I mean, I figured that'd happen.

314
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,203
You and I have wheeled and dealed
together too many times.

315
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,581
There's no way
the boss was letting me run that one.

316
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:05,625
It's not Ericsen, is it?

317
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:09,421
The whole Albuquerque office is out.
We all know you, Jimmy.

318
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,132
Well, who is it?

319
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,135
I don't know.
They're pulling someone in from Belen.

320
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,554
Hay?

321
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:20,265
Something Hay, I think.

322
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:23,268
I don't know. Boss used the words,
tough but fair.

323
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:27,214
Gotta jam.

324
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,488
Good luck.

325
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,495
Burger's getting cold.

326
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,331
You want it?

327
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,667
- Yeah?
- There's too many trans fats.

328
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,670
Those are the best fats.

329
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,093
- So they let you keep the car?
- What?

330
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,765
Davis and Main.
They let you keep the German car?

331
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,683
No.

332
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,727
That blows.

333
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,314
Ms Hay?

334
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,233
Mr McGill?

335
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,860
Chuck, please.
Meet me at the front door.

336
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,112
They said to
put my things in the mailbox.

337
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,448
Yes, please. Anything with a battery.

338
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,832
Did your brother
ever have a key to the house?

339
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:17,335
Before the recent trouble, he did.

340
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:20,630
He brought me my groceries
and sundries.

341
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,174
But we had a falling out.

342
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,885
I have an employee
who does all that now.

343
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:29,514
You took away your brother's key
when you hired this employee?

344
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,849
I changed the locks.

345
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:37,772
Going... Going back to the confrontation,
so I have it absolutely clear...

346
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,232
Did he strike you?

347
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,276
No, nothing like that.

348
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,361
He backed me into a cabinet.

349
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:44,529
Did he have a weapon?

350
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:48,283
Well, as I mentioned, he used
a fireplace poker to break into my desk.

351
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,243
But he never would've used it on me.

352
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:52,328
Did you feel physically threatened?

353
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:57,208
My brother is a lot of things,
but even he has limits.

354
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:01,296
And you're willing to appear
as a witness, even though he's family?

355
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,381
Unfortunately, yes.

356
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:05,550
If we continue with this...

357
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,552
I'll need your sworn testimony.

358
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,347
I've had situations
with family members before...

359
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:15,101
where the injured party
has ultimately been reluctant...

360
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,769
to cooperate with my office.

361
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,688
That won't happen.

362
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:25,236
I'm curious about your strategy.

363
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:29,991
Well...

364
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:33,911
as officers of the court...

365
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:37,290
I feel we should be held
to a higher standard.

366
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:40,710
I don't intend to take it easy on
your brother because he's a lawyer.

367
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,211
Of course not.

368
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:45,340
The bone of contention is
the felony breaking and entering.

369
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:47,592
He's gonna wanna
plea down to a misdemeanour...

370
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,969
but I'll hold the line on the felony.

371
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:54,223
Which means
this could possibly go to trial.

372
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:59,687
Now, I... I wanna be mindful
of your comfort and well-being.

373
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:03,733
With... With your condition,
are you able to appear before the court?

374
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,735
- In person?
- I certainly appreciate...

375
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:08,196
you accommodating me today
by coming here.

376
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:11,991
But don't worry, I'm able to
tolerate being out for short periods...

377
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,701
with a few minor adjustments.

378
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,412
Nothing that will
overly inconvenience the court.

379
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:19,916
I'll get started on this.

380
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:26,089
Unless you have other concerns?

381
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:29,092
I just...

382
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,095
I just keep thinking...

383
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:37,058
- You know, Jimmy has a good heart.
- I'm... I'm sure he does.

384
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:39,018
It's not an excuse for what he's done.

385
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:42,063
But he's my brother.

386
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:43,690
And I know...

387
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,067
Well, he...

388
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:48,361
Well, he's emotional,
he flies off the handle.

389
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:50,363
This is more than flying off the handle.

390
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,908
I'm not going to defend his actions...

391
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:58,329
but I can't help wondering
if there's not a better solution...

392
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:00,665
for everyone.

393
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:54,505
What do you think?

394
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:56,507
Maybe hunters?

395
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,015
Maybe.

396
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,942
Hunters.

397
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:39,295
Looks like we got a hit.

398
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:49,138
Get down on your knees.

399
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,161
Jesus, how old is this?

400
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:56,080
I found it in the glove box.

401
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:57,289
Best guess?

402
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,068
From back when all the doors matched.

403
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,716
I got a deal offer from the ADA today.

404
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,469
And?

405
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:12,221
It's not what I expected.

406
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:14,849
Bad not what you expected?

407
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,226
It's just that...

408
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,728
it's different.

409
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:23,774
She's offering me
pre-prosecution diversion.

410
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:25,401
Seriously?

411
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:27,736
A PPD?

412
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,907
That's great, Jimmy.

413
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:36,162
- Best I could hope for, right?
- Right.

414
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:38,706
What does she want you to confess to?

415
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:39,874
All of it.

416
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,292
The felony B and E.

417
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:44,211
Misdemeanour petty assault
and property damage.

418
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:47,715
I never touched him,
but they got assault in there.

419
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:49,967
Well, could be worse.

420
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:53,345
As long as they never activate it,
it doesn't matter, right?

421
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:56,682
You gonna be able to
keep your nose clean for a whole year?

422
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:59,101
Keep Viktor with a K on lockdown?

423
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:01,604
It's not a problem, Giselle.

424
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:05,357
And if I don't, it's instant jail, right?

425
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,485
Lucky break.

426
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:11,405
She must not want the hassle of a trial.

427
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:13,908
Guess so.

428
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:16,202
Jimmy.

429
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:18,537
This is good news.

430
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:22,416
And Chuck is gonna be pissed.
It's a big check in the pro column.

431
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:26,629
Actually, the PPD was Chuck's idea.

432
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:28,464
Shit.

433
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:30,257
Yeah.

434
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,345
What's his game?

435
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:38,057
One condition of the PPD
is that my written confession...

436
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:41,810
is immediately submitted to
the New Mexico Bar Association.

437
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:43,896
Your written felony confession.

438
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:48,901
I thought he wanted me in jail,
he just wants my law licence.

439
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:53,239
What are you gonna do?

440
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:55,699
Well...

441
00:42:55,866 --> 00:42:58,327
I knew the bar
was gonna be an issue, right?

442
00:42:58,494 --> 00:43:01,038
So I figured I'd plea down
to a couple misdemeanours.

443
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:05,376
Get a censure
and maybe a little suspension.

444
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,336
But a confession to a felony?

445
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:09,546
Grounds for disbarment.

446
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,799
Yeah, and if I take it to trial
and I lose...

447
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:15,803
I face the bar anyways,
and jail time, most likely.

448
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:18,555
He's got me boxed in.

449
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:22,559
You can fight this.

450
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:25,020
The board listens to
extenuating circumstances...

451
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:27,523
No, Chuck knows everybody at the bar.

452
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,358
Hell, he made half their careers.

453
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,403
It's gonna be
him and his cronies versus me.

454
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,321
Alone.

455
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:39,118
Not alone.

456
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:42,579
- Kim.
- Come on, Jimmy.

457
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:44,248
You need me.

458
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:46,208
You can't argue this yourself.

459
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:50,587
You and I both know that, and I'm not
gonna let you fight this on your own.

460
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:54,466
Are you sure?

461
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:56,135
Yeah.

462
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:57,928
Because I don't...

463
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:02,224
Why would you...?

464
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,102
Come on.

465
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:07,354
This guy? Seriously?

466
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:16,071
Let's just call it the fallacy
of sunk costs.

467
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:20,743
So, what now?

468
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:21,994
Now?

469
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:27,791
Now we take that PPD and
we shove it right up Chuck's ass.
