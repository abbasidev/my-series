1
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,495
- Check over that way.
- Will do.

2
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,299
You see a guy in a corduroy coat go by?

3
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:36,342
Sir?

4
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,928
Sir?

5
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,431
Young guy, dark hair, corduroy coat?

6
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:47,145
How about it?

7
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:57,030
Hey, Nick. Come here.

8
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,036
Wanna come on out here?

9
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,421
Go ahead and open your jacket for me.

10
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:22,263
I'm placing you under arrest, sir.
Put your hands on your head, please.

11
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,897
- Nick, wanna grab those for me?
- You got it.

12
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,779
All right, let's go.

13
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,031
Nice job.

14
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:43,326
Say nothing. You understand?
Get a lawyer.

15
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,835
Get a lawyer.

16
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,798
Asshole.

17
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,143
- Ladies.
- Hey, Gene.

18
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,353
Nice lunch?

19
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,772
Oh, yeah. What you need?

20
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:15,066
Rolls about to come out.

21
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,901
You got it.

22
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:00,611
So can I tell Howard...

23
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:04,532
you're not quitting,
or retiring or whatever?

24
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:09,037
And can we take all this shit
down off the walls?

25
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:13,833
I'm gonna go call Howard.

26
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,334
Jimmy.

27
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,756
You do realise you just confessed
to a felony?

28
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,674
I guess.

29
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:24,093
But you feel better, right?

30
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:27,680
Besides, it's your word against mine.

31
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,599
Absolutely.

32
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,559
Coming back.

33
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,895
What's it matter what I said, Howard?

34
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:19,232
Why are you looking a gift horse
in the mouth? He just...

35
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,568
Yeah. Well, whatever it was,
he's over it now. All right?

36
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:25,696
And by the way, you're welcome.

37
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:39,669
Well, Howard's breathing again.
You made him very happy.

38
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,031
Jimmy.

39
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,992
Jimmy, if you're gonna help...

40
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,202
at least use a little finesse, won't you?

41
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:16,164
- Finesse? What do you...?
- Quit yanking at it. You're...

42
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,041
You're pulling the varnish
right off the walnut.

43
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:24,005
- I'm not pulling any varnish off the walnut.
- You most certainly are. Look. Look. See?

44
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:26,424
Maybe you should've thought
about the walnut...

45
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:29,552
- before you covered it in duct tape.
- I don't need your help.

46
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:33,681
- I don't recall ever asking for it.
- I'm sorry. Okay?

47
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,684
Finesse. Fine. Show me. Demonstrate.

48
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,561
Like this.

49
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:43,608
Gently roll it with your thumbs.

50
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,527
Left and then right.

51
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:49,113
You see? Alternate the thumbs.

52
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,532
Up and down.

53
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:54,619
Get a nice tight roll going.

54
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:58,247
Sorry. I think you're the one
that needs a nice tight roll.

55
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,917
Come on. Show me.

56
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,336
Gently. Gently.

57
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,087
Left, then right.

58
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,631
Left, right.

59
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,592
I get it. Wax on, wax off.

60
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:12,053
Mr Miyagi.

61
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:14,096
Karate Kid.

62
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,809
Seriously?

63
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,949
Oh, my God.

64
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:36,160
The Adventures of Mabel. I...

65
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,829
I haven't thought about this in forever.
Remember this?

66
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,706
I do.

67
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:43,501
- Harry Thurston Peck.
- Yeah.

68
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,711
Mabel goes into the mountain...

69
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:49,423
and she meets the king of the brownies,
and he gives her...

70
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,010
some kind of
super-delicious jelly, and...

71
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,138
Holy crap. 1912.

72
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,557
Yeah. Belonged to Grammy Davenport.

73
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,226
She wrote her name in it.

74
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:04,855
She was reading that to her school kids
the year the Titanic went down.

75
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,023
Damn.

76
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,775
Then Mom read it to me.

77
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,528
I read it to you.

78
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,072
You don't remember.

79
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,740
Yeah. Yeah.

80
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,243
I do now that you say it. Yeah.

81
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,538
What was I, like 5 or 6?

82
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,124
You had had...

83
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:28,170
this weird night light
that you were so crazy about.

84
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,964
It was...

85
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,465
It was Daffy Duck.

86
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,218
It was some Daffy Duck rip-off
with this weird red bill.

87
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,928
- Mouth. Oh, yeah. The bill.
- Yeah.

88
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:38,931
It used to get so hot,
we thought it'd burn the house down.

89
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:42,560
- But you wouldn't let anybody touch it.
- Honest to...

90
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:45,021
You got a great memory, Chuck.

91
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,982
That red bill and everything. Hey.

92
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,361
What was the name of that little girl
that lived three houses up from us?

93
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,822
- She had, like, a pageboy haircut...
- Jimmy.

94
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,616
and she was always in the dirt,
always dirty.

95
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,411
- I liked her, and she was always...
- Jimmy. Jimmy.

96
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,832
Don't think I'll ever forget
what happened here today.

97
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:14,216
And you will pay.

98
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:34,945
You didn't mention my garden.

99
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,947
Your garden is part of your backyard...

100
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,658
so it's automatically included
in the property that goes to Jenn.

101
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,536
It comes with the house, Mom.

102
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,414
Well, I think you need
to mention it by name...

103
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:49,460
in case some dirty judge
decides to play tricks.

104
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,130
Okay. We can do that.

105
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,716
Let's see.

106
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,094
Garden.

107
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,304
Hey, I'm back.
Oh, hi, ladies. Jimmy McGill.

108
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,264
Hey, Jimmy. We are almost done here.

109
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,767
- Great. Can I...?
- We're almost done.

110
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,228
I'll be with you in a minute.

111
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,154
And mention my lily pond.

112
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,365
It's in my garden.

113
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,201
Lily pond.

114
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,508
- Okay, ladies.
- Thanks so much for your help.

115
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:40,052
You're very welcome.
Thank you for being so patient.

116
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:43,222
And, Mrs Aherne, if you or Margaret
ever need anything from me...

117
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,641
anything at all,
you can call me day or night.

118
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,852
This is Mrs Siemasko
and her daughter Jenn.

119
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,729
I'm sorry.
I get my wires crossed a little.

120
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,064
- Bye.
- Bye.

121
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,274
- Drive safe.
- Thank you.

122
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:55,151
Okay. Thank you.

123
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,946
You are a superhero.

124
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,991
I owe you big time.

125
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,462
So how's Chuck?

126
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,882
Crisis averted, I guess. I mean...

127
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:21,927
he's back to being
the same old Chuck, so...

128
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,472
Wanna talk about it?

129
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,599
Depends.

130
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,517
It may or may not involve...

131
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,312
that thing you said you never,
ever wanted to discuss.

132
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,814
Okay. Then thanks.

133
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,274
I gotta get back to it.

134
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,153
How about we call it a day?
I'll buy you some dinner.

135
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,321
You're kidding, right?

136
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,281
You realise how far behind I am...

137
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,950
not to mention,
now I've got eight wills to finish?

138
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,410
What? I'll do the wills.

139
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,245
- No, you won't.
- Of course I will...

140
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,080
do the wills. They're my clients.

141
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,833
They're my clients.
You and I aren't partners, remember?

142
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,711
Once I take people on,
I can't just reassign them to you.

143
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,506
Oh, come on. Why you getting all,
like, legal on me, huh?

144
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,382
Who cares?

145
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,803
I told every single one the situation,
that they'd be getting me instead of you.

146
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,056
I tried to talk them into
coming another day.

147
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:09,225
Six left. Maybe you'll get those back.

148
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,228
- Look. If this is about the money...
- It's not about the money.

149
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,854
You can keep the money.

150
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,940
Don't act like I wanted this.

151
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,609
Jesus, like I need more on my plate?

152
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,909
Are you mad?

153
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,496
I'm not mad.

154
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,749
I'm just...

155
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,420
thinking about things.

156
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,930
For 10 minutes today,
Chuck didn't hate me.

157
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,851
I forgot what that felt like.

158
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:19,878
Jimmy.

159
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,551
You do realise
you just confessed to a felony?

160
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,803
I guess.

161
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,180
But you feel better, right?

162
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:34,268
Besides, it's your word against mine.

163
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,478
That's the end of it.

164
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,440
Howard.

165
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:40,708
That's the end.

166
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,486
Could you...?

167
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:46,905
Yeah.

168
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,412
Well, now do you believe me?

169
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,792
I don't even know where to begin.

170
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,794
But yes, I believe you.

171
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:05,132
Your brother
is one world-class son of a bitch.

172
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:07,593
No offence.

173
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,473
I just really wish you'd told me
about these plans of yours...

174
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,477
- before you went out and did it.
- I know, and I regret misleading you.

175
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:20,731
It's just that a certain vérité
had to be established.

176
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,026
I'm not talking about the heart attack
that you nearly gave me.

177
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,487
Chuck, this tape.

178
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:29,239
I'm not sure exactly what it accomplishes.

179
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,575
You know evidentiary rules
better than I do...

180
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:35,579
but a secretly recorded tape
with a problematic chain of evidence?

181
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,624
- It will be hell of a time getting it admitted.
- I agree.

182
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,417
If you put it in front of a jury...

183
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:44,713
Jimmy would call audio experts to say
the voice isn't his, and the tape is edited.

184
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,881
He would, indeed.

185
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:49,218
Are you thinking about playing this
for Kevin Wachtell at Mesa Verde?

186
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:52,846
Because as much as I would love to,
that ship has sailed.

187
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,973
We're never
getting them back, regardless.

188
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,060
Oh, I doubt we could even
get in the door over there.

189
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:02,272
If that tape is useless in a court of law
and no help in the court of public opinion...

190
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,607
what's the point?

191
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,235
Because I can't think of a single use for it.

192
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,238
I can.

193
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,734
Hey, mister.

194
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:00,988
We're closing in 15 minutes.

195
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,871
Call me a cab, will you?

196
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,376
What about your vehicle?

197
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,004
Keep it.

198
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,343
Five J's Auto Salvage.

199
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:27,014
Broadway, at Bobby Foster's.

200
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,308
Yeah. Ehr... Ehr... Ehr...

201
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,727
How is it again?

202
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,603
Ehrmantraut.

203
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,023
Yeah. Ehrmantraut.

204
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,899
Yeah.

205
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:41,611
Just tell him
to pull up to the gate and honk.

206
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,280
Okay.

207
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,032
Thanks.

208
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,408
They're on their way.

209
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:48,285
Thank you.

210
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,336
Do you sell a gas cap
for an '87 Caprice wagon?

211
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:44,091
Should. GM cap should be the blue
on the bottom there.

212
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,447
You're sure I can't help carry those
to your car, Mrs Vankamp?

213
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:55,740
Don't be a silly.

214
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:59,452
I only hope I didn't take too much
of your time with all my dusty old photos.

215
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:03,498
Goodness, no.
Your grandson's wedding was gorgeous.

216
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:06,501
When I come back,
I'll show you my niece's confirmation.

217
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,000
Wait till you see the flowers.

218
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:11,965
- Roses, petunias, orchids.
- Yes.

219
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,676
- They don't smell. And baby's breath.
- Well...

220
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:17,804
- And bachelor buttons. Lilies of the valley.
- Okay.

221
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,057
- Well, I'll believe it when I see it.
- Daisies. Daisies don't tell.

222
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:23,643
Now I've got something to look forward to.
Okay, bye.

223
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,021
- Bye.
- See you.

224
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:32,610
Thank you for waiting so patiently.
Who do we have next?

225
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,615
That'd be me.

226
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,581
Hello, hello.

227
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,249
It's so good to see you again.

228
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:51,212
I escorted you and your clients
onto my base.

229
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,757
I treated you with hospitality and respect.

230
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:56,760
Now I come to find every word
out of your mouth is a damn lie.

231
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,346
Captain, please, sit down, take a load off.

232
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:02,349
Hey, I'll get you a complimentary coffee,
or a soft drink?

233
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,101
And your so-called war hero
Fudge Talbott?

234
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,145
No such person. Never was.

235
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:10,231
Granted, some artistic licence
may have been taken.

236
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,151
You entered government property
under false pretences, sir.

237
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,154
I am no expert on your procedures
and protocols and whatnot...

238
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:21,451
so if we failed to cross a T or dot an I,
I apologise for any misunderstanding.

239
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:24,537
- No, it's not a misunderstanding.
- Step back. Big picture this.

240
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,830
What damage was done?

241
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,791
Hey, who was hurt, huh?

242
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:30,377
What was damaged?
The base is still there, right?

243
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,670
- The B-52 is, I presume, still...?
- B-29.

244
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,091
B-29. Fifi's a B-29.

245
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,305
Oh, this is all just
one big joke to you?

246
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,391
- You don't like the commercial.
- No, I don't.

247
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,560
- But this has nothing to do...
- Constructive criticism is welcome.

248
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,772
But you should realise
that most people find it uplifting.

249
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:51,940
Patriotic even.

250
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,609
Check recruiting numbers.
I think you'll see an uptick.

251
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,737
And you know what?
If it turns out Fudge wasn't in the war...

252
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:00,323
Fudge is not a person.
He wasn't in the war.

253
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,035
Well, neither was Tom Cruise,
and look what Top Gun did for you.

254
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,079
You lied to me.

255
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:09,082
You lied to my face,
and I can't let you get away with it.

256
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:12,710
I think we just... We're just gonna have to
agree to disagree.

257
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:15,213
So can I get you that coffee to go, or...?

258
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,925
No, no, I'm gonna tell you
what's happening now.

259
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,927
You're gonna take that ad off the air.

260
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:25,223
And if you play it again, I'll go to the judge
advocate, and we'll take you down.

261
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,935
Trespassing, false representation,
stolen valour, the whole nine yards.

262
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,812
For eight seconds of a TV commercial?

263
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:34,816
You take that ad down,
or there'll be hell to pay.

264
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,818
That clear enough for you?

265
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:40,029
Make me.

266
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,699
- Yeah? Make you?
- Yeah.

267
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,909
Let's do this.
Bring your commander here.

268
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:47,954
I'll explain how you let us on the base,
red-carpet treatment...

269
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,831
Because you lied your way in.

270
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:53,501
Not how I remember it,
and I've got witnesses to back me up.

271
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,712
Do you like being
an Air Force captain?

272
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:59,299
Think the United States wants to sue
an old man in a wheelchair?

273
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,384
He was standing on TV.

274
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,011
He wasn't even in a wheelchair.

275
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:07,599
Periodically he is, and when he's in court,
you best believe he'll be in a wheelchair.

276
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:10,268
You're an ambulance-chasing
piece of shit. All the same.

277
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:14,481
Always on a high horse,
always trying to make me feel like I'm...

278
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,281
Look...

279
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:28,161
I'm a lawyer, and this is what I do
all day, every day, so how about this?

280
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:30,622
I won't fly jet planes.

281
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:34,375
You stay out of court.
Does that sound good?

282
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,090
You know, guys like you...

283
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:44,511
you think you're so damn smart.

284
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,889
And you think you don't have
to play straight with anybody.

285
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,099
The wheel is gonna turn.

286
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,727
It always does.

287
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:10,954
A lawyer you can trust, my ass.

288
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:14,707
Thank you for your service.

289
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:28,716
Three-thirty in the morning? Seriously?

290
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,135
Can you get me that?

291
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,972
I don't know.

292
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:42,522
- It's a real thing?
- Yeah.

293
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,607
Then yeah.
I know someone who can get it.

294
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:46,317
How much?

295
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,194
What do I look like, RadioShack?

296
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:51,322
It's gonna cost you whatever it costs me,
plus my end.

297
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:52,782
Well, let's start with that.

298
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:56,452
Normally, be about 500...

299
00:33:56,619 --> 00:34:00,790
but seeing that this is
an after-hours house call...

300
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:02,917
let's make it a grand.

301
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,264
Hey, how's the pup?

302
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,266
Doing okay?

303
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:23,479
- Yeah.
- She's not being left alone all day, is she?

304
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:25,982
- She's got plenty of company.
- Good.

305
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:31,446
Hey, this is gonna take me
a few days, so...

306
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:33,531
I'll let you know.

307
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:35,408
And next time...

308
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:39,412
let's try to make business happen
during business hours.

309
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:21,287
Well, this will certainly help
my Thursday PowerPoint.

310
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,748
Excellent.

311
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,794
That's a draft letter from Kevin
to the Arizona regulator.

312
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,421
I know he likes the personal touch.

313
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:32,465
He's gonna love it.

314
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:35,009
I can't believe you did all of this
in three days.

315
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,429
Am I reading this right?

316
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:40,431
Did you get the rehearing moved up?

317
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:44,644
Yeah. Those are three possible dates,
depending on your and Kevin's schedule.

318
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,646
The soonest I could get is the 4th.

319
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:49,106
You moved it up almost three weeks.

320
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,734
I'll give it another shot
and see if I can do better.

321
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,903
Are you kidding me?

322
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,073
Kevin will be popping champagne.

323
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:02,453
- I knew you were the right one for this.
- Well, I appreciate the opportunity.

324
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,873
You should've heard how that arrogant jerk
spoke to me at the hearing.

325
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,545
Right there in front of Kevin,
he accuses me of muddying the waters.

326
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:13,881
Muddying the waters.

327
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:17,176
I mean, he's the one
who can't even get the address right.

328
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah. That's...

329
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:23,516
I know you have friends over at HHM.
They talk a good game, but come on.

330
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:28,521
Guys like that, when crunch time comes,
it's always someone else's fault.

331
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:31,816
Paige?

332
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:34,652
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's almost 11:30.

333
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:37,029
Thanks, Greta. I'll be right up.

334
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:39,574
So are we still on for lunch Tuesday?

335
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,619
Absolutely, and, Paige,
thank you for everything.

336
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:46,914
No. Thank you for cleaning up
that mess McGill left behind.

337
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:51,002
Would you mind if I messenger that over
tomorrow morning, first thing?

338
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,963
I'd like to take one last look
before we submit, just...

339
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,715
double-check a few things.

340
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:56,966
Sure.

341
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,593
So tomorrow, first thing?

342
00:36:58,759 --> 00:36:59,927
Absolutely.

343
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,137
Thanks.

344
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:02,805
- I'll see you, Paige.
- Okay, bye.

345
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:49,727
How's it coming in there?

346
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:52,939
Good.

347
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:01,364
- Don't mean to rush you.
- No. It's okay.

348
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:07,244
I'm done.

349
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,798
Half a rainbow?

350
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:21,175
Wanna keep going
till you do the whole thing?

351
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:24,470
No. If you're done, I'm done.

352
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:27,640
You know,
your clients seem to like that rainbow.

353
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:29,517
Think they're gonna miss it?

354
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:31,519
Wait till they see what's going up next.

355
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:33,729
They're gonna love it.
You're gonna love it.

356
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:35,481
Yeah? Should I be worried?

357
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,191
Nope.

358
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,319
What do you say
we get the hell out of here?

359
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,405
Sounds good.

360
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:08,222
You ready to hit it?

361
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:11,100
Sorry. I just need to check one thing.

362
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:14,311
It'll be two minutes. Tops.

363
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:47,845
Ernesto.

364
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:49,555
Good morning, Mr McGill.

365
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:52,600
They didn't have Fuji apples,
so I got you Honeycrisp.

366
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,227
- Hope that's all right.
- I'm sure it'll be fine.

367
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:56,562
Did you get the...?

368
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:58,314
Yeah. I got them.

369
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:02,526
I went ahead
and I figured I should maybe...

370
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:10,576
I wrapped them up, you know?
For safety.

371
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:14,330
That's very thoughtful of you,
but I need them now, so...

372
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:17,249
- You sure it's okay?
- It's okay.

373
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:27,009
Yep.

374
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,269
Perfect.

375
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:49,281
Shit.

376
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:16,392
Ernesto, could you come in here, please?

377
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,356
Thought I could do this myself.

378
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:24,316
Would you mind changing the batteries?

379
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,527
Sure thing, Mr McGill.

380
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:29,113
Thanks.

381
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:39,123
I changed 1261 to 1216. It was me.

382
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,041
Turn that off. Turn it off.

383
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:43,836
- It all went exactly...
- Turn it off!

384
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:47,673
You did not hear that!

385
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:54,013
All right.

386
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,640
Okay, Ernesto...

387
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:59,685
this is my fault, not yours.

388
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:04,857
But now that you've heard it,
you need to understand something.

389
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:08,360
You know about confidentiality, right?

390
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:12,448
As employees of Hamlin Hamlin McGill,
we are both bound by the strictures...

391
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:14,450
of client confidentiality.

392
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:17,286
By law. Both of us. By law.

393
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:18,913
You understand what I'm saying?

394
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,999
- So I'm not supposed to tell anyone?
- That's right.

395
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:26,629
No matter who, no matter what reasons
you think you might have...

396
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:29,965
you must not, you cannot tell anyone.

397
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:32,551
There could be terrible consequences.

398
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:35,679
Life-changing consequences.

399
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:39,642
And we don't want you to get into trouble.

400
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:42,228
If something were to happen to you
because of this...

401
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,396
I'd feel sick about it.

402
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,067
Okay.

403
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:49,401
Enough said.

404
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:54,531
I guess I'll go finish
putting away the groceries. Okay?

405
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,742
Thank you, Ernesto.

406
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:14,481
Tuesday,
high temperatures will be in the mid-60s...

407
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:17,067
with five to 10 mile per hour winds...

408
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:20,404
but expect scattered showers
Tuesday night with lows in the 40s.

409
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:24,032
Wednesday will be partly cloudy
with high temperatures in the mid-50s.

410
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,827
The Grants area will have temperatures
in the mid-40s...

411
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:29,872
with southwest winds
15 to 20 miles per hour.

412
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:33,584
Now let's get back to more
of your favourite sound, Souvenir Oldies...

413
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,963
with the Steve Ricketts Programme
on KDSK 92.7FM.

414
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:42,593
Thank you, Derek.
Love those temperatures. It's almost like...
