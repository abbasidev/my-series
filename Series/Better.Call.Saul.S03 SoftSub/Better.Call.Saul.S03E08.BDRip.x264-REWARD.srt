1
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,318
Let there be light.

2
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:27,779
And then there was light.

3
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,493
Jeez, will you look at this.

4
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:40,625
That's where your mom used to work.

5
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:44,796
- Right back there doing the books.
- Yeah, whatever.

6
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:51,553
Hey, remember when
we used to ditch fourth...

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,306
come in the back door?
Tell your folks it was a free period?

8
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:58,727
- O'Dell's Algebra Two.
- Mr O'Dell.

9
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,062
Man, that guy was a butthole.

10
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:03,648
And your mom,
I think she knew we were skipping...

11
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:07,652
but she'd always stop what was
doing, give me a pack of Little Debbies.

12
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:11,197
I think all those Little Debbies
put them out of business.

13
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,908
How'd you get up there
when you were a kid?

14
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,661
A couple of milk crates, you know.

15
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:31,218
All right.

16
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,889
No, no, no.

17
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,006
Nope.

18
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:42,854
Boom. Indian head penny.

19
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:45,064
All right.
That's worth about three bucks.

20
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,150
We polish it up, run the coin game.

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,402
Nice. We get 150 bucks easy.

22
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:52,489
A hundred fifty? We got 110
for a plain vanilla half dollar.

23
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:56,075
This, this is actually rare.
I mean, you can see it, you know?

24
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:57,786
Three hundred, easy.

25
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,455
Three hundred. Me likey.

26
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:04,209
Now you're gonna tell me what your
coin collection was doing up there.

27
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:10,124
It's a long story...

28
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,760
Let's get out of here.

29
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:27,857
- All right. Now let's hit it.
- No. There might be another one.

30
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,610
All right. Then give.

31
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:32,946
What's the deal with the coins?

32
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,000
Well...

33
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:44,249
I was what, 12 or so.
I was working the register.

34
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,834
A guy comes in...

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,381
and buys a box of Ivory Flakes
and a sixer of Old Style.

36
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:58,179
He pays with
a couple bucks and this.

37
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:00,807
The second I see it,
I know what it is.

38
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:03,101
It's a George Washington silver.

39
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:06,062
I tell my dad, Pop, this quarter is rare.

40
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:09,524
It's worth four bucks.

41
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:14,153
I barely get the words out of my mouth,
he hightails it out to give it back.

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,657
He can't find the guy, so he tapes it
to the side of the register.

43
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:23,872
He's hoping that this guy
will come back so he can return it.

44
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,667
He starts talking about giving it to
Father Mahoney for the poor box...

45
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,711
so I make it disappear.

46
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:32,672
Then after that, every day after school,
I'm checking the till.

47
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:36,885
Something catches my eye, I stick it
in the box, put it up there for good luck.

48
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,763
So much for good luck.

49
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,101
It's a crying shame they lost this place.

50
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,979
They never should've
bought it in the first place.

51
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:50,023
My dad didn't have it in him.

52
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:51,900
What do you mean?

53
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,860
Your folks worked so hard.

54
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,111
Yeah, they worked hard.

55
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:59,157
They worked a lot of hours for
a lot of years for nothing.

56
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:02,493
I don't know, Jimmy.
A lot of customers, everybody liked them.

57
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,581
Everybody liked him because
he was a soft touch, you know?

58
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:09,000
Every deadbeat in the neighbourhood
owed him money.

59
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,543
You come in with a sob story...

60
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,338
you leave with a pat on the back
and a gallon of milk.

61
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,923
He could've made it work.

62
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,343
He could've sold beer and cigarettes
to the kids from Mary-Margaret's...

63
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,263
but, oh, no, not him.

64
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,600
He was never gonna do
what he had to do.

65
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:37,320
How'd you know there'd be another?

66
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,618
Okay.

67
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:45,495
Banquet's over.

68
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,039
Those conventioneers...

69
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:52,001
been talking farm equipment
for 10 hours straight.

70
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,337
Now they want to party.

71
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:58,257
Gonna be a big night, my friend.

72
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:01,052
- What do you say? Time to get moving?
- Let's go.

73
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:55,453
Yeah, tribal police?

74
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,372
Yeah, I was out on
your property this afternoon.

75
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,833
I found a dead body.

76
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,669
Off the old post road.

77
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:09,008
Out in the scrub. It was past
the Oasis Motel billboard.

78
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:13,179
I was out with my metal detector
looking for arrowheads.

79
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:17,892
No, I don't want to give my name.
I was trespassing.

80
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:23,147
Look, you better send someone out there
to find him before the coyotes do.

81
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:45,628
Over here, I've recorded
the location of the incident.

82
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:49,173
That is where I was
physically when it began.

83
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,052
This column gives approximate origin.

84
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:55,263
And as you can see,
much of the time...

85
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,474
I couldn't be sure,
so I just wrote ambient.

86
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:03,062
And of course, I've recorded
the times and dosages of the medicine.

87
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:07,400
- This is very impressive, Charles.
- And look at the trend.

88
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:11,570
Day one, pain of seven and eight,
even eight point five.

89
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,365
Day three,
nothing higher than five and a quarter.

90
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,285
And now, it's all threes and fours.

91
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,539
Later, I'd like to give you
some exercises and strategies...

92
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:22,957
that might help even more.

93
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:25,001
I'm all ears.

94
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,962
How do you see your next steps?

95
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,632
Well, clearly with this kind of
improvement...

96
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:36,345
it won't be long before I'm back to
work full time with no accommodations.

97
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,848
And then soon after,
I'm gonna get back into court.

98
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:43,436
I haven't argued a case
in almost three years, so that's next.

99
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,897
And I'm gonna get these lights
turned back on.

100
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:49,900
I want this house to be full of music.

101
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,819
I wanna have a dinner party.

102
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:55,114
Or hell, no. A great big celebration.

103
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:58,659
I want 100 people in here,
spilling out onto the lawn.

104
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,829
I want caterers and a full bar.

105
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:06,500
I want to be surrounded
by friends and colleagues.

106
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,962
That's stirring.
Those are excellent goals.

107
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:14,800
Doctor, I wouldn't have believed
I could come so far so quickly.

108
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,179
And I have to give you
the lion's share of the credit.

109
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:20,348
Well, it's remarkable.

110
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,099
But Rome wasn't built in a day.

111
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:26,812
I know rushing forward may be tempting,
but it's important to give yourself time.

112
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:31,734
You've just begun a journey
that could take years.

113
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,028
Well, I suppose...

114
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:37,490
but surely you'd admit
that every case is different.

115
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,909
- Of course.
- Then perhaps...

116
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:41,827
my recovery might be speedier...

117
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,455
than your run-of-the-mill patient.
Is that possible?

118
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:47,208
I'm just cautioning you
not to push yourself too hard.

119
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:52,880
I know... Appreciate every step forward,
but modulate your expectations.

120
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,299
Yes, absolutely.

121
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,428
Let's talk about the night
you first called me.

122
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,431
- You sounded very distressed.
- I was.

123
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,684
Using a telephone
must've been difficult for you.

124
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,270
I had to walk 10 blocks to a payphone.

125
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,481
That was extremely uncomfortable.

126
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,900
Probably almost a nine.

127
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,945
What made it so important
to talk to me that night?

128
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,158
I'd had an incident.

129
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:24,954
A very public incident.

130
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,416
Perhaps the worst experience
of my life.

131
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,713
It was proven to me...

132
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:40,136
in public and beyond the shadow
of a doubt, that there was a battery...

133
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,888
a fully charged battery...

134
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:46,892
almost next to my skin
for the better part of two hours.

135
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,479
And I felt nothing.

136
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,025
What does that mean to you?

137
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,074
This condition...

138
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,536
To me, it's as real as that chair.

139
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,998
It's as real as this house.
It's as real as you.

140
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,666
But...

141
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,462
what if it's not?

142
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:18,215
What if it's all in my head?

143
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,927
And if that's true...

144
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,139
if it's not real...

145
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,311
then what have I done?

146
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,323
It's all in the storyboards.
Get set for the master shot. Okay?

147
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,242
Looking good. We about ready?

148
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,621
- Just about.
- I gotta hand it to you. I...

149
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,540
This is the busiest weekday
we've had in the last six months.

150
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,459
And are people
mentioning the commercial?

151
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:55,085
You know what, they are.

152
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,962
- Excellent.
- I know.

153
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,549
Oh, here's your partner. Hey, get him
into make-up. We can carve this turkey.

154
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:01,759
Okay, listen.

155
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,886
Excuse me. Not now.

156
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,679
- It's fine.
- Sorry.

157
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,432
I just got off the phone with the station.

158
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:12,478
- You don't even work for them.
- I never said I worked for the station.

159
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,772
Saul Goodman Productions?
Remember?

160
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:18,651
You work with us, you don't have to
deal with the bureaucrats at KWBV.

161
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,319
- We take care of everything.
- Okay.

162
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,488
Remind me, how much
is all this gonna cost?

163
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:24,782
Exactly what we talked about
the other day.

164
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,409
The first one was gratis.
That's my treat.

165
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,328
Now we're moving on
to the elite package.

166
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:34,208
Seven commercials for
the heavily discounted price of $6500.

167
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,378
Yeah, the station just
quoted me $450 per.

168
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:40,756
- Four hundred and fifty dollars?
- That's for airtime only.

169
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:41,966
Call the station.

170
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,552
Ask them how much
they charge for production...

171
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,804
of seven top-flight TV commercials.

172
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:50,015
Okay, but why do we need
seven new ones in the first place?

173
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,767
Yeah, what's to stop us...

174
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:55,312
from paying the station to just
keep running the one we have?

175
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:59,608
That's not what we agreed to.
How about that for starters?

176
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:04,655
- He did give us the first one for free.
- Yeah, I know.

177
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,074
Okay, how about this?

178
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:11,078
How about we pay you
450 for the one that already aired...

179
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,997
and then we take it from there.

180
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,040
Guys, I don't wanna
get technical on you.

181
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:18,210
But that commercial,
it doesn't actually belong to you.

182
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:23,591
It's the real and intellectual property
of Saul Goodman Productions.

183
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,385
- I don't think so. I mean, it's our faces.
- It's our store.

184
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:31,015
And it's my commercial, and you can't
run it without my permission.

185
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,434
- Okay.
- Okay. Wanna play it like that? Okay.

186
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:35,311
Four hundred and fifty dollars
is now off the table.

187
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,646
- Yeah, and that crew of yours...
- Yeah.

188
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,857
Just a bunch of UNM students.

189
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:41,650
- We can get those.
- We can get students.

190
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,319
- We can get students. We could...
- Yes, we can.

191
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,653
- Reshoot the ad.
- Yes.

192
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,239
- And then run that.
- Guys, guys, come on.

193
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,908
You wouldn't even be thinking
about a commercial if it wasn't for me.

194
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,620
Okay, we are not
gonna pay you $6,500...

195
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,913
for something
we can do ourselves, you got it?

196
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,081
Seriously?

197
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,249
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

198
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,709
Excuse us.

199
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,295
Hello there.

200
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,005
Anything we can help you with?

201
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:23,442
- Put that camera back up. Roll it.
- It's not gonna do a damn thing.

202
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:28,322
Don't give me any lip, okay? Just roll it.
Make sure it's pointed in my direction.

203
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:32,534
It's all about output. What you get
out of it is what you put into it.

204
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,245
- If you're gigging a lot...
- Are you gigging a lot?

205
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,832
Hey, sorry to interrupt. I just wanna
make sure there's no wiggle room here.

206
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:43,212
We are with customers right now.
Please, all right, just go. Thank you.

207
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,881
Okay, well, best of luck
in all your future endeavours.

208
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,466
- Go. Goodbye.
- Go.

209
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,802
- Sorry about that.
- Sorry about that.

210
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:54,932
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

211
00:16:56,558 --> 00:17:00,270
It was a drumstick.
It was laying loose in the aisle.

212
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,148
- Somebody call an ambulance.
- No, you don't need to.

213
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,776
I don't need...

214
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,823
Yes, an ambulance.
That's a good idea.

215
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,786
You guys have
liability insurance, right?

216
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,040
To our Four Corners strategy.

217
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,458
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

218
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,715
I'm not saying this to rush you,
I have a 2:45 tee time at Four Hills...

219
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,550
so don't let me get long-winded.

220
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:32,219
I've heard the water gets tricky
on the back nine there.

221
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,346
You heard right.
I didn't know you played.

222
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:37,307
Well, growing up where I did,
there was nothing else to do.

223
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,644
We ought to be having
this meeting out on the fairway.

224
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,855
I think Kim has a lot to cover.

225
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:46,358
Speaking of which,
I'm sorry, but I gotta ask.

226
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:47,901
I got a friend, Billy Gatwood.

227
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,280
He's a driller,
has a small operation over near Farwell.

228
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,866
Anyway, poor bastard's
tangled up in some kind of...

229
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,285
interstate wrangle between
Texas and New Mexico.

230
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:59,204
Now, I can't make heads or tails of it,
and neither can he.

231
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,583
His lawyer was a local guy,
completely over his head.

232
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,085
So Billy's fired the guy,
but he doesn't know...

233
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,796
whether to shit or wind his watch,
pardon my French.

234
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,759
Anyhow, I told him about
the job you're doing for us.

235
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,470
I know he'd love to talk to you.

236
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:18,265
It's got the beauty of Montana, but you
don't have to wait in the lift lines.

237
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,143
Oh, wow,
I can't tell you how flattering that is.

238
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,814
Remember, Kim's got her hands full
with Utah and Colorado.

239
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:30,110
As far as I'm concerned, she's proven
she can field whatever we throw at her.

240
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:34,114
Kevin, your faith in me is...
It's...

241
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:37,576
It means a lot, but when we first
started working together...

242
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,996
I promised you Mesa Verde
would be my sole focus, and I meant it.

243
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,790
- Sure, but I gotta...
- Hey, there.

244
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,250
- I thought I saw some familiar faces.
- Howard.

245
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,295
Kim, sit. I insist.

246
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,755
- Kevin.
- Howard.

247
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,049
Paige. Always wonderful to see you.

248
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:55,093
- You too, Howard. How have you been?
- Fantastic. Thank you.

249
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,095
All is well with the expansion?

250
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,224
You got that branch approved
on your original timeline after all.

251
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,351
We did, thanks to Ms Wexler here.

252
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,895
Kim's one of the best.
You're lucky to have her.

253
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,271
She sure is, we sure are.

254
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:09,233
Seems like just yesterday,
she was logging hours in doc review.

255
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,903
Always a pleasure to see
one of our protégés...

256
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,197
spread her wings
and leave the nest.

257
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,701
Well, I'll get out of your hair.
Best of luck to all of you.

258
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,662
You too, Howard.

259
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:26,959
I appreciate we got you all to ourselves,
Billy just needs a consultation.

260
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,586
I'm so sorry but...

261
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,505
Would you excuse me
for just a moment?

262
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,090
Sure.

263
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,323
I've had the salmon. If you like
sea scallops, they're fantastic.

264
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,201
- Kim, hello again.
- Howard, sit. I insist.

265
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,288
Sorry to interrupt.
I just needed to give Howard something.

266
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:11,128
Folks, this is Kim Wexler,
a former member of our firm.

267
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,422
Kim, this is the team
from O'Malley Industries.

268
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,048
Oh, of course. I remember Lauren.

269
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,551
Good to see you.
This is Jack Sweet, our new CFO.

270
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:18,719
- Hello.
- Pleasure.

271
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,387
Nice to see you too. Henry. Nick.

272
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:23,181
- Marie Austin. Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

273
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,851
Good to see all of you.

274
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,186
Have a wonderful lunch, Howard.

275
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,026
- Sorry to hold things up.
- Not at all.

276
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,070
Okay, Kevin, if you want to
give me Mr Gatwood's number...

277
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,114
I'd be happy to speak to him.

278
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,324
That's great.

279
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,661
Once I understand, I'll put him with
a firm that'll take very good care of him.

280
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,330
I leave it in your capable hands.

281
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,498
Great. Okay, Utah.

282
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,959
The good news is
the filing requirements...

283
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,879
are very similar to
what we submitted for Arizona.

284
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,633
Thanks again. I'll let Billy know
you'll be calling. We'll talk tee time soon.

285
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,009
- Sounds good.
- See you soon.

286
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,594
Bye.

287
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,596
Here.

288
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:13,190
- What the hell is this?
- I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

289
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,903
Look, Howard, you were very generous
when I left HHM.

290
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,155
It never sat right
that you covered my loans.

291
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,782
Seemed to sit right at the time.

292
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,953
I appreciate the gift, but now I'm able
to afford it, I wanna pay you back.

293
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,038
- Well, you appreciate the gift.
- Yes, I do.

294
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:31,667
You know what I'm doing in there?
Take a guess.

295
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,210
I'm doing damage control.

296
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:37,047
I'm doing it three meals a day for
the past two weeks with every client.

297
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,800
I am trying to repair
the reputation of the firm...

298
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,177
after you and Jimmy
dragged it through the mud.

299
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,513
I did everything in my power
to defend my client.

300
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,265
- Is that what you're calling it?
- That's the job, Howard.

301
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:52,229
It was very convenient for you to
ignore Chuck's illness when it suited you.

302
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:56,024
I take you out of the mailroom,
put you through law school, mentor you.

303
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:59,236
You leave and stab me in the back,
that's my fault? I'm not cashing this.

304
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,242
Kim, your debt is forgiven.

305
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,953
But anything else, that's on you.

306
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,872
All we did was show
the situation for what it is.

307
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,958
And if you're hiding that
from your clients...

308
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,210
well, Howard, that's on you.

309
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,741
- Nacho.
- Hey, Papa.

310
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,577
You're here early, son.

311
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:58,039
Yeah, thought
I'd get a jump on the invoices.

312
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:01,251
Nice to see you taking
an interest in the business.

313
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,795
I'm gonna start on the Continental.

314
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:08,049
Grab some of the golden doeskin
vinyl and give me a hand.

315
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,260
Yes, Papa, I'll be right there.

316
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,478
Blue shirt.

317
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,314
Yellow wall.

318
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,566
Silver door.

319
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:34,492
White sign.

320
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:36,578
Red pepper.

321
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,414
Purple sweater.

322
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,958
Brown wood.

323
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,668
Black mat.

324
00:25:57,224 --> 00:26:00,185
Jason to the front
for carryout assistance.

325
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,063
Jason to the front
for carryout assistance.

326
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,116
Yellow bananas.

327
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:16,576
Green grapes.

328
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:19,412
Orange oranges.

329
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:28,713
Excuse me,
where would I find the soy milk?

330
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,758
Over there and to the left,
just past the freezer aisle.

331
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,779
A white ceiling.

332
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,739
Green basket.

333
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:56,658
Grey floor.

334
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,728
- All set?
- Yeah.

335
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,771
Courier on the way?

336
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,565
- Twenty minutes.
- Great.

337
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:31,151
They'll need this back
at Gatwood Oil by EOD.

338
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,280
What's...?

339
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,248
Hey.

340
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:46,958
Hey.

341
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:53,631
What's up?

342
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,218
New guitar.

343
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,012
Check it out.

344
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,558
That is something.

345
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,643
I sold the rest of my ads.

346
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,212
That must be a relief.

347
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,481
They loved the response they got.

348
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,608
So impressed,
they threw in this baby.

349
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,985
Signed by the one and only
Ritchie Blackmore.

350
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:20,533
And lying on the floor helps you
with your fingering?

351
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,494
- I fell.
- What?

352
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,079
It was during productions.

353
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,247
Crazy stuff happens.

354
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:29,292
Long story. But the big picture...

355
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,419
I'm up one guitar.

356
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:32,879
When did this happen?

357
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:36,132
- Yesterday.
- I saw you yesterday. You were fine.

358
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,634
That was Tuesday.

359
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,929
You picked up clean clothes.
Remember?

360
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:44,307
Did you go to the doctor?

361
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:48,061
Oh, it's... it's not as bad as it looks.

362
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:49,354
I just need to rest it.

363
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:50,522
It'll be fine.

364
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:52,524
Look on the desk.

365
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,484
There's something for you.

366
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,946
Yeah, that.

367
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,156
Open it.

368
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,785
That's my half.

369
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:06,538
It's good for the next six weeks.

370
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:09,457
So at least we can stop
talking about that.

371
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,294
- Jimmy, I wasn't...
- Just take it so we're square, all right?

372
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,423
Okay.

373
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,092
Sorry.

374
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:23,471
Just, my back hurts like hell and...

375
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,640
People suck.

376
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,605
Jimmy, you...

377
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:36,776
You don't have to
push yourself like this.

378
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:42,073
You could rest.

379
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,325
Let your back heal.

380
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,744
Then go to community service
and get it over with.

381
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,455
Take some time.

382
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,290
Plan your next move.

383
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:51,666
Meaning...?

384
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,834
I'm saying...

385
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,712
I could cover
our expenses for a while.

386
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:57,672
- You got the cash in your hand.
- I know...

387
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,134
- Why are we talking about this?
- I looked at the numbers. I can carry us.

388
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:04,512
Not forever, but at least
until you're back to 100 percent.

389
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:07,307
I appreciate the thought, but no.

390
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,684
I'll do what I have to do
to take care of my half.

391
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:13,521
You do what you have to do
to take care of yours. End of story.

392
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:18,651
Okay.

393
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,825
I mean, you believe me, right?

394
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:28,953
Yes.

395
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,335
Feel better, Jimmy.

396
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:56,814
Francesca, is it too late
to get ahold of the courier?

397
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,733
I can call. Need to reschedule?

398
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,401
No, cancel it.

399
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,737
And get Billy Gatwood
on the phone for me.

400
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,948
- Will do.
- Thanks.

401
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,206
I've got Billy Gatwood on the line.

402
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,042
Great. Put him through.

403
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,631
Mr Gatwood? Hi, Kim Wexler.

404
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,050
Listen, I've been reviewing
your documents...

405
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:27,345
and I thought I might've had to
refer you to a colleague...

406
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:30,265
but I think I may have a solution
to your problem myself.

407
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,518
Do you think you have some time
this week we could sit down and talk?

408
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:39,857
- Chuck.
- Howard.

409
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,652
- What a nice surprise.
- I knocked, but there was no answer.

410
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:46,155
Thought you were asleep.
Figured I'd wait, in case...

411
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,491
- Are those groceries?
- They are.

412
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,952
I decided to go for a little walk.

413
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,379
That's great, Chuck.

414
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,789
- Why don't you come on in?
- Thank you.

415
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,542
To what do I owe the pleasure?

416
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,670
I wish it was a social call,
but unfortunately we have an issue...

417
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:03,423
- we need to discuss.
- What's that?

418
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,050
It concerns your
malpractice insurance.

419
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:07,927
There's...

420
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:11,514
Well, we should sit and talk it through.

421
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,283
You're good.

422
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,202
Cool.

423
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,871
See you, Nacho.

424
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,751
Don Hector.

425
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:36,951
What?

426
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:41,372
This one looks funny.

427
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:47,837
Bring it here.

428
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:05,021
You see? Is it fake?

429
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,653
No, it's fine.

430
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:19,535
I'm so sorry, Don Hector.

431
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:17,385
Carlos.

432
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:18,970
Nacho.

433
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:30,523
I'm heavy.

434
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:33,401
Took care of that problem over on Fifth.

435
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:37,405
- That crew won't bother us no more.
- Do me a favour. Shut up.

436
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:44,787
You're good.

437
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,455
Okay.

438
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:50,126
See you next week.

439
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:37,400
Don Hector, more espresso?

440
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,334
McGill.

441
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:39,754
Keep it moving.

442
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,431
Sir? Sir?

443
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,892
- What's up?
- Hey...

444
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:55,478
It's my kid. Her mom just called.

445
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,396
You're not supposed to be
on the phone.

446
00:39:57,563 --> 00:40:00,649
I know, I know, but she's sick.
She caught pneumonia at day care.

447
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,568
She's in the hospital. Please can I go?

448
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:04,904
Sure. You can go.
But you're not getting credit.

449
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:07,073
Come on, can't I just go
and come right back?

450
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,533
I have to get my hours done this week.

451
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,701
Judge says so.

452
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:12,620
Judge told you, huh?

453
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:14,872
Sounds like that's on you.

454
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:31,597
Hey, you wanna get out of here?
How much is it worth to you?

455
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:32,932
What?

456
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:34,809
To ditch this.

457
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,227
How much?

458
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,270
Leave me alone, yo.

459
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:41,107
Come on, you want to get
to your deal or what?

460
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,317
Hey, man,
I was trying to see my sick kid.

461
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:46,028
No, you're trying to sell something
you shouldn't have...

462
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,030
to someone
who shouldn't be buying it.

463
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:50,991
Hey, no judgements, all right?

464
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,284
Man's gotta make a living.

465
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:56,622
I'm just saying, the way you make yours
rhymes with mug mealer.

466
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:59,041
- What are you, a narc?
- I'm the guy...

467
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,418
who's gonna get you out
and keep your hours.

468
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:03,546
- Yeah. How you gonna do that?
- Yeah.

469
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:06,132
Let me worry about the how, okay?

470
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,716
Just...

471
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:10,344
Seven hundred bucks
and you're gone.

472
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,763
I don't have 700 bucks.

473
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,766
Yeah, you got a couple of grand
in your sock.

474
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:22,106
Seven hundred bucks,
and you can get me out of here?

475
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:27,528
All right. You can do it,
you got a deal.

476
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,072
Okay.

477
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,741
Go pick up trash. Go on.

478
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:52,178
What the hell's this?

479
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,682
Resting. I hurt my back.

480
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,809
Get up.

481
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:01,353
Nope. My back's killing me.

482
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,063
Suit yourself.

483
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,648
You're not getting your hours.

484
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:07,610
I'm pretty sure
you're gonna give me my hours.

485
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,278
Oh, yeah?

486
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,071
How do you figure that?

487
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:14,158
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna sue you.

488
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:18,704
Hate to break it to you, smart guy,
but you signed a waiver.

489
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:20,831
I signed a waiver with the city.

490
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:22,625
But I'm not suing the city.

491
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,835
I'm suing you. Personally.

492
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:29,757
You can't do that.

493
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:32,051
Buddy...

494
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:37,640
This is the land of the free
and home of the lawsuit.

495
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:39,308
I sure as shooting can.

496
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:40,726
You know what?

497
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:44,021
I think I'll bring that guy
in with me.

498
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:46,232
Make it a class action thing.

499
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:47,608
What's he got to do with it?

500
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:51,195
You knowingly prevented him
from visiting his child in the hospital.

501
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:55,574
If that isn't intentional infliction
of emotional distress, what is?

502
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:57,493
That's crazy.

503
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,994
Crazy hasn't even started.

504
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:02,831
I can also sue you for failure to approve
community service hours.

505
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:07,086
That's a direct violation of your duties
as an agent of the state of New Mexico.

506
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:08,671
I'm only doing my job.

507
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:12,132
And just for tickles,
maybe I throw in failure to treat...

508
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:14,677
and mitigate damages
suffered by me...

509
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,845
due to injuries sustained
under your watch.

510
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:18,430
- Injury?
- My back.

511
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,100
You're full of shit. The waiver clearly...

512
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:24,561
That waiver's gonna make
Swiss cheese look solid.

513
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:28,274
And in a personal lawsuit,
it's a fart in the wind.

514
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,361
You're never gonna win that.

515
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:34,280
Maybe. Maybe not.

516
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,740
In order to find out,
we gotta do some math.

517
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:39,660
Let's see, a lawyer's gonna cost you
about 90 bucks an hour.

518
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:43,372
You're looking at eight to 12 months
of litigation, minimum.

519
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,208
- I'll represent myself.
- Great.

520
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,002
Bring it on. You got a car?

521
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:49,962
You got a house? A pension?

522
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:52,047
Kiss it all goodbye.

523
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:54,550
Look, out here you might be
King Douche-nozzle.

524
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:58,887
But in court you are little people.

525
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:02,433
The judge and I, we'll gladly spend
the next five years in the courtroom.

526
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,103
But for you, it's expensive.
It's very, very expensive.

527
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,230
It's third mortgage expensive.

528
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:09,648
So...

529
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:12,401
I'm offering you a simple choice.

530
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:15,654
You go to your wife, explain that you're
about to lose your job...

531
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:18,824
your pension,
whatever pinhole of a reputation...

532
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:22,202
you've got at the bowling alley
on Glow-ball Sundays. Or...

533
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:25,372
let my friend here
visit his sick daughter in the hospital...

534
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:28,417
and you let me rest my back
on this sacred...

535
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:31,503
now litter-free, New Mexico soil.

536
00:44:31,879 --> 00:44:35,174
Oh, and we keep our hours.

537
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,098
Fine.

538
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:46,268
Asshole.

539
00:44:50,564 --> 00:44:52,358
Well, go on.

540
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:54,401
Get out of here.

541
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,030
Hey, man.

542
00:44:58,197 --> 00:45:01,450
That was some
Jedi mind shit right there.

543
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:09,708
Best 700 I have ever spent.

544
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,673
Here you go. I'm out.

545
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:23,680
Yeah, yeah.

546
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:25,766
Yo, I'm on my way. Yeah, yeah.

547
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:30,080
I've got a problem
I think you can help me with.

548
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:32,833
I've got cash I can't spend.

549
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:36,128
About $200,000.

550
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:40,716
If anything happens to me,
my family will never see it.

551
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:44,386
Now, it seems to me...

552
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:48,557
you opened this place
to solve a similar problem.

553
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,519
And you think that solution...

554
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:54,271
could be applied to you.

555
00:46:54,605 --> 00:46:56,356
As a one-time arrangement.

556
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:03,614
It would be unwise for us to be
publicly associated, wouldn't you agree?

557
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:06,783
Because of the Salamancas.

558
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,785
If they were to take notice...

559
00:47:09,286 --> 00:47:10,871
there would be consequences.

560
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:12,831
For both of us.

561
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:19,171
I'm thinking a paper transaction.

562
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,465
Even so.

563
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,970
Perhaps there is a way.

564
00:47:27,513 --> 00:47:31,934
One with a degree more difficulty.

565
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,061
But one I may be able to arrange.

566
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:39,733
Would 20 percent
overcome this difficulty?

567
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:44,154
I would not take money
from your family.
