1
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:37,247
You're back!

2
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:45,922
Hector!

3
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:48,466
Don Eladio.

4
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,765
Good, tell me.
What's your big news?

5
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,726
I bought a company.

6
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:58,893
Yes?

7
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,145
What kind of company?

8
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:01,604
Ice cream.

9
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,898
A beautiful factory in Michoacan.

10
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:08,570
Ximenez here, he was their driver.

11
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:11,531
Immigration wave him through every time.

12
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,158
Don Eladio, it's a pleasure.

13
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:17,203
Idiot, you don't talk unless spoken to.

14
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:20,165
Ximenez.

15
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,417
Nice to meet you.

16
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:29,257
Tell me something, it wouldn't occur
to you to run off with our stuff.

17
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:32,677
No. Never.

18
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:33,845
No, no, no.

19
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:35,430
Just teasing!

20
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:41,770
But with this one, you better be careful.
You had better behave.

21
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,606
Because he gives no second chances.

22
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,065
Understand?

23
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,862
What else?

24
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:54,491
A store, an ice cream shop
in Albuquerque.

25
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,285
Named it after you.

26
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,246
The Winking Greek.

27
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:03,249
What is that?

28
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:16,137
What is this?
Is that supposed to be me?

29
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,475
Sabrosito.

30
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:24,187
He's winking.

31
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:28,691
Ximenez, what do you say?

32
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,735
Does that look like me?

33
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:33,613
I don't...

34
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:35,448
No, of course not.

35
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:36,991
Because it's very fat, right?

36
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,159
Yes.

37
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:40,703
- Very chubby. I'm not that fat.
- No.

38
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,081
Very chubby.

39
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,667
So just the toy?

40
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,554
That I like!

41
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,724
Go on...

42
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,436
Hey, Bolsa!

43
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,481
Son of a bitch!

44
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:10,733
Don Eladio, so good to see you!

45
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,694
It's good, it's good.

46
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,821
Hector.

47
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:15,989
Bolsa.

48
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:18,408
What did you bring?

49
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,535
Nothing much.

50
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,208
Such fancy wrapping.

51
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,380
A T-shirt?

52
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,637
Los Pollos Hermanos.

53
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:42,515
Very nice, Bolsa.
Look, Hector!

54
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,517
Pollos Hermanos.

55
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,021
More like the Butt Brothers.

56
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:55,653
Over here!

57
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:57,655
What is this?

58
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:04,746
Over there.

59
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,211
What is this?

60
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:24,766
Gustavo sends his regards.

61
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:28,311
All of this from only one month?

62
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,105
He's a distribution genius.

63
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,066
See, Hector?

64
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,319
So neat and tidy.

65
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:44,702
I insist, from now on
everyone must bring it like this.

66
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,288
No more rubber bands.

67
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:51,918
He wanted to come himself,
pay his respects.

68
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:53,795
He promises soon.

69
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:57,674
Let him stay.

70
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,259
And keep doing whatever he's doing.

71
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:04,138
What do you think, Hector?
Look what Gustavo gave us.

72
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,350
It's impressive, no?

73
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:09,268
It's okay.

74
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:12,397
It's okay.

75
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:19,654
It seems to me someone
is a little jealous.

76
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:31,708
What's that you say, Sabrosito?
About Don Hector?

77
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:33,835
No.

78
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:40,341
Sabrosito tells me,
Gustavo's is bigger than yours.

79
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:43,344
Don't be like that.

80
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,974
No, say something nice, Sabrosito, please.

81
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,018
What? What?

82
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,602
Yes.

83
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,396
You see.

84
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:58,526
Sabrosito says, that yours is cute.

85
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:03,281
What? Is cute not good enough for you?

86
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:09,287
Hector, you're so serious. Very serious!

87
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:12,040
We're all friends here.

88
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:13,958
Let's go.

89
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,210
There is plenty of business
to do in the north.

90
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:17,462
Come.

91
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,590
Now then.

92
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,800
We'll eat some lunch.

93
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:27,930
Drink to your little shop.

94
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,187
Not a bad day's work, eh?

95
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:38,024
It's a good shirt, eh?

96
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,651
It fits well.

97
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:45,656
Inside, inside.

98
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,249
Hector.

99
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,959
You coming?

100
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,756
Don't insult him.

101
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:16,229
What're you looking at?

102
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:06,529
- Does he have a truck yet?
- No, but they're listening.

103
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,016
- Pop?
- Hey, honey.

104
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:37,518
Almost didn't recognise the number.

105
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,396
I'm sorry. They changed my hours
up at work.

106
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,481
I'm still getting used to it.

107
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,151
How are you two?

108
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:46,694
We're great.

109
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,321
Did it go okay?

110
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,488
Yeah, yeah.

111
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:53,117
Thanks to those movers you got,
all I had to do was watch.

112
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:55,661
And, Pop, this house...

113
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,166
- It's good?
- It's great.

114
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,751
Kaylee loves her new school.

115
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,461
The neighbourhood's friendly.

116
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,338
We feel safe.

117
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,923
That's good.

118
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,592
Mike, I don't know how to thank you.

119
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,928
Well, you don't have to.

120
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,764
I'm just glad you're enjoying it.

121
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,766
Do you want to come over for dinner?

122
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,852
- Tonight?
- Sure, I'm making lasagne.

123
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,021
There'll be plenty.

124
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,484
That's sweet,
but I don't want to put you out.

125
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:28,486
Pop-pop, come over.

126
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:31,280
There's someone
here who wants to see you.

127
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,714
Ice cream.

128
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,009
Oh, is she snoozing?

129
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,053
Close.

130
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,430
Ice cream?

131
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,934
I should have let well enough alone.

132
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,398
I'm good.

133
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,358
- You sure?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:08,526
I'll have his.

135
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,236
No. I don't think so.

136
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,114
- Maybe we can get a lift.
- Yeah.

137
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,540
Hey!

138
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:25,084
- What's the matter?
- Guys hanging around the truck.

139
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,295
- Air-raid warden?
- No, funny-looking guys.

140
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,880
- What you mean, funny looking?
- I mean funny looking.

141
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,048
Like fish.

142
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,050
Who are you kidding?
What do you mean, like fish?

143
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,553
- They got scales.
- Hey.

144
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:37,221
You okay?

145
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:40,891
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

146
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,519
Off a flying saucer! Off a Sputnik!

147
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,438
Oh, look, they've seen us!

148
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,649
- Let's get out of here!
- Things from outer space.

149
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,276
Off a flying saucer!

150
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,594
Hot sauce?

151
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,525
I can't have pico de gallo.
I'm really sorry about that.

152
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,153
Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.
May I take your order?

153
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:41,994
Oh, men's room is on the left.

154
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,914
Cabron, I need to see your boss.

155
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,292
Okay, well, I'm the assistant manager.

156
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,336
The manager's actually not here today.

157
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,255
Not the manager. The boss.

158
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,258
- You mean Mr Fring?
- Mr Fring.

159
00:11:57,385 --> 00:12:02,056
Well, he's not here at the moment. I'm sure
I could help you with whatever you need.

160
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,392
I need Fring.

161
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:08,771
Well, like I said he's not here,
and I don't really know when he'll be back.

162
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:09,939
I can take a message.

163
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:11,816
I'll wait.

164
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,153
You don't have to do that.

165
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:17,822
I'd be happy to take a message.

166
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,200
I'm sure Mr Fring wouldn't want
to keep you waiting.

167
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:28,499
Okay, sir, if you don't mind,
there are other customers.

168
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,463
Jeez, sorry about that.
Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.

169
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,758
- May I take your order?
- Yeah, can I get a 12-piece bucket...

170
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,844
with jumbo fries...

171
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,387
and...

172
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:44,056
- You said the 12-piece?
- Yeah, the 12-piece.

173
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:49,019
Excuse me, sir?
You can't light that in here.

174
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,563
Sir?

175
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,274
There's no smoking on the premises.

176
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:58,320
Please, sir, look at the signs. No fumar.

177
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,824
You can't, it's... it's health-code violation.

178
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,999
- Sir, it's employees only.
- We have to go, okay?

179
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,584
Let's go.

180
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:14,003
Sir?

181
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,763
Sir?

182
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:37,193
Sir, you're not allowed back here.

183
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,878
Gus Fring is a pillar
of our local business community.

184
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,297
Not just for underwriting our travel raffle...

185
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,925
but for making the best damn chicken
in town.

186
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,345
- Gus.
- Thank you.

187
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:05,804
Thank you.

188
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:11,393
Well, gentlemen, ladies, I hope to never
need your services, no offence.

189
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,063
But if I ever did, it's good to know that...

190
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:33,582
Yes?

191
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,095
I'll be right there.

192
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,913
I want you all to go home now.

193
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,166
You will be compensated
for your full shifts.

194
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:18,335
Normal schedule tomorrow.

195
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,133
Go, now.

196
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,261
We are closed for today.

197
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:39,607
Mr Fring, you sure you want
to be left with these guys?

198
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,275
I'm fine, Lyle. You go home.

199
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,610
Should I call someone?

200
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,520
No.

201
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,572
That will not be necessary, truly.

202
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,240
You sure?

203
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,867
Please do as I ask.

204
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:51,744
I'll see you tomorrow.

205
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,173
He's waiting in the office.

206
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,176
I know where he is.

207
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,766
Don Hector.

208
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,226
Took you long enough.

209
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,032
Don Hector...

210
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:33,786
mine is a cartel business.

211
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:35,162
But...

212
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,289
it is mine.

213
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,708
And it is legitimate.

214
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,878
My employees are civilians.

215
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,131
Your actions here today
have endangered them...

216
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:50,344
my interests, and those of the cartel.

217
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,431
I am the cartel.

218
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,142
And from now on, you are my mule.

219
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,312
You are going to bring my product north.

220
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:19,164
I understand that your supply line
has been compromised.

221
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,126
And this is most unfortunate.

222
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,752
However, my trucks...

223
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,880
are already at maximum capacity.

224
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,590
Make room.

225
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:33,971
Don Hector. You must understand
that I answer to Juan Bolsa.

226
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,140
You want to cry to Bolsa?

227
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,725
Cry to Bolsa.

228
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,143
Or, hell, Eladio.

229
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:47,359
Adding more product will threaten
the reliability of the entire operation.

230
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,445
May I ask...

231
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,532
did Don Eladio approve this?

232
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:59,371
I approve this.

233
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,717
You're doing it.

234
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,080
You gonna let me out of here?

235
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,416
Hello?

236
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,801
Tell him we're square.

237
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:18,969
What?

238
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,554
No.

239
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,684
Excuse me, everyone.

240
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,812
Could you all please take a moment
and join me out here?

241
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,730
Please, come.

242
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,361
Come, come, come.

243
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,622
I would...

244
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:15,377
I would like to apologise
to each and every one of you...

245
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:19,589
who, yesterday, had to endure
the behaviour of those men.

246
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,678
It was unacceptable.

247
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,724
Despite the difficult circumstances...

248
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,145
you all acquitted yourselves impeccably.

249
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,480
That said...

250
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:40,360
if any of you wish to seek counselling
due to lingering trauma...

251
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:45,240
speak with me privately
and it will be arranged.

252
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:50,287
Also, you will all be receiving 24 hours
of overtime...

253
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,289
as I am sure in one way or another...

254
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:55,292
each of you brought
this incident home with you.

255
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:57,127
Yes, Lyle?

256
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,171
Mr Fring...

257
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,965
who were those guys?

258
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,762
Well, as some of you know...

259
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,180
many years ago...

260
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:12,476
I opened my first Los Pollos Hermanos
in Michoacan.

261
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,521
Shortly thereafter...

262
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,901
those same men showed up.

263
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:23,945
They wanted money.

264
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,697
And I...

265
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,115
I'm...

266
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,034
I'm ashamed to say that...

267
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,620
I paid them.

268
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,374
You see, in that place, at that time...

269
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:41,463
if I wished to conduct my business,
I had no choice.

270
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,924
But yesterday...

271
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:50,222
Yesterday, they came here.

272
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,475
Here.

273
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,105
They intimidated my customers.

274
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:01,024
They threatened my employees.

275
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,026
And again...

276
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,571
they wanted money.

277
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,323
Now, my friends...

278
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,076
I must confess...

279
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:14,454
that I almost gave them
what they wanted.

280
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:17,833
Then I thought, no.

281
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,709
No.

282
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:23,296
This is America.

283
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:27,926
Here, the righteous have no reason to fear.

284
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,513
Here, those men have no power.

285
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,683
And when they saw
that I had no fear of them...

286
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,479
they ran, like the cowards they are,
back across the border.

287
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,692
They will not return.

288
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,028
We will move on from this.

289
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,197
My friends...

290
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,284
I promise you...

291
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,538
that together...

292
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,373
we will prosper.

293
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,834
All right.

294
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,092
Yes, hi. I'm still here.

295
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:11,636
Really? You sure...

296
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,305
Sure. Gotcha.

297
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,223
Sorry for bothering you.

298
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:24,024
Hi, I'm calling because we had
an appointment with you guys for...

299
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,768
I think Wednesday?

300
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:30,363
I'll be honest with you, I can barely
read my own darn handwriting.

301
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:31,948
My mistake.

302
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:33,700
Okay. Have a nice day.

303
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:41,750
Hello, I'm calling to confirm
an appointment for Charles McGill.

304
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,377
Yes, it's 215 San Cristobal Road.

305
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,172
McGill, with an M.

306
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,882
A door.

307
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,259
Okay, I thought it was you guys.

308
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:52,719
Guess I was wrong.

309
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:53,887
Thanks anyway.

310
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:58,975
Hi, I'm calling about an appointment
for Charles McGill.

311
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,519
Well, that's why I'm calling.

312
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:06,191
I think it's for this week, but, good
thing my head's attached to my neck.

313
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,859
San Cristobal, that's right.

314
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,736
Yes, that's it.

315
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,863
Two-thirty tomorrow?

316
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,448
Great.

317
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:17,118
So we're gonna need to cancel that.

318
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:18,578
Yeah.

319
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:19,996
I will.

320
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,289
Thank you.

321
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:22,582
Bye.

322
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,922
Oh, poor Frisky.

323
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,299
Well, Pomeranians can be difficult.

324
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:32,968
All that hair.

325
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,552
I know.

326
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:38,223
So, Mrs Vallance,
does Thursday 11:30 work?

327
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,892
That's right, 11:30. I'll make sure...

328
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,519
No.

329
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:43,728
Really?

330
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,856
Martin's Handyman and Repair,
2:30 tomorrow.

331
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:50,235
Thank you. How many calls did that take?

332
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,737
I lost track. Is that it?

333
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,865
Yeah, I'm nearly done. I'm just...

334
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,076
giving it a remorse pass.

335
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,829
Remorse is important.

336
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:09,421
Destroyed property.

337
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:15,385
I'd try damaged the victim's property...

338
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,388
instead of destroyed.
See if you can't get away with that.

339
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:19,973
Yeah.

340
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,147
Boom.

341
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,649
Yeah, that's nice.

342
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,652
I mean it, by the way.

343
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,195
What?

344
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:36,990
Thank you.

345
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,659
Seriously.

346
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:43,121
You're welcome, seriously.

347
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,083
I better get back to it.

348
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,668
Yeah.

349
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:50,837
Are you...?

350
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,213
You're...

351
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,091
absolutely sure
you got the right guy for this?

352
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,637
The crème de la crème.

353
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:30,877
Martin's Repair?

354
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:33,213
- Yeah. Mr McGill?
- Good afternoon.

355
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:36,257
If you don't mind wiping your shoes.

356
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:39,803
It's this way.

357
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,519
Mind the step here.

358
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,188
As you'll see, the frame is boarded over...

359
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:53,400
but the door itself is intact.

360
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,194
The damage is mainly
to the door jamb and casing.

361
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,321
There's another step up here.

362
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:11,876
Break-in?

363
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:13,586
That's right.

364
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:19,509
Went after your copper wire,
from the look of it.

365
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:26,057
There was a time, remember,
when we could leave our doors unlocked.

366
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:27,809
I certainly do.

367
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:29,769
Yeah.

368
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:33,106
- Where do I plug in?
- You don't.

369
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:36,067
- No?
- No. Didn't you...?

370
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,279
I believe my assistant was very clear
with your dispatcher.

371
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:42,282
No electricity due to a condition
that was explained...

372
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,867
in some detail.

373
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,204
No problem.

374
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,914
Good thing I charged my battery.

375
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,917
I'd be going at it like
Fred Flintstone otherwise.

376
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,171
I'm sorry.

377
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:59,924
I'm sorry. I understood there would
be no power tools of any kind.

378
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:02,177
What, a screwdriver and a hammer?

379
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:04,095
Turns a morning job into two days...

380
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:06,473
with me, myself, and Ben-Gay.

381
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:09,025
But it's your call.

382
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,438
I suppose.

383
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,357
Very well.

384
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:29,162
You seem to be making fast work of it.

385
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,455
Good.

386
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:32,165
It's good.

387
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,668
Okay, what I'll do, I think, is...

388
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:13,558
Very good.

389
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,852
Yeah.

390
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,146
Nice.

391
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,398
Great.

392
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:21,566
Yep. Nice.

393
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:25,069
At some point, we should probably
discuss the rule of thirds...

394
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:27,697
but otherwise, these...

395
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:35,121
A gas lantern sitting on a stack
of frigging Financial Times.

396
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,748
Now, that tells a whole story.

397
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,875
These are museum-quality.

398
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:44,130
You, my friend, are the Ansel Adams
of covert photography.

399
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:47,216
And that other thing?

400
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,190
How'd you get it?

401
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,984
Address book on his desk.

402
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,487
Right.

403
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,240
So...

404
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,993
what'd you think of him?

405
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:17,080
I mean, speak freely.
You couldn't possibly offend me.

406
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,957
He's a bit of a prick, right?

407
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,170
Nothing?

408
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:25,421
Seriously?

409
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:28,007
All right.

410
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,468
Can't even dish the dirt with this guy.

411
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:33,346
Isn't our business concluded?

412
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,306
Yeah. Even Steven.

413
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:39,477
- I mean, you did fix the door, right?
- Yeah.

414
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:41,854
You did a reasonably good job of it?
Otherwise...

415
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,856
He won't be grumbling to anyone.

416
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,733
That's all I'm asking.

417
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,860
I did it right.

418
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:49,696
Thank you.

419
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:54,158
Nice to fix something for once.

420
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:59,622
Well, if that's how you feel
I've got a leaky toilet back at the office.

421
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,374
All right.

422
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,794
If you ever need anything from my end...

423
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,424
Hasta luego.

424
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:16,180
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

425
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:45,918
May we talk?

426
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:51,174
You can park it over there.

427
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,532
You sent back the payment
we agreed upon.

428
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,954
What I did, I didn't do for you.

429
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,835
The man.

430
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:31,798
The one killed for helping the truck driver.

431
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:36,511
If I may make an observation...

432
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:40,932
perhaps you were trying to correct
something which cannot be corrected.

433
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:46,270
It's not the kind of thing
I want to take money for.

434
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:47,939
But the fact remains...

435
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:51,067
that your actions benefited me
more than you can know.

436
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,069
That's your business.

437
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:57,406
I'm just glad to have Salamanca
out of my head.

438
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,413
Well, perhaps in the future...

439
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:07,375
you will consider working for me.

440
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,386
Could be.

441
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,013
That'd depend on the work.

442
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,822
Would you care to know why...

443
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:40,616
I stopped you from killing Hector?

444
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:44,287
Like you said, it wasn't in your interest.

445
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:50,668
A bullet to the head
would have been far too humane.

446
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:40,051
Jimmy.

447
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:41,802
Howard.

448
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:56,317
Jimmy.

449
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,379
Howard.

450
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,589
- Kim.
- Chuck.

451
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:20,341
Kim.

452
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:54,291
Good afternoon.

453
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:57,294
Good.

454
00:38:57,628 --> 00:39:00,131
- Mr McGill, does this work for you?
- It'll have to do.

455
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,632
Thank you.

456
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:05,845
I assume everyone left their cell phones
and so on at reception.

457
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:07,263
Yes, indeed.

458
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,891
And you'll let me know
if you need a break or anything else.

459
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,518
I will. Thank you, Ms Hay.

460
00:39:12,727 --> 00:39:14,270
Well...

461
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:18,274
I was actually speaking
to my husband about your condition.

462
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:19,817
Oh, yes?

463
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:24,280
I had an aunt. She's no longer with us.
She went to church every Sunday, but...

464
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:27,992
when the boys' choir sang,
she would absolutely have to leave.

465
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,371
Something about the frequency
of their voices really did a number on her.

466
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:34,707
- Well, that is a shame.
- Indeed.

467
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,543
All right.

468
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,963
Let's get down to it.

469
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:47,511
We are here to finalise the pre-prosecution
diversion for James Morgan McGill.

470
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:51,140
Representing the divertee,
Ms Kimberly Wexler.

471
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:53,517
Mr James McGill has signed a contract...

472
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,686
waiving his rights to a speedy trial...

473
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:59,273
and presentment of his case
within the statute of limitations.

474
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,442
The terms of the deal are for you,
James...

475
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:03,986
to report to your
pre-prosecution service officer...

476
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:06,280
at the Albuquerque
District Attorney's Office...

477
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:09,992
on the second Monday of every month
for the next 12 months.

478
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:13,829
Community service hours
will be assigned.

479
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,332
You must maintain lawful employment.

480
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:19,668
You must only associate
with law-abiding citizens.

481
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:24,173
Your client understands that if he
violates the terms of the agreement...

482
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,719
or is arrested for any infraction the
crimes to which he has confessed here...

483
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:31,388
will be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law...

484
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:34,308
- in addition to any new charges.
- He understands.

485
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:38,145
And I must inform you, Mr McGill,
as an officer of the court...

486
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:39,980
and member of the bar...

487
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:44,443
your confession will be referred
to the New Mexico Bar Association.

488
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,822
Okay, I have your statement here.

489
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,449
Has everyone had a chance to read it?

490
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:52,201
Comments? Thoughts?

491
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,120
Actually, page two.

492
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,831
He damaged the victim's property.

493
00:40:56,997 --> 00:41:01,502
Would it not be more accurate to say
destroyed a cassette tape?

494
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:03,963
I'm sorry. Wasn't the cassette tape
his property?

495
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,965
- Of course.
- Then it seems accurate...

496
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:08,134
to say he damaged the victim's property.

497
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,301
Why be vague?

498
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:12,471
And damaged doesn't reflect
its irrevocable condition.

499
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,267
- Fine. Damaged property of victim.
- It was a cassette tape.

500
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:18,686
That's what it was.
Not a teacup. Not a chair.

501
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:20,855
A cassette tape.

502
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:24,316
Destroyed item of personal property?

503
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:25,943
All right.

504
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:30,072
We'd suggest
destroyed item of personal property.

505
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,907
Ms Wexler?

506
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:33,742
Works for us.

507
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,536
Shall I change it, or...?

508
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:36,912
If you would.

509
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:48,883
Destroyed item of personal property.

510
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:50,301
There.

511
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,761
Can you initial it, please?

512
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,556
J-M-M.

513
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:57,433
Initialled.

514
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:03,689
Charles, was there anything else you
found wanting in your brother's statement?

515
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:06,442
No.

516
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,068
We're satisfied. Thank you.

517
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:13,240
All right, so we're all set?

518
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,075
No, not all set, Mr McGill.

519
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:18,162
Your brother may be satisfied,
but I am not.

520
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:23,959
The confession you've written is adequate,
but frankly, I sense a lack of remorse.

521
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:27,254
And I, for one,
would like to hear an apology.

522
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:30,007
Charles deserves at least that much.

523
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:35,638
- Now?
- Yes, Mr McGill, now.

524
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,435
Okay.

525
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:43,938
I was wrong...

526
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:47,608
Mr McGill, could you at least
look your brother in the eye?

527
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,911
Chuck...

528
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:02,915
I'm very sorry.

529
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:06,627
I lost my temper and I did some things...

530
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:09,964
so many things that I regret.

531
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:14,343
I shouldn't have broken down your door.

532
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:18,514
Doesn't matter how I was provoked.

533
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:21,976
I shouldn't have done that.
There's no excuse for that...

534
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:25,854
or for the things that I said.

535
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,565
I regret it all.

536
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:31,777
All of it, more than you can imagine...

537
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:33,821
because...

538
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:36,657
because you're my brother...

539
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:41,328
and no one should treat
his own brother like that.

540
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,539
Not ever.

541
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,835
Okay?

542
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:51,338
All right then.

543
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,090
On to the matter of restitution.

544
00:43:53,257 --> 00:43:57,011
Mr McGill, according to your agreement,
you have two weeks to pay your brother...

545
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:59,596
I would like to pay up now, if I may?

546
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:01,348
You may.

547
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:04,810
The amount is $321.

548
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:06,979
Ms Hay, I'm sorry.

549
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:09,982
That figure doesn't represent
a full accounting.

550
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:14,695
- Oh, no?
- I believe the correct amount is $323.98.

551
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:17,948
That includes the cassette tape...

552
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:19,450
which was destroyed.

553
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:20,659
Good. Thank you.

554
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:24,038
Three hundred twenty-three dollars
and 98 cents...

555
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:27,833
including the cassette tape.

556
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:51,148
What do you say we get you home?

557
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,735
Howard. Chuck.

558
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:57,613
I'm putting you both on notice
regarding the bar hearing.

559
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:00,115
First, I'm filing a motion
to suppress that tape.

560
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:02,951
The tape that Jimmy destroyed,
you mean.

561
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:06,121
How about we stop with the games?
No way there isn't a duplicate.

562
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,456
Really?

563
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:09,041
Of course there is.

564
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:12,503
You knew Jimmy was gonna break in.
You wanted him to.

565
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:16,048
There's no way you'd let him destroy
the only copy. You made a duplicate.

566
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:18,258
- It's the first thing you did.
- Kim.

567
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:19,927
This is not how we do discovery.

568
00:45:20,094 --> 00:45:23,305
Actually, Jimmy destroyed the duplicate.

569
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:25,557
It's fine, Howard.

570
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:29,728
The original is under lock and key, and in
due time, it will be put into evidence...

571
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:31,313
for your review.

572
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,608
So of course, file whatever motions
you'd like. It's your privilege.

573
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:37,403
- I will. Count on it.
- But, Kim...

574
00:45:37,611 --> 00:45:41,740
you should be aware, because I believe
this will be your first disciplinary hearing...

575
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:44,743
the Bar Association's standard of proof...

576
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,496
is far more lenient
than what you're used to.

577
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:51,708
Motions aside, that tape will be played.

578
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:53,961
Chuck?

579
00:45:54,128 --> 00:45:55,170
See you, Kim.

580
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:19,403
Well?

581
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,365
What?

582
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:25,576
Bingo.
