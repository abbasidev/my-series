1
00:00:04,673 --> 00:00:10,887
It was very still, except for the tree toads
and frogs in the brook, peeping.

2
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:17,811
And every little while, Mabel could hear
strange rustlings in the leaves.

3
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:21,898
She tried to remember the way home,
but the woods looked so different now.

4
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:27,362
She couldn't think which way to go.
She began to be frightened.

5
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:29,447
What's that?, said Mabel.

6
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:31,950
Oh, I'm so frightened.

7
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:35,412
In a minute or two,
she heard the howl again.

8
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:41,292
A long, wild cry.

9
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:46,381
She began to run,
but the poor thing had lost her way.

10
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:48,466
Is she gonna be okay?

11
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,511
- She'll be fine, Jimmy.
- How do you know?

12
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:55,181
Just listen. You'll see.

13
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:01,438
It was so dark that she stumbled over
the bushes and the roots...

14
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:30,175
Okay. I gotta go down.

15
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:36,890
Kim.

16
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:44,939
I know.

17
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:51,529
Does she need to spend the night?

18
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:54,532
Once this is done, she'll be discharged.

19
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:58,828
Good.

20
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:55,468
Lawsuits. Threats. Recriminations.

21
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:58,805
This is a situation
no firm ever wants to be in.

22
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:01,766
It's... Well, it's embarrassing.

23
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:06,396
I know we all want a swift resolution here.

24
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,940
So, what are our options?

25
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:12,110
Take it to trial. Expensive.

26
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:15,613
And extremely damaging
for HHM's reputation.

27
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,868
Not my first choice, or yours, I imagine.

28
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:23,204
The firm could choose to buy me out...

29
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:26,958
for an amount that is almost certain
to bankrupt it.

30
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,879
I spent decades building this firm.

31
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:34,090
I don't want to be the agent
of its destruction.

32
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:38,136
There is a third option.

33
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:43,391
There's no reason we can't
put all this unpleasantness behind us...

34
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:46,436
and continue on as we have been.

35
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:49,939
I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

36
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,275
And if you agree...

37
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:57,280
I think we can settle all this right now
with a simple handshake.

38
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,327
Would you all give us the room
for a moment?

39
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,182
Seventeen years.

40
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,518
Eighteen in July, actually.

41
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:32,106
All those years
we built this place together.

42
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:36,277
And all that time I've supported you...

43
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,781
looked up to you, deferred to you.

44
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:45,578
Because I always thought you had
the best interests of the firm in mind.

45
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,222
I have.

46
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,791
You did.

47
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,709
For a long time.

48
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:55,129
But you've let personal vendettas
turn your focus away...

49
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,841
from what's best for HHM.
You've put your needs first.

50
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,678
- To our detriment.
- I don't think that's accurate.

51
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,847
And the moment that I mildly suggest,
with empathy and concern...

52
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:08,309
that maybe it's time for you
to consider retirement...

53
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,438
the first instinct you have
is to sue me?

54
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,233
To sue the firm?

55
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,819
Well, I...

56
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,989
I don't even know...

57
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:26,411
In what world is that anything
but the deepest betrayal...

58
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,539
of everything we worked
so hard to accomplish?

59
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:32,709
In what world is that anything but
the deepest betrayal of our friendship?

60
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,961
I could argue that you're the one
who betrayed me.

61
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,671
That's bullshit.

62
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,506
And you know it.

63
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,636
This is pointless.

64
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,767
Here. Just take this.

65
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,856
Three million dollars?

66
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:58,026
The first of three payments,
as per the partnership agreement.

67
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,237
The firm can't afford this. Are you...?

68
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:05,700
- You're not shutting down, are you?
- I would never endanger the firm.

69
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,995
This is mostly from my personal funds.

70
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:11,080
And a few loans.

71
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:17,462
You're paying me
out of your own pocket?

72
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:23,468
You won.

73
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,522
There's one last thing.

74
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,839
Everybody.

75
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:07,011
Thank you for gathering.
I have some bittersweet news to share.

76
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:10,473
I'm sorry to say, but our fearless leader,
Charles McGill...

77
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,476
will be leaving HHM,
effective immediately.

78
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:16,104
I wanted to take this moment
to thank Chuck...

79
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,481
for everything he's done for HHM.

80
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,691
We started off with six employees...

81
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,612
and Chuck helped grow us into
one of the largest firms in the state.

82
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,616
We will be forever grateful
for his dedication.

83
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:32,745
Do you have anything
you want to say?

84
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,628
All right then. Let's give him a hand.

85
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,826
Hey.

86
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,870
Morning.

87
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,413
Close.

88
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:05,796
Gatorade. You need electrolytes.

89
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,930
You hungry?

90
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,517
I'll make you something.

91
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,979
Be right back. Finish that.

92
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,656
Hey.

93
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,826
I said I'd bring it to you.

94
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,828
I needed to stretch my legs.

95
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,914
Sit. Eggs.

96
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,632
- This is twisted.
- Oh, thanks.

97
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:56,514
This one-handed crap
is gonna get real old, real fast.

98
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,812
Is there coffee?

99
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:06,148
Sure. But more Gatorade first.

100
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:17,660
All right, your two options are...

101
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:21,872
good old ibuprofen, which, yeah,
should take the edge off...

102
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,583
or the proverbial good stuff.

103
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,965
The answer is always the good stuff.

104
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,426
All right, but food first.

105
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:56,073
You're not feeding me, Jimmy.

106
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,200
There are lines we do not cross.

107
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:09,170
I was looking into
our lease on the office.

108
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:11,672
We'd definitely take a haircut
if we broke it.

109
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,842
But we are allowed to sublet.
Might be our best option.

110
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,303
The furniture's mostly rented
month to month...

111
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,804
so that's not an issue.

112
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:24,393
For you, I think you need a desk,
some file cabinets.

113
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,187
A Westlaw terminal.

114
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:31,817
And I haven't figured out Francesca yet,
that's another conversation.

115
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,987
All that sound okay?

116
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,116
Are you sure about this?

117
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,370
I mean,
even with the Sandpiper money?

118
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,537
Look...

119
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:49,210
after everything...

120
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,673
I don't give a shit about the office.

121
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,226
So can I start looking for a tenant?

122
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:08,646
Yeah. Yeah.

123
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:25,079
- I could've killed someone, Jimmy.
- Yeah. Yourself.

124
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:31,377
I worked most of the last week
on maybe six hours of sleep, and then I...

125
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:36,924
I crossed three lanes of traffic
and I don't remember any of it.

126
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:40,803
Look, you were just doing
what you thought you had to do.

127
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,680
Because of me.

128
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:45,057
You didn't make me get in that car.
That was all me.

129
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,229
I'm an adult. I made a choice.

130
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,704
Hey.

131
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:13,627
All I can say is, I am gonna fix things.

132
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,455
Okay, so we're gonna
do everything around back.

133
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:54,126
It's mostly commercial around here,
so it's quiet at night.

134
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:57,046
We pull the trucks up to the doors,
we unload right into the shop.

135
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,758
We can break down the stuff in here.

136
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:05,554
There's space in the back
for storing scales and supplies...

137
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,139
when the shop's open.

138
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:10,351
Should be able
to process everything overnight.

139
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:15,272
- I'll be here to see it gets done right.
- Where's, eh, Papi?

140
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,985
I'll be taking care of all this.
But he's good.

141
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:24,490
Once we get everything packed,
Arturo will pick up and supervise distro...

142
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,950
make sure everything's clear.

143
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,911
Here's Papi.

144
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,716
Don Hector.

145
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,220
This is my father, Manuel.
Dad, Don Hector Salamanca.

146
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,564
Relax. We're friends.

147
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,630
Better?

148
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,138
Please, get out of my store.

149
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,307
Dad, please.

150
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,893
Don Hector is being very generous.
Don't be disrespectful.

151
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,991
Think about Aunt Rosa and the twins.

152
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,746
Mama's family in Galeana.

153
00:15:58,334 --> 00:15:59,835
Please.

154
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:33,327
He's old-fashioned. He'll come around.

155
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,293
Don Hector.

156
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:49,176
I'll talk to him. He'll come around.

157
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,722
I don't trust him.

158
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,233
These are from Kevin and Paige.

159
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,069
Well, I guess they're from everybody
at Mesa Verde.

160
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:10,614
And there's a card
somewhere in here.

161
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,324
Here.

162
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:16,620
- You brought the book?
- Sure.

163
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,294
Mr Gatwood.

164
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:28,716
The card wasn't clear, but I'm pretty sure
you're getting steaks too.

165
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,000
- Really?
- Texas.

166
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,214
He wishes you a speedy recovery.

167
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,854
You are so lucky.

168
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,734
I used to drive that highway
every weekend...

169
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,736
to visit my brother and his kids...

170
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:52,114
and I saw an accident
almost every single time.

171
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:56,452
People die on that road all the time.

172
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,876
I already rescheduled
everything you had this week.

173
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,754
But I didn't touch that meeting
with the regulator.

174
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,007
I know that whole Utah timeline
is delicate.

175
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,134
- All right. It's next Wednesday, right?
- Yes.

176
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,094
There's a lot of prep that we pushed...

177
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,389
so you could focus on getting
Mr Gatwood up by the end of the quarter.

178
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,016
Which isn't happening now.

179
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,185
Actually, I talked with Colleen...

180
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,521
and she said everyone's fine
doing that meeting Monday.

181
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:28,984
So, you know,
that means we could still slide in...

182
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,069
just under the deadline.

183
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,867
Did you bring a breakdown
of the documents I'll need?

184
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,244
- I would have to figure out...
- Yep.

185
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,163
how long that'll take me.

186
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,921
That's a quarter to 6, 7...

187
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,298
Go to 11.

188
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:09,191
I found it. Here you go.
And Paige's timeline's on the top.

189
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,527
Kim?

190
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,572
You okay? I can always come back.

191
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm gonna need you to cancel Gatwood
and push everything else.

192
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,455
- What? Everything?
- Yeah. Everything.

193
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:27,459
- Okay.
- But first, could you give me a ride?

194
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:31,213
Absolutely. Where to?

195
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,757
Ms Wexler sends her apologies,
Mr Gatwood.

196
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:37,553
And she feels terrible about this,
but with her accident and the recovery...

197
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:41,139
she's just not gonna be able
to finish her work for you in time.

198
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,727
Oh, of course, I'll tell her.
And again, she is very sorry...

199
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:49,147
and I know she'll be giving you
a call herself soon.

200
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,776
Well, yes.
Ms Wexler did ask me to tell you...

201
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,195
she strongly recommends
Schweikart & Cokely.

202
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,447
They're an exceptional firm.

203
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:01,493
Okay.
Well, I will send that info over today...

204
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,538
and Ms Wexler
will follow up herself shortly.

205
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:08,584
- Thanks for the meat.
- And she says thank you for the steaks.

206
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,053
She's so excited to fire up that grill.

207
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,964
Thank you. Bye.

208
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,883
Okay, how many do I have?

209
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,718
Nine.

210
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,219
Good.

211
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,680
It's Jimmy.

212
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:08,185
I know you don't wanna see me,
but I just want to know you're okay.

213
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,441
Come on, Chuck.
I just want to see your face.

214
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,488
Come on, Chuck. I just need a minute.
I just need to know you're all right.

215
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,367
I'm all right, Jimmy.

216
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:25,077
Hey. Good.

217
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:28,372
I'm glad you're all right. I...

218
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,084
Can I come in? Talk for a minute?

219
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:18,505
As you can see, I'm more than all right.

220
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,841
I'm very well, in fact.

221
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,395
How...?

222
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:37,399
I always told you I'd get better.
You just never believed me.

223
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,360
Sure I did.

224
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:47,034
But, Chuck, this is great.

225
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,537
How did you do it?

226
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:54,458
What was it you wanted?
Beyond proof of life?

227
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,799
Something happened...

228
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:07,304
and it made me think about
what went down between you and me.

229
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,680
And...

230
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:15,312
So I wanted to say, in hindsight,
I could've made different choices.

231
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,439
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

232
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:21,610
I mean, I'm not saying it's all on me.
It's not.

233
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:24,780
But if I had to do it all over again...

234
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:29,743
I would maybe do some things
differently.

235
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,370
And I just thought
you should know that.

236
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,248
That you have regrets?

237
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,435
Yeah. I have regrets.

238
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,380
Why?

239
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:48,095
Well, because you're my brother.

240
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,473
There aren't that many
of us McGills left...

241
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,392
and I think we should stick together.

242
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,106
No. Why have regrets at all?
What's the point?

243
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,275
- What do you mean?
- Well, look at you.

244
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,319
You're in so much pain.

245
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,280
Why are you putting yourself
through all this?

246
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:10,367
- Because I wanted to tell you...
- That you have regrets.

247
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:14,830
And I'm telling you don't bother.
What's the point?

248
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,916
- You're just gonna keep hurting people.
- That's not true.

249
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,960
Jimmy, this is what you do.

250
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:23,463
You hurt people.
Over and over and over.

251
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,924
And then there's this show of remorse.

252
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,593
- It's not a show.
- I know you don't think it's a show.

253
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,054
I don't doubt your emotions are real...

254
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:35,183
but what's the point of all the sad faces
and the gnashing of teeth?

255
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,186
If you're not going to change
your behaviour, and you won't...

256
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:42,315
- I can change...
- why not just skip the whole exercise?

257
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:46,903
In the end,
you're gonna hurt everyone around you.

258
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,699
You can't help it.
So stop apologising and accept it.

259
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,576
Embrace it.

260
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:55,370
Frankly, I'd have more respect for you
if you did.

261
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,123
What about you, Chuck?

262
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:01,001
You didn't do anything wrong?

263
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:02,711
You're just an innocent victim?

264
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:05,547
Let me put your mind at ease, Jimmy.

265
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,300
You don't have to make up with me.

266
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:11,553
We don't have to understand
each other.

267
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,598
Things are fine the way they are.

268
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,393
Hey.

269
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,482
I don't want to hurt your feelings...

270
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:30,363
but the truth is you've never mattered
all that much to me.

271
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:04,874
Gold comforter. Green chair.

272
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,710
Brown journal.

273
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,721
Jimmy. What a nice surprise.

274
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,808
Irene, as beautiful as ever.

275
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,102
Why don't you come in?

276
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,145
Can I get you some tea?

277
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,939
Oh, I don't want to be a bother.

278
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:53,733
I just have a couple things to drop off.

279
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,360
What is all this?

280
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:58,988
Well, when we win, we celebrate.

281
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,449
That's very sweet.

282
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,827
Yes, and I didn't forget
about Oscar and Felix.

283
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:08,498
I've got some kitty toys and catnip
in there for those two little rascals.

284
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:12,043
- You shouldn't have, Jimmy.
- Of course I should.

285
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,003
Now, have you given any thought...

286
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,798
to how you wanna spend
that settlement money?

287
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:20,218
I don't know.

288
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,053
I can tell you what I'd do.

289
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,013
Alaskan cruise.

290
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,810
You can walk on a glacier
under the Aurora Borealis.

291
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:36,609
And if Alaska's too cold,
maybe a European river cruise.

292
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,111
Float on down the Danube.

293
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,947
You and the ladies
could split a deluxe suite.

294
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:43,116
Get into all sorts of trouble.

295
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,160
That sounds very nice...

296
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:48,371
but I don't think they'd really want to.

297
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:50,290
Why not?

298
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,168
They're still...

299
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,128
upset.

300
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:59,382
They must be excited
about the settlement though, right?

301
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:07,056
You can't let one little misunderstanding
destroy years of friendship.

302
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:09,642
Oh, it's just not the same, Jimmy.

303
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,311
She showed her true colours.

304
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:15,648
When it came to that settlement, we were
the furthest things from her mind.

305
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:19,986
It just took her a bit to realise
what was important to you.

306
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:22,113
She came around.

307
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,493
She just wanted to get back
on our good side.

308
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:32,957
Okay, how do you trust someone
who bends any way the wind is blowing?

309
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:35,126
Where is her integrity?

310
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:43,843
Well, I can't help but blame myself.

311
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,179
- You were just trying to help.
- No.

312
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:50,767
I stuck my nose in where it didn't belong
and I stirred the pot.

313
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,477
So...

314
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:56,397
Look, if you wanna blame someone...

315
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,983
you should blame me.

316
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:03,154
Jimmy, you're a good friend.

317
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:04,697
She doesn't deserve you.

318
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,491
No, she doesn't.

319
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:35,728
Yes, I've shut off all the breakers.

320
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,983
Yes, I have checked. Several times.
The power meter is still turning.

321
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:44,737
There's something in the house
that isn't wired through the breaker box...

322
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,990
and it's drawing power.

323
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:52,412
Well, I want you to send someone over
to find it and disconnect it.

324
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:57,584
Wednesday? I can't wait that long.

325
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,836
Are you sure there's nothing sooner?

326
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,632
Wednesday then.

327
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:51,364
Yes, hello, this is Charles McGill.

328
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:54,492
I have a 3:00 with Dr Cruz today.

329
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:58,788
Yes, well, would you tell her
that something's come up...

330
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,915
and I'm not able to come in today?

331
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:04,961
No, no need to reschedule.
I'll just see her next week.

332
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,755
Thank you. Bye.

333
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:30,054
Good.

334
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:31,931
You got my message.

335
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:33,974
Yeah.

336
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:35,601
You strapped?

337
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,571
They're coming.

338
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:25,192
Don Hector.

339
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:28,863
Don Eladio wanted me
to speak with you face to face...

340
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:31,031
so there's no misunderstanding.

341
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,658
From now on...

342
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:37,163
there will be only one route
over the border for our product.

343
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,789
The chicken trucks.

344
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:40,499
And that is final.

345
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,711
But you must understand
this is for efficiency only.

346
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:47,298
There's no disrespect to you
or your family.

347
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:50,509
What's he doing here?

348
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,304
The boss wants you to settle this.

349
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:56,515
I settle it right now, okay?

350
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,519
You have to work together.
It's what the boss wants.

351
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,981
The boss can suck me.

352
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:07,193
- I'd watch what I say if I were you.
- Who do you think you are?

353
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,487
You should be kissing my ass right now.

354
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,656
Me and my family?

355
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:14,700
We built this whole business.

356
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:17,077
We all did. Together.

357
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,246
No, no! Salamanca did!

358
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,040
Salamanca money!

359
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:23,834
- Salamanca blood!
- You have to calm down.

360
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:26,045
That hacienda! I paid for it.

361
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:27,838
And you treat us like dogs.

362
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:30,090
Hector, this isn't personal.

363
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:33,594
It is! It is personal!

364
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:51,654
Call 911.

365
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,906
Stash the guns.

366
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:57,117
You should not be here
when they arrive.

367
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:01,413
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

368
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:06,794
Outside a garage at the corner
of Aztec and Jordan.

369
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:09,380
My boss collapsed.
He's having a heart attack.

370
00:43:22,492 --> 00:43:23,236
Come on.

371
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:39,660
Be advised, we have one adult male...

372
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:42,705
Does he have a history
of cardiac issues?

373
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:44,373
Yeah.

374
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,667
And was he taking any medications?

375
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:48,752
He took these.

376
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:51,422
Thanks.

377
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:54,216
We're headed to Lovelace
if you'd like to follow.

378
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:21,035
- Hey.
- Hey.

379
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:28,000
How's Relax-O-Thon 2003
coming along?

380
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:30,794
No complaints. Join me.

381
00:44:31,879 --> 00:44:34,298
Oh, dip it in the sauce.

382
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,967
- It seems like overkill.
- Trust me.

383
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:43,766
So, what's next?

384
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,309
Monty Python.

385
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:46,602
Solid choice.

386
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:50,272
Or we could just watch
To Kill a Mockingbird again.

387
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,649
- Again?
- Yeah, I watched it this morning.

388
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:55,611
It was my favourite when I was a kid.
I loved Atticus Finch.

389
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:58,155
All the girls were in love with
Gregory Peck.

390
00:44:58,322 --> 00:45:00,741
No, I wasn't in love with him.

391
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:02,242
Well, a little, but...

392
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,286
No, I wanted to be him.

393
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:06,830
Fight the good fight, change the world?

394
00:45:06,997 --> 00:45:08,999
Yeah. Didn't you?

395
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:13,754
That was more Chuck's thing.

396
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:17,508
But, I mean, the good news
is you made it.

397
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:19,301
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

398
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:22,679
I'm changing the world
by helping a mid-size local bank...

399
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:24,890
become a mid-size regional bank.

400
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:26,809
Yay me.

401
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:30,854
So...

402
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:33,148
No luck with Mrs Landry?

403
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,943
Shit, that bridge is burned.

404
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,111
Ashes.

405
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:38,862
It's that bad?

406
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:41,198
No putting that genie
back in the bottle.

407
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:43,617
And I've tried everything.

408
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:45,869
I sent muffin baskets to the gals.

409
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:47,704
- I signed them from her.
- Nice.

410
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:49,248
They saw right through it.

411
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:52,668
Oh, Jimmy, you're too nice.
Jimmy, she doesn't deserve you.

412
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:54,878
The more I try to make them like her...

413
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:57,881
the more they end up
loving me instead.

414
00:45:58,949 --> 00:46:01,635
Well, sounds like you've exhausted
all your options.

415
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:05,431
- If muffin baskets don't solve it...
- I don't know what else to do.

416
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:07,766
I'm not good at building shit,
you know?

417
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:11,103
I'm excellent at tearing it down.

418
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,568
Oh, rookie move.

419
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:19,319
What the...?

420
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:22,573
- It's already cheese.
- It's cheese on cheese.

421
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,032
See?

422
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:28,078
You know, sometimes you gotta
play to your strengths.

423
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:30,956
- You should stitch that on a pillow.
- Oh, I will.

424
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:32,458
All right, screw it.

425
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,877
Mockingbird encore it is.

426
00:46:40,883 --> 00:46:42,301
No.

427
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:44,720
Oh, shit.

428
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:46,013
What? What is it?

429
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,683
Mrs Landry.

430
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,144
You figured it out?

431
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:54,813
Yeah.

432
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:58,150
But I really, really don't wanna do it.

433
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:13,165
- Hello. Hi there.
- Jimmy.

434
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:14,666
Jimmy.

435
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,002
Okey-dokey.

436
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,967
Testing, testing.

437
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:26,345
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

438
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:30,766
I know many of you were expecting
Sandy for this morning's chair yoga...

439
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:32,976
but her daughter has a cold.

440
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:34,269
She'll be fine.

441
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:37,773
The nice folks in front
said I could sit in.

442
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,650
So you guys ready to get to it?

443
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,235
Yeah.

444
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:47,366
Okay, let's wake up those spines
with a cat-cow position.

445
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,661
Very good cat.

446
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:55,040
And then cow.

447
00:47:57,334 --> 00:47:59,545
Sit up straight. Very good, Jasper.

448
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,338
Cat.

449
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,465
And cow.

450
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:05,551
Long, deep breaths.

451
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:09,096
Breathe in through the nose
and out through the mouth.

452
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,015
And cow.

453
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:18,063
And cat...

454
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:20,732
Mr McGill.

455
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:25,195
Erin Brill!
You're just in time for chair yoga.

456
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:27,489
I need to talk to you.

457
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:32,369
Well, pull up a chair.
There's always room for one more.

458
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:34,580
Now, Mr McGill.

459
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:44,548
- What?
- You are unbelievable.

460
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:47,884
I could not for the life of me figure out
why Mrs Landry...

461
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:51,430
would suddenly change her mind
about the Sandpiper settlement.

462
00:48:51,597 --> 00:48:53,432
I had to drag the information out.

463
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,518
You filled her and all of her
friends' heads with lies.

464
00:48:56,685 --> 00:48:58,812
I never lied to anyone.

465
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:02,441
You drastically misrepresented
the reality of the case.

466
00:49:02,608 --> 00:49:04,985
- So?
- So?!

467
00:49:05,736 --> 00:49:07,529
You took advantage of Mrs Landry.

468
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:09,948
Does she know
how much money you're gonna make?

469
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:12,534
Nope. And again, I ask, so what?

470
00:49:13,452 --> 00:49:15,162
These people trusted you, Jimmy.

471
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:18,540
Do you have any idea
how much time I had to put in...

472
00:49:18,707 --> 00:49:21,543
listening to their ramblings
about their sciatica...

473
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,087
or which grandchild
disappoints them?

474
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:25,714
Damn right they trust me.

475
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:29,718
- I worked my ass off earning their trust.
- Then you betrayed it.

476
00:49:29,885 --> 00:49:33,972
If the only thing standing between me and
a million bucks is some old lady's tears...

477
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,099
I'd suggest investing in Kleenex.

478
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:37,934
You ruined her life
because you wanted your money.

479
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,020
Boo and hoo.

480
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:44,066
Besides, it's not like she's got
that much time left, anyway.

481
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:45,484
You're disgusting.

482
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,236
And rich.

483
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:53,659
Hey, everyone. Apologies.

484
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:57,871
That was probably more like 20 breaths
instead of 10...

485
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:01,333
I don't see a lot of
forward folding going on.

486
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:17,933
Come on, girls.

487
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:21,853
Shame on you.

488
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,625
So?

489
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:47,337
- Like a charm. Yeah.
- She'll go back on the settlement?

490
00:50:47,504 --> 00:50:50,882
I imagine you'll hear from her
within an hour or so.

491
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:53,510
- Good.
- Hey.

492
00:50:53,677 --> 00:50:55,178
Well done in there.

493
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:57,347
I meant every word I said.

494
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:00,559
I know.

495
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:04,020
Thank you.

496
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,705
- You got the address?
- Yep.

497
00:51:21,872 --> 00:51:25,876
- Okay, I'll meet you guys there in an hour.
- Sounds good.

498
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:34,259
Hey. You guys about done?

499
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:35,886
Yep.

500
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:38,346
Listen, I...

501
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:40,724
I'm real sorry that this didn't work out.

502
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:42,017
It's fine.

503
00:51:42,184 --> 00:51:46,897
I already talked to my old supervisor.
Looks like they can take me back, so...

504
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:48,440
Oh, that's great.

505
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,943
And, you know,
if we ever get another office up...

506
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,737
you'd be our first call.

507
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,325
Yeah, okay.

508
00:51:58,533 --> 00:51:59,868
Good to know.

509
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:03,246
- Bye, Kim.
- Oh, bye.

510
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:19,763
She understands.

511
00:52:23,475 --> 00:52:25,477
So what's left?

512
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:28,372
Think this is it.
This is all admin stuff...

513
00:52:28,939 --> 00:52:30,774
Appointment book. Your rolodex.

514
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,322
Hey, why'd you do that?

515
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:40,951
Because no senior's coming
within 20 feet of me ever again.

516
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:43,370
I'm gonna need
a whole new business model...

517
00:52:43,537 --> 00:52:45,121
when I get my licence back.

518
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:47,040
Kim, it's pointless.

519
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:50,252
They're smearing my name
across the tristate area...

520
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:53,255
sending telegrams
to everyone far and near.

521
00:52:53,964 --> 00:52:55,632
You never know.

522
00:53:04,558 --> 00:53:06,393
It's a good wall.

523
00:53:08,562 --> 00:53:11,022
- You think?
- Yeah.

524
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,443
We'll get another.

525
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:18,822
