1
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:03,022
You're good.

2
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,987
See you, Nacho.

3
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:10,447
Don Hector.

4
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,147
Hola, Don Hector.

5
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:46,858
Hey, Nacho.

6
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,818
Have a seat.

7
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,660
How's your dad?

8
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,166
Fine.

9
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,210
- Business good?
- Yeah, I think so.

10
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,045
- Cool.
- All right.

11
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:09,339
Hey, my father's gonna
bring in his Corolla.

12
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:14,177
His dogs tore up the back seat.
Like, ate the stuffing.

13
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:36,282
So one of my guys, new kid,
got spooked by a cruiser and ran.

14
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,494
Dumped his stash in the gutter.

15
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,205
Let me finish.

16
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,133
You're light.

17
00:02:57,387 --> 00:03:00,515
- Like I was saying, the guy...
- Why didn't you make it up on your end?

18
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:03,518
I did, but I couldn't make it all up.

19
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:06,813
You got my share, man.

20
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,357
I swear.

21
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:16,698
All right. Make it up next week.

22
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:19,033
Thank you, Nacho.

23
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,743
Don Hector.

24
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,340
Who works for who, huh?

25
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,945
Nacho, no.

26
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,072
No!

27
00:03:58,364 --> 00:03:59,657
No!

28
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:03,077
Nacho, no.

29
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,788
Oh, come on. Come on.

30
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,836
No, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

31
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,504
Nacho.

32
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,235
Son.

33
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,322
Have you seen the black cowhide?

34
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,115
In the back, Dad.

35
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,993
On the top shelf.

36
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,830
Next to the red suede.

37
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,747
I wanna start by
thanking you for your patience...

38
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:14,167
through this
long and emotional proceeding.

39
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:17,712
Jimmy McGill has worked tirelessly...

40
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,131
to build a practice that
helps an underserved...

41
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:24,218
and frankly, overlooked segment
of our community...

42
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,095
the elderly.

43
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,891
You've heard from many of
Mr McGill's clients today.

44
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:34,645
Every one of them came here gladly
in support of their lawyer.

45
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,689
Jimmy reached out to people...

46
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:40,026
who may never have
seen an attorney in their entire lives.

47
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:43,488
He took the time to
make sure they had wills...

48
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:47,700
that accurately reflected their
wishes for a price they could afford.

49
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:51,579
Because Jimmy McGill
cares about people.

50
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,167
He's devoted the past three years of
his life to his brother's welfare.

51
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:59,212
Waking at 5 in the morning to
buy Charles' favourite newspaper...

52
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,632
from the single newsstand
in the city that carries it.

53
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:07,386
Dropping everything to care for his
brother through multiple hospitalisations.

54
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,180
Even supporting Charles' career...

55
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:12,141
by hand making
a Mylar-lined suit jacket...

56
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:15,561
to spare his brother discomfort
from exposure to electricity.

57
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:18,981
And yet, during this time...

58
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:22,693
Charles McGill's irrational animus
towards his brother...

59
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,781
grew to epic proportions.

60
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:30,368
So when Jimmy discovered that Charles
had used his love and his caring...

61
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:32,203
against him...

62
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,663
when he discovered...

63
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,416
he had been betrayed by
his only living blood relative...

64
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,627
Jimmy snapped.

65
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:42,213
Wouldn't you?

66
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,049
I might.

67
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,177
Chuck?

68
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,389
Jimmy McGill understands
he broke the law...

69
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:53,975
when he forced his way
into his brother's house...

70
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:57,603
and he is deeply sorry.

71
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,648
He is more than ready to
face the consequences.

72
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,654
However,
as to ethical violation 16-304A...

73
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:09,490
the state bar's claim of
destruction of evidence...

74
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:13,953
it categorically did not happen.

75
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,957
Jimmy McGill had no agenda
when he entered his brother's home.

76
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:21,294
- He lost his temper, plain and simple.
- Chuck, please let me in.

77
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,797
So now the question you must
ask yourselves is this...

78
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:30,344
Is the legal profession better
with Jimmy McGill in it?

79
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:36,934
I believe the answer is
a resounding yes.

80
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,939
Here's to 12 short months.

81
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:45,985
Also, somebody call the pope
because according to your summation...

82
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:50,072
I ought to be a saint, me and
Mother Teresa, right up there with her.

83
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:53,117
Saint Jimmy.
Yeah, that has a nice ring to it.

84
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:54,368
Boom.

85
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:07,173
So have you given any thought to what
you're gonna do for the next year?

86
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,858
You know, with your clients?

87
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:10,968
Slow down.

88
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:14,305
That is tomorrow talk, counsellor.

89
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:18,309
Tonight, I celebrate with
the world's best defence attorney.

90
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:19,602
Where are your notes?

91
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:23,105
Let's spread them out and roll around
on them. See what happens.

92
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,736
It's a good plan.

93
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:47,713
Rebecca?

94
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,257
Jimmy.

95
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:52,718
Well, I'm... Come on in, please.

96
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:55,137
- Hi. Kim Wexler.
- Rebecca Bois.

97
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,056
We didn't formally meet earlier.

98
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:58,933
- Right. It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

99
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,895
I was just at Chuck's,
and he won't answer the door.

100
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:06,315
I was out there knocking
for almost an hour.

101
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:09,735
That sounds like Chuck. I'm sure
he's fine. He's just being dramatic.

102
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,113
I think it's a little bit more than that.

103
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,074
I want you to come with me to
get him to let us in.

104
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:19,954
- Jimmy, he needs our help.
- No, thanks.

105
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,374
I've already kicked
my door in for the year.

106
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,168
You owe it to him.

107
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,922
I don't owe him squat.

108
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,892
Jimmy, you lied to me.

109
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,520
This was never about helping Chuck.

110
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:48,149
If you feel misled, I apologise,
but I think I was clear.

111
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:50,443
I told you I had to defend myself...

112
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:54,280
and Chuck would need help
afterwards, which he does.

113
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,574
You got what you wanted.

114
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,784
Now it's time to do what's right.

115
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,995
Yeah...

116
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,997
No.

117
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:07,043
Jimmy, he's still your brother.

118
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,005
Not anymore, he's not.

119
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:24,310
Chuck was right about you all along.

120
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:30,691
He's mentally ill. What is your excuse?

121
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,613
Enjoy your champagne.

122
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,339
Like the other night, during dinner...

123
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:56,550
Kaylee asked if her daddy
ever used to cook.

124
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,469
And I told her about...

125
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:02,932
how Matty used to make her
Mickey Mouse pancakes on weekends.

126
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:07,520
You know, two small pancake ears
attached to a big one?

127
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:11,982
She didn't remember,
but I think it made her happy.

128
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,277
She even asked for them
the next morning.

129
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,864
Boy, Matty made it look easy.

130
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:22,451
Keeping the ears separated,
it's really hard.

131
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:26,997
Mine looked terrible,
but Kaylee didn't care.

132
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:30,251
Now she wants Daddy pancakes
every weekend.

133
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:36,966
But there are times...

134
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,342
Career day's coming up...

135
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:42,596
and she asked me if I would go
and talk about her daddy's job.

136
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,683
She wants to know
more about what he did.

137
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:49,186
That kind of took my breath away.

138
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,647
Kaylee's teacher thinks
it would be good for her...

139
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:57,778
maybe make his absence feel
a little bit more normal.

140
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:02,825
- So do you think you're gonna do it?
- I don't know.

141
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,744
- Maybe.
- Good.

142
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,747
That's good work, Stacey.

143
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,919
Well, who's next?

144
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,047
Thanks for coming. It means a lot.

145
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,593
Well, honey, if it makes you
feel any better, I'm all for it.

146
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,179
Enough that you'd come again?

147
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:24,972
We'll see.

148
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,101
Well, the thing is I sort of
volunteered you for something.

149
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,938
- What?
- To help with the new playground.

150
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,900
The kids deserve way better
than that, don't you think?

151
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,485
Sure, but why me?

152
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,237
Well, they need someone who
knows how to pour concrete.

153
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:43,491
The slide and swings need
something called footings, I think.

154
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,494
Sweetheart,
that's not really my department.

155
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,539
Sure it is, Pop.
You built a carport when Matty was a kid.

156
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:51,832
I did?

157
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,252
Yeah, he told me about it
a bunch of times.

158
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,338
He said when
you were pricing it out...

159
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,965
you thought all the people
who gave you quotes were crooks.

160
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,176
So you decided to do it yourself.

161
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,888
And you let Matty write his initials
in the wet cement.

162
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:12,144
Pop, the way he talked about you,
it was like you hung the moon.

163
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,482
I'm sorry.
I can get you out of it. I thought...

164
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:19,568
No, it's fine.
Just tell me when and where.

165
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:22,071
Come on. Jeez.

166
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,158
Thank you.

167
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,816
Chuck?

168
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:11,203
Chuck, it's Howard.

169
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,213
I'm not leaving, Chuck.

170
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:26,176
I don't want to wake up the neighbours,
but I got all night.

171
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,056
Chuck?

172
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:15,392
That is a 35-year-old Macallan.

173
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,020
I'm not gonna tell you
how much it cost...

174
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,522
but don't worry,
it's coming out of my end.

175
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,695
The opinion came in.

176
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,947
Jimmy was suspended
for 12 months.

177
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,076
This is a win, my friend.

178
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,828
I know, it doesn't feel like it.

179
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,289
But hear me out.

180
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,125
Jimmy's not gonna be
a lawyer for one year.

181
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,920
And if he screws up,
which we both know is likely...

182
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:44,505
his PPD terminates.

183
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:48,050
And that one year
may turn into forever.

184
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,266
Chuck, you're at a crossroads.

185
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,394
You can keep looking backwards...

186
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,648
stay focused on your brother,
what he's up to, or you can go forward.

187
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,818
And, Chuck, listen to me...

188
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,612
Jimmy's just not worth it.

189
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,365
Where would we be if...

190
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:15,577
say, Clarence Darrow had
devoted the best years of his life...

191
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,288
to supervising his
ne'er-do-well relatives?

192
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,166
Think of the cases
he wouldn't have taken...

193
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:25,129
the injustices that would
have gone unanswered.

194
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,590
What a waste.

195
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,386
I say...

196
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:37,182
put your energy into the future.

197
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,111
Anything else...

198
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:53,615
is a waste of
your time and intellect.

199
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,790
What do you say?

200
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,391
To new beginnings.

201
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,144
To new beginnings.

202
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,948
You okay to drive?

203
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,075
Absolutely.

204
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,789
How are you feeling?

205
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,833
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you, Howard.

206
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,921
Lunch is served.

207
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,673
Swim, honey.

208
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,384
Get it before it's soggy.

209
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,147
- Francesca, it's go time.
- Where should we start?

210
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:31,899
With the A's.

211
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:35,569
Hi, Mrs Adamson?
It's Francesca at Jimmy McGill's office.

212
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,989
Are you available to talk with Jimmy?
Okay, great.

213
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,657
Mrs Adamson.

214
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,619
Hello, dear. Do you have a moment?

215
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,038
I just wanted you
to be the first to know...

216
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:49,082
that I'll be taking
a brief sabbatical from the law.

217
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,459
Just one year.

218
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,670
One quick trip of the Earth
around the sun and I'll be back.

219
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,631
I will.

220
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,176
- Next.
- Hold for Jimmy.

221
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:03,221
I did? Oh, that's an honour.

222
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,766
And how did he pass?

223
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,812
Next. The details will all be
in a letter you'll receive shortly.

224
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,564
Mostly legal boilerplate.

225
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:15,400
Now you give that
nephew a hug for me.

226
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,693
Niece.

227
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,153
Next.

228
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,991
- Hold for Jimmy.
- It's just a technical thing, really.

229
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,453
It's just a technical...
An agreement. It's an agreement.

230
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:30,165
It's an agreement that I came to
with the bar association.

231
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:33,085
You're gonna get a letter
with all the details so...

232
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:36,296
Mr Levine, can you hear me? Hello?

233
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:41,259
Can you hear me still?
Okay, you stop talking and I'll talk.

234
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,844
Okay. Next.

235
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:48,642
The letter will explain it, but the details
are boring, legalistic mumbo jumbo.

236
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:51,436
I don't know where
those sounds are coming from, sir.

237
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:54,481
You... You'll have to check.
Well, then stay inside.

238
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,318
Details will be in a letter.
That's right, but don't worry about it.

239
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,405
Next. Next. Next.

240
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,991
Yes, Mrs Pressman,
I still have the document.

241
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,119
I'm including the calico.

242
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,955
I don't wanna get down
into the weeds on this with you.

243
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,833
Just my headache, sir. I'm tired.

244
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,711
Listen to you. Where did you
learn so much about lawyering?

245
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,755
Yes, just watch your mail
for that letter from my office.

246
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,882
Okay. Bye bye.

247
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,593
- Next.
- Last one. Mr Yalowitz.

248
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,637
Last one.

249
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,017
Mr Yalowitz. Hey, it's Jimmy McGill.

250
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:34,187
Listen, for your future lawyering needs,
I am taking a hiatus of one year.

251
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:38,108
Will you please watch your mail
for a letter from my office?

252
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,610
Yes, Jimmy from TV.

253
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,530
You watch it every day, huh?

254
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,867
Really?

255
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:49,828
Were you the pilot of the B-29?

256
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:53,957
Thirty-two missions? Holy...

257
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,335
Well, can I just say, sir...

258
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:01,381
you are one of the people who made
the greatest generation so damn great.

259
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,799
I salute you.

260
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,845
All right. See you soon.

261
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,264
On TV, right.

262
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,016
Bye.

263
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,986
Francesca, get me KWBV.

264
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,572
Okay.

265
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,835
Get me the manager.

266
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:42,130
Then get me somebody
who can pull a commercial, stat.

267
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:04,277
- You finished making your calls?
- Yeah, that was a ton of fun.

268
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,780
But what gets me is this.

269
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,115
What is it?

270
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,617
It is my KWBV contract.

271
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:13,620
I almost let one of my ads run today.

272
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,248
- You can't do that.
- I know.

273
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:19,334
But can you believe this?
I've got nine airings left.

274
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:22,379
I'm out 4000 bucks.

275
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:28,802
I guess...

276
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,139
you have to find a local business
and sell them your time.

277
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,933
- What else can you do?
- Yeah.

278
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:40,063
This pile of garbage explicitly states
I'm not allowed to resell.

279
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,566
You're a lawyer.
See if you can you find a loophole.

280
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:47,195
I cannot look at another contract.
I'm up to my eyeballs in Mesa Verde.

281
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,448
Yeah, I'm sorry.

282
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,076
So, what do you want to do
about Francesca?

283
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,912
Do about her? What?

284
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,915
How much notice should we give her?
Two weeks?

285
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:03,795
We're not doing her any favours
by keeping her in the dark.

286
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,214
She should start looking.

287
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:10,635
So you want to fire Francesca?

288
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,470
I don't want to.

289
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:17,017
I don't need her for more than filing
and getting coffee. I can do that myself.

290
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,227
We just hired her. I like her.

291
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:22,105
We need to talk about
the overhead on this place.

292
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,648
No, Kim, no.

293
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:26,318
This office is set up
for two legal practices...

294
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:30,405
and now there's only one. I don't need
all this space. I only have one client.

295
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,825
- It's a huge client.
- I looked into it...

296
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,912
and breaking the lease will cost
less than 10 months' rent.

297
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:41,416
We didn't go through all this to give up
everything after one day of suspension.

298
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:45,003
- One day.
- It's not everything.

299
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:49,007
It's an office. Four walls and a door.

300
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:52,886
Why waste money on something
we don't need?

301
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:58,975
As far as I'm concerned,
nothing's changed, all right?

302
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:02,020
I'll hold up my end,
you hold up yours. Fifty-fifty.

303
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:06,149
You'll keep paying for half a law office
even though you're not practising law?

304
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:08,860
- Call it aspirational thinking.
- Okay.

305
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:12,197
But how are you gonna pay for it?

306
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,910
The day I don't show up with my half...

307
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:20,205
that's the day we'll talk
about closing this place.

308
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,710
That's fair, I guess.

309
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,469
You'll see.

310
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:56,199
Look at the two of you.
I mean, you belong on TV.

311
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,368
You're naturals.

312
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:01,538
I know. You're thinking,
It's too good to be true.

313
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:04,457
The TV's too expensive.
We can't afford that.

314
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:07,502
Well, I'm telling you, you can.

315
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,296
And here's the beauty part.

316
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:12,132
For a reasonable price,
we will shoot your commercial.

317
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:17,387
And then we'll throw in the airtime
for the low, low price of free.

318
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,639
Hey, give me Jimmy.

319
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,933
That's right. That's me.
You've seen my ad.

320
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,061
Well, what I did for me,
my friends, I will do that for you.

321
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:27,522
Look,
our all-inclusive premium package...

322
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,358
that's gonna be
the best bang for your buck.

323
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:34,529
We'll shoot nine commercials
for $4,900.

324
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:35,739
Okay?

325
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:40,744
And that includes the nine airings at
3:20 in the afternoon on channel KWBV.

326
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,039
That is a prime slot with a viewership...

327
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:48,376
of tens of thousands
of potential customers.

328
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,879
- It does sound like a good deal.
- It does.

329
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,174
- It's a lot of money.
- Yeah.

330
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:58,470
That's perfectly understandable.
It's a big financial commitment.

331
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:02,849
That's why we have
our "Toe-in-the-Water" package.

332
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:07,979
That's one commercial,
flat rate, 849.95.

333
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:11,107
Beauty part again, free airtime.

334
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:13,526
And when this thing runs,
you're gonna get calls.

335
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,653
I can promise you that.

336
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:20,492
We'll think about it.

337
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,577
Excellent.

338
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,830
When do you think you might decide?

339
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,875
- Maybe next week.
- Yeah.

340
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,754
Gee, I'm sorry for any confusion.

341
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,297
But I was talk...

342
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:38,176
I was talking
about a much shorter window...

343
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:41,054
for the thinking part.

344
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,098
How short?

345
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:47,519
We would have you on the air
by 3:20 this afternoon.

346
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:51,689
Today? You're gonna shoot a commercial
in the next two and a half hours?

347
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:54,234
Oh, no. I mean,
there's a whole post process.

348
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,153
There's editing,
and mixing, colouring, layback.

349
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,696
It's a whole megillah.
You don't want to know.

350
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:03,701
But we would need to be shooting
in the next 15 minutes.

351
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,259
No, there's Joseph and
the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.

352
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,344
I thought they made,
like, a Moses musical.

353
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,554
- They did.
- They did.

354
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,597
Which one's that? Let my people go?

355
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,891
Well, yeah. It was kind of...

356
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:28,435
Everybody get in the car.

357
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,871
- Is everything okay?
- No.

358
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,665
I air in two hours and 20 minutes,
and I have no client.

359
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:54,294
That's another 400 bucks
down the drain.

360
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:00,467
How do I find somebody who
needs a commercial and can afford one?

361
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:06,723
Maybe you could make a commercial.

362
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,768
Have you not been listening?
That's what I've been trying...

363
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:17,567
Right.

364
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:42,675
Let's go. Chop chop.

365
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,262
All right...

366
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:47,555
Plant it right here.

367
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:50,975
I want you to get
those dishes behind me.

368
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:53,895
Hi, this is Jimmy McGill.
For a limited time. No.

369
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:58,441
Jimmy McGill here to talk about
the wonders of broadcast. No.

370
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,110
Jimmy McGill's the name.
Advertising is...

371
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,904
Camera ready.

372
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:09,744
Hi, I'm Jimmy McGill with an amazing
opportunity for small business owners...

373
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,663
Shit. No. I can't do this.

374
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,874
- Sure, you can.
- No.

375
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,418
We're totally off-brand here.

376
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:20,213
I'm Jimmy McGill,
a lawyer you can trust.

377
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,591
I can't suddenly turn into
commercial guy.

378
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,262
Hold on.

379
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:31,683
Repeat after me. For a limited time,
we'll shoot your commercial today...

380
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,017
and have it on the air tomorrow.

381
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,562
For a limited time,
we'll shoot your commercial today...

382
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,772
and have it on air tomorrow.

383
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,360
I thought you were president
of the Drama Club or something?

384
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:43,570
I'm treasurer.

385
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:47,532
You, go.

386
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,076
Say the words.

387
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:55,290
For a limited time only we...

388
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:57,750
Cut. Maybe next time.

389
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:06,050
We gonna do this or not? Because
either way I'm getting my 100 bucks.

390
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:09,971
Quick, crack open your magic bag.
We'll have to Karloff this thing.

391
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:51,614
All the same weight?

392
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,450
Within a quarter gram.

393
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,452
You have a scale?

394
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,039
Take your pick.

395
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,818
You forgot how to count?

396
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:31,112
You get five.

397
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:34,449
Don Hector gets six.

398
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,589
He's expecting six.

399
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,969
And that's what I'm gonna bring.

400
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:19,452
He's trying to take six.
We only owe him five.

401
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,996
He's pushing it.

402
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:29,587
- Give it to him.
- You sure?

403
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,672
Give it to him.

404
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,977
Well?

405
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:53,230
It could work.

406
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:56,901
Okay then.

407
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:48,929
- Doctor's exchange.
- May I speak with Dr Lara Cruz, please?

408
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,307
- Can you hold a moment?
- Yes, I'll hold.

409
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:00,232
- Thank you for your patience.
- Doctor?

410
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,985
- Is this an emergency?
- I need to speak with her.

411
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:05,696
- Who's calling?
- Yeah, Charles McGill.

412
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:07,907
I'm a patient, former patient.

413
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:11,160
I need to see Dr Cruz
as soon as possible.

414
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:14,288
- I'll page her. Please hold.
- Thank you.

415
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:21,796
So?

416
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:25,007
I took the five, then one more.

417
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:28,469
What'd he say? Did he piss himself?

418
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:32,264
No, he wasn't there,
it was just his guys.

419
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:33,432
So, what happened?

420
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:38,687
They called him, and while we were
waiting to see what he'd say...

421
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,190
one of the guys
put a gun to my head.

422
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,692
They put a gun to your head?

423
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:47,822
It was no big deal.

424
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:52,952
Lionel.

425
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:56,413
Go outside. See what he found out.

426
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,957
Yeah.

427
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:06,215
So your father...

428
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:08,092
his shop...

429
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:12,429
where does he get his upholstery?

430
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,475
From the distributor.

431
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:20,187
And where is the distributor?

432
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,815
- Jalisco.
- Jalisco.

433
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,058
- Jalisco.
- Jalisco.

434
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,781
I want a new way to
get my stuff over the border.

435
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,409
A legitimate business.

436
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:35,119
Right, but the chicken man...

437
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:40,583
Temporary.
I want a new front, my own.

438
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:47,214
Don Hector,
my father is a simple man.

439
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:50,509
He is not in the business.

440
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:53,721
- You will teach him.
- Don Hector, please...

441
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:56,891
Don't worry. I'll take
good care of papi. He'll make money.

442
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:59,643
A lot more than with
his little sewing machine.

443
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:03,480
Lionel talked to our guy in Los Lunas.
Looks like Tuco knifed a guy.

444
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:05,858
He broke a guard's jaw.
They've got him in solitary.

445
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:09,111
What?
All he had to do was six months.

446
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:11,238
He'll be in there forever.

447
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,139
Boss.

448
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:52,738
You talk to your father.

449
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:16,303
I promise,
as soon as you see the first one...

450
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,181
you're gonna want
the whole package.

451
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,809
Take about an hour.

452
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:25,479
So I'll bring the whole team down there.
We'll be there 12:30 sharp.

453
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:28,148
I'm gonna turn you into a star.

454
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:31,944
Absolutely, you'll be
on the air by tomorrow afternoon.

455
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:34,947
I know. It is amazing.

456
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:39,535
Okay, and don't wear stripes
because you'll moire.

457
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:42,246
It's a filmmaking term.
Just don't wear stripes.

458
00:43:42,413 --> 00:43:44,498
Okay. See you then.

459
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:49,044
- You want a beer?
- Yes. Thanks.

460
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:54,300
So sleeping in your own bed tonight.
Things must be looking up.

461
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:56,927
I needed clean clothes.

462
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,638
What was all that?

463
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:04,059
- Well, I'm unloading that ad time.
- But I thought you couldn't sell it.

464
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:05,978
Well, that's the thing. I'm not.

465
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:10,149
They pay me to make a commercial.
I throw in the airtime for free.

466
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:11,900
- Smart.
- Yeah.

467
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:15,821
I spent most of the day going
door to door pitching. No dice.

468
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:19,658
Then it came to me. I'm selling
advertising. Why not advertise?

469
00:44:19,867 --> 00:44:23,454
And it worked.
I mean, TV commercials get calls.

470
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:27,541
What commercial did you run?
Not... Not Gimme Jimmy?

471
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,211
No, I... I made a new one.

472
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:33,339
When?

473
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:34,965
Today.

474
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:37,676
Right here.

475
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:40,471
So you made a commercial
for commercials today?

476
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,058
Yeah, I'm starting to think
I might break even here.

477
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:48,979
Okay. Let's see it.

478
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:51,148
I don't know.

479
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:55,694
It's not my best work.
It's very last minute.

480
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:58,530
Well, you're getting calls.
It can't be that bad.

481
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:00,532
Yeah.

482
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:03,469
What, now you're getting shy?

483
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,663
Come on.

484
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:09,541
Okay, but keep in mind...

485
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:13,545
Yeah, yeah, it's not your best work.
I got it.

486
00:45:28,227 --> 00:45:31,605
What's that I see?
Albuquerque's next TV star?

487
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:33,273
It's you, small business owner.

488
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,692
Struggling to make it
in today's fast-paced economy?

489
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:38,904
Thought television advertising
was too expensive for you?

490
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:43,117
Well, you better think again.
You can't afford not to be on TV.

491
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,411
Look at you, you're a triple threat.

492
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:48,122
Great services,
great products, and most of all...

493
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:50,666
that face. You're a star.

494
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:55,838
Wrap it all up in your natural charisma
and bam, you belong on TV.

495
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:59,133
Better watch out for
autograph hounds and paparazzi.

496
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:01,885
And it gets better.
I can have you on the air tomorrow.

497
00:46:02,052 --> 00:46:03,929
You heard me right. Tomorrow.

498
00:46:04,096 --> 00:46:06,473
Better get ready to be famous,
Albuquerque.

499
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,643
I can make you a TV star
for a price you can afford.

500
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:11,270
Call me, Saul Goodman.

501
00:46:11,437 --> 00:46:14,148
The world needs to know
about you and your business.

502
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:15,691
Call me now.

503
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:23,365
The guy at the station said he's never
seen so many star wipes in a row.

504
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:25,868
It's never been done.

505
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,413
Saul Goodman?

506
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,541
Yeah, it's like, it's all good, man.

507
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:35,544
- That guy has a lot of energy.
- Yeah.

508
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:38,213
It's just a name.
