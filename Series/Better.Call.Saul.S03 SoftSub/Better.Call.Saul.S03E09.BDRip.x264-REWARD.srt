1
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,252
Mrs Landry,
you're looking lovely as ever.

2
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,255
Jimmy McGill.

3
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:46,548
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:48,633
I was in the area, and I thought...

5
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,261
I wonder how my favourite
former client is doing?

6
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:52,846
And I have cookies.

7
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:55,765
Oh, you're so sweet. Come on in.

8
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:58,309
After I made these, I looked down...

9
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:02,814
and thought, wow,
that looks just like your Felix.

10
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:05,066
They do.

11
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:08,486
- You're so thoughtful.
- Well, I was afraid you wouldn't be here.

12
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:12,532
Thought with that settlement money you
might've moved somewhere swankier.

13
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,159
What do you mean?

14
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,952
The settlement.

15
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,454
The Sandpiper case?

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,789
- That's gotta be wrapped up by now.
- Oh, that.

17
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:23,251
That... That... That's still years away.

18
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:26,254
- You haven't settled?
- No, I don't know all the details yet...

19
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:30,925
but Erin... Erin Brill
of Davis & Main, do you know her?

20
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:35,638
Lovely girl.
She reminds me of a young Mary Martin.

21
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:40,977
Oh, yes. I have met her.
It's a... It's a wonderful young lady.

22
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:42,812
Well, she takes care of all that...

23
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:45,690
and she said
there's still a long way to go.

24
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,276
But you've received an offer, right?

25
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:51,488
Something sent to you in writing.

26
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:54,157
I mean, something more than
just Erin and you chatting?

27
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:01,998
It's probably all here in this box.

28
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:07,170
I can't make heads or tails of it,
but you are welcome to look.

29
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:08,463
You sure?

30
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,591
Of course. It's you.

31
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,386
Well, I gotta say...

32
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:20,859
I can't blame you
for getting mixed up with all this.

33
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:25,980
I mean, these legal notices, I mean,
no one really understands them.

34
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,733
You know, I've got a law degree.

35
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,194
Sometimes, I can't even...

36
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:37,158
I can't even...

37
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,749
You haven't...

38
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,876
accepted this?

39
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,838
Erin says we should wait.

40
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,798
But...

41
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,927
Erin doesn't really matter, does she?

42
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:59,222
I mean,
you're the class representative.

43
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:00,765
That's a big deal.

44
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:04,602
That means you, and you alone, decide.
You're...

45
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,857
You are the legal stand-in
for your friends and neighbours.

46
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:13,695
I don't know about all that, Jimmy.
I just leave it all to the professionals.

47
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:18,157
Yeah. Sure, sure. Lawyers know best.

48
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,368
But I'm sorry...

49
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:23,580
if you won the lottery,
I mean, you'd take the lump sum, right?

50
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,416
I mean,
money now is better than money later.

51
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,377
- Bird in the hand?
- I suppose.

52
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:32,046
More time to enjoy it.

53
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,924
You really should talk to Erin.

54
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,886
She knows all the ins and outs.

55
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:41,598
Ins and outs. Yeah.
Erin sure knows those.

56
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:45,001
I'd be happy to talk to Erin.

57
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:50,106
But I just can't help but wonder
if she's taking every aspect into...

58
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,484
Oh, Jimmy.

59
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:57,697
I completely forgot.
I'm on my way to chair yoga.

60
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:59,699
I'm so sorry.

61
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,218
Oh, it's okay.

62
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:06,247
I probably should be going.
I have a lot to do.

63
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,253
Jimmy.

64
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:15,298
- Jimmy.
- Rose, Myrtle, Helen.

65
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:17,717
That chair yoga really works, huh?

66
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,344
You all look 10 years younger.

67
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:22,931
- Oh, you honeydripper.
- Hey, hurry up. It starts in five minutes.

68
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:26,059
- You wanna come with us?
- You're welcome to. We can have guests.

69
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,729
I would love to,
but I'm not dressed for it.

70
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:32,106
So I'll take a rain check.

71
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,734
Certainly, thanks for the cookies,
Jimmy.

72
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,486
Bye.

73
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:43,159
That can't be right.

74
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,453
Can't be right.

75
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:52,543
Seventeen point four total.

76
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,629
Thirty-three percent
is the common fund.

77
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,757
So I'm one-fifteenth.

78
00:04:57,924 --> 00:04:59,550
Fifteen into 17...

79
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,680
Carry the two...

80
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,517
One million, one hundred and sixty.

81
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:13,856
One million,
one hundred and sixty thousand.

82
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,776
Holy shit.

83
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,230
- Mr Ehrmantraut?
- Yes.

84
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,316
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It'll be right this way.

85
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:00,653
Can I get you anything to drink?
Tea, water, espresso?

86
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,531
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

87
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:22,133
- Ms Rodarte-Quayle, I have your next...
- Yes, thank you.

88
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,552
Mr Ehrmantraut,
Lydia Rodarte-Quayle.

89
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,720
Mike.

90
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,346
Thanks, Justin.

91
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,099
Have a seat.

92
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,684
Mike...

93
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:36,856
HR sent up your start paperwork.
I-9, W-2, pretty standard.

94
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,819
Could I have your driver's licence
and social-security card?

95
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:45,698
- Why?
- My assistant needs to make a copy.

96
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:50,119
How does this hire work exactly?
Walk me through it.

97
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:54,332
You'll receive a paycheque from Madrigal
in the amount of $10,000 per week.

98
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:58,669
I believe at that rate, your employment
should be paid out in about 20 weeks.

99
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:02,381
Mr Fring has arranged to cover FICA,
social security...

100
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,467
the entirety of the tax burden.

101
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,469
I assume that's all right with you?

102
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:13,434
Good. So to that end, I have you down
as a logistics consultant.

103
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,685
What is that?

104
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:18,481
It's a person who consults on logistics.

105
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,483
Does it matter?

106
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:23,861
I'm not long on logistics.

107
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:27,782
Security consultant would be better.
I used to be a cop.

108
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:32,495
That'll look better on work history than
your current employer, SMQ Parking.

109
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:33,788
So...

110
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,790
you take my money...

111
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:38,376
run it through this joint,
and it's clean? That it?

112
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,086
Yes.

113
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:42,088
Who knows this operation?

114
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:44,298
You? Anyone else?

115
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:47,051
- No.
- You sure?

116
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,430
May I ask what, precisely,
is your concern here?

117
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,811
I'm concerned about what happens
if you put my real name in your books.

118
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:59,647
Your Madrigal is a German company.

119
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,608
One thing I know about Germans
is they love a good audit.

120
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:08,489
I oversee eight freight terminals
across Texas and the Southwest.

121
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:13,995
Operating costs range between
$800,000 and $1 million per week.

122
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,748
All due respect, Mike,
but your money?

123
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,458
It's a rounding error.

124
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,794
If the IRS or anyone else looks...

125
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:24,005
you're a contractor for
a multinational corporation...

126
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:27,300
with 114,000 employees worldwide.

127
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,719
You're like every other person
in this building.

128
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:32,180
Like you?

129
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,141
You think I'm not on the books?

130
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:36,601
I am.

131
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:37,935
Under my own name.

132
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,938
- This is the way you handled it before?
- Handled what?

133
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:44,025
The money for Fring's other guys.

134
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,944
Other guys?

135
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,947
This is the first time I've done this...

136
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,908
for anyone.

137
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,994
I don't know what you do, but...

138
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,289
Mr Fring must think
you're quite good at it.

139
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:15,598
Twenty weeks.

140
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,767
The sooner you're off my books,
the better.

141
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,852
Justin?

142
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,071
Can you make a copy of these,
please? Thank you.

143
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:36,327
What?

144
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,040
This is a very nice office.

145
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:43,084
Thank you.

146
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,464
Seem to be risking a lot
for a drug dealer.

147
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,175
Drug dealer?

148
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:57,723
If that's all you think he is...

149
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,518
then you don't know Gustavo Fring.

150
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,248
Let me understand you.

151
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:28,212
You're proposing to double our premiums
on every one of our practising attorneys?

152
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:32,216
We know this is abrupt.
New issues have come to light.

153
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,343
New issues?

154
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,470
You mean
Mr McGill's testimony at the bar?

155
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,930
That's a part of it. Yes.

156
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,268
After 25 years of paying full premiums,
I can count on one hand our claims.

157
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:45,896
This is an underwriting decision.
You shouldn't take it personally.

158
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:49,358
In some special circumstances,
we have been known to extend a rider.

159
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:50,735
What kind of rider?

160
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:54,697
A senior, management-level partner
who would supervise Charles' work.

161
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,991
Attend court
and client meetings with him...

162
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,659
review filings.

163
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:02,455
We've done this for clients with
a high probability of health failure...

164
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,665
- as a precaution.
- What you're saying is...

165
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:08,169
for any case Charles takes on,
another partner is tied up as well.

166
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:09,879
And we don't bill a penny more?

167
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:11,505
This is ludicrous.

168
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,133
The insurance industry
is heavily regulated.

169
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,844
I can think of a dozen infractions
here off the top of my head.

170
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,220
Mr McGill.

171
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,806
You're hoping we'll either
find another carrier...

172
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:23,559
or cut you an enormous cheque.
Win-win for you.

173
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,062
I assure you,
neither is going to happen.

174
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,730
What will happen is very simple.

175
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,816
You're going to do right by us,
or we will compel you to do so.

176
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,778
- What do you mean by compel?
- You know exactly what I mean.

177
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:36,280
If you're threatening litigation,
this meeting is over.

178
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,157
Then it's over.

179
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,534
Thank you for your time.

180
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,621
Mr Hamlin, Mr McGill.

181
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,341
All right. Where do we begin?

182
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:57,676
Francis should start
digging into regulations.

183
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:01,597
I'm sorry. I don't have the code sections
at my fingertips just now.

184
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,474
Let's pull a team of associates...

185
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:07,103
and get them looking at
every angle of injunctive relief.

186
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,522
Before close of business,
we'll hit Santa Rosa...

187
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:13,192
with a demand letter
that'll make their heads spin.

188
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:16,362
Odds are, inside a week,
they'll be sitting at the table again.

189
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:19,115
And if not, well...

190
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,826
we've never shied away from a fight.

191
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,831
Chuck,
do you remember Al McConnell?

192
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,791
Of course. Hell of a litigator.

193
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,461
- Retired now, isn't he?
- He's a professor at UNM now.

194
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,464
Wrote a fantastic book
on SCOTUS during Reconstruction.

195
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:36,757
Fascinating stuff.

196
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,592
- Okay?
- I was talking to him...

197
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:43,639
and he mentioned
he'd love you come speak to his One-L's.

198
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,100
Maybe make it a regular thing,
if you wanted.

199
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,020
What are you talking about, Howard?

200
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,022
What I'm saying is...

201
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,067
maybe it's time
to hang up your spurs.

202
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,194
Become partner emeritus.

203
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,780
Leave your name on the firm,
but focus on your legacy.

204
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:03,409
You always said you wanted to
work on the Commerce Clause.

205
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,369
You can write the book on it.

206
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,621
And no longer be a practising lawyer.

207
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,001
Chuck, there's more to life than this.

208
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,171
That day is far in the future, Howard...

209
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,549
and I don't appreciate
the suggestion.

210
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,720
- What if it's not a suggestion.
- Meaning?

211
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,639
Meaning if enough people
tell you that you're drunk...

212
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,058
maybe it's time to sit down.

213
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,230
You want me to retire over this?

214
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,649
- Insurance?
- It's not just the insurance.

215
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,569
That's the straw
that broke the camel's back.

216
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,573
Oh, so this is about my condition?

217
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:43,949
Look.

218
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,494
Look.

219
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:50,206
You see?

220
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,958
See?

221
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,085
I'm better.

222
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,880
Howard, I'm fine.

223
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:03,260
This is not what fine looks like.

224
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,934
Chuck, you are the best
legal mind I've ever known.

225
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,977
Hands down.

226
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,773
But your decision making
has become unpredictable.

227
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:21,070
I can't be partners with someone
whose judgement I don't trust.

228
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,243
Chuck.

229
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:44,343
This right here
is the Texas-New Mexico border.

230
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,553
Now...

231
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,472
all of my wells are square...

232
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,766
on the Texas side.

233
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,852
When I negotiated for the mineral
and property rights...

234
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:57,398
the surveyor said that
the next nearest pool extended to...

235
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:03,487
about here.

236
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:05,114
Right.

237
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:07,074
But after some extraction...

238
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:09,827
the west wall of the salt dome
gave way...

239
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:12,621
opening up another pool
that extends what?

240
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,499
- A hundred yards over the border?
- About the size of it.

241
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,961
And now you have the New Mexico
rights holders to deal with.

242
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:20,754
They should get profit on theirs...

243
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:25,259
but I've got two states coming after me
for taxes on each and every gallon.

244
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,596
No equipment crosses the border?

245
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,306
No, ma'am.

246
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:33,309
Nothing below the surface, like the...?

247
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,144
What, is it a drill bit?

248
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:38,063
It'd be a sucker rod at this point,
but no, none of that.

249
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,065
Only on the Texas side.

250
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:43,819
That's not stopping
New Mexico from trying to bleed me.

251
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,405
You said on the phone
you have a solution.

252
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,783
You don't negotiate a lease
with the rights holders.

253
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,286
- You offer to pay them damages.
- Damages?

254
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:54,455
For diminishing their resource.

255
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:58,083
A significant fraction of the value
of the New Mexico portion...

256
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,753
but without paying for
the rights themselves.

257
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,589
So a kind of a payoff.

258
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,758
You don't get hit with the taxes.

259
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,926
You think you can make that fly?

260
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,638
If someone came to me with this offer...

261
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,431
I'd sure as hell take it.

262
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,267
Wish I'd called you sooner.

263
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,061
Way they're making noise...

264
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,897
if I don't get this wrapped up
by the end of the quarter...

265
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,608
I'm pretty sure
the tax boys are gonna take me apart.

266
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,903
And that's two weeks from now?

267
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,865
I can do it by then.

268
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,158
Really?

269
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,077
If we get the rights holders
in one place...

270
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,996
I can walk them through
what we're proposing.

271
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,041
- If they're smart, they'll go for it.
- Well, hot damn.

272
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:44,922
Kevin said you're a miracle worker.
I didn't believe him.

273
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,465
I'm starting to.

274
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,843
Yeah. Well, let me work
that miracle first, then we'll talk.

275
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,389
You know the way out of here?
I got a drill-head...

276
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:57,184
that's acting up on me
out in the North-40 I gotta check.

277
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,852
Yeah. I'm good.

278
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,980
You need anything from me,
you got my cell. Call me.

279
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,816
Will do.

280
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,754
Billy Gatwood meeting notes.

281
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,089
Contact Gatwood Oil...

282
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,008
get names and numbers
for New Mexico rights holders.

283
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,890
Shit.

284
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,369
No, no, no!

285
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,871
Shit.

286
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,398
Continuing notes from
Gatwood Oil meeting.

287
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,651
Contact rights holders...

288
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,236
begin scheduling.

289
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,886
Howard.

290
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:44,101
- What are you doing here, Jimmy?
- We have business to discuss.

291
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,644
Is this about Chuck?

292
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,437
Who?

293
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:50,190
If you have business,
then call my secretary.

294
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,026
I did. She stonewalled me,
as if you didn't know.

295
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,194
Sandpiper.

296
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,446
- What about it?
- It's time to settle.

297
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,115
I saw the current offer.

298
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:02,286
The clients make their losses back
plus a solid chunk of change.

299
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,371
Not that it's any of your business...

300
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,082
but we project a number
higher than the current offer.

301
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,792
I get it. I get it. You hold out...

302
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,211
maybe you squeeze
a grand more for each client.

303
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,006
Meanwhile HHM nets a few million,
you know?

304
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,466
You're screwing the clients
for your own benefit.

305
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,303
Oh, so now you're worried
about the clients?

306
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,430
It's the right thing to do,
and you know it.

307
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:22,639
Please.

308
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,434
All you care about
is your share of the payout.

309
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,687
It's like talking to Gollum.

310
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:32,190
You're transparent and pathetic.

311
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,985
Do you want a handout?

312
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:37,863
Here.

313
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,911
Next time...

314
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,621
why don't you bring a tin cup?

315
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,789
It'd be more honest.

316
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,626
Listen, Howard.

317
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,378
Settle this now.
It's in everyone's best interests.

318
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,672
Meaning it's in your best interests.

319
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,591
And if we don't,
what are you gonna do?

320
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,677
Peel off members of the class,
leak insider info to Schweikart?

321
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,304
Oh, I doubt it.

322
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:05,349
I know you're low enough to do that,
but you're too damn greedy.

323
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,644
You do any of that,
you'll be jeopardising your payday.

324
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,022
You'll get your damn money...

325
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,107
you're just gonna have to wait for it.

326
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,698
What's so important?

327
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,700
Had a conversation...

328
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,368
with our friend by the pool.

329
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,246
He's very pleased with our progress.

330
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:13,083
He feels our consolidated
transportation method is working.

331
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,420
In fact, it works so well...

332
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:21,717
that our friend says this will be
the only way, moving forward.

333
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:25,971
Of course, your territory will stay
yours forever.

334
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:30,017
But this system has less
exposure. Less risk.

335
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,145
Everything moves through
the Chilean.

336
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:42,904
Can you hear me?

337
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,913
I hear you.

338
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,124
Don Hector...

339
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,835
I never asked for this.
I do not want it.

340
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:07,804
Don Hector.

341
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:45,550
Fuck Eladio...

342
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:48,011
fuck Bolsa...

343
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,263
and fuck you.

344
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:45,861
Well, we go around about,
you know, six times, I think.

345
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,654
I think we're... Yeah.

346
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,614
I think... I think so.

347
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,494
I know. It's just so good for you.

348
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,037
Hello, ladies.

349
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:57,455
Good morning.

350
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:59,082
- Jimmy?
- Hi, Jimmy.

351
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:04,713
Jimmy. You girls go on a little bit.
I'll catch up with you.

352
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:09,551
Wow, Irene. Fancy running into you
twice in one week.

353
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:10,844
How lucky am I?

354
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:13,638
You're a mall-walker? I had no idea.

355
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,099
Me? Oh, yeah, big time.

356
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:22,230
I mean, it's great for cardio,
hamstrings, glutes, I-T band.

357
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:25,358
I'm a huge mall-walker.
Been out of the game for a while.

358
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,987
Developed this damn plantar fasciitis.
Hurts like a bear.

359
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:31,615
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that.

360
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:35,744
Well, hey, I got the cure right here.

361
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:37,662
Pow!

362
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:41,291
These have a special gel
and resistance coils...

363
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,586
and a bunch of stuff.
It's like walking on pillows.

364
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:47,797
Well, they look comfortable.

365
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,049
You like them?

366
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:52,302
Well, they... they're quite stylish.

367
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,512
Hey, you know what?

368
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:58,516
I bought a pair for my girlfriend, and
they don't fit, and the store has this...

369
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,228
Wouldn't you know it?
No refunds policy.

370
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:02,812
What size are you?

371
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:07,150
Seven and a half, seven and a half.

372
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:10,862
Seven and a half. Oh, there you go.

373
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,000
How does that feel?

374
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,542
I... I see what you mean.

375
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:29,381
They are so nice,
and they fit like a dream.

376
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,967
But I can't take these for free, Jimmy.

377
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:33,885
Oh, please.

378
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:38,014
- There is one thing you could do for me.
- What's that?

379
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,183
Don't tell the other folks
I gave them to you.

380
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,686
I don't wanna look like
I'm playing favourites.

381
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,187
My lips are sealed.

382
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:47,107
Then you enjoy those.
I'm gonna go get my heart rate back up.

383
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,566
- Oh, thank you.
- See you later.

384
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,152
Thank you so much, Jimmy.

385
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,665
The hand of love. Now watch,
and I'll show you the story of life...

386
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,543
You've got some questions.
It's only natural.

387
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,214
And the truth is, if Irene settled,
you'd get some money.

388
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,468
But I mean, it's not like
you guys need it, right?

389
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,139
On the other hand,
I did get a look at their offer...

390
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:22,642
and I don't wanna speak
out of school, but it's...

391
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:29,024
But, I mean, hey,
everyone's situation is different.

392
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:31,776
Maybe Irene
just doesn't need the money.

393
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,570
I don't know for a fact, but...

394
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,823
when you see someone
buying nice new things...

395
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,783
- Like those shoes.
- Like those shoes.

396
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,079
Those must have cost a pretty penny.

397
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,416
If she can afford those,
she's walking on easy street.

398
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:49,377
And there's something else.

399
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,087
You know, the lawyers?

400
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:55,508
I mean, that's the lawyer's share
of the settlement...

401
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:58,762
and your share is this much.

402
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,389
If Irene holds out...

403
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:04,059
the lawyers get this much more...

404
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,811
and you are gonna
get this much more.

405
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:10,190
Doesn't seem like much difference.

406
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,776
I know, but that's how it works.

407
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:16,279
Irene knows it too. I mean,
the lawyers have explained it to her.

408
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,366
It's crazy, but it's all up to Irene.

409
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:22,243
After all,
she is the class representative.

410
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,038
Does that mean that she gets more?

411
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:29,709
No, no. It just means in the eyes
of the court, she's special.

412
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:32,921
She's like your Congressman
or ambassador.

413
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,881
Is there anything we can do?

414
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,424
No.

415
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,885
No. You can't do anything.

416
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:41,221
I can't do anything.

417
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:44,391
Only Irene.

418
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,685
She probably knows what's best.

419
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:50,855
I'm sure she's taking your feelings
into account.

420
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:53,316
Hey, look at the big picture.

421
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,152
Who needs money
when you got the moral high ground?

422
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,787
Rose.

423
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:07,789
Helen.

424
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,375
Ladies?

425
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,919
Ladies?

426
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,379
Ignacio?

427
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,381
Hey, Dad.

428
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,718
I was falling asleep to the news.

429
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:04,053
Yeah, I know.

430
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,265
Are you all right, Mijo?

431
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:18,693
Dad...

432
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,781
A man is going
to come to your shop. Soon.

433
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:25,492
A bad man.

434
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:27,952
What?

435
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:31,247
He'll want to run the place for a while.

436
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,834
And you'll have to let him.

437
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,924
Do you understand?

438
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:43,218
And who is this man?

439
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:49,849
Hector Salamanca.

440
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,480
Salamanca.

441
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:00,068
I've been working for them again.

442
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,741
I know what you're thinking.

443
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,451
And you can scream at me...

444
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:09,702
disown me...

445
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,164
never speak to me again,
but whatever happens...

446
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,291
you must do what he says.

447
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:20,338
I know what you're gonna want to do.

448
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:23,925
But you can't.

449
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,387
You can't, Dad.

450
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:31,975
Do what he says, this will blow over
in a few weeks.

451
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,436
If you don't...

452
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:39,065
I swear.

453
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,569
I swear it'll be over soon.

454
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,992
How can I believe anything
you say?

455
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:54,038
Promise me you won't do
anything stupid.

456
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:02,630
Promise me, Dad.

457
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,384
Please.

458
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,474
Get out of my house.

459
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,979
I'm still waiting
for those third-party subpoenas.

460
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:02,774
- Great. Let me know. Thanks, Francis.
- All right.

461
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,776
Julie, what's up?

462
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,736
From Chuck. It came via messenger.

463
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:10,406
The instructions say he wants you
to read it as soon as possible.

464
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:16,371
Here's what I need you to do.
Call around.

465
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:19,374
Find someplace special
for the retirement party.

466
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,960
Something classy, old school.
La Posada, maybe.

467
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,630
And a band, something jazzy. Upbeat.

468
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,049
Find what's available. Let's set it up.

469
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:29,634
Okay.

470
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:44,524
Goddamn it, Chuck.

471
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:49,070
You're suing Hamlin Hamlin McGill?

472
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:51,239
Come on in, Howard.

473
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,160
You turned the lights on?

474
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,912
I told you.

475
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,706
I'm back to normal.

476
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:03,209
And, yes, I am suing HHM
for breach of contract.

477
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,503
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

478
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,881
I believe I do. I'm calling your bluff.

479
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,759
This is my firm. I built it.

480
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:15,179
Your father was working
in a two-room office when I joined him.

481
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:18,182
And you, I tutored for the bar exam.

482
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:19,600
You're not kicking me out.

483
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,396
If you can't trust my judgement,
as you say, so be it...

484
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:26,065
but you're gonna have
to pay me for my share.

485
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:29,360
I believe that comes to around
$8 million.

486
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:32,238
We both know the firm
doesn't have the money.

487
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:35,950
You'd rather tear down HHM
than retire?

488
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,120
You think I'm trouble now
as your partner?

489
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,705
Imagine me as your enemy.

490
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,170
Chuck.

491
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,505
The damage you're going to do...

492
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:53,134
If you'd like to discuss this further,
we can, in court.

493
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,720
Until then...

494
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,473
what else is there to say?

495
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:19,160
Blue pot. Red wine.

496
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:20,828
Black burner.

497
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,164
Blue pot. Red wine.

498
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:27,126
Black burner.
Black burner. Black burner.

499
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:19,387
I got hot hands. I got hot hands.

500
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:23,307
I know this is gonna be the one.
B-9.

501
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:28,062
Let's hope that biopsy
comes back B-9.

502
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,356
B-9.

503
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:36,279
Okay. What's next?

504
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:38,698
We got I-29.

505
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:41,242
I remember when I was 29.

506
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,286
I bet you do too.

507
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,913
I-29.

508
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:54,463
Here comes O-62.

509
00:36:56,173 --> 00:37:00,803
Oh, my God. Have I called 62
of these already? Feels like it.

510
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,389
O-62.

511
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:07,768
Here we have B-2, B-2.

512
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:10,396
Hold tight. It is all bingo.

513
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:11,772
Here it comes.

514
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:14,275
O-70, anyone? O-70.

515
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,278
All right. No takers.

516
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,113
Boom.

517
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:22,199
G-55. G-55.

518
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:25,786
Oh, my God, bingo. I got bingo.

519
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,873
Big Paul, bring it up.
Kelley, take a look.

520
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,084
We may have a winner.

521
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,211
Kelley, tell me.

522
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:37,548
Have we got it?
We have a bingo, Paul.

523
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:40,426
Step up to the winner's circle.
Let's hear it for him.

524
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:42,637
Let's give him a big round of applause.

525
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,350
Okay. New game, new cards.

526
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:48,517
Here they come.

527
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:52,355
Get yourself some new cards,
new cards.

528
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:53,981
The helpers have them.

529
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,902
You can have one, two.
You can have up to four, as you know.

530
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:00,780
Here's a lucky blue one for you.

531
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:04,283
All right. Take your cards
so we can start a new game.

532
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,328
There you go. Add that to your stack.

533
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,164
All right. Get your cards.

534
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,291
Hey, Irene? You feeling lucky today?

535
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,168
I guess so.

536
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:16,921
All right. Well, here's one on me.

537
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:18,381
Just for you.

538
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:20,299
All right.

539
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:24,637
I sold my soul for B-I-N-G and O.

540
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:26,806
Let's clear the table.

541
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:48,703
Load it up.

542
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:56,544
Locked and loaded.

543
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,970
Here comes a new game.

544
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,893
First number up.

545
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:17,523
It's N-31.

546
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:19,025
N for Nancy.

547
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:22,319
Thirty-one for the number of times
she told me to take a hike.

548
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,281
N-31.

549
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:32,038
G-48.
G for the Greatest Generation.

550
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:34,832
Forty-eight for
Dewey defeats Truman.

551
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,960
Here's I-25. The big I.

552
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:41,464
I-25. It's B-12.

553
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:43,841
Like the vitamin.

554
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:53,476
O-67.

555
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:56,896
Anybody?
I got a good feeling about this.

556
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:59,356
O-67.

557
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,652
I... I think bingo!

558
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:05,863
Who is that?

559
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,782
Come on up.

560
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:11,577
Irene? Irene, come on up here, dear.

561
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,288
Bring it up to Kelley.
Let's take a look.

562
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,875
Kelley has to check your card.

563
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:21,587
Here she comes.

564
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,968
Could be.

565
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,473
Oh, my goodness.

566
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,477
It is a bingo for Irene.

567
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,687
Let's hear it for Irene Landry.

568
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:44,235
Give it up for the big winner,
Irene Landry.

569
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,279
Fastest bingo of the night.

570
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:50,157
Come on. Let's hear it for Irene.

571
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:54,370
Irene?

572
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:55,871
Where are you going? Hey...

573
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,957
You know what? Take over.

574
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,292
Okay.

575
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,460
Time for a new game.

576
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:03,921
Let's get some cards out
for everyone.

577
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:13,389
Hey, what's going on? You okay?

578
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,226
Oh, don't do that.

579
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:20,396
Your mascara's gonna run all over.

580
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:24,567
Irene, come on.

581
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,402
What's wrong?

582
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:31,615
They've all turned on me.

583
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:34,034
Who has?

584
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:35,995
My friends.

585
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:39,248
Helen, Rose, Myrtle.

586
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,541
All of them.

587
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:44,378
What? No.

588
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:46,255
Yes.

589
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:50,217
They're so cold.

590
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:54,471
When I walk past them,
they stop talking, and...

591
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:59,101
I hear them whispering
when they think I'm not there.

592
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:01,520
It's just so...

593
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:05,774
They're so cruel,
and I don't even know why.

594
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,740
I think...

595
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:15,159
maybe I do.

596
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:18,579
You do?

597
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:25,044
Could it be the settlement?

598
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:30,007
I mean, maybe they want the money...

599
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:33,552
you know, to improve their lives?

600
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,639
I had no idea
any of them needed money.

601
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:38,933
No one said anything to me.

602
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:41,352
Well, maybe it's not
about the money itself.

603
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,020
I mean, although...

604
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:45,773
who wouldn't want more money?

605
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,276
I mean, maybe it's the idea that...

606
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:54,156
they don't think
you're considering them, you know?

607
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:56,367
Thinking of their needs.

608
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,744
I... I didn't know.

609
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,957
I don't wanna hurt them.
They're my friends.

610
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,544
I wish we'd never even
started this lawsuit.

611
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:10,297
I just want everything
to go back the way it was.

612
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:16,095
What should I do?

613
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,889
What would you do?

614
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:25,354
I mean, you know
I'm not a lawyer right now.

615
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,065
Please?

616
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:31,318
Should I settle?

617
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:37,408
Irene...

618
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:42,246
you listen to your heart.

619
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:58,053
- Time?
- Two hours out.

620
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,680
When did I say I was gonna leave?

621
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:01,390
Twenty minutes ago.

622
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:04,727
Can I have some more coffee please?

623
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,145
Coming.

624
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:14,320
I'm missing a survey history
in this one.

625
00:44:14,987 --> 00:44:16,405
On it. Sorry about that.

626
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:19,116
Not a problem.

627
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:23,120
Hey, who's ready
to have her life changed?

628
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:24,288
Kim, can you hear me?

629
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,206
Yep. I heard you. Life changed.

630
00:44:27,215 --> 00:44:30,377
Stop your work,
both of you, for a sec.

631
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:31,837
I got big, big news.

632
00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:34,923
Can you just tell us later?
I'm so late, it's not even funny.

633
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:38,218
Mesa Verde can wait.
Look, I got Zafiro.

634
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:41,638
It's not Mesa Verde. It's a new client,
and if I mess up, a former client.

635
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,766
I thought Mesa Verde
was your one and only.

636
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,642
No, it's... I'm sorry.

637
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:47,603
Can I explain this to you later? I'm...

638
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:49,980
Sandpiper is settling.

639
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:52,483
- What?
- Yeah.

640
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:54,902
For a bundle.

641
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:59,031
But they can't be settling.
Class actions don't move that fast.

642
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:01,325
Don't get bogged down in the details.

643
00:45:01,492 --> 00:45:03,410
Trust me. They're settling.

644
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,791
- Wow, that... that's great then.
- Yeah. Yeah.

645
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:10,584
So hey, let's celebrate.

646
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:14,713
I can tell that you pulled
another all-nighter here, you know?

647
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,965
You gotta stop and smell the roses.

648
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:20,219
Hey, who's got two thumbs,
a bottle of Zafiro...

649
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:22,096
and 20 percent of the common fund?

650
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:25,766
- This guy.
- I know. You do. I am happy for you.

651
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:26,934
Be happy for us.

652
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:29,103
This is the solution to everything.

653
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,563
- Okay. Could you put these all in my car?
- Kim.

654
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:34,942
- Yeah. Jimmy, I gotta go.
- Give me five goddamn minutes.

655
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,528
- I don't have five minutes.
- You're already late.

656
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:39,947
What's five more minutes?
Drive 60 instead of 55.

657
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:41,740
- Jimmy.
- What...?

658
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:45,035
You're not hearing me.
Our troubles are over. Come on.

659
00:45:45,202 --> 00:45:47,871
Jimmy, I'm leaving now.
I'll be back in a few hours.

660
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:50,874
Think of all the things you wanna say
to me and say them later.

661
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:52,126
Goodbye.

662
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:06,014
You. Shots.

663
00:46:06,823 --> 00:46:08,225
- I...
- Shots.

664
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:09,852
We're celebrating.

665
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:17,860
Cheers.

666
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:22,990
Smooth.

667
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:27,786
Yeah.

668
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:36,003
Under the terms we're offering,
you get a substantial payment...

669
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:39,339
without any impact to your property
via drilling and extraction...

670
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:43,844
and rather than waiting years to close,
Mr Gatwood is offering cash, right now.

671
00:46:44,595 --> 00:46:46,680
Given the cost of overhead...

672
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:49,725
liabilities and other burdens
Mr Gatwood assumes...

673
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:52,394
we believe this offer
is more than fair.

674
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:54,229
We believe...

675
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:57,858
We believe this offer is more than fair.
