1
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:26,421
Name.

2
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:28,757
James McGill.

3
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,383
Bring your card?

4
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,760
Yeah.

5
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,353
Sign that.

6
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:54,115
Can I read it first?

7
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:58,119
It's just a waiver.
We're not responsible if you hurt yourself.

8
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:37,135
Good morning.
Saul Goodman Productions.

9
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:40,889
That's right. We...

10
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,767
We do it all. We write it, shoot it,
get you on the air for one low, low price.

11
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,437
May I ask what business you have?

12
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:51,900
Computer repair. That is a perfect
business to advertise on television.

13
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:55,945
Because, you know,
computers are our future.

14
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,827
Yes. Well, our rates are...

15
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:09,042
I'm sorry. That was one of our trucks.
We're location-shooting today.

16
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,044
It's a big production, actually.

17
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:14,047
Our usual rate is one commercial...

18
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:17,216
one airing, $850, but you're in luck.

19
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,969
Today, we have a one-time special.

20
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:23,973
Our elite package,
seven commercials, seven airings...

21
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,559
for $40...

22
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:30,229
forty-six hundred dollars.

23
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,106
Yeah, $4,600.

24
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,651
And we can add... Hello?

25
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,903
Hello?

26
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:46,996
No, I didn't...

27
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,958
because you keep putting me on hold.

28
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,834
Okay, my sit...

29
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,796
Hello? My sit...
Yes. My situation is this. I...

30
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:57,340
Two months ago, I paid for a full year...

31
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:59,634
but due to unforeseen circumstances...

32
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:03,012
I'm not gonna be a lawyer
for the next 12 months.

33
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,766
Yes. Suspended.

34
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:11,854
So I'm not practising,
so I don't need malpractice insurance.

35
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,399
And I'd like to speak to someone
about a refund.

36
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:17,026
What? Yeah...

37
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:20,446
Well, then, may I please speak
to someone who can make a decision?

38
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:23,116
No, no. Don't put me on hold again.
Please. Hell...?

39
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,368
Hello? Hell...?

40
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,688
- Wait a minute. This says 30 minutes.
- Yep.

41
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,441
We were out here for four hours.

42
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,026
You were on your phone.

43
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,403
You knew the rules when you signed up.

44
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,114
What? I collected more garbage
than anybody out here.

45
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:06,284
I have to be able to conduct business
to earn a living.

46
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,952
No.

47
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,495
What do you mean no?

48
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:12,373
Think of community service
as your jail time.

49
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,167
No phones allowed in jail.

50
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,544
Well, hold on there, buddy.

51
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,796
I mean, who do you think you are, huh?

52
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,257
You...? You think
you can treat us like this?

53
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:24,635
We're out here for the good
of the great city of Albuquerque.

54
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,513
Not for you.
You're not our lord and master.

55
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,768
You don't get to sit back
and decide who's worthy and who isn't.

56
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,186
Am I right?

57
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:37,315
Dude, are you gonna
get in the van or what?

58
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:43,196
Come on. Thirty minutes, that's not right.
You can do better than that.

59
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,283
We could make it zero.

60
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,714
Come on, come on.

61
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,550
Come on, baby.

62
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,472
Yes.

63
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:42,899
So come on down to Duke City Recliners,
and put your feet up.

64
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:46,736
Mention this ad and get
10 percent off your first purchase.

65
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,488
And cut. Great.

66
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,490
- How was that?
- Camera's good.

67
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,075
Thank you. That was great.

68
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,454
Hold up, hold up. I wanna do one more.

69
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:57,914
Was that okay?

70
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,081
It was great...

71
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:04,337
but I just... I want you
to connect more with the audience.

72
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,672
Like you're talking to a friend.

73
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,009
Look into that lens, and see a friend.

74
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,177
Can you do that?

75
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:13,429
I mean, think of a specific friend.

76
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,389
- Do you see him?
- Yes.

77
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,849
Okay, who is he?

78
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:19,060
- My friend Ron.
- Great.

79
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,896
Look into that lens, and see Ron.

80
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:25,733
And just...
Two guys just chatting about chairs.

81
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:30,947
Don't think about it. Just throw it away.
Last looks. Roll sound.

82
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,869
- Sound speed.
- Camera set.

83
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:38,496
And...

84
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:41,332
having a conversation
with your good friend Ron.

85
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,125
Just a couple of guys talking.

86
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,796
And you got some
very exciting news about the recliners...

87
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:50,591
that you've been dying to share
with him, and action.

88
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:54,178
So come on down to Duke City Recliners,
and put your feet up.

89
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:58,266
Mention this ad and get 10 percent
off your first purchase.

90
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,102
And cut. Great. That's the one.

91
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,480
- Check the gate. How'd that feel?
- Good, I guess. What did you think?

92
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:08,401
Good. So good. Just very, very...

93
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,735
- Great.
- Very nice.

94
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,321
Listen. You are on a roll, my friend.

95
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,240
I say we strike while the iron is hot.

96
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:16,117
Remember that other offer
we discussed?

97
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:18,452
More commercials at the discounted rate.

98
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,789
Got my whole crew here.
We can bang out seven more...

99
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,250
and give you a run
that will make you a household name.

100
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,336
- What do you say?
- Mr Goodman, I...

101
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,755
love the idea of more commercials.

102
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:33,009
But I just can't swing it.
My wife didn't want me to do this one.

103
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:38,306
You know what? They say you gotta
spend money to make money, and...

104
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,809
And I tell you what,
you got a chance here...

105
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:44,687
to potentially spike your sales
by hundreds, hell...

106
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:48,691
thousands of new customers who'd
never even heard of Duke City Recliners.

107
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:49,900
What do you say?

108
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:51,610
Sure, sure.

109
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,571
But like I said...

110
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:55,948
I only have enough to pay for the one.

111
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,744
Well, you know what?

112
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:01,579
I like you.

113
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,247
And I wanna help, so...

114
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:07,501
I know we discussed a discounted rate
of 545 per commercial...

115
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:11,172
but if you sign up right now for
our elite package...

116
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,632
now that's seven commercials...

117
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,012
I think we can do the whole thing
for 500 per commercial.

118
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:23,309
Now that is 3500 all in.
That is a bargain of a lifetime.

119
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,816
I don't know.

120
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:34,487
Any chance you can do it on credit?

121
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,157
On credit?

122
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,076
No.

123
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,536
No. I can't.

124
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,038
Sorry.

125
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,623
Maybe another time?

126
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,209
Let me get your money for this one.

127
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,389
Can we make this easier
and split it four ways?

128
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:02,932
I'll split you four ways.

129
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,184
Don't they teach you capitalism
in that school?

130
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,811
I'm just saying we got expenses, man.

131
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,105
You don't have expenses.
I got expenses.

132
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,650
You see this? This is money
I've spent on airtime for that commercial.

133
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,569
Four hundred and forty-five bucks.
Know what that leaves me?

134
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,737
One hundred dollars.

135
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,823
One hundred and four dollars
and 95 cents.

136
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,827
For writing, directing, producing,
client outreach, transpo...

137
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,203
- All of it.
- I get it.

138
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,539
So let's get you in the editing room
and finish this...

139
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,958
and I don't wanna hear
about expenses.

140
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,836
Okay, electric.

141
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,587
I paid this month.

142
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,506
Anything else?

143
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,384
I bought a couple reams of paper
for the printer.

144
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:41,303
Paper.

145
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:46,767
One hundred and sixty-two. Okay. So...

146
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,065
Looks like...

147
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,109
puts me ahead this month...

148
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,736
$3,172.

149
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:01,740
All right. What's it to even me up?

150
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,951
Divided by two.

151
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,996
One thousand, five hundred, eighty-six.

152
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,373
Okay.

153
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,375
One thousand.

154
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:13,794
Five hundred.

155
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,839
Mr Moneybags, huh?

156
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,466
So this...

157
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,968
commercial thing, it's turning a profit?

158
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:25,347
It's TV. How could there not be a profit?

159
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,186
You didn't...

160
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,938
drain your bank account, did you?

161
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,733
No. I didn't, no.

162
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,694
Oh, that's Chinese food.

163
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,821
I ordered it for us.
You're working late, right?

164
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,031
Yeah. Thanks.

165
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:44,325
- Oh, wait. Here.
- No.

166
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:46,118
I got this.

167
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,750
- Hi.
- Twenty-four dollars.

168
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,506
Keep the change.

169
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:03,010
A dollar?

170
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:04,803
Yeah.

171
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,473
We can make it zero.

172
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:47,304
Jesus.

173
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,847
What the hell?

174
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,267
I mean, what the hell?
How'd you get in here?

175
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:53,477
Relax.

176
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,813
- I just wanna talk.
- Talk?

177
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:58,315
You mean, like, apologise?

178
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,901
Because that's really
the only talk I wanna hear.

179
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:04,238
I wanna do some business like before.

180
00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:06,115
Business?

181
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:09,743
Is that, like,
code for stealing my baseball cards?

182
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,538
I'm not here for your baseball cards.

183
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,042
I'm here...

184
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,335
for this.

185
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,221
Can you get more of these?

186
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,859
You want me to steal this?

187
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,278
Get a prescription
and go to a pharmacist.

188
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:47,573
- It'll be cheap.
- I need those capsules empty.

189
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,575
Before they're sealed.

190
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:52,036
With those exact markings.

191
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:59,376
Place I work doesn't make these, but...

192
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,047
But what?

193
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:12,139
I could probably get some samples
diverted on an R&D request.

194
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,516
So do it.

195
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,644
Why? I mean, what's the point?

196
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,479
I need them.

197
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,357
Okay.

198
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:25,611
And if I don't get them...

199
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:26,779
then what?

200
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,447
Are you gonna...

201
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:31,325
threaten me? Break my legs?

202
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,457
You get me those pills,
and I'm gonna pay you $20,000.

203
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,588
Get them.

204
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,617
Hey, Pop.

205
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,369
You're doing okay?

206
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,538
Yeah. It's coming along.

207
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,999
I have a couple of volunteers here
who wanna help.

208
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,792
Well, thanks, but I think I'm good.

209
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,295
Please.
We can't let you do it all by yourself.

210
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:08,630
Certainly not after you've bought
all those supplies.

211
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,008
At least let the church reimburse you.

212
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,301
It's a donation.

213
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:15,429
Come on.
You've got unskilled but eager labourers.

214
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,014
Let us do something.

215
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,808
Just point and tell us what to do.

216
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,023
All right...

217
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:31,320
How about you dump one of those packs
into the wheel barrow?

218
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:34,615
And you, you fill that bucket up
to the brim with water.

219
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,909
And then you dump it in little by little...

220
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,869
while he stirs it with a hoe.

221
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,497
- You got it.
- Okay.

222
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,253
I'm ready. What can I do?

223
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,965
I think we're covered.

224
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,425
You're kidding, right?

225
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,427
It's not that big a job.

226
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,049
Am I doing this right?

227
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,736
Why don't you try using this instead?

228
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,323
Excuse me.

229
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,659
It's for the walkway.

230
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:20,244
Look.

231
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,622
It puts down a texture...

232
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:26,124
so the kids don't slip when it gets wet.

233
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,012
Like this?

234
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,848
You got it.

235
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,349
Nice and gentle.

236
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,103
- You're Kaylee's Pop-Pop, right?
- I am.

237
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,814
I am the very proud grandfather.

238
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:52,234
- I'm Anita.
- Mike.

239
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,070
- Nice to meet you, Mike.
- And you.

240
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,239
Thanks for helping.

241
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:01,201
And thank you
for not trying to do this all by yourself.

242
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,905
Hey, Carl?

243
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,364
Yeah?

244
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,701
Hold the fort for a few minutes,
would you?

245
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,578
You got it, Mike.

246
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,383
Oh, hey.

247
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:03,639
- You're here.
- This your idea of stealth?

248
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,391
I never claimed to be good at this.
Any of it.

249
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,268
On that, we can agree.

250
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,729
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here.

251
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,814
I wanna hire you again.

252
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,691
- You what now?
- Hire you.

253
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,277
As my backup man.
Same terms as before.

254
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:20,530
I don't wanna make the same mistake
as last time.

255
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,616
You don't wanna make
the same mistake...

256
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:26,286
then don't get involved with
whatever it is you're getting involved with.

257
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:29,581
But I'm involved already.

258
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,708
I'm not.

259
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,463
It's Nacho Varga.

260
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,098
What about him?

261
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,766
He broke into my house.

262
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,685
He was inside waiting for me.

263
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,270
Somehow,
he got past my security system.

264
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,897
I have no idea how.

265
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,317
All he had to do
was unplug your phone lines.

266
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh. That's it?

267
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,240
- What did he want?
- Pills.

268
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:05,325
Well, not exactly.

269
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,577
Empty Lydristel capsules.

270
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:11,623
- Lydristel?
- Yeah, they're like nitroglycerin.

271
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,000
And he offered me money.

272
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,960
I mean, lots of money.

273
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:17,713
Way more than they're even worth...

274
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,172
but...

275
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,550
I'm afraid if I don't do it...

276
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,885
or even if I do do it...

277
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,846
I don't know.

278
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,891
- Tell him you can't get what he needs.
- I already ordered them.

279
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,686
I mean, the shipment gets here
in two days. He knows.

280
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:34,312
Then make up an excuse.

281
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,941
Fine. Three thousand.

282
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,819
- I'll give you 3000.
- I'm not interested.

283
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,071
And you, find a way out of it.

284
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,616
- But...
- Not interested.

285
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,090
Look, full disclosure...

286
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,383
when you told us
about the disciplinary hearing...

287
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,219
I admit it, I had concerns.

288
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,554
Just so you know,
I had to do my due diligence.

289
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,431
I read the transcripts.

290
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:52,891
All of them.

291
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,142
It was amazing.

292
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:57,771
What you did to Charles,
you and James set him up perfectly.

293
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,273
You destroyed him.

294
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:03,360
Oh, my God. I couldn't believe some of it.

295
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,988
I'm not crazy.
It's 1216, one after Magna Carta.

296
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,058
The Magna Carta?

297
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,827
It was perfect.

298
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,996
You think this chicanery is bad?

299
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,457
Who talks like that?

300
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:22,838
On page five is a breakdown
of loan-to-deposit ratios by county...

301
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:26,133
and you can see, if Mesa Verde's
gonna comply with section 109...

302
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,051
you will have to raise
your loan numbers.

303
00:24:28,618 --> 00:24:30,095
That can't be right.

304
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,763
We were fine in Arizona.

305
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:36,476
Yes, but the FDIC requirements
in Utah are different.

306
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:40,272
Ninety-six percent? Is it really that high?

307
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,440
I thought Arizona was only 79.

308
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:48,780
Again, it was, but Utah
has a higher loan-to-deposit ratio.

309
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:55,412
I think we're gonna need to check that.
That number seems way off.

310
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,289
The numbers are right.

311
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:01,251
But you can review the guidelines
if you want. Right here.

312
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,382
Are you gonna check them,
or can we move on?

313
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,099
No.

314
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:20,061
Of course, if it's 96, it's 96.

315
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,898
We'll increase our loan numbers.

316
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:24,691
Absolutely.

317
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:30,739
Can we review these
fixed-mortgage rates because that's...

318
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,824
definitely an area
we're gonna need to focus...

319
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,826
Hey, Paige, that was...

320
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,996
unprofessional.

321
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,998
I didn't mean to speak to you that way.

322
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,583
Kim...

323
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,502
don't worry. It's not a problem.

324
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:45,962
- At all.
- No, I'm sorry.

325
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,548
There's no excuse
for talking to you like that.

326
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:53,011
I know how hard
you've been working on this.

327
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,848
Please, I've forgotten about it already.
You should too.

328
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,433
Okay?

329
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:11,279
As far as I'm concerned, all we did...

330
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,868
All we did was tear down a sick man.

331
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,881
Fixed-mortgage rates.

332
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,133
I think it's page three.

333
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,677
- Yes.
- Yeah.

334
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,932
There's an acquisition comparison
at the top. And you wanna go by total...

335
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:15,343
Get in.

336
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,513
Let's go. Chop-chop. Come on, come on.

337
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,371
Get in.

338
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,081
I'm trying.

339
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:52,756
- That doesn't sound good.
- Come on, come on.

340
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,425
- Think you're flooding it.
- I'm not.

341
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:56,718
You're over-cranking it.

342
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,720
You don't know what you're talking about.

343
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:01,097
We're getting paid
whether we get there or not.

344
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,641
- Maybe we should catch the bus.
- Come on. Just...

345
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:05,560
It's gonna start, okay?

346
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:09,189
- You've definitely flooded it.
- He drained the battery.

347
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:12,150
Can you not talk about something
you know nothing about?

348
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,469
There's a bus we can get in.

349
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,738
I just need to think for one minute.

350
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,826
- We're taking the bus.
- Yeah.

351
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,546
Film crew.

352
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:34,923
Hold up the bus.

353
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:40,303
You see that? Fender Stratocaster
signed by Ritchie Blackmore.

354
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,473
- You know who that is, right?
- Someone no one's ever heard of.

355
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:44,891
That's real good.

356
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:48,645
I hope your parents enjoy
supporting you for the rest of their lives.

357
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:52,232
Come on. Ritchie Blackmore.
Deep Purple.

358
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:55,193
Another brick in the wall.

359
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,279
Oh, how I weep for the future.

360
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,115
Mr McGill?

361
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:01,741
We have a problem.

362
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,035
Them.

363
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:07,747
Hey, fellas. You ready?

364
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:11,042
We got the first shot all lined up.
Can I walk you through it?

365
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:12,836
We hate to do this to you.

366
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,712
- We're having second thoughts.
- Yeah.

367
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,840
I get it. That's nerves. Stage fright.

368
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:19,175
I tell you what. We got cue cards.

369
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:22,720
And with the magic of editing,
we're gonna make you guys look like...

370
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,974
- James Garner and Mariette Hartley.
- It's not that.

371
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:28,518
It's just that it seems
like too much money...

372
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,061
For not a whole lot of return.

373
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,773
And that, my friends, that's where
you're mistaken because this is about...

374
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,150
brand-awareness.

375
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:39,946
From now on, when people think guitars,
they're gonna think ABQ In Tune.

376
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:43,074
When they think pianos, ABQ In Tune.

377
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,285
Drums, xylophones
for less than the price...

378
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,954
of that Ritchie Blackmore beauty
you got on that rack...

379
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,957
you're gonna have the whole town
thinking, ABQ In Tune.

380
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,834
Yeah, but what about the time slot?

381
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,086
- I mean, Murder She Wrote repeats.
- Come on.

382
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,546
Hey.

383
00:29:56,713 --> 00:30:01,551
Grandmas love buying the gift of music
for little Johnny and Sally and Skip.

384
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,219
And it's school-recital season...

385
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,805
so where are those kids
gonna get those recorders?

386
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:09,476
- We don't sell recorders.
- Synthesisers then.

387
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:13,229
But point is, those social-security cheques,
they gotta be spent somewhere.

388
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:15,665
Hey...

389
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:20,820
As it happens, today only,
I can offer the same package...

390
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:23,907
but 50 percent off.

391
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:27,702
Look.

392
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,996
I'm sorry, but we can't. Not today, guys.

393
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,874
Don't do that. Guys. Now come on.

394
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,043
Look, I know you want this.
I know you do.

395
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,086
- Fifty percent off.
- Yeah, we get it.

396
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,464
But we're just not...

397
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,132
Convinced.

398
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:45,845
Free.

399
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,223
I'll shoot the spot for free.

400
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,059
For free?

401
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,228
You will shoot this spot for free?

402
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:56,314
I'll film your ad, and I'll put it on the air.

403
00:30:56,481 --> 00:31:00,443
But when you see more traffic
coming through here, and you will...

404
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,405
then we do the other spots
for the original rate.

405
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,157
Okay? Now how can you say no?

406
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:09,827
- I mean, when he puts it like that.
- I guess we can't.

407
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,329
Good.

408
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:15,041
That's the best decision
you're gonna make. The best.

409
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:55,873
You're gonna catch the bus, Mr McGill?

410
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,710
No, I...

411
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,796
You guys get to the editing room.

412
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,756
I just need...

413
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,301
to sit.

414
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,028
Mr McGill.

415
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,781
No. I... I can't.

416
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:30,033
It's okay.

417
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:34,746
That's yours. You earned it.

418
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,790
But you're losing money.

419
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,126
We'll see.

420
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,462
It'll be fine.

421
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:45,673
Okay.

422
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,605
So I finally got my act together.

423
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:05,109
I pulled a bunch of Alan's boxes
out of the closet.

424
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,738
Only took me eight years.

425
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:17,872
I gave all of Alan's clothes a last wash
before driving them over to Goodwill.

426
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,793
I cried.

427
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:25,380
I cried when I washed them.
I cried when I folded them.

428
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,715
I cried when I dropped them off.

429
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,719
But once it was done...

430
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,472
it felt good...

431
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,141
to let them go.

432
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,096
I kept his uniform though.

433
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,189
Can't let that go.

434
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:46,001
Lord, he'd never forgive me
if I let that go.

435
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,156
But I figured it's okay
to keep one thing, right?

436
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:53,825
I mean...

437
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:57,745
people can use the other clothes...

438
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:01,791
but I'm not sure what use
they'd have for an old uniform.

439
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:10,049
I just don't remember this much
homework when I was Kaylee's age.

440
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:13,344
It doesn't seem to bother her, but still.

441
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,888
Most of it is just busywork.

442
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:19,183
A couple of us
actually spoke to the school board...

443
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,435
and they agreed.

444
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,603
Done. All yours.

445
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,008
Fair warning.
The coffee's not all that.

446
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:29,527
I guess they feel if you can face this,
you can face anything.

447
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:33,048
Could be.
I must be stronger than I think.

448
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,243
You mind if I ask?
I really don't mean to pry, but...

449
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:41,414
Let me guess. You have another
construction job you need my help on.

450
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:45,376
No. But if I do,
you'll be the first person I call.

451
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,712
Okay. Ask away.

452
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:51,883
You said
you kept your husband's uniform.

453
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,968
Was he on the job?

454
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,970
On the job?

455
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,139
Oh, you mean, the police?

456
00:34:58,514 --> 00:34:59,724
No.

457
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:01,309
Alan was a Navy man.

458
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,770
He was well out of the service
when I lost him.

459
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:06,355
I'm sorry.

460
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,566
The group has heard my story
over and over.

461
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,819
Well, that's what we're here for.

462
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:17,742
Well...

463
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,453
Alan loved to hike.

464
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,122
We even opened
a camping-supply store.

465
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,708
I helped him with the mail-order
side of it.

466
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:28,002
And then...

467
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:31,422
this was eight years ago.

468
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:34,133
He went hiking at Gila National...

469
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:36,552
and never came back.

470
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,262
They found our car...

471
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:40,431
but they never found him.

472
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,850
And I don't know if...

473
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:44,852
he slipped and fell
or had a heart attack...

474
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:47,522
or met someone
who didn't like the way he looked.

475
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,233
I don't know.

476
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,819
And even after all these years...

477
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,363
not knowing how he passed...

478
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:57,532
or where he is...

479
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,412
I wish it didn't matter.

480
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,373
But it does.

481
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:40,074
Hello?

482
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:42,702
It's me.

483
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,704
You make the deal?

484
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:48,791
No, not yet.

485
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,501
Why?

486
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,588
I'm in.

487
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,473
Hey, let's get out of here.

488
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:48,517
What? Get out where?

489
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:51,020
I'm up to my neck in Mesa Verde.
I can't.

490
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:55,232
- Come on, we're going. Up.
- No, I can't.

491
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,901
Nope. Nothing.

492
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:59,528
Nothing you can do to stop this.

493
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:02,990
Oh, one thing. You have to drive.

494
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:06,577
Oh, oh, oh. Look at this guy.

495
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,873
It's Alfred Hitchcock in a rented toupee.

496
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,502
Come on.
Why would you rent a toupee?

497
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:16,295
You know, from the toupee store...

498
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:18,881
so you don't have to maintain it.

499
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,886
- All right. Seven and seven.
- Yeah.

500
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:27,306
- And an old fashioned.
- Keep them coming, good sir.

501
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,351
Can you...

502
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,687
start charging this card
instead of that other one?

503
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:33,896
You got it.

504
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:35,523
- Thank you.
- No problem.

505
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,609
You're not maxing out your cards,
are you?

506
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:40,444
Of course not.

507
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:43,698
I'm spreading the points around.

508
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,200
I got a system.

509
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:50,371
That moron takes the bet.

510
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:51,789
He took three points.

511
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,290
He's a fool. Look.

512
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:57,962
- Is it wrong?
- Wait, this guy over here.

513
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:01,966
Yeah. He wants everyone
to know what a big spender he is.

514
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:05,761
I've got every dollar that guy owns.

515
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:08,347
We're here to meet a celebrity...

516
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:10,141
who's donating to my charity.

517
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,059
Kevin Costner.

518
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:14,353
I will go stand in that corner...

519
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,355
you point me out.

520
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:18,649
You're meeting Kevin Costner.

521
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:20,943
What? You don't look like Kevin Costner.

522
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:23,195
I look exactly like Kevin Costner.

523
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:27,033
People are always coming up to me,
and saying they love me in Bull Durham.

524
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,325
Never.

525
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,910
- Never happened.
- Always.

526
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,412
- Hey, hey. You.
- Not that one.

527
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:33,581
- Yes, sir.
- What is this?

528
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:37,585
- Dirty martini?
- No, this is a $14 glass of puke.

529
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:41,213
Why don't you get that idiot look
off your face and get me another one?

530
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,923
- That guy.
- Who said anything about gin?

531
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,302
- How do we get him?
- Well, I want vodka.

532
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:49,597
- What, am I just gonna hold it here?
- What do you think?

533
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:51,849
- You go and get me another one.
- The...

534
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:53,642
The trick with the coin
you told me about.

535
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,227
I know your boss. I'm an investor here.

536
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:57,563
- Or the counterfeit bill?
- No.

537
00:39:58,522 --> 00:39:59,815
That guy's a real asshole.

538
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:01,984
...act together and get me a real drink.

539
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,527
He needs to go down hard.

540
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:05,780
What kind of menial job is this?

541
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:09,158
Here's what we're gonna do.

542
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:13,370
We're gonna sell him
a worthless credit card for 5000 bucks.

543
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:16,582
Here's what you do.

544
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:19,627
Make eye contact with him.

545
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:22,588
It's all it will take for him
to think you're interested.

546
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:27,259
I'll act good and drunk, and he'll think
I'm a loser and try to steal you away.

547
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:30,846
He will persist.

548
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:35,017
You tell him you can't leave me. Not yet.

549
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:37,561
Let him know you're trying to roll me.

550
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:39,522
He'll want in.

551
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:42,108
He'll help you ply me with booze.

552
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,527
And you take my wallet
and you lift the card.

553
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:46,654
Following this?

554
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:50,616
We're not actually doing this, right?

555
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,743
We're just talking.

556
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,331
Yeah.

557
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,834
Just talking.

558
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,883
What...?

559
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,138
Nothing.

560
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:15,850
- It's not nothing. What?
- I keep thinking...

561
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,479
Was there another way?

562
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,566
Another way?

563
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:27,444
Chuck? Is that what you're talking about?

564
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:28,863
Kim.

565
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:32,783
He had us in a corner. Okay?
We did what we had to do.

566
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:34,535
- But Rebecca...
- Everything...

567
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,621
that happened was his own fault.

568
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:38,789
Everything.

569
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:40,791
You put him in the rear-view mirror.

570
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:43,669
He is not worth thinking about. Done.

571
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,427
Why, thank you.

572
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:52,678
Have a good evening.

573
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:55,139
Can I get anybody anything else?

574
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:11,447
How about that one?

575
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,080
I bet we could get him to invest...

576
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:23,626
in some of Giselle Saint Claire's
land in South Africa.

577
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:24,960
Oh, yeah.

578
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:26,754
Definitely.

579
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,174
Mining rights would be all his.

580
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:06,794
Really?

581
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:08,504
He called me.

582
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:10,005
For obvious reasons.

583
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:12,549
Look, I'm not here to rip him off.

584
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:14,468
He has the stuff, right?

585
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:17,805
I need to know what you're planning.

586
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:20,182
What's it matter to you?

587
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:23,310
I know they're for Salamanca.
Nitro pills.

588
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:24,979
Your boss has heart problems.

589
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:28,857
You already got it all figured out.
Why are you asking?

590
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:31,777
How you gonna make the switch?

591
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,740
Hector keeps the pills in his coat pocket.

592
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:39,243
When he hangs up his coat,
I'll make the switch.

593
00:43:41,136 --> 00:43:43,038
He goes down, then what?

594
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:46,333
His heart goes out. That's it.

595
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,210
A lot of eyes on Salamanca.

596
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:49,920
You do this...

597
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:53,382
how are you gonna stop them
from finding out it was you?

598
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:57,344
Are you trying to tell me not to do this?

599
00:43:57,553 --> 00:43:59,763
I'm not telling you anything.

600
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,558
I just wanna make sure
you know what you're getting into.

601
00:44:02,725 --> 00:44:05,769
I'm not getting into anything.
I'm in it.

602
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:07,896
I've got no choice.

603
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,361
Hector wants to use my dad's business.

604
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:18,073
My dad is a straight arrow.
He won't stand for it, which means...

605
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,119
he goes to the police,
which means he's a dead man.

606
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:24,872
And that's not happening.

607
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,916
You get caught, it could get worse.

608
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,252
You don't think I know
who I'm dealing with?

609
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:31,837
No.

610
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:33,547
I don't.

611
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,442
What are you doing?

612
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:15,839
There are more people
than the Salamancas...

613
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:17,216
to worry about here.

614
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:21,762
Now, if you manage to pull this off
without a bullet in your head...

615
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:23,764
and switch those pills...

616
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:25,265
then switch them back.

617
00:45:27,518 --> 00:45:29,436
Switch them back?

618
00:45:29,603 --> 00:45:30,646
Why?

619
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:33,524
If anyone gets an itch
about the medicine not working...

620
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,859
they're gonna look at those pills.

621
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:39,029
You do this, switch them back.

622
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:45,452
So...

623
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:48,872
- You're gonna let us make this deal?
- You got the money?

624
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:52,751
Good.

625
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,880
Now before we do this...

626
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:59,174
I'm gonna need one more thing
from you.

627
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:10,602
Yes.

628
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:12,563
Okay.

629
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,399
Miss Valco will see you now.

630
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:17,985
Second door.

631
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,786
Hey there. Come on in.

632
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:31,915
Yeah. Hi. I've called quite a few times...

633
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:34,710
about an issue I'm trying to address.

634
00:46:34,877 --> 00:46:36,920
Do you have your policy number?

635
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,006
No.

636
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:41,508
Can you just look up my name? McGill.

637
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:50,517
Charles McGill of Hamlin Hamlin McGill?

638
00:46:51,477 --> 00:46:53,204
No, that's my brother.

639
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:55,731
I'm Jimmy.

640
00:46:55,898 --> 00:46:58,942
James McGill. Solo practitioner.

641
00:47:00,927 --> 00:47:04,198
There you are. Looks like
you're all paid up through the year.

642
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:05,908
That's sort of the issue.

643
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:09,703
Long story short.
Through a series of unfortunate events...

644
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,039
my licence has been suspended.

645
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:14,124
Yes, I see that here.

646
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:15,334
Right.

647
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:18,879
Well, I was hoping I could get a refund
for the time that I won't be a lawyer.

648
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:20,756
Now, that's only fair, right?

649
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,967
I'm sorry, Mr McGill.
It doesn't work like that.

650
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:27,721
We don't refund
for unused malpractice insurance.

651
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:33,727
- But it's... it's a lot of money for nothing.
- I understand it seems that way...

652
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:37,689
but if one of your clients decides
they want to bring a suit against you...

653
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:39,566
this continues your coverage.

654
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:44,488
That's the thing. My clients, they love me.

655
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:47,282
I mean,
they would never bring a suit against me.

656
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:49,743
I'm extremely loveable.

657
00:47:49,952 --> 00:47:54,498
I can see that,
but it's company policy.

658
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,710
What about we put
the insurance on hold?

659
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:02,297
And then, if someone were to try
to sue me, which they won't...

660
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:03,882
then we just...

661
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,176
kick that old policy back into gear.

662
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,887
I understand your situation. I do.

663
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:13,016
But there are rules preventing us
from stopping and starting coverage.

664
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:15,894
And I regret to inform you that...

665
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:19,022
when your licence
is reinstated next year...

666
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:22,651
because of the suspension,
your premiums are going to go up.

667
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,195
Considerably.

668
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:27,906
How considerably?

669
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:41,128
Looks like, roughly, 150 percent.

670
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:47,467
God...

671
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,476
Mr McGill?

672
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:08,780
Mr McGill, I'm sorry.

673
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:11,116
I wish we could help you,
but we just can't.

674
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:15,162
I'm sorry.

675
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,957
It's hard.

676
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,501
Very, very hard.

677
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:25,172
I'm just having a rough time.

678
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:28,717
I just need a break.

679
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:31,511
Just one break.

680
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:37,976
And I know...
I know you can't do anything, but...

681
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:42,105
I'm getting run out
on this community service...

682
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:46,818
and I'm getting ripped off left and right.

683
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:49,738
And my car won't start.

684
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:54,076
My gal is disappointed in me, and...

685
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:56,411
my brother.

686
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:01,541
My brother is sick.

687
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,503
And he's alone.

688
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,799
I spent years caring for him...

689
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:11,551
and now he hates me.

690
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:15,555
He's the only family I got left,
and he hates me.

691
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:17,265
He hates my guts.

692
00:50:18,225 --> 00:50:19,601
Is this your brother Charles?

693
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:23,814
And I pretend not to care...

694
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,858
but he's my brother. How can I not?

695
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:30,028
He's mentally ill.

696
00:50:30,696 --> 00:50:33,573
And he's... he's holed up in a house
with no electricity.

697
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,244
He's working by the light of gas lanterns.

698
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,997
He's making mistakes
with his clients. He's...

699
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:43,834
mixing up numbers
on important documents.

700
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,502
He...

701
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:49,631
He had a complete mental breakdown
at the bar hearing.

702
00:50:50,674 --> 00:50:52,426
Your brother, he had...

703
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:53,927
a breakdown in court?

704
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,680
It's in the transcripts.

705
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:01,518
I'm not worried. I'm just...

706
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:05,188
If he screws up with one more big client...

707
00:51:06,273 --> 00:51:08,066
it's just gonna destroy him.

708
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,696
Don't...

709
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:14,072
Don't write.

710
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:16,450
What are you writing? No, don't write.

711
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:18,493
I didn't mean to say that.

712
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:20,162
I don't want him...

713
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:22,914
to get in trouble with you guys
because of me.

714
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:26,752
- Right.
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna go.

715
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:29,463
You're not gonna do anything, are you?

716
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:32,466
I wouldn't worry about it, Mr McGill.

717
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,259
But please feel better.

718
00:51:34,468 --> 00:51:36,470
I'm sorry.

719
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:39,973
Just... Forget.
