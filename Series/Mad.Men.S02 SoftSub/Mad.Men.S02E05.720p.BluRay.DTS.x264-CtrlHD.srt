1
00:00:52,935 --> 00:00:55,665
Mr. And Mrs. Campbell,

2
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:57,740
I'm Dr. Stone.

3
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,340
And how are we today?

4
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:02,468
We're so pleased to be here.

5
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:03,943
My friend, Sara Driscoll,

6
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:06,607
her father is head of Obstetrics
at Lenox Hill.

7
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:08,343
She said you get results.

8
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:09,475
They got results.

9
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,611
Sometimes all a young couple needs
is a good old-fashioned hand-holding.

10
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:15,589
Have a seat, Mr. Campbell.

11
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:21,153
Now, I am going to ask you
some questions together

12
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:24,062
and more intimate ones separately.

13
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,933
How long have you been
trying to conceive?

14
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:30,062
Eighteen months.

15
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,573
That sounds like a long time. Is it?

16
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,143
Let's not worry about what's normal.

17
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:37,735
Everyone is different.

18
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,042
Are you two aware
of the principles of conception?

19
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:42,014
Of how the sperm meets the egg?

20
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:44,313
Yes.

21
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,150
Although if you'd like
to show us some films...

22
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:50,219
You'd be surprised.

23
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:53,853
Prior to the decision to conceive,
were you using birth control?

24
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:56,227
- She was.
- I used a diaphragm.

25
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:58,493
Although it's possible I didn't need to.

26
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:00,364
Mrs. Campbell.

27
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:05,633
So we're walking in the park after lunch,

28
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:09,371
and he sees these birds
picking seeds out of some horse shit,

29
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,811
and he says, "Move over, fellows.
That's my job."

30
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,813
That sounds like a visit
from the stork or De Beers.

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,252
Or it could be just a new hairdo.

32
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,382
Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Draper.

33
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:25,017
How are you this morning?

34
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:26,493
Joan. Morning.

35
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,792
Well, there's your answer.

36
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,861
- Ever had mumps?
- Yes.

37
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,938
How old were you?

38
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:38,233
Summer of '45...

39
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:39,672
11, 12.

40
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:42,006
Did your testicles descend normally?

41
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,671
Absolutely.

42
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:47,614
And have you ever fathered a child?

43
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:49,241
No.

44
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:52,014
Have you ever had difficulty
completing the sexual act?

45
00:02:54,123 --> 00:02:57,149
Drinking doesn't help.

46
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,158
But no.

47
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,229
I always reach home base.

48
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,661
Do you have difficulties with arousal?

49
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,562
Jesus.

50
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,363
I'm a red-blooded American male, okay?

51
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,631
No one is questioning
your manhood, Mr. Campbell.

52
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,468
You could be a warrior,

53
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:14,134
an athlete, a bull of a man.

54
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:17,508
George Washington was sterile.

55
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:20,013
Fertility has nothing to do with manliness.

56
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:24,513
Do you want to have a child?

57
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,646
What kind of question is that?

58
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:29,816
Of course I do.

59
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:31,860
What man doesn't want a child?

60
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,064
Although you think
about the world right now.

61
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:41,363
The bomb...

62
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,065
Do you worry about the world?

63
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,970
Occasionally.

64
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,072
Do you work with X-rays,
radioactive material,

65
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,546
or toxic chemicals?

66
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,276
I'm in advertising.

67
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:59,582
We got a Xerox machine,
but I don't use it.

68
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:00,713
Not personally.

69
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,484
Advertising?

70
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:03,718
Must be a lot of fun.

71
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,487
Are you kidding?

72
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:07,119
I'm an account man.

73
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,859
I spend half my day tiptoeing
around creative crybabies

74
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,128
and the other half drinking
with ungrateful turnips

75
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:15,363
who just fell off the truck.

76
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:18,031
I'm completely replaceable,

77
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,904
even though I just brought in
a huge account.

78
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:26,775
Then you throw this baby thing
on top of it,

79
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:30,182
the economy contracting, my in-laws...

80
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,117
Yes, it's a lot.

81
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:34,246
What about your parents?

82
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,325
My father just passed away.

83
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:39,826
I'm sorry to hear that.

84
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:42,090
Do you think that has
something to do with this?

85
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,665
It doesn't.

86
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,893
I mean...

87
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:48,232
I try not to think about it.

88
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:49,634
It's been a few months.

89
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:53,903
It is a difficult moment in the life cycle.

90
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,410
But we are part
of a continuum, aren't we?

91
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,108
So maybe I'm the end of the line.

92
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:07,478
Well, that'll do it, Mr. Campbell.

93
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,526
I think I feel better already.

94
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:12,150
Can you send in your wife?

95
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:14,320
And then I'd like you
to schedule a time with a nurse

96
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,954
for a semen analysis.

97
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,360
Whenever she's free.

98
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,300
Red and green are my colors,
so we're gonna do Christmas.

99
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,376
He doesn't know that yet.

100
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:29,273
I can cover Mr. Draper's desk for you.

101
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:30,572
I know you'll have your hands full.

102
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,738
You had your shot.

103
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:33,144
It's beautiful.

104
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,910
Miss Holloway,
those aren't wedding bells.

105
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:37,281
I'm so sorry, Mr. Draper.

106
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:39,354
Mr. Draper's office.

107
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
One moment, please.

108
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,260
Mr. Draper, Bobbie Barrett on line 1.

109
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:48,625
Thank you.

110
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:59,600
Don, I want you to ask me how I am.

111
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:02,337
How are you?

112
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,310
Where are you right now?

113
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:06,779
I'm in my office,

114
00:06:06,882 --> 00:06:09,510
where you called me.

115
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,677
You sound a little tipsy.

116
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:11,980
We did it.

117
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,181
We sold Grin and Barrett.

118
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,724
Congratulations. You got an order?

119
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:19,624
No, but we're going to make a pilot.

120
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,492
I remember that because Jimmy said,

121
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,997
"Ask her. She's made
every pilot in town."

122
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:26,524
Come celebrate with me.

123
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,072
I'm at Sardi's, surrounded by clowns.

124
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:33,203
And why would I come?

125
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,109
I'm being ignored.
Come take up my time.

126
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,372
I'm working.

127
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,178
You provided key advice.

128
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,013
We can call it business.

129
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,248
No. Let's not confuse this.

130
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:49,688
I'm about to change my mind.

131
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,441
Thank you.

132
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,602
Was there even a party?

133
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:11,806
He'll have an old fashioned.

134
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:18,143
Buddy Hackett told Jimmy

135
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:19,721
that Gleason didn't have to make a pilot,

136
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:22,052
so Jimmy went home to sulk,

137
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,592
and the rest went out
to celebrate that they ruined his day.

138
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,218
So here we are.

139
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,030
I expect him to get this way
when it's bad,

140
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:32,760
but when it's good?

141
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:34,233
Maybe he doesn't understand
how big this is.

142
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:35,462
No, he does.

143
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,768
It's the big opportunity
he's bound to ruin.

144
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:52,120
Mr. Draper.

145
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,415
Miss Menken.

146
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:56,582
Actually, it's Mrs. Katz.

147
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,853
- This is my husband Tilden.
- Pleasure.

148
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:03,262
Mr. Draper's firm did some work
for us a while back.

149
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:04,457
Advertising.

150
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:10,837
I'm Bobbie Barrett.

151
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,202
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:15,744
Mrs. Barrett's husband
is a comedian who works with me.

153
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:17,574
Nice to meet you.

154
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,341
Tilden. I love comedians.

155
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,082
So, how are things at Grey?

156
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:24,846
Are they still taking credit
for everything we did?

157
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:26,979
He's all business, isn't he?

158
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,124
Now, Rach, we don't
want to miss the curtain.

159
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:32,592
We have seats for
A Funny Thing Happened.

160
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,390
Oh, it's wonderful.

161
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:37,728
Well, you two enjoy working together.

162
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,198
Nice to meet you.

163
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:52,803
So, I would like some really good chow.

164
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:54,473
Shall we go elsewhere?

165
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,380
We can.

166
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:59,215
Does feel a little cloudy in here right now.

167
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:01,846
No, it's fine.

168
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,453
So, tell me what I want.

169
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:09,193
Steak tartare.

170
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,233
Oh, my God, you're good.

171
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:15,599
Hearts of palm salad. Steak tartare.

172
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:18,036
I always order for Jimmy.

173
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,040
Watch the money.

174
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,134
Otherwise he ends up
sporting for people we don't know.

175
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:26,544
He doesn't realize that being a big shot
means you don't have to pay.

176
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:31,520
I think you're wrong about that.

177
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,111
In the end, we're
in different businesses, okay?

178
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,792
To a nice price on the pilot.

179
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:45,859
And I boxed them in for 39
on the air if they order.

180
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:47,936
You should have seen my neckline.

181
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:50,403
You really do his business, don't you?

182
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:53,941
If it wasn't for me,
it wouldn't be Grin and Barrett.

183
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:55,408
It'd be Grin and Brownstein.

184
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,378
This is America.

185
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,643
Pick a job and then become
the person that does it.

186
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:05,681
Well, that's true.

187
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:08,018
Right after I met Jimmy,

188
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:11,286
I watched somebody's Uncle Morty

189
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:12,826
close a deal for him,

190
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:15,761
and I realized
I negotiate for everything...

191
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,527
the rent, the plumber, my hairdresser.

192
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:21,797
I even did it in a department store once.

193
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:24,464
It's touchy because
you're really telling somebody

194
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,268
they're not worth what they think.

195
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,240
But you can't hurt their feelings.

196
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:30,972
Negotiating is a bore.

197
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,139
It's hand-to-hand combat.

198
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:37,182
You don't like negotiating.

199
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:39,083
What the hell do you like?

200
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:40,951
What do you mean?

201
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:42,683
Doesn't have to be in business.

202
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:43,780
I'll take anything.

203
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,321
You can't even answer.

204
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:53,060
The answer is huge.

205
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,431
I don't think so.

206
00:10:57,973 --> 00:10:59,736
Do you like the ocean?

207
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,605
Yes.

208
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:03,803
Yes, I do.

209
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,351
I have a little place in Stony Brook,
right on the shore.

210
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:19,658
I want to have you on the beach.

211
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:25,792
Feel the cold sand on my back
with the surf pounding behind us.

212
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:39,439
I can smell the ocean.

213
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:46,719
I love bridges.

214
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:49,488
I don't know if it's the drop

215
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:51,616
or just because
you get to see something

216
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:54,560
disappearing behind you.

217
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:55,960
Do you like bridges?

218
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,531
I do.

219
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,299
That's two things you like.

220
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:05,396
What else?

221
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:09,070
Movies.

222
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,672
Yes. Spartacus?

223
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:16,882
You seen the foreign ones?

224
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,580
So sexy.

225
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,280
Yes.

226
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:28,053
Why is it so hard to just enjoy things?

227
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:34,961
God, I feel so good.

228
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:42,536
I don't feel a thing.

229
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,816
You all right?

230
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,447
Yeah.

231
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,423
I think so.

232
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:36,688
Are you okay in there?

233
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:55,782
Mr. Draper, your wife says
that the whiskey was hers.

234
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:58,785
But you did fail the sobriety test.

235
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:00,855
You're at the legal limit...

236
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:03,390
. 15 percent.

237
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:06,393
The fine's $150.

238
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,825
May I?

239
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:30,809
I have $63 and some subway tokens.

240
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,386
I'll mail you the rest.

241
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:35,582
I need you to pay the fine tonight.

242
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:37,352
Or I can put you up.

243
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,493
Let me call a cab,
and I'll send an employee

244
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:43,827
out here with the $500
tomorrow morning.

245
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:46,423
I bet you would, too.

246
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:50,096
No, it's just 150.

247
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:52,002
It's within my rights to detain you.

248
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:53,699
What is the problem?

249
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:57,609
People's kids are out on that road, sir.

250
00:14:57,713 --> 00:14:59,510
Call somebody.

251
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,813
Or maybe your wife has a friend.

252
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,924
I have $110.

253
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,998
It's all I could get short notice.

254
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,050
If you're going to be sick,
please tell me.

255
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,087
This is my brother-in-law's car.

256
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,883
I put $2.00 worth of gas in it.

257
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:19,688
I don't want to have to clean it, too.

258
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,862
Mr. Draper, I think
you should keep her awake.

259
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:28,561
Bobbie, stay up!

260
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,278
What?

261
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,780
What do you think?

262
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:42,909
Are you feeling okay?

263
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,883
You can drop me off at Grand Central.

264
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:46,011
Bobbie, what do you want to do?

265
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:48,954
Jimmy can't see me this way.

266
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:50,684
I should check in somewhere,

267
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:51,816
see how the shiner does.

268
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:56,221
Peggy, do you have a roommate?

269
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:57,298
No.

270
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,491
I don't know.

271
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,364
No, you should stay with me.

272
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,529
Just for the night, if you want.

273
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:07,405
Mr. Draper, you need to rent a car.

274
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:10,069
I can take you to LaGuardia.

275
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:11,406
Idlewild is better.

276
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:13,140
The Cross Island or the Belt Parkway.

277
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:15,944
It's faster to take the Grand Central
to LaGuardia.

278
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:22,587
I don't have any clothes.

279
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:24,386
I wish I was your size.

280
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:26,791
Do you have any dry cleaning?

281
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,157
I'll pick it up.

282
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:29,821
In the city.

283
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:32,331
I'll go in and get it first thing.

284
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:33,901
Okay?

285
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,970
Hello.

286
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:40,701
Leave her alone.

287
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:48,307
No one in the office can know about this.

288
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,475
It's business.

289
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,457
You'll have to believe me
that I'll forget this.

290
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:01,820
I don't want you treating me badly
because I remind you of it.

291
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:05,898
This can be fixed.

292
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:47,340
Where the hell were you?

293
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:48,966
I was in an accident.

294
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,311
What? Are you okay?

295
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,610
What happened?

296
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:59,175
By the time I could call,
I didn't want to wake you.

297
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:00,720
Wake...

298
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:01,720
Wake me?

299
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:03,222
I've been awake all night.

300
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,924
I knew something was wrong.

301
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:07,585
I could feel it.

302
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:12,633
I went to the doctor a while ago,
and I have high blood pressure.

303
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,998
What the hell, Don?

304
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:17,071
It's fine, except...

305
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:18,230
he gave me a prescription,

306
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,141
and I think the pills
mixed with the drinks was too much.

307
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,213
I lost control of the car.

308
00:19:25,313 --> 00:19:29,272
Jesus. How could you
not tell me about this?

309
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:31,011
I didn't want to worry you.

310
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:34,746
I've been up all night.

311
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:38,849
And now I find out you're sick
and you could have died?

312
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,451
What did you want me to do?

313
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:42,825
Have you come down there?

314
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,831
Ask Francine in the middle of the night
to watch the kids

315
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,161
because your husband's
in the drunk tank?

316
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,704
Who cares if I couldn't help you?

317
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:52,035
You should call me.

318
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,300
I'm your wife.

319
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:54,500
I was solving a problem, Bets.

320
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,975
I need a clear head.

321
00:19:57,078 --> 00:19:59,069
You can't get all hysterical.

322
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:04,016
I didn't know you were waiting up.

323
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:09,921
You promised you wouldn't
disappear like that anymore.

324
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,955
I have to get changed and go in.

325
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:19,727
You're going to the office?

326
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:23,635
I don't want anyone to know about this.

327
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:25,205
I rented a car. I'll have to get my car.

328
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:29,004
I don't care about the car, Don.

329
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,907
My father has high blood pressure.

330
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,514
I'll swing by Dr. McLattery on the way in.

331
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,853
Just help me get dressed, okay?

332
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,032
You can fend without me.

333
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:59,835
I'm at a fat farm.

334
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:02,068
One of your friends
made a crack about my ass.

335
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,668
It doesn't matter who.

336
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:13,746
Well, we're gonna be
all over the television,

337
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,550
and the camera adds 10 pounds.

338
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:20,553
No. You look fine.

339
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,257
Jimmy, stop.

340
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,332
You and I both know

341
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:26,263
you should have behaved
yourself last night.

342
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,759
I will.

343
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:36,972
I couldn't find an ashtray.

344
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:41,471
What's all this?

345
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,811
I thought you might be hungry.

346
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:45,318
It'll ruin my alibi.

347
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,887
I need cottage cheese and champagne.

348
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,888
I'm joking.

349
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,150
Do you mind if I lay down
for a few minutes?

350
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:54,922
I'm not used to being up all night.

351
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,622
Of course, dear.

352
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:59,131
And I got this to keep me company.

353
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,496
I'll make up the couch for you.

354
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:01,796
You must be beat, too.

355
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:02,927
I'll make it.

356
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:04,903
- Where are the linens?
- Just a minute.

357
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:12,703
Oh, Marilyn.

358
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:15,339
The tragedy you live.

359
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,281
I'm sure glad I don't have problems.

360
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:22,154
I think most women
would love to have her problems.

361
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,555
Somebody said she's gonna
be at the fundraiser

362
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,025
at the Garden on Saturday night.

363
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:29,858
You know, the president's birthday?

364
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:32,024
I really don't want to miss it.

365
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,657
Do you have a headache?

366
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:36,236
Because we had a little boy
in our neighborhood

367
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:38,169
who fell off a swing set and hit his head

368
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,570
and went to sleep.

369
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:41,073
And then he died.

370
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,545
Well, it's certainly
good to have company.

371
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,978
I'm sorry. I shouldn't talk that way.

372
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,951
I keep forgetting the accident.

373
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:54,919
It was terrible.

374
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:58,417
And it keeps getting stranger.

375
00:22:58,526 --> 00:23:01,290
If you're lucky, it will disappear.

376
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:03,864
I have to lie down.

377
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,432
Are you his secretary?

378
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:08,469
No, but we work together.

379
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:13,001
We'll both be handling
Mr. Draper for the time being.

380
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:14,234
Now, you're a college girl,

381
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:16,708
so I'm going to expect you
to jump in with haste.

382
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,371
I have a lot of arrangements
to make for my wedding.

383
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,813
Oh, my goodness. Congratulations.

384
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,281
He's a doctor. He doesn't work here,

385
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:25,319
so don't worry about putting
your foot in your mouth.

386
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,887
Lucky you.

387
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,922
Let me see?

388
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,219
It's so lively.

389
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,489
You'd like to think it doesn't matter.

390
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:39,291
I've been offered a few,
and this is by far the best.

391
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,336
I'm a little bit clairvoyant,

392
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,635
and I think you two are going
to be very happy together.

393
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:56,817
I feel like I'm walking in tall cotton.

394
00:23:56,918 --> 00:24:00,911
Aren't you darling?
You're gonna be gangbusters.

395
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,514
Mr. Draper is impatient.
Do not let it intimidate you.

396
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,926
If it isn't the welcome wagon.

397
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,725
Hello there.

398
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:12,629
I'm Ken Cosgrove, Accounts.

399
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,668
Paul Kinsey, copywriter.

400
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,760
Harry Crane, married.

401
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:18,839
Jane Siegel.

402
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,931
Anything I can help
you gentlemen with?

403
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,443
I actually need to see Mr. Draper.

404
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,446
Is he in?

405
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:29,681
- Morning, Don.
- Morning.

406
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:32,150
Mr. Draper.

407
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:34,687
I'd like you to meet Jane, the new girl.

408
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:35,778
Morning.

409
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:39,655
Can I talk to you for a minute?

410
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:44,263
I'm gonna help you hold onto this one.

411
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:48,199
I'm not paying attention anymore
until they're here a month.

412
00:24:48,303 --> 00:24:50,601
What happened to your wing?

413
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:52,536
I missed the bottom step.

414
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,677
It's an old house.

415
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:58,837
I got an urgent call from Jimmy Barrett.

416
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:00,574
He wants to come in.

417
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:01,671
Why?

418
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:02,909
He wouldn't say.

419
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:05,645
Was he upset about something?

420
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,187
Who can tell?

421
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:13,560
I want you to put him off a few days,

422
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:15,253
let him cool.

423
00:25:15,363 --> 00:25:16,352
He'll make more sense.

424
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:18,591
Good idea.
He probably wants a rubdown.

425
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,395
Paper says they ordered his pilot.

426
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:22,060
Friday.

427
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,629
Should I talk to your girl?

428
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,798
I'll handle it.

429
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:29,138
You bet.

430
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:31,041
Get the door.

431
00:25:44,058 --> 00:25:45,150
Hello?

432
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,591
Is everything okay?

433
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:48,525
Yes, I think so.

434
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,528
Is she awake?

435
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,098
She's fine.

436
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:54,530
Put her on.

437
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,433
Just a minute.

438
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,239
I didn't think you'd call.

439
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,507
Why not?

440
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:08,980
I don't know. I just...

441
00:26:10,018 --> 00:26:11,007
How are you?

442
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:13,314
I don't know.

443
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:15,389
Jimmy called.
He wants to meet with me.

444
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,355
He does?

445
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,892
I called him, and everything went fine.

446
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:21,552
So you don't know
anything about this?

447
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,597
You think I'd be in Brooklyn
if I didn't have to be?

448
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:26,223
I talked to him.
I'm covered. Believe me.

449
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,825
I do.

450
00:26:28,937 --> 00:26:30,199
Are you okay?

451
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:33,069
I guess.

452
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,402
You?

453
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:37,540
It's going to be better.

454
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:40,011
Good.

455
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:41,445
Take care.

456
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:54,227
Do you want to play cards or something?

457
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:55,261
I think I have some.

458
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,591
No.

459
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:07,305
I'm sorry, but it's killing me.

460
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:11,007
Why are you doing this?

461
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:12,579
I don't know.

462
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,908
He's my boss.

463
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:15,880
Quite an example he's setting.

464
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:20,648
Are you seeing him?

465
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:22,847
No.

466
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:25,292
So what, then?

467
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,953
He's done a lot for me.

468
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:29,654
He made me a copywriter.

469
00:27:29,764 --> 00:27:32,358
I bet you made yourself a copywriter.

470
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:33,559
All these books.

471
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,100
He's a decent man, isn't he?

472
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:39,969
You wouldn't think he would be.

473
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:43,305
I never expect him to be
any other way than what he is.

474
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,824
We'll keep her here for another few weeks.

475
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,793
She's still not in any condition
to make decisions for herself.

476
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:02,362
She should be at home.

477
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,954
Listen to the doctor, Mama.

478
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:07,557
In this kind
of psychoneurotic disorder...

479
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:10,194
Hello, Ma.

480
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:11,431
Hello, dear.

481
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,539
I'm afraid you'll have to leave us alone.

482
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:21,311
I'm going, but I'm not leaving, Peaches.

483
00:28:32,593 --> 00:28:34,390
Hello, Peggy.

484
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:36,486
How are you today?

485
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:39,691
I still feel so tired.

486
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,268
Do you know what year it is?

487
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:45,037
It's 1960.

488
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:47,869
Do you know who the president is?

489
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,774
Dwight D. Eisenhower.

490
00:28:50,878 --> 00:28:54,575
Good. Do you know
where you are, Peggy?

491
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,214
St. Mary's.

492
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,150
Do you know why you're here?

493
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,448
No.

494
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,550
You know St. Mary's is a hospital?

495
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,128
Yes.

496
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:10,754
Why do you think you're here?

497
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:15,502
I don't know.

498
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,105
I don't feel like myself.

499
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:23,677
That's because we have you
on medication.

500
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:26,941
We want you to be relaxed
so you feel more like talking.

501
00:29:31,986 --> 00:29:34,784
I told you what happened.

502
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:36,481
You had a baby.

503
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:30,934
You know, you can hear that outside.

504
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:33,036
Nobody knows what I'm doing.

505
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:35,240
It's good for mystique.

506
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,752
So, Joanie, I hear
congratulations are in order.

507
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:42,584
Yes.

508
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,488
Marriage. Don't know why you'd want
to join that club, baby.

509
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,823
Hasn't stopped you
from having a good time.

510
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,487
How old is this guy?

511
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,224
He's 34.

512
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:53,493
What's wrong with him?

513
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,125
Nothing.

514
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:59,070
Well, I think it's nice to hear the story
of relatively young love.

515
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:01,903
Are you being a concerned daddy?

516
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:06,003
I'll tell you the same thing
I told my daughter.

517
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,378
If you put a penny in a jar

518
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:11,281
every time you make love
in the first year of marriage,

519
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:13,114
and then you take
a penny out of the jar

520
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:14,813
every time you make love
in the second year,

521
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:16,048
you know what you have?

522
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:17,715
A jar full of pennies.

523
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:20,589
I envy that girl having you
to give her away.

524
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,723
I've always been faithful
to whomever I was with.

525
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:29,302
And despite your jokes,

526
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:31,428
I always assumed you
were unhappy with Mona,

527
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,006
not the whole idea.

528
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,303
You aren't just another woman, Joanie.

529
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,470
Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?

530
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,605
I fell in love.

531
00:31:43,784 --> 00:31:45,615
Makes me sad.

532
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,984
Just another reason
not to come in to work.

533
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:49,647
I'm not going anywhere.

534
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:51,418
Yes, you are.

535
00:31:51,526 --> 00:31:53,426
You'll see.

536
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:57,488
Can I give you a couple paddles
for good luck?

537
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,872
Coffee.

538
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:19,143
Thanks for buying milk.

539
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:21,278
I live alone. It always goes bad.

540
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:24,222
So this really must be a kick in the head.

541
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,491
Company is nice.

542
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:28,823
Your eye's improved.

543
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,898
That's good.

544
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:33,592
I can cover the purple
with some green eye shadow.

545
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,532
Complementary colors. We use that.

546
00:32:35,636 --> 00:32:37,194
Old trick.

547
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:38,397
I was a dancer.

548
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:41,634
I met a lot of interesting people.

549
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:45,538
You have a boyfriend?

550
00:32:45,646 --> 00:32:47,136
No, I don't.

551
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,818
So, are you in love with him?

552
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,477
No.

553
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:56,887
It's not a ridiculous question.

554
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:58,458
Are you?

555
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,584
It's a personal question,

556
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:02,492
and I've already answered you.

557
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:05,763
You're right.

558
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,700
Aren't you going to ask me
if I'm in love with him?

559
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,674
It's none of my business.

560
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:19,936
You're right again.

561
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,680
You're so young and beautiful.

562
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:26,912
I'm not your competition.

563
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,182
That's sweet.

564
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:33,250
Is there anything else I can get you?

565
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:35,852
No.

566
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:37,430
I love your place.

567
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:41,233
I've been trying to fix it up.

568
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:44,736
Well, I like it. It takes me back.

569
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:02,917
Unless one of you needs help
finding a dead client file,

570
00:34:03,024 --> 00:34:05,049
I suggest you pitch
your tents elsewhere.

571
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:12,431
I see what you're doing,

572
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:14,057
and I have to say I'm disappointed.

573
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:15,795
I don't follow.

574
00:34:15,903 --> 00:34:18,201
Your décolletage is distracting.

575
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,070
This is an office that hinges
on professional decorum.

576
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:24,076
I'm so sorry, Joan.

577
00:34:24,178 --> 00:34:25,907
I didn't realize.

578
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:26,945
Better?

579
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:28,845
Go out and get a sweater at lunch.

580
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:31,349
Be reasonable.

581
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:34,910
There's still plenty to see,
and you know that.

582
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:42,619
Jane.

583
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:48,032
I have some very important talent
coming in tomorrow to see Don,

584
00:34:48,135 --> 00:34:49,762
somebody famous,

585
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,237
and I just want to make sure
you're aware of that.

586
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,775
What's your title here?

587
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:56,843
Title?

588
00:34:58,379 --> 00:34:59,937
I'm Ken.

589
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:02,546
Cosgrove.

590
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:04,977
Accounts.

591
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:07,646
Yes, you're here in the book
with Jimmy Barrett.

592
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:09,655
Would you like to go see him sometime?

593
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,393
Hey. Listen to this.

594
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,197
It's Mozart.

595
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:48,323
You can use the mirror in the bedroom.

596
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,488
No.

597
00:35:50,598 --> 00:35:54,295
Part of the process of learning
to live without your hospitality.

598
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,835
It's nothing.

599
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:00,067
Not true.

600
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:13,653
I was curious if you're aware
of the value of your service.

601
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,813
It's what you're supposed to do, isn't it?

602
00:36:16,724 --> 00:36:18,021
I wouldn't say that.

603
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,525
People will take advantage of you.

604
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:22,095
I know what I'm doing.

605
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,133
What do you want?

606
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:32,330
Are you just some busy little bee
building a hive out in Brooklyn?

607
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,965
Are you still trying to say thank you?

608
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:39,808
You have to start living the life
of the person you want to be.

609
00:36:39,914 --> 00:36:42,542
Is that what you did?

610
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,553
You're never going to get that corner office

611
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:53,456
until you start
treating Don as an equal.

612
00:36:54,895 --> 00:36:56,385
And no one will tell you this,

613
00:36:56,497 --> 00:36:58,089
but you can't be a man.

614
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,827
Don't even try.

615
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:03,062
Be a woman.

616
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:07,607
It's a powerful business
when done correctly.

617
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:15,438
Do you understand
what I'm saying, dear?

618
00:37:17,918 --> 00:37:19,545
I think so.

619
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:27,283
How do I get to Grand Central from here,
steam ship?

620
00:37:27,394 --> 00:37:28,986
I can walk you to the train.

621
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:30,085
It's two blocks over.

622
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:31,289
I'll call a car.

623
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,604
Hello?

624
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,337
How was your day?

625
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:46,811
Spectacular.

626
00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:49,974
Duck called Bert Peterson a mongoloid.

627
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:51,779
What a leader of men.

628
00:37:51,886 --> 00:37:53,319
Dr. Stone's office rang.

629
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,650
How is Dr. Stone?

630
00:37:55,756 --> 00:38:01,285
I didn't ask, but the nurse said
that your sample was quite viable.

631
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:03,329
Is that right?

632
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,627
Well. What do you know?

633
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:12,937
That is a relief, I do say.

634
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,132
Yes.

635
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,842
Able to leap tall buildings
in a single bound, are they?

636
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,014
I suppose.

637
00:38:24,118 --> 00:38:26,086
To viability.

638
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,947
What? This is good.

639
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,287
It is.

640
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:35,686
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

641
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:38,230
No, you're right. It's a relief.

642
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:39,492
Now we know it's me.

643
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,794
Right.

644
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:44,496
So Stone can blow up your ovaries
or do whatever his cutting-edge plan is.

645
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:47,597
Peter, I can't believe you.

646
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:50,609
Wait a minute. You wanted to do this.

647
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:52,736
You had to know this
was a possible outcome.

648
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:55,145
Get back here!

649
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,443
Trudy!

650
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:02,950
Sit down.

651
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:07,389
I'm sorry.

652
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:10,787
I didn't think it through.

653
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:13,231
That's honest.

654
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:16,060
I don't know what I thought.

655
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:19,399
Who says we have to do this?

656
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:20,598
Except for what,

657
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:22,699
it's the next thing we're supposed to do?

658
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,710
But it is. It's natural.

659
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:26,109
Says who?

660
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:31,146
I was having a great time.

661
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:32,650
Weren't you?

662
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:35,984
Maybe this is the way
it's supposed to be.

663
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,923
I mean, you have a baby.

664
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:40,254
You can't travel.

665
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,852
You can't go to the movies
unless you have help,

666
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,328
and that's expensive.

667
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:47,598
You're immature, Peter, you know that?

668
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:50,033
I just did a very private thing

669
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,071
in a very public place for you.

670
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:56,040
And guess what.
You don't like the results.

671
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,701
What do you want me to do?

672
00:39:57,811 --> 00:40:00,541
Express some concern.

673
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,513
And stop talking about
how you're going to miss

674
00:40:02,616 --> 00:40:04,982
seeing Cape Fear for the third time.

675
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:06,143
I know one thing.

676
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:09,711
I sure as hell wouldn't want a kid here
watching this donnybrook.

677
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:11,984
Either you make it through this thing,

678
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:13,889
or you just keep it to yourself.

679
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,188
I'm giving you that option.

680
00:40:15,295 --> 00:40:16,592
Stop!

681
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,325
I'm sorry.

682
00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:23,869
I'm just...

683
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,605
It's just I really do want a baby.

684
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,218
What is all this for?

685
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,916
I don't know.

686
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:53,157
Can we eat now?

687
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:56,998
Not here.

688
00:40:57,104 --> 00:40:58,264
Get your coat.

689
00:41:34,808 --> 00:41:36,571
Is that you?

690
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:39,969
Are you really there?

691
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,378
Yes, I am.

692
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:45,643
What are you doing here?

693
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:50,352
You got a promotion and disappeared.

694
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:54,188
Your Christmas present
is sitting on your desk.

695
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,456
I called your house,

696
00:41:56,563 --> 00:41:59,191
and your roommate gave me
your mother's number.

697
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:01,199
Oh, God.

698
00:42:04,738 --> 00:42:07,901
Your mother told me you were quarantined.

699
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:09,566
TB.

700
00:42:09,676 --> 00:42:13,442
I guess that was supposed
to lessen my concern.

701
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:17,848
I'm sorry.

702
00:42:17,951 --> 00:42:19,680
What's wrong with you?

703
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:22,845
I don't know.

704
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:25,857
What do they want you to do?

705
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:30,793
I don't know.

706
00:42:30,898 --> 00:42:32,525
Yes, you do.

707
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:36,759
Do it.

708
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:40,600
Do whatever they say.

709
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:47,376
Peggy, listen to me.

710
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:53,476
Get out of here and move forward.

711
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:57,751
This never happened.

712
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:04,490
It will shock you
how much it never happened.

713
00:43:15,275 --> 00:43:17,675
It's old work, and we're
meeting early next week.

714
00:43:17,778 --> 00:43:19,302
The artwork is new.

715
00:43:19,413 --> 00:43:22,075
I'm going to see my
father-in-law this weekend,

716
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,377
and he's going to ask me.

717
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:28,554
Mr. Draper, Jimmy Barrett
is going to be early.

718
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:33,254
I'm sorry I'm late.

719
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,420
Don was asking where
we're going with this.

720
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,964
I need more time. I was sick.

721
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:41,534
I did my work.

722
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:44,695
Should we bring someone else in?

723
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:46,238
Throw it at Kurt and Smitty?

724
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,900
I don't know. Miss Olson,
do you need some help?

725
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:50,499
No. I'll have it first thing Monday.

726
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:52,841
Yes, you will.

727
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:07,185
Yes?

728
00:44:07,294 --> 00:44:09,694
Mr. Draper, I'm sorry I was unprepared.

729
00:44:09,796 --> 00:44:11,525
Don't let it happen again.

730
00:44:12,966 --> 00:44:15,196
Well, it's... it's just that...

731
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:17,994
What?

732
00:44:19,172 --> 00:44:22,300
$110 is a lot of money for me.

733
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,535
Your bail.

734
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:29,004
Right.

735
00:44:35,722 --> 00:44:37,212
Here.

736
00:44:37,324 --> 00:44:39,656
I'll give you 50 tomorrow.

737
00:44:41,695 --> 00:44:43,663
I guess when you try
to forget something,

738
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,493
you have to forget everything.

739
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:49,392
Thank you, Don.

740
00:45:00,347 --> 00:45:02,747
Wow, Draper.

741
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:04,612
Some kind of tomato farm you got here.

742
00:45:04,718 --> 00:45:06,015
Window dressing's important.

743
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,643
Can I get you anything?

744
00:45:07,754 --> 00:45:10,086
I was going to ask you the same thing.

745
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:14,886
Blondie, wait outside.

746
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,829
Jimmy, Mrs. Barrett, you look good.

747
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:25,768
You don't. What happened
to the flipper there?

748
00:45:25,872 --> 00:45:27,339
Old football injury.

749
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:29,671
Yeah. I get those, too.

750
00:45:29,776 --> 00:45:31,835
Have a seat.

751
00:45:31,945 --> 00:45:34,436
No need. I'll keep this short.

752
00:45:36,183 --> 00:45:38,151
I just want to thank you
for convincing the folks at Utz

753
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:39,912
to let me do the show.

754
00:45:41,755 --> 00:45:43,450
- My pleasure.
- Yeah.

755
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:45,752
We all got what we wanted, didn't we?

756
00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:47,326
What I'm trying to say is,
the way I behaved,

757
00:45:47,427 --> 00:45:49,486
I wouldn't have been surprised
if you would have, you know,

758
00:45:49,596 --> 00:45:51,860
looked the other way
on this thing, blocked it up.

759
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:53,296
Why would I do that?

760
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:55,663
This guy.

761
00:45:55,769 --> 00:45:57,999
I can't tell if he's being smug or not.

762
00:46:00,273 --> 00:46:02,503
I just wanted you to know
that I'm not a bad guy.

763
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,969
You didn't have to come all
the way in here to say that.

764
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,137
I know that.

765
00:46:07,247 --> 00:46:09,010
Nobody knows that.

766
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:12,415
You're a cool cat, Donnie.

767
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,676
Okay.

768
00:46:14,788 --> 00:46:16,255
Bye, Mr. Draper.

769
00:46:32,205 --> 00:46:34,002
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

770
00:46:38,278 --> 00:46:39,336
How was your day?

771
00:46:40,914 --> 00:46:42,006
I made it.

772
00:47:02,035 --> 00:47:03,502
Where's the salt?

773
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:07,740
Oh, Bets. No salt?

774
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:10,938
You'll see. You'll get used to it.

775
00:47:11,044 --> 00:47:12,909
It's for your own good.

776
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:18,514
What would we do without you?

777
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:22,077
Why can't Daddy have salt?

778
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,487
Because we love him.
