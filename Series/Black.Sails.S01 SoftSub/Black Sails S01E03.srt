1
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:13,336
<i>Flint:
Urca de Lima,</i>

2
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:16,330
the largest Spanish treasure
galleon in the Americas.

3
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:19,533
A page was torn from the log with
the Urca's course and schedule.

4
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:21,393
- Take them into custody.
- ( grunts )

5
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:25,364
( crew cheering )

6
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,455
The schedule is here
on the island.

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,058
The thief who stole it
has offered to sell it to me.

8
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:33,119
5,000 pesos in pearls.

9
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:35,822
- After I get payment, we leave tonight.
- Leave with me.

10
00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:38,556
I've spent my life trying
to build something here.

11
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:40,923
If you ever challenge me
again in front of my crew,

12
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:42,562
I might just forget
that I loved you once.

13
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:44,328
The page is gone.
Don't lie to me!

14
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,662
- Where's the page?
- You're looking at it.

15
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:52,868
I took drastic measures.
Your schedule is up here.

16
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:56,832
Ah!

17
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:03,135
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

18
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:39,867
<i>( rooster crows )</i>

19
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:41,804
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

20
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,482
( groans )

21
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:08,716
<i>- ( sheep bleating )
- ( pots clanking )</i>

22
00:03:24,197 --> 00:03:25,867
( sniffs )

23
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,066
You're dripping blood
across my floor.

24
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:46,713
Whoever tied this bandage
was either blind or drunk.

25
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:48,078
I think both.

26
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:51,140
( winces )

27
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:53,108
Oh, my God.

28
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:00,517
You couldn't have told me
about this last night?

29
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:05,095
It's really not
as bad as it looks.

30
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,360
( groans )

31
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:09,201
( coughs )

32
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,800
Is that really necessary?

33
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:15,413
One of my neighbors

34
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:18,580
must have witnessed
your arrival last night.

35
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:21,950
They've planted a spy
out by the scrub pine.

36
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:24,147
The crone
with the crooked nose?

37
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:27,187
She passed.

38
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:30,757
Pastor Lambrick has a new
chief of intelligencers.

39
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,564
Mrs. Archer.
Eyes like saucers.

40
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:43,400
What is it?

41
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,235
I found it, Miranda.

42
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:52,030
Parrish's ship?

43
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,573
You found the schedule?

44
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,790
Ma'am.

45
00:05:18,294 --> 00:05:20,159
She's gone.

46
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:21,927
She's gone?
Are you sure?

47
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:26,365
One of the whores
helped her past the guards.

48
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:28,269
She said Max
had a boat waiting.

49
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:30,773
I went to check.
It's no longer there.

50
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:35,514
I told her I would protect her.

51
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,753
Did she not believe me?

52
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,556
She chose this, not me.

53
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:55,942
- Something wrong?
- You better be worth it.

54
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,879
( door slams )

55
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:09,596
When do you
imagine you'll sail?

56
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,491
We'll know for certain
once that thief

57
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:13,392
has transcribed
the page that he stole,

58
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,928
but it'll be soon.

59
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:19,534
- ( snaps fingers )
- Which reminds me.

60
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:23,367
Found it in Parrish's cabin.

61
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,140
Middleton.

62
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,235
Thought you might like it.

63
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,220
I must admit,

64
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:42,754
given how long
it's taken to track him,

65
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,920
I had wondered
if it was a lost cause.

66
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:50,520
You seem disappointed.

67
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:55,665
Not at all.

68
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,531
I just...

69
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:04,776
well, I was hoping
to have you all to myself.

70
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,711
<i>( horse whinnies )</i>

71
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:10,518
<i>( dog barking )</i>

72
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,289
About that.

73
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:18,593
Ma'am.

74
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:37,107
I need a favor.

75
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:44,050
You promised us a score.

76
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:46,347
That I did.

77
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,915
And now there's no score.

78
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:50,220
There would not
appear to be, no.

79
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:52,660
This ain't no joke, Jack.

80
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:55,795
5,000 pesos
of our money is gone

81
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:57,462
and someone's got
to answer for it.

82
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,471
I assure you all
what happened last night

83
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:01,269
was as disappointing to me
as it was to you.

84
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:04,900
But if you're quite certain my
value to this crew is exhausted,

85
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:07,738
then by all means elect
yourselves a new quartermaster.

86
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:10,240
Make it right, Jack.

87
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:14,539
Quickly.

88
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:58,918
- Where's the rest?
- Beg pardon?

89
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:01,390
The Urca has a planned
stop to take on water

90
00:09:01,455 --> 00:09:03,158
<i>somewhere on the coast
of Florida.</i>

91
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:06,727
That's the point where they're
most vulnerable to attack.

92
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:08,726
This describes a course

93
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,597
that ends miles
short of the coast.

94
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:15,239
Where's the rest of the course?

95
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:20,035
Well, I can't exactly
write that down, can I?

96
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:21,171
Why not?

97
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:23,673
Well, you all seem
rather angry with me.

98
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:26,672
Especially you.

99
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:28,878
And if I were
to write it all down,

100
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,943
then what's to stop you
from killing me right here?

101
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:36,179
I say we bring Joji in here.

102
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:38,211
<i>He'll have it out of him
in 10 minutes.</i>

103
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:40,885
<i>- Silver: Torture won't help you.
- You haven't seen Joji work.</i>

104
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,353
No, I mean I have an exceptionally
low tolerance for pain.

105
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,921
I'd say anything
to make it stop.

106
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:49,962
But there may be a more

107
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:53,698
mutually beneficial
solution to all this.

108
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:56,967
What if I were to remain
with your crew?

109
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,033
It makes sense. I forgo
payment for the schedule

110
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:05,601
in exchange for my share
of the prize.

111
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,232
You proceed with your plan.

112
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,673
When the time comes for me
to reveal the last piece,

113
00:10:09,738 --> 00:10:12,478
I will be right by your side.

114
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:14,952
If what I tell you
is in any way incorrect,

115
00:10:15,017 --> 00:10:16,952
well, you can do with me
what you will.

116
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:21,789
And when the Urca's ours,

117
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,224
what's to stop me
from killing you anyway?

118
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:29,296
Well, that's a few weeks
from now, isn't it?

119
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:31,232
We might be friends by then.

120
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,370
( chuckles )

121
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:43,345
Good enough for you?

122
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:48,049
I guess it will have to be.

123
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:51,785
Wait, we're moving ahead?

124
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:54,455
<i>Flint: Mr. Gates and I will
begin our search for a consort.</i>

125
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,294
This is not a task
we'll be able to complete

126
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,725
without the assistance
of another ship.

127
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,491
- Captain, can we just discuss this?
- Join me outside, Billy.

128
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,474
We'll need some additional items
that will exceed our normal demands.

129
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:21,042
<i>- You'll have it.
- 100 casks of powder.</i>

130
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:23,579
1,000 rounds of shot.

131
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:27,852
New guns, 12-pounders.
At least a dozen of them.

132
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,828
When we fire on the Urca, we'll
need to do more than make a scratch

133
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,567
or we'll have no chance
of success.

134
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:39,335
As I said...

135
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:44,271
you'll have it.

136
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:57,555
All right, fire away.

137
00:11:57,627 --> 00:12:00,595
Silver knows Singleton
wasn't a thief.

138
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,165
Am I the only one
that remembers this?

139
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,871
No, you're not.

140
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:07,642
Our crew is less than a day
removed from a mutiny.

141
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,915
I don't care how much gold
you dangle in front of them,

142
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,883
that hatred
doesn't just disappear.

143
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,516
And Flint wants to put
him back on board?

144
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:18,956
What if he tells
the wrong person the truth?

145
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:21,094
- I think we need to canvass.
- Oh, Billy.

146
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,156
No, 'cause then we'll at least
know who to watch out for

147
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:25,027
and who to keep Silver
separated from on the watch.

148
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:26,996
And there's a good chance
by doing that,

149
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,332
you're gonna cause the very same
suspicion you're looking to ferret out.

150
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:32,204
You know that, don't you?

151
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:38,507
Everything all right?

152
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:39,940
Aye. Onward.

153
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:45,152
You, come with me.

154
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,889
You heard him.

155
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:55,770
You sure he's all right?

156
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,770
Billy?
He'll be fine.

157
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,914
Randall.

158
00:13:09,975 --> 00:13:13,646
Mr. Silver here
has lost a wager to me.

159
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:16,548
Owes me the rest of the day
helping you peel.

160
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:19,553
Not supposed to wager
on the ship.

161
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:23,730
I know, but it was made
over an ale at Guthrie's.

162
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:25,532
It's all in good order.

163
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,438
Would you do me a favor
and keep an eye on him?

164
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,011
Give me a yell
if he tries to wander off.

165
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:36,816
Peel.

166
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,823
( screaming )

167
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:56,432
That's what I'll do
if he should wander.

168
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:07,284
I haven't seen a pair of 12-pound
guns on this island in months.

169
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:10,217
He wants a dozen and you
tell him not to worry.

170
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,415
Bryson's due back in two days.

171
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:14,320
And?

172
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:17,106
He's armed himself with 12-pounders
since he joined my father's fleet.

173
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,564
What?

174
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,501
But they are his guns.

175
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:22,798
You can't expect him
to give them to us.

176
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:24,302
( sniffs )

177
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:26,173
I understand that.

178
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:30,976
And while we're on
the subject of Bryson,

179
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:33,144
once he arrives, if he arrives,

180
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:36,620
that is the last of your father's
supply ships we can expect.

181
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:39,063
We have to assume
that the others

182
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,696
will hear of your father's
arrest at port.

183
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:43,000
In which case they won't
dare return here.

184
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:46,802
Look.

185
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:51,143
I can reach out to our
contacts in Port Harbour.

186
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,855
And there's also the sloop trade
in Havana and Santo Domingo.

187
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,994
But even so, we will only cover
roughly one-third of our costs

188
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:02,698
per ship per week, which means
in less than four weeks--

189
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:04,696
The warehouse is empty.

190
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:10,234
Then he'll have to help us.

191
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,443
Who?

192
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:14,244
My father.

193
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:22,515
I can't help but notice that you
don't seem to like me very much.

194
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,157
Do you mind if I ask why?

195
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:27,860
I can cook.

196
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:29,958
I see.

197
00:15:30,031 --> 00:15:32,629
You're upset because
they gave me your job.

198
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:36,227
In my own defense,

199
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,639
I'm still trying to figure out how
this whole place works myself.

200
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:43,110
I mean, I came aboard
the ship two days ago

201
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:46,773
and I hear Mr. Singleton
making what sounds to me

202
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,580
to be a lot of sense.

203
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:52,084
Then less than a day later,
he's dead, Flint remains,

204
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:55,515
and everyone seems to have forgotten
that any of it ever happened.

205
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:03,988
What?

206
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:06,892
Do you know of people
who still harbor

207
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:09,626
some anger towards the captain?

208
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:12,724
Not supposed
to talk about that.

209
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:14,764
Well, that's a shame.

210
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:17,027
If you knew someone like that,

211
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,035
I'd be very curious
as to what they had to say.

212
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:34,779
Hello, Father.

213
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:41,525
You lost a lot of blood.

214
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,322
May I have a towel?

215
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:54,496
I'm sorry this happened to you.

216
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:01,543
Flint wants you guarded.

217
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,609
To make certain you don't
interfere with his plan

218
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:05,648
to hunt the Spanish galleon.

219
00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:11,389
Father, I need your help.

220
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:14,126
If we're to stay in business
here, we need a new partner.

221
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:15,863
Someone with ships
and legitimacy.

222
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:18,934
Someone we can trust
not to cross you.

223
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,966
I know this is difficult,
but I need you to trust me.

224
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,007
I can do this.

225
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:43,483
Who the fuck are you kidding?

226
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:46,217
It's help me or flee to Boston.

227
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,889
Beg your father
and brothers for sanctuary.

228
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:51,394
Oh, they might save you
from the gallows,

229
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,129
but they won't
spare you their scorn.

230
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:55,126
You'll be right back
in the parlor room

231
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:57,966
listening through a crack in the door to
where the real business is being done.

232
00:17:58,031 --> 00:18:01,964
Back to where you started before
you brought Mother and myself here

233
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,670
and we made you into the man that you
always insisted to them that you were.

234
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:07,572
Think on that while you
sit here and pretend

235
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:09,479
that helping me isn't
the only choice you have.

236
00:18:17,151 --> 00:18:19,117
Billy, I don't know
what you want me to say.

237
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,885
No griping?

238
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,084
No grumbling over duties?

239
00:18:24,157 --> 00:18:26,819
Everyone on the crew is content,
that's what you're saying?

240
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:28,794
Except for maybe this bastard.

241
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:32,287
There you go.

242
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,122
Hmm.

243
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:42,192
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

244
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:47,494
I just find it hard to believe.

245
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,332
You know what I find
hard to believe?

246
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:50,836
What?

247
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:54,205
We've been on land two days

248
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,867
and you still haven't
gotten yourself laid.

249
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,172
Now that's a fucking mystery
worth investigating.

250
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,987
I was right, wasn't I?

251
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,416
Billy's been asking
'round about us.

252
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,223
What do you think?
Does he know anything?

253
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:19,224
No.

254
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,128
And if we're smart,
it'll stay that way.

255
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:26,232
What's this?
You backing out?

256
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,335
You know Flint lied
about Singleton.

257
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,238
You know what he is.

258
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:42,140
Fuck you, then.

259
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:56,351
I've been talking
with our friend Randall

260
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:58,391
about my suspicions
about our captain.

261
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:00,792
He seems to think
we might have that in common.

262
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:21,444
( sighs )

263
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:24,379
You make me climb
those fucking stairs

264
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:25,844
just to see you again

265
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:28,822
and my first order of
business will be tossing you

266
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:31,919
and that poxy chair
into the fucking ocean.

267
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,125
Philip, do you know
the provenance

268
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,756
of the chair in which
I currently sit?

269
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:40,629
- The what?
- This chair once sat

270
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:43,334
in the Plymouth office
of one Sir Francis Drake.

271
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:47,376
I took this chair from a prize
off the coast of Boston.

272
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:49,347
I lost six men in that fight.

273
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:52,811
Ever since then,
this chair has resided here

274
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,352
atop my fort from which
I survey the harbor

275
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:59,855
that I protect for the good
of an ungrateful island.

276
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:03,149
Philip, if Mr. Gates should
ever lay a hand on my chair,

277
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:06,325
you have my permission
to shoot him where he stands.

278
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,019
<i>Yes, sir, Captain Hornigold.</i>

279
00:21:15,956 --> 00:21:17,628
How are you, Ben?

280
00:21:18,892 --> 00:21:20,626
"How are you, Ben?"

281
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:23,026
Don't be pleasant with me.
I know why you're here.

282
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:24,930
L'Urca de Lima.

283
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:26,475
Every captain
on the island is buzzing

284
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,298
about who will be
joining you on consort.

285
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:31,235
News travels fast.

286
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:32,644
( scoffs )

287
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,277
Time was the thought
of taking on a treasure galleon

288
00:21:35,342 --> 00:21:37,181
would have gotten you
laughed off a crew.

289
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:39,581
The world's changed, Ben.

290
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:41,621
Some risks nowadays,

291
00:21:41,686 --> 00:21:43,252
it's more dangerous
not to take 'em.

292
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:46,990
( chuckles ) Jesus, now
you're talking like him.

293
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,462
( laughs )

294
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:51,231
So I am to be Flint's new consort, huh?
Is that what it is?

295
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:53,401
He couldn't come down here
and ask me himself?

296
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:55,369
He thinks you don't like him.

297
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:58,106
Then he's right. The man's
arrogant and presumptuous.

298
00:21:58,171 --> 00:22:01,273
Be that as it may, he doesn't
want you as the consort.

299
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:04,344
Then what does he want?

300
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:09,249
Your ship and your crew.

301
00:22:09,314 --> 00:22:12,952
The offer is one share per
man, two for you personally

302
00:22:13,017 --> 00:22:14,717
<i>in exchange for your support</i>

303
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:17,483
<i>in persuading the men
to vote in favor.</i>

304
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:20,556
And who exactly is going
to captain my ship

305
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:22,294
under these arrangements?

306
00:22:25,464 --> 00:22:28,030
( chuckles )
Oh. You?!

307
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:29,598
Oh, don't say it like that.

308
00:22:29,671 --> 00:22:31,870
- It's not such a crazy idea.
- Isn't it?

309
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,103
Well, look, he doesn't
want somebody new.

310
00:22:34,176 --> 00:22:36,479
He and I share
a kind of a shorthand.

311
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,176
Your ship is sound.

312
00:22:38,248 --> 00:22:41,312
Your crew know and trust me.
It makes the most sense.

313
00:22:43,984 --> 00:22:45,321
You assume too much.

314
00:22:45,386 --> 00:22:47,791
I'm not even certain my men
trust me at this stage.

315
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,164
Any news from your friends
in Edinburgh?

316
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:57,290
The last I heard,
James fled to France.

317
00:22:57,363 --> 00:23:00,058
Call him the Pretender now.

318
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:03,234
I promised my men that if they stayed
with me, they'd be soldiers again,

319
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,865
that they'd be part
of a rebel navy

320
00:23:05,938 --> 00:23:08,871
fighting a war to restore
a rightful king.

321
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:12,168
Now...

322
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:14,409
They'd never desert you.

323
00:23:14,474 --> 00:23:16,175
Who knows what they'll do?

324
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,078
They're coming to terms with
a very uncomfortable truth.

325
00:23:20,384 --> 00:23:23,150
And what is that?

326
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:25,886
That no matter how many lies
we tell ourselves

327
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:28,854
or no matter how many stories
we convince ourselves

328
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,791
<i>we're part of,</i>

329
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:34,097
we're all just thieves
awaiting a noose.

330
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:47,440
And what do I tell Flint?

331
00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:53,545
That after 50 years at sea...

332
00:23:55,116 --> 00:23:56,689
you're the only man
I've ever met

333
00:23:56,754 --> 00:23:58,858
that's gotten dumber with age.

334
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:15,801
<i>Miranda:
Hello.</i>

335
00:24:19,703 --> 00:24:22,140
Salted meat, cornbread, broth.

336
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,305
If you require
anything else, just ask.

337
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:27,473
Who are you?

338
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:34,714
My name is Mrs. Barlow.

339
00:24:34,787 --> 00:24:38,493
Who are you to him?

340
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:51,002
"Marcus Aurelius."

341
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:53,571
Have you read it?

342
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:56,108
It's a personal favorite.

343
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:59,012
And at the risk
of sounding presumptuous,

344
00:24:59,078 --> 00:25:01,446
I think you might
find it helpful.

345
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,388
Perhaps when you've finished,

346
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:10,422
we could discuss it together.

347
00:25:18,505 --> 00:25:19,904
Hey!

348
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:33,279
( sighs )

349
00:25:33,352 --> 00:25:35,312
What the hell are you doing here?
Where's Randall?

350
00:25:36,754 --> 00:25:38,025
Follow me.

351
00:25:50,111 --> 00:25:52,173
There.
The short-haired gentleman

352
00:25:52,238 --> 00:25:54,108
<i>who goes by Mr. Turk,</i>

353
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:56,708
<i>Randall, and the man in black.</i>

354
00:25:59,315 --> 00:26:01,778
They are what's left
of your mutiny.

355
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,650
How do you know?

356
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:07,089
Because I had a long
conversation with Mr. Turk

357
00:26:07,154 --> 00:26:08,585
<i>about it this afternoon.</i>

358
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:12,392
His resentment of the captain
runs very, very deep.

359
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:15,160
And he's convinced
Flint lied about Singleton.

360
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:17,296
When I told him
I was of a like mind,

361
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:19,561
he happily opened up.

362
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,736
And now you're telling me why?

363
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:24,831
I want to live.

364
00:26:24,904 --> 00:26:27,701
Earning your trust seemed like
a good start toward that end.

365
00:26:27,774 --> 00:26:30,911
Now, would you like
to know what Mr. Turk

366
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:33,646
shared with me
about our beloved captain?

367
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,216
Turk thinks Flint is undead,

368
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:39,249
walks the earth without a soul.

369
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:42,186
He believes there's a witch who
lives deep inside the island

370
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:44,689
<i>who controls his every move.</i>

371
00:26:44,762 --> 00:26:47,856
More or less, yes.

372
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:51,035
Fucking numbskull's been
spreading those tales for years.

373
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:54,101
Randall is Randall.

374
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:56,908
But Morley...

375
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,674
Morley I had no idea about.

376
00:27:02,546 --> 00:27:05,810
He's got no one left
but the misfits.

377
00:27:05,883 --> 00:27:07,248
How dangerous can he be?

378
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:20,191
Mind if I sit down?

379
00:27:20,256 --> 00:27:22,526
I understand congratulations
are in order.

380
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:25,462
Captaining the Royal Lion
as consort to the Walrus.

381
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:27,364
It's your first command,
is it not?

382
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:32,161
Get up and walk away.

383
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:35,095
With all due respect,
Mr. Gates,

384
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:36,800
this tone is beneath us.

385
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:39,106
As quartermasters,
we serve our men best

386
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:41,473
when we rise above the fray
and see the truth

387
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:42,841
from an unobstructed vantage.

388
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:44,075
When we indulge in their--

389
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:47,179
I don't know what
you're after, Jack,

390
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:51,219
but you sound like one
desperate motherfucker to me.

391
00:27:51,284 --> 00:27:54,691
Has this got anything to do
with that massive stash

392
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,593
of pearls you lost
out by the wrecks, eh?

393
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:00,091
( laughs )

394
00:28:00,164 --> 00:28:03,194
How long did they give you
to make it right?

395
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,163
They weren't specific
about time frames.

396
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:09,711
Oh, usually in my experience,
that means about three days.

397
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:12,344
Perhaps instead
of pestering me,

398
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:15,682
you should be out there
looking for a boat.

399
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:23,768
It won't take much for you to
lose that new crew of yours.

400
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:28,933
You may have them
fooled now, but at sea...

401
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:32,476
<i>Perhaps you'll oversleep the
bells and need to be roused.</i>

402
00:28:32,548 --> 00:28:35,715
Perhaps you'll be handed the glass and
need help with where to point it.

403
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,248
Perhaps you'll slip and fall and that
knee of yours will finally give out.

404
00:28:39,313 --> 00:28:42,848
Perhaps-- perhaps.

405
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,624
Perhaps no one
will say anything.

406
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,686
<i>Of course, they respect
you too much for that.</i>

407
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,223
<i>But the moment
the Urca looms close</i>

408
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,959
<i>and the first shot
is fired in anger,</i>

409
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:56,428
you know exactly what every last
man in that crew will be thinking.

410
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:58,700
Christ Almighty,
I wish we had a captain

411
00:28:58,765 --> 00:29:00,869
30 years younger.

412
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,014
What did we spend on stores?

413
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:18,116
Too much, sir.
We're bleeding money.

414
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:20,619
Just tell me how much it was.

415
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:23,049
- 105--
- Mr. Dufresne.

416
00:29:23,122 --> 00:29:24,889
Would you give us
a moment, please?

417
00:29:24,954 --> 00:29:26,790
We're almost done.
Just another minute.

418
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:29,685
Dufresne, get the fuck out.

419
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:40,986
I think I have a better idea for the
consort than the one we discussed.

420
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,556
Another crew
for you to captain?

421
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:48,719
No, different captain.
Comes with his own crew.

422
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:51,286
Really?
Who?

423
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:55,020
Charles Vane.

424
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,062
( laughs )

425
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,967
Yeah.
Yes, let's do that.

426
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,439
( laughing )

427
00:30:10,438 --> 00:30:11,908
That wasn't a joke, was it?

428
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,209
- Are you ill?
- Not that I'm aware of.

429
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:18,040
Then why would
you even think--

430
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,047
Because the Ranger is twice
the ship the Lion is.

431
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:24,278
More men, more guns.

432
00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:27,316
More importantly, the captain
is strong in a fight,

433
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:29,281
second only to you.

434
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:35,816
Where's this coming from?

435
00:30:38,287 --> 00:30:40,726
You said it yourself.

436
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:42,695
Without the Urca,
we have nothing.

437
00:30:44,497 --> 00:30:47,567
From where I'm sitting,
without Vane,

438
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:49,493
we don't have the Urca.

439
00:30:57,913 --> 00:31:00,977
Even if I was willing
to consider this,

440
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,551
and I am absolutely not
willing to consider this,

441
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:07,087
what makes you even think
he would do it?

442
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:12,087
<i>- Fuck you, Jack.
- Rackham: I understand your feelings,</i>

443
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,658
but humbly, I'm not certain
this is entirely your choice.

444
00:31:19,522 --> 00:31:21,437
You already told the crew.

445
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:22,890
They have a right to know.

446
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:25,697
And if Mr. Gates succeeds in
bringing Flint to the table,

447
00:31:25,762 --> 00:31:28,242
they may wish to move forward
with or without your endorsement.

448
00:31:28,268 --> 00:31:30,371
They were ready
to bury you this morning.

449
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:32,341
You're looking to dig
the hole even deeper.

450
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:35,340
They need to yell
every now and then.

451
00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:37,347
It's good
for their self-esteem.

452
00:31:37,412 --> 00:31:40,315
And besides, you haven't even
asked me what's in it for you.

453
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:44,252
You said five million
pieces of eight.

454
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:45,756
That's what's in it
for the crew.

455
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,052
Do you really think
I'd bring you something

456
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,885
like this with just money
to offer in return?

457
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:51,793
<i>See the bigger picture.</i>

458
00:31:51,858 --> 00:31:53,192
What are you talking about?

459
00:31:53,257 --> 00:31:56,592
If we swallow our pride
and help Flint land the Urca,

460
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,031
who else on this island
stands to benefit?

461
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,867
Who else might see you
in a different light?

462
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:28,190
What did you have to threaten him
with to get him to agree to this?

463
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:30,913
This was his idea.

464
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,424
Here we go.

465
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:55,974
Shall we begin?

466
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,005
First off, let me
express my appreciation

467
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,073
to everyone seated
at this table.

468
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:02,339
Given recent events,
it's encouraging to know

469
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:05,578
that we can still rise above our
differences in the spirit of mutual--

470
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:07,547
I want to talk about Mosiah.

471
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:11,314
--gain.

472
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:12,754
What about him?

473
00:33:14,683 --> 00:33:16,217
He's dead.

474
00:33:17,354 --> 00:33:19,990
And before we rise
above anything,

475
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:23,097
I want to hear your cowardly
fuck of a captain

476
00:33:23,162 --> 00:33:24,828
<i>apologize for it.</i>

477
00:33:30,104 --> 00:33:33,250
I'd like a moment to confer
with my colleague.

478
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:37,049
Outside.

479
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,903
That was my fault.
Entirely my fault.

480
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:50,334
I should have been clearer when I
prepared you for this meeting.

481
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,672
When I said we would need
to keep our tempers in check

482
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:54,377
if we were going to make
this meeting happen,

483
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:56,176
I should have specified
we'd need to do so

484
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:58,675
for the duration
of the meeting as well.

485
00:33:58,741 --> 00:34:00,411
Not to worry.
A simple setback.

486
00:34:00,477 --> 00:34:02,612
Now we have clarity
and a unity of vision.

487
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:04,612
I feel good.
You?

488
00:34:10,422 --> 00:34:13,326
( sighs ) All righty, then.

489
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:24,740
What Captain Flint meant to say

490
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,348
<i>is that we have a crew
to answer to.</i>

491
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:30,348
<i>And whether we can reach an agreement
around this table is meaningless</i>

492
00:34:30,414 --> 00:34:32,621
if we can't sell it to our men.

493
00:34:32,686 --> 00:34:35,053
Having lost a valued
and respected brother,

494
00:34:35,118 --> 00:34:37,852
they will want to know
what's been done about it.

495
00:34:40,724 --> 00:34:43,195
Without accepting
responsibility

496
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,732
for your loss,

497
00:34:44,797 --> 00:34:47,798
I can see a small
allowance being made

498
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:49,405
for goodwill.

499
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,508
How much did you have in mind?

500
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:55,804
£10,000.

501
00:34:58,614 --> 00:35:00,380
<i>That's for Mosiah.</i>

502
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:03,381
Now let's talk about
his man that you killed.

503
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:08,021
( sighs )

504
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:10,124
No, that's all right.
We can wait.

505
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:14,797
<i>( Gates shouting )</i>

506
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,261
Well, at this rate,
the Urca will get to Cadiz

507
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:19,467
and back again before
we resolve anything.

508
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:24,404
I'm gonna take a piss.

509
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:33,979
Be honest.

510
00:35:35,348 --> 00:35:38,281
Are you as surprised as I am...

511
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:41,049
that I'm the only one here
behaving myself?

512
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:52,836
( sniffs )

513
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,403
A share per man,
two for the captain,

514
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:57,035
two additional
for use of the ship,

515
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,969
and five set aside in a fund
to offset injury payments.

516
00:36:05,612 --> 00:36:07,011
Share and a half
for the captain,

517
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:08,882
one for the ship.

518
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:10,282
Injuries come out of your end.

519
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:14,156
But your men get priority on...

520
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:16,259
unique items.

521
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,261
Ooh.

522
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:26,834
Done.

523
00:36:26,899 --> 00:36:28,433
Oh, just one more thing.

524
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:30,200
Don't push your luck, Jack.

525
00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:31,600
No, no, the terms
are agreeable.

526
00:36:31,665 --> 00:36:33,368
My concern is
who will enforce them?

527
00:36:34,638 --> 00:36:36,300
What the fuck
are you talking about?

528
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:40,107
Your role in propping up
Captain Flint was made clear

529
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:42,276
when you assaulted my captain
the other night.

530
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:44,181
What's to stop you from
altering the terms of the deal

531
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:47,045
after the fact to see it suit
a more favored party?

532
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:49,413
<i>I'd feel much better
if our deal</i>

533
00:36:49,485 --> 00:36:52,116
had a more impartial guarantor.

534
00:36:52,189 --> 00:36:54,420
And who did you have in mind?

535
00:36:54,486 --> 00:36:56,222
The only person around here
that isn't beholden

536
00:36:56,295 --> 00:36:58,231
to Miss Guthrie
for their livelihood.

537
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,093
<i>- Her father.
- Gates: Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

538
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:06,141
What have we been doing here all day if
you're planning on pulling this shit?

539
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:08,733
Certainly he can be persuaded
to come down off the mountain,

540
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:11,037
as it were, and bless
our little arrangement.

541
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:16,142
Unless I'm missing something.

542
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:18,618
My father doesn't know
about this.

543
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:22,322
I see.

544
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:26,162
But you have my word
these terms shall be honored.

545
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:29,795
Perhaps it would be wise
to revisit our terms

546
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:31,595
to account for this added risk.

547
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:33,829
<i>Gates: No one's revisiting shit.
We had a fucking deal.</i>

548
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:35,436
- I've heard enough.
- ( sighs )

549
00:37:36,942 --> 00:37:38,909
<i>Vane:
The terms are fine.</i>

550
00:37:42,817 --> 00:37:44,617
Her word's good enough for me.

551
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:49,656
And it's good enough
for you, too.

552
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:55,262
Well...

553
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,433
can we consider this a deal?

554
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:18,091
Rackham:
I was getting somewhere.

555
00:38:18,156 --> 00:38:21,457
You're too clever
for your own good, Jack.

556
00:38:21,522 --> 00:38:24,425
Regardless, our fortunes
appear to be on the rise.

557
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:29,264
So...

558
00:38:31,198 --> 00:38:34,299
perhaps it's time you finished
cleaning up last night's mess

559
00:38:34,364 --> 00:38:36,497
before someone finds out

560
00:38:36,562 --> 00:38:39,801
and everything we've achieved
here goes up in smoke.

561
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,335
( sighs )

562
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,412
She's all yours, Captain.

563
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,544
You do understand

564
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:26,574
I had no choice.

565
00:39:28,712 --> 00:39:31,552
What you did,

566
00:39:31,617 --> 00:39:33,425
it required an answer.

567
00:39:44,202 --> 00:39:46,169
<i>I've been meaning to ask you.</i>

568
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:51,211
Our mutual friend,

569
00:39:51,277 --> 00:39:53,212
<i>she put guards at your door,</i>

570
00:39:53,277 --> 00:39:55,076
<i>tried to protect you.</i>

571
00:39:55,149 --> 00:39:58,520
Yet you left anyway.

572
00:39:59,657 --> 00:40:00,959
Why?

573
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:05,790
You really have to ask?

574
00:40:09,064 --> 00:40:10,694
How did you feel

575
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:13,837
when she threw you aside?

576
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:25,341
( exhales )

577
00:40:28,246 --> 00:40:31,021
When she's ready,
get her on a boat.

578
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:34,590
Captain, this isn't
what I meant by cleaning up.

579
00:40:36,296 --> 00:40:37,995
<i>What if she comes back?</i>

580
00:40:41,207 --> 00:40:42,302
She won't.

581
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:49,021
Do it after dark.

582
00:40:51,156 --> 00:40:53,322
And do it quietly.

583
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,687
<i>Man:
Mrs. Barlow.</i>

584
00:41:21,517 --> 00:41:24,723
I'm sorry. You're expecting company.
I can return another time.

585
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:27,524
Pastor Lambrick,
you have happened by here

586
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:29,123
every Wednesday for months now.

587
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:31,426
<i>I've grown tired
of acting surprised,</i>

588
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:33,660
so I have instead
decided this Wednesday

589
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:35,100
to receive you properly.

590
00:41:36,837 --> 00:41:39,171
I beg your pardon. I'm
afraid I've become a burden.

591
00:41:39,236 --> 00:41:41,703
Far from it.

592
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:44,071
I look forward
to our conversations.

593
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:45,810
Please, sit?

594
00:41:57,988 --> 00:41:59,859
( snoring softly )

595
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:08,465
This week's sermon?

596
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,697
( chuckles )

597
00:42:09,762 --> 00:42:12,328
Your thoughts
are always enlightening.

598
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,201
Ahem.

599
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:20,906
Easter.
Is it Easter already?

600
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:34,134
"It is Christ's love of sinners
that gave him the strength

601
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,335
to endure his agony.

602
00:42:36,408 --> 00:42:38,672
This, the truest form of love,

603
00:42:38,745 --> 00:42:40,609
love through suffering--"

604
00:42:42,714 --> 00:42:44,314
Do you believe this?

605
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:47,157
It's not to be believed
or disbelieved.

606
00:42:47,222 --> 00:42:49,492
It's God's gospel truth,
is it not?

607
00:42:54,999 --> 00:42:58,029
"Thy navel is like
a round goblet

608
00:42:58,102 --> 00:43:00,638
which wanteth not liquor.

609
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:04,439
Thy belly is like
a heap of wheat

610
00:43:04,512 --> 00:43:06,576
set about with lilies.

611
00:43:07,714 --> 00:43:11,049
Thy breasts are like two fawns,

612
00:43:11,114 --> 00:43:14,217
twins of a gazelle.

613
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,624
Thy stature is like
that of a palm tree

614
00:43:17,689 --> 00:43:21,096
and thy breasts like
clusters of grapes.

615
00:43:23,194 --> 00:43:25,835
I will go up the palm tree

616
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,340
and take hold
of its fruits."

617
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:32,704
God wrote that, too.

618
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:37,777
True love shouldn't
require suffering.

619
00:43:37,842 --> 00:43:40,115
And you don't have
to take my word for it.

620
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:43,388
More tea?

621
00:44:09,374 --> 00:44:12,710
I must confess there is an
ulterior motive for my visit today

622
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,709
beyond the content
of my sermon.

623
00:44:14,782 --> 00:44:17,012
Is that so?

624
00:44:17,077 --> 00:44:20,414
There are whispers
among my flock

625
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:22,190
that a ship of the Royal Navy

626
00:44:22,255 --> 00:44:25,023
docked in Harbour Island
recently.

627
00:44:25,088 --> 00:44:27,361
The Scarborough.

628
00:44:27,426 --> 00:44:31,133
They say the king means to
reassert colonial rule here.

629
00:44:31,206 --> 00:44:33,502
Perhaps soon.

630
00:44:33,574 --> 00:44:37,044
Judgment in this world,
not the next.

631
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,107
For those who are
a part of my flock

632
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:41,074
when that judgment arrives,

633
00:44:41,147 --> 00:44:43,976
their righteousness will almost
certainly go beyond doubt.

634
00:44:45,346 --> 00:44:47,885
It's not quite
that simple for me.

635
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,453
Is he keeping you here?

636
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,295
<i>Good day, Pastor.</i>

637
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:16,343
<i>( floor creaks )</i>

638
00:45:40,431 --> 00:45:43,135
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

639
00:46:00,862 --> 00:46:03,367
( breathing heavily )

640
00:46:09,581 --> 00:46:11,147
Ah!

641
00:46:28,533 --> 00:46:30,230
- ( grunts )
- ( moans )

642
00:46:43,982 --> 00:46:45,844
Hello, Jack.

643
00:46:47,748 --> 00:46:49,653
Gentlemen.

644
00:46:49,718 --> 00:46:52,021
The captain might
have brought her here...

645
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:57,429
but it's up to us
when we're done with her.

646
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:41,768
<i>( Max screaming )</i>

647
00:47:42,938 --> 00:47:44,940
Captain, the men.
I need you now.

648
00:47:45,005 --> 00:47:46,373
Oh, shit.

649
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,547
Eleanor, wait.

650
00:47:50,612 --> 00:47:52,084
- Fuck.
- Shit.

651
00:48:13,173 --> 00:48:15,343
( grunts )

652
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,543
Fuck you!

653
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:24,351
( whimpering )

654
00:48:32,722 --> 00:48:33,985
You did this.

655
00:48:45,687 --> 00:48:47,421
Listen to me very carefully.

656
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:51,600
You are, all of you,
this whole crew,

657
00:48:51,665 --> 00:48:53,831
as of right now finished!

658
00:48:53,896 --> 00:48:58,367
<i>You will not sell anything.
You will not buy anything.</i>

659
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,176
You will not eat anything.

660
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:02,375
Eleanor.

661
00:49:04,544 --> 00:49:07,247
Unless--

662
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,320
unless you decide right now

663
00:49:12,385 --> 00:49:14,152
to elect yourselves
a new captain.

664
00:49:17,762 --> 00:49:20,329
( men murmuring )

665
00:49:20,395 --> 00:49:24,002
Unless you decide to join
the crew of Captain Flint.

666
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,705
You will join his crew and you will
grant him disposal of your ship.

667
00:49:33,073 --> 00:49:35,839
So what will it be?

668
00:49:35,911 --> 00:49:38,311
Beggars under an old captain?

669
00:49:40,448 --> 00:49:42,751
Or rich men under a new one?

670
00:49:51,528 --> 00:49:53,561
Where are you going?

671
00:50:21,382 --> 00:50:24,158
You move, you die.

672
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,466
Get the fuck away from her!

673
00:50:38,907 --> 00:50:40,338
I'm so sorry.

674
00:50:40,403 --> 00:50:42,740
I'm so sorry
he did this to you.

675
00:50:42,813 --> 00:50:44,829
Let me take care of you.

676
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,315
We could have left.

677
00:50:50,049 --> 00:50:52,479
We could have been free.

678
00:50:54,016 --> 00:50:55,782
He didn't do this to me.

679
00:50:58,488 --> 00:50:59,920
You did.

680
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:15,839
My actions cost you
your pearls.

681
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:20,410
Until the debt is paid,

682
00:51:20,475 --> 00:51:22,210
I am yours.

683
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:43,738
What the hell just happened?

684
00:51:45,926 --> 00:51:48,326
It looks like she
just gave us a ship.

685
00:51:50,967 --> 00:51:52,900
A ship with no captain.

686
00:52:06,911 --> 00:52:08,847
<i>( bell rings )</i>

687
00:52:22,669 --> 00:52:25,039
Billy.

688
00:52:25,112 --> 00:52:26,975
Is my watch up?

689
00:52:33,282 --> 00:52:35,857
So, what now?

690
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:38,921
You here to threaten me?

691
00:52:38,994 --> 00:52:41,362
What the captain wants
to accomplish here,

692
00:52:41,427 --> 00:52:44,229
our survival hangs
in the balance.

693
00:52:44,302 --> 00:52:47,007
And I need to know we're all
pulling in the same direction.

694
00:52:48,334 --> 00:52:51,068
I've got a right
to think what I think.

695
00:52:51,141 --> 00:52:52,375
Well, then say it.

696
00:52:55,018 --> 00:52:57,278
Singleton was no thief.

697
00:52:57,351 --> 00:53:01,119
He had his warts, but
thieving wasn't one of them.

698
00:53:01,184 --> 00:53:03,656
Singleton stole the page.

699
00:53:03,721 --> 00:53:05,725
Saw it with my own eyes.

700
00:53:09,065 --> 00:53:10,433
You calling me a liar?

701
00:53:14,265 --> 00:53:15,905
Oh, fuck!

702
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,511
I may be wrong about Singleton,

703
00:53:25,576 --> 00:53:28,113
but I'm not wrong about Flint.

704
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,920
What's that supposed to mean?

705
00:53:31,985 --> 00:53:34,692
To him, we're all disposable.

706
00:53:35,704 --> 00:53:38,669
Chits to be used
for his own purposes.

707
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,974
I don't believe that.

708
00:53:47,677 --> 00:53:52,283
That's because you don't
know about Mrs. Barlow.

709
00:54:03,795 --> 00:54:05,530
You were right.

710
00:54:06,762 --> 00:54:09,330
This is a remarkable book.

711
00:54:20,535 --> 00:54:21,973
May I?

712
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:39,484
The emperor writes,

713
00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:41,883
"How should you be?

714
00:54:41,948 --> 00:54:45,023
You should be like
a rocky promontory

715
00:54:45,088 --> 00:54:49,226
against which the restless
surf continually pounds.

716
00:54:50,436 --> 00:54:53,669
It stands fast
while the churning sea

717
00:54:53,734 --> 00:54:56,839
is lulled to sleep at its feet.

718
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:03,816
<i>I hear you say, 'How unlucky</i>

719
00:55:03,881 --> 00:55:06,257
<i>that this should
happen to me.'</i>

720
00:55:11,087 --> 00:55:12,855
<i>But not at all.</i>

721
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:18,824
<i>Perhaps say instead,</i>

722
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:20,896
<i>'How lucky I am</i>

723
00:55:20,961 --> 00:55:25,361
<i>that I am not broken
by what has happened</i>

724
00:55:25,434 --> 00:55:29,170
<i>and I'm not afraid
of what is about to happen.'</i>

725
00:55:30,707 --> 00:55:34,407
<i>For the same blow
might have struck anyone,</i>

726
00:55:34,472 --> 00:55:37,288
but not many who would
have absorbed it

727
00:55:37,513 --> 00:55:40,845
without capitulation
or complaint."
