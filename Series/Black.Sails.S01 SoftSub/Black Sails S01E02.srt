1
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:15,322
GATES: Singleton, he has the votes
to remove you as captain.

2
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:17,724
They think he has any idea how
to put money in their pockets?

3
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:19,332
Landfall. We're home.

4
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:21,933
- SILVER: Is this English soil?
- LOGAN: It was once.

5
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:23,902
- Whose is it?
- Ours. (Laughs)

6
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:26,743
You screwed me tonight.
Flint, his captaincy, I had an interest.

7
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:29,509
When the sea grows rough,
you come to Max.

8
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:34,182
L'Urca de Lima.
Total cargo of $5 million.

9
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:35,551
Take them into custody.

10
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:39,184
What happened with Richard?

11
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:42,621
Someone tore from this log
the very page necessary

12
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:45,356
to discover that prize
and then stoked your resentment

13
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,525
to make himself your captain.

14
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,895
It's the stolen page.

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,304
MAX: A whore for every
finger on your hand,

16
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:55,169
but your eyes keep drifting to this.

17
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:58,038
I think I have something
you might want to buy.

18
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:38,607
(Birds chirping)

19
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,756
(Chatter)

20
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:19,067
When my father still lived here,
this place was a fucking mess.

21
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,307
Men just fucked in tents,

22
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:23,103
threw their shit in the streets.

23
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:26,669
I wonder if he didn't notice
everyone living like animals

24
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:28,140
or if he just didn't care.

25
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:31,138
Why all this talk of your father?

26
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,072
A man-o'-war was spotted yesterday.

27
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:36,107
Royal Navy.

28
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:43,044
What if today's the day?

29
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:45,283
What if Scott
is downstairs right now

30
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:46,947
waiting to give me the news?

31
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,985
The British are back.
Decamp from Nassau.

32
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,754
And then what?

33
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,289
Then they blockade the island,
choke off trade.

34
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,159
A few crews will resist,

35
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:02,126
but how long can they survive
without my father's support?

36
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:04,495
One by one their numbers
will dwindle.

37
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:06,063
The fort will be abandoned.

38
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:08,061
Soldiers will storm the beach.

39
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,833
By the time the smoke clears,
my father will have arrived.

40
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:16,001
First time he's set foot
here in five years

41
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:18,871
waving the royal commission
that his bribes purchased

42
00:04:18,936 --> 00:04:20,407
and lording over the place.

43
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:22,603
Round of applause,

44
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:24,802
the new governor.

45
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:28,737
Somewhere in London, some foul
fuck will get news of all of this,

46
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,642
light his pipe and say,

47
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:34,912
"Finally, all is right again
in Nassau."

48
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:38,749
You say this as if it is certain.

49
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,947
Perhaps you can buy this place.

50
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,050
Nassau will need an inn.

51
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:47,049
Max could be your partner.

52
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:49,289
There is no finer host in the world.

53
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:52,322
How will Mr. Noonan feel
when he hears of this plan?

54
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:55,055
I think maybe soon
what Mr. Noonan feels

55
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,495
will be of no concern to me.

56
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,862
- (Knocking)
- Yes?

57
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:05,596
It's Scott. Can you let Mistress Guthrie
know she's needed?

58
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:07,869
I'll be down in a minute.

59
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,646
I think, perhaps, you may be
a little longer than that.

60
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:18,017
<i>Viens ici.</i>

61
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:27,458
(Giggling)

62
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:30,025
- (Dog barking)
- (Man shouting)

63
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:32,633
- (Men laughing)
- (Chicken clucking)

64
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:41,703
Where is he?

65
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:47,339
Says he wants to be the first
one Flint sees when it's done.

66
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:51,473
Prize master's in the tent.

67
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:12,295
(Men cheering)

68
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,601
MAN:
Show us the color of the gold!

69
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,937
(Men shouting)

70
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,273
Rum and snatch for each and all.

71
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,976
- (Cheering)
- Gentlemen, I understand your excitement,

72
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,205
but do we really think
it is a good idea

73
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:29,413
to open up what are,
to be fair, depleted reserves

74
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:31,982
and start spending money
we haven't earned yet?

75
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:33,844
- MAN: Money we haven't earned yet?
- DUFRESNE: Gentlemen.

76
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:36,545
(Men cheering)

77
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:38,016
MAN:
Gold for the whores!

78
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:40,350
(Laughing)

79
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:42,316
GATES:
Billy.

80
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,913
Billy. Billy.

81
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:57,930
Jesus.

82
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:00,926
What did I do?

83
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,224
MAN:
Have some whores!

84
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:16,126
(Men cheering)

85
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,726
MAN:
Drinks and whores!

86
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:20,301
We don't like thieves.

87
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:24,169
Beg pardon?

88
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:26,440
You shouldn't steal.

89
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,576
That's what happens.

90
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,414
I see that.

91
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:44,819
I'm hungry.

92
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:50,058
All right. I'll see what I can do.

93
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:55,194
You mustn't steal.

94
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,930
He wasn't no thief, Randall.

95
00:07:58,003 --> 00:08:00,002
(Laughing)

96
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,337
Here.

97
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:04,409
Not now.

98
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:06,546
Don't be stupid.

99
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,144
The schedule is here on the island.

100
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:15,479
How do you know?

101
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:19,919
Whoever stole it
came back to read the log,

102
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:22,561
find out exactly
what it was they had.

103
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:25,824
Someone on that deck
out there is our thief.

104
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:27,661
Well, it can't be one of our men.

105
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,355
How would they have
known to look for it?

106
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:32,732
And the men taken from the
prize were all searched.

107
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,130
What?

108
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:38,169
The cook.
I found him hiding in the armory

109
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:39,665
standing over a dead body.

110
00:08:39,738 --> 00:08:41,401
Said it was suicide.

111
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:43,306
Did you search him?

112
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,079
SILVER:
Hold that boat.

113
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:51,405
- There will be another.
- I'm sure you're right, but...

114
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:54,443
I understand everyone
wants to get laid,

115
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:56,746
but we disembark by seniority.

116
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:58,713
Perhaps if you made
the men some food,

117
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:02,314
it would take the edge off the
spree they're about to go on.

118
00:09:14,663 --> 00:09:16,092
Careful.

119
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:18,291
Unless you want everybody
to know what he's got.

120
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,250
Where the fuck is he going?

121
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,757
Ah!

122
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:51,596
CREW:
Ooh!

123
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,994
(Screams)

124
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:55,495
(Laughing)

125
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,463
That kid must really
want to get laid.

126
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:00,261
(Laughs)

127
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:06,129
Come on, give us your hand.

128
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:14,071
(Bird squawking)

129
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:22,109
I know it's late.

130
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:29,989
(Coins clink)

131
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:31,685
For Max.

132
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:33,188
What happened to you?

133
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:35,292
She worked late
with the Ranger crew.

134
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:38,126
Noonan know about this?
He's just gonna let it go?

135
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:39,966
50 pieces they paid her.

136
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:42,669
That's worth a few nicks
to the hull, wouldn't you say?

137
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,803
I have news.

138
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:46,836
Please tell me it's the good kind.

139
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:49,036
A crew of 10 have just
arrived out of Carolina.

140
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:51,804
Captain's waiting for us
at the warehouse.

141
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:53,642
He bring a prize with him?

142
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:57,311
50 barrels of tobacco and a
fluyt's worth of rare silks.

143
00:10:57,376 --> 00:10:58,808
Let's go say hello.

144
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:02,478
I had hoped we'd have a word first

145
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:04,478
before we start work.

146
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:13,088
You walked away from me last night

147
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:15,423
and did something very foolish

148
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:18,459
to a man whose temper you can
no longer afford to provoke.

149
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:19,761
He moved on Flint.
I responded.

150
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:23,191
And what did that accomplish?

151
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:25,526
It made me feel better.

152
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:28,195
Eleanor,

153
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,566
you can never forget
who these men are.

154
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:32,700
They are not our friends.

155
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:34,499
They are not our subjects.

156
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,234
They want your father's business.

157
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:39,337
That is the only reason we do not
find their knives at our throats.

158
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:43,072
Tell me you understand.

159
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,447
Be honest, is it bad?

160
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:11,821
5,000 pesos in pearls.

161
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:16,527
Don't leave much in the reserves.

162
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:19,693
An investment, if you'll allow.

163
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,661
Good morning, Captain.

164
00:12:25,462 --> 00:12:26,732
What are you up to, Jack?

165
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,235
There's been a development.

166
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,601
It seems that Captain Flint
has for weeks

167
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,662
been chasing a piece of information
that would enable the bearer

168
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:36,767
to know the precise whereabouts
of the Spanish treasure galleon

169
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,071
Urca de Lima.

170
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:43,803
And you know this how?

171
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,473
Because the thief
who stole it from him

172
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:47,473
has offered to sell it to me.

173
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:49,314
- You've met this person?
- His agent.

174
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,114
The thief's too smart
to show us his face.

175
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:55,282
He's asking 5,000 pesos
for a chance at five million.

176
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,783
I'm sorry,
have I said something funny?

177
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:02,349
You'd empty our reserves
to purchase what?

178
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,851
A scrap of paper someone told
you may be worth something?

179
00:13:04,924 --> 00:13:05,986
They have no reason to lie to me.

180
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,584
They have 5,000 reasons
to lie to you.

181
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:11,886
Please tell me
I don't need to explain further.

182
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,093
Well, I doubt the crew
will share your sentiments

183
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:15,957
with what they stand to gain.

184
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,795
Unless you have a score
of your own to present.

185
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:22,965
Or are we to sit here patiently waiting
for Eleanor Guthrie to arrive,

186
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,834
place one at our feet?

187
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,141
Remind me how many leads
have the Guthries brought us

188
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:30,173
since you two had your falling out?

189
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,471
Please tell me I don't
have to explain further.

190
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:47,726
Find me when Singleton's
back and it's done.

191
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,333
The fuck's his problem?

192
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:57,838
He thought that Flint
was the only one

193
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,040
standing in the way
of his being crowned king.

194
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:03,144
He thought wrong.

195
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:29,726
Hey, friend, can you point
me to the blacksmith?

196
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,630
- Which way to the butcher?
- In the square.

197
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:33,662
I need a new shirt.

198
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:44,904
Hey, anybody know
where the cook went?

199
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:47,006
- That way.
- That way.

200
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:50,004
Oh, Jesus.

201
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,076
What do we do?

202
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,908
Don't get too comfortable
in there, you twats.

203
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,412
A couple of fucks
and you're back on this beach.

204
00:14:57,477 --> 00:15:00,252
We got a score to chase.

205
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:04,050
(Rhythmic slapping)

206
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:06,848
I want to fuck, Max.

207
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,023
- Max.
- Yes?

208
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:14,652
- I want to fuck.
- You know the rules.

209
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:16,292
That bitch keeps you all to herself.

210
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:18,196
And she pays for the privilege.

211
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:21,859
It's not fair.

212
00:15:21,932 --> 00:15:23,898
(Breathing heavily)

213
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,931
It's not... it's not f...

214
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:27,571
it's... it's not fair.

215
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,738
It's not...

216
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,473
- What are you doing?
- Apologies.

217
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:33,472
Don't let me interrupt.

218
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:35,039
Wait your fucking turn!

219
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:37,539
Certainly.

220
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:43,215
BOTH:
Outside!

221
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,213
Okay.

222
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,147
Okay, this is going to require
a bit of an explanation.

223
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:49,652
Fuck.

224
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:50,886
Come back later, mon cher.

225
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,821
(Muttering)

226
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:00,693
Have you no decency?

227
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:06,565
Who do you think you are that
you can cost me this money?

228
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:08,436
Necessary, I'm afraid.

229
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,435
We have a problem.

230
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:12,435
- Flint's onto me.
- And so you come here?

231
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:14,569
- What if you were followed?
- No, I was careful.

232
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,673
Careful? You just told
me you've been caught.

233
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,177
Well, that's true.

234
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:20,974
You fucked me.

235
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,677
There's no need to panic.

236
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:24,181
We can still make the deal and...

237
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:25,782
And then what?

238
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:28,417
How long before Flint discovers
I had a part in this?

239
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,890
When a man is being fucked,

240
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,225
he wants to know
whose cock was in him.

241
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,326
True, but by that time,

242
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:37,324
these two cocks will be in a
boat halfway to Port Royal.

243
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:39,355
Port Royal?

244
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:42,192
After I get payment,
we meet at the boat

245
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:44,096
in the cove and leave tonight.

246
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,227
Unless there's something
else keeping you here.

247
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:56,668
MAN: I was told Richard Guthrie
was the fence in Nassau.

248
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:58,373
Brought his ships down from Boston.

249
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:01,006
Hides his plunder in sugar barrels.

250
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,478
But unless he went
and sprouted tits,

251
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:05,076
you're not him.

252
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,044
(Laughs)

253
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:09,117
I'm his daughter Eleanor.

254
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:11,986
I run the operation here
alongside my retainer Mr. Scott.

255
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:14,923
A schoolgirl and a sugar monkey.

256
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:19,087
We pay in coin, trade, or credit

257
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:21,421
the moment your goods
enter my warehouse.

258
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:24,095
And while we're off selling it at
rates you couldn't hope to match,

259
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,659
you and your men get to enjoy the many
pleasantries Nassau has to offer.

260
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,260
And what will that cost us exactly?

261
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,528
- Around four reales on the dollar.
- Half our profits go to you?

262
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,295
At first.

263
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,166
But the more you earn,
the better the terms.

264
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:41,073
Oh, you enjoy setting terms, do you?

265
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:43,935
Since I sprouted tits.

266
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:47,436
Well, Port Royal is not that far.

267
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,974
I think I'll keep
my haul and my profits.

268
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:52,310
- No offense.
- None taken.

269
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,679
Though you might want to keep
that decision to yourself.

270
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:55,811
And why is that?

271
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:57,451
Because the last fool
who turned her down

272
00:17:57,516 --> 00:17:59,218
was never seen or heard from again.

273
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:02,151
Though the same can't
be said for his plunder.

274
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:05,625
A seller brought it to Mistress Guthrie
the very next day.

275
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:09,458
And that seller would be you?

276
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:11,563
Well, perhaps you'll find me
more of a match

277
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:14,264
than that other craven bastard.

278
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:18,063
James Bridge of the Demeter.

279
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:21,533
Charles Vane of the Ranger.

280
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,341
The Negro gentleman
takes our goods, does he?

281
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,847
- Come on. We're off. Come on.
- Let's go.

282
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:47,181
That wasn't necessary.

283
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:49,286
But fun, nonetheless.

284
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,464
I'd like a word in private.

285
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:55,358
We have some business
to get sorted.

286
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,133
Wonderful.

287
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,677
I don't have time for this,
so if there's something...

288
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:14,212
I want to talk about our business.

289
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:21,712
I noticed lately that my crew

290
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,750
hasn't been given the same
kind of information from you

291
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:28,286
about potential prizes
that we once did.

292
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:32,664
That others currently do receive.

293
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,229
You've noticed that, have you?

294
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:38,660
I believe it to be personal

295
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,900
and I'd like to put an end to it.

296
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:46,069
Things were better... are better

297
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:47,773
for the both of us

298
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:52,210
when you and I are on
the same side of things.

299
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:55,747
I would like to return to that.

300
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:58,448
You have an odd way of showing it.

301
00:19:58,513 --> 00:20:00,449
Excuse me?

302
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:03,382
I have responsibilities here...

303
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:05,750
commerce to oversee,
profits to maintain.

304
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:07,823
The idea that I would
withhold valuable leads

305
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:09,686
for personal reasons
is fucking absurd.

306
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:11,389
Is that so?

307
00:20:11,454 --> 00:20:12,726
I stopped providing you
with intelligence

308
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,832
because I don't like
the way you run your ship.

309
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:18,196
Your men are undisciplined, unruly.

310
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:21,194
For as much money as they bring in,
they cause twice as much damage.

311
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,696
They're fucking animals.
You encourage it.

312
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,861
And that makes you
a poor investment.

313
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:27,992
You expect me to believe
this is about business?

314
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:30,232
I don't give a fuck what you believe.

315
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,729
I know that last night...
last night,

316
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:35,767
you killed a member of a crew
that has value to me

317
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:38,873
in order to depose a captain
that has value to me.

318
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:43,073
And now not only do you
expect to be forgiven,

319
00:20:43,146 --> 00:20:44,681
you wish to be rewarded for it.

320
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:46,780
Flint's so weak he needed
protection from you

321
00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:48,749
and I'm the poor investment?

322
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:53,417
From where I sit, you coming here
means one of two things.

323
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,584
Either you're under the
illusion that with Flint gone,

324
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:58,759
I have no other choice
than to give you what you want

325
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,053
or you think because
you and I used to fuck,

326
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,292
you can cross me
without any consequences.

327
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:05,858
(People shouting)

328
00:21:05,923 --> 00:21:08,459
I'm not sure which of
the two is more stupid.

329
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:12,634
Be careful, Eleanor.

330
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:14,771
Fuck you, Charles.

331
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:18,443
(Shouting continues)

332
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:24,641
MAN:
Captain says we're gonna be rich!

333
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:28,846
Son of a bitch. You made it.

334
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,677
I did.

335
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,613
What happened?
I thought Singleton had the votes.

336
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:37,385
Turns out Mr. Singleton
was unfit for command.

337
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,179
We have more pressing
issues to attend to.

338
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:41,681
Shall I wait?

339
00:21:42,978 --> 00:21:44,945
Captain Vane was just leaving.

340
00:21:58,823 --> 00:22:02,387
Hey, what the fuck
happened on that ship?

341
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:04,449
Where is Singleton?

342
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,988
Fruit. Fruit.

343
00:22:08,053 --> 00:22:11,155
Tits. Tits.

344
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,419
Plant. Plant.

345
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:15,692
It's the fucking same.

346
00:22:15,757 --> 00:22:19,428
Yes, Captain, I'm sure
they look the same.

347
00:22:22,838 --> 00:22:25,005
What the hell are you doing?

348
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,668
Watch this.

349
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:29,572
As I explained, this is the
work of Adriaen Hanneman.

350
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:31,476
A masterwork, unmistakably.

351
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:35,347
This is an abomination.

352
00:22:35,412 --> 00:22:37,579
To suggest that the value of one
has any bearing on the other

353
00:22:37,652 --> 00:22:40,311
simply strains
the very bounds of reason.

354
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:47,654
Fruit. Fruit.

355
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:50,218
Tits. Tits.

356
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:52,818
I love this town.

357
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,790
I'm so glad you're entertained.

358
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:58,885
I'm sorry, weren't we supposed
to be looking for the cook?

359
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,125
- We are. Any luck?
- No, and I've looked all over.

360
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,691
Meanwhile, you haven't moved
from this stump all day.

361
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:07,498
Billy,

362
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:09,499
take a load off.

363
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:14,466
Fruit. Fruit. Tits. Tits.
Plant. Plant.

364
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,704
I've always been straight
with you, haven't I?

365
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:21,209
Never lied. Never hedged.

366
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:26,881
You did the right thing.

367
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:34,354
Yesterday when you sent me with
the captain to Harbour Island,

368
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:38,254
you told me to restrain him
if he tried to go too far.

369
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,157
I did.

370
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:41,988
Singleton wasn't a thief.

371
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:44,889
Flint baited him into that fight,
then he killed him.

372
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:46,558
That's not going too far?

373
00:23:46,623 --> 00:23:48,694
Singleton was no saint.

374
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,724
That's not the point.
The point is I lied to my own crew

375
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:52,459
to protect the captain.

376
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:54,791
You lied to protect the crew.

377
00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:56,295
You saw the Scarborough, mate.

378
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,063
You know what's coming.

379
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:02,897
We can't thieve forever.

380
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:08,902
Flint said we need a king.

381
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,403
Is that what you think?

382
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:17,781
I think we need something.

383
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:21,951
Five million pieces
is a good place to start.

384
00:24:24,257 --> 00:24:26,560
I guess we just keep looking, then.

385
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,128
No need.

386
00:24:29,193 --> 00:24:30,623
- There's a man up there.
- Where?

387
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:33,463
- The brothel.
- Ah, the brothel.

388
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:36,903
Take them inside.

389
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,445
Why are we following the appraiser?

390
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,675
Because if I'm this cook and
I want to sell the schedule

391
00:24:52,748 --> 00:24:56,017
and leave this place a rich man,
I need two things...

392
00:24:56,082 --> 00:24:59,352
I need a boat and I need
a method of payment.

393
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:01,286
BILLY:
A method of payment?

394
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,053
What about gold coins?

395
00:25:04,118 --> 00:25:07,555
Gold is too heavy,
attracts too much attention.

396
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,818
So I need a bill of exchange

397
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:12,289
- or...
- Jewels.

398
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:14,822
I was thinking pearls.

399
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:18,921
And I'd want to know the exact
value of what I'm getting.

400
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:20,924
- (Music playing)
- (Chatter)

401
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:36,430
LOGAN:
Mr. Gates.

402
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:37,924
Hello, boys.

403
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:40,131
Where the fuck have you two been?

404
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:42,797
(Laughs)
Come join us.

405
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,763
We'll be right with you.

406
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,835
Any chance he's up
for a quick fuck?

407
00:25:48,236 --> 00:25:51,138
With Anne Bonny standing guard?

408
00:25:53,908 --> 00:25:56,748
Excellent luster and orient.

409
00:25:58,314 --> 00:26:01,146
Rest assured, young lady,
the quality is quite good.

410
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:04,923
200 pieces of eight at any clearinghouse
in the civilized colonies.

411
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:08,694
And the rest of them?

412
00:26:13,664 --> 00:26:16,227
- No offense.
- None taken.

413
00:26:23,702 --> 00:26:25,667
Sure I can't suck your cock
while you do that?

414
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,169
Uh, thank you, no.

415
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:33,409
Use my hand? Sing you a song?

416
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:35,874
Something worth paying money for?

417
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:37,642
Fucking peepers.

418
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,681
My father's under arrest?

419
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:45,680
A fugitive, technically.

420
00:26:45,753 --> 00:26:47,183
I have him on the Walrus.

421
00:26:47,248 --> 00:26:50,886
He was injured in the escape,
but he'll survive.

422
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:53,158
Unfortunately, the same can't
be said for his reputation.

423
00:26:53,223 --> 00:26:55,789
This is impossible.

424
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:58,355
He's been bribing
the Lords Proprietor for years.

425
00:26:58,428 --> 00:27:00,364
They've agreed to make
him governor here.

426
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:03,501
It would appear they've had
a change of heart.

427
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:05,466
You don't seem concerned about this.

428
00:27:05,531 --> 00:27:07,799
I never much liked your father.

429
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:09,964
Too caught up in appearances.

430
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,195
She's not talking about
your opinion of the man.

431
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,234
Once news spreads
of Mr. Guthrie's arrest,

432
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,096
our operation here
will no longer be viable.

433
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:18,502
No legitimate port will have us.

434
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,562
And his ships, the ships that
take your cargo to market,

435
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:23,200
if they are not impounded already,

436
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:25,200
will be on their way
back to Boston.

437
00:27:27,304 --> 00:27:31,402
Captain, we are finished here.

438
00:27:31,468 --> 00:27:35,036
Under normal circumstances,
I'd agree with you.

439
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:38,074
- However...
- However what?

440
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:43,378
Let me tell you a story

441
00:27:43,443 --> 00:27:45,375
about a Spaniard named Vazquez.

442
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:05,187
Happy to be of service.

443
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,917
Thank you for your patience
in these matters.

444
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:14,491
You understand my partner
simply wishes to be careful.

445
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:17,152
I wouldn't fault him
in the slightest.

446
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:18,990
Now, shall we discuss delivery?

447
00:28:19,055 --> 00:28:21,325
The wrecks at sundown.

448
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,353
Once he sees the pouch
with the seal unbroken,

449
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:26,562
he will hand over the page.

450
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,776
Is something wrong?

451
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:46,807
It's unclear
which is more appealing,

452
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,910
your beauty or your intelligence.

453
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:51,048
You are very kind, monsieur.

454
00:28:51,113 --> 00:28:53,281
Well, let's not get carried away.

455
00:28:56,555 --> 00:28:58,858
You.

456
00:28:58,923 --> 00:29:00,058
Is there a problem, Captain?

457
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:02,826
She doesn't have your page.
Flint does.

458
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:05,193
He killed Singleton,
took it off his body.

459
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:08,536
His crew's skipping around the island
like the prize is as good as theirs.

460
00:29:08,602 --> 00:29:11,088
That is impossible.
My partner has the page.

461
00:29:11,091 --> 00:29:12,128
What?

462
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:14,510
Mr. Singleton is not the seller,
I assure you.

463
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,753
- What did you just say?
- RACKHAM: Charles.

464
00:29:16,818 --> 00:29:19,616
Shut up, Jack.
You really want to keep pushing this?

465
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:22,509
- Play me for a fool?
- You are mistaken.

466
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:24,010
- Yeah, the fuck I am.
- (Whimpers)

467
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:25,543
I need a weapon.

468
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:27,774
Tell me the truth.

469
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:30,274
- The page is gone.
- No.

470
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,240
Do you have a candlestick

471
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:35,345
or perhaps a heavy shoe?

472
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,545
- That'll do.
- VANE: Play me for a fucking fool?

473
00:29:37,618 --> 00:29:40,280
- MAX: You are mistaken.
- VANE: Yeah, the fuck I am.

474
00:29:40,353 --> 00:29:42,582
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- (Whimpers)

475
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,117
She isn't lying, Charles.
Flint is.

476
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:46,988
- What?
- He lost the page.

477
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:48,720
So what does he do?
He bluffs.

478
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:50,418
He makes Singleton
the thief and kills him

479
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:51,954
to prevent counterargument,

480
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:54,190
putting a tidy end
to his mutiny in the process,

481
00:29:54,256 --> 00:29:56,855
then hopes he can recover it
before anyone's the wiser.

482
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,296
Honestly, Charles, are we
to believe that Singleton,

483
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:01,663
while conspiring with you
to depose Flint,

484
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,629
was using this whore to try and
bilk your crew out of its money?

485
00:30:04,694 --> 00:30:05,932
Say what you want about Singleton,

486
00:30:05,997 --> 00:30:07,963
but he was neither
that clever nor that dumb.

487
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:10,701
Now will you please put her down so
we can complete our transaction?

488
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:13,573
Is that what you thought?
You could fuck us out of our money

489
00:30:13,638 --> 00:30:15,309
and then hide behind Eleanor?

490
00:30:15,374 --> 00:30:17,476
You think I'd really let that happen?

491
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,780
You think I'm that fucking pathetic?

492
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:22,013
Jesus, lady.

493
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:24,414
(Choking)

494
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,499
(Shouts)

495
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:59,151
Unless Mr. Singleton rose from
the grave to eavesdrop on us...

496
00:31:00,621 --> 00:31:02,586
it would appear
she's telling the truth.

497
00:31:03,852 --> 00:31:05,418
(Gasps)

498
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:08,858
If he's wrong about this,
he'll answer to our crew.

499
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:12,732
If you're lying,
you'll answer to me.

500
00:31:14,703 --> 00:31:17,540
(Max coughing)

501
00:31:17,603 --> 00:31:19,505
Yes, all right.

502
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:21,937
(Panting)

503
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,208
The Urca de Lima?

504
00:31:25,273 --> 00:31:26,472
That's correct.

505
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:28,715
You're talking about
a floating castle.

506
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,579
No one has ever taken a treasure
galleon like that as a prize.

507
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:33,418
Let me worry about hunting her.

508
00:31:33,483 --> 00:31:35,888
It's what comes after
for which I'll need your help.

509
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:38,690
After?
Why return at all to Nassau?

510
00:31:38,756 --> 00:31:41,794
With money like that and my father
out of business, why not run?

511
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:45,026
What's coming our way
can't be outrun.

512
00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:51,435
But with the money
I strip from the Hulk,

513
00:31:51,507 --> 00:31:54,806
we could add 50 guns to the fort.

514
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,079
We could build ships
to defend our shores

515
00:31:57,144 --> 00:31:59,277
and train new men to sail them.

516
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,582
We could work the land,

517
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,953
grow crops and raise cattle.

518
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:08,329
Then whoever arrives
on our shores first,

519
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,900
be it England or Spain,

520
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:13,700
will be in for a most
unwelcome surprise.

521
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,710
- A nation of thieves.
- (Laughing)

522
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:24,351
You have your doubts?

523
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:28,179
Of turning pirates
into farmers and soldiers?

524
00:32:28,252 --> 00:32:32,248
Of fighting a war against Whitehall
from a sliver in the Atlantic?

525
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:34,318
Doubt, Captain Flint,

526
00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:37,389
does not begin to describe
how I am feeling.

527
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:40,651
If there's to be a war, that
will be Whitehall's choice.

528
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:42,923
I'd settle for a pardon,
title on lands,

529
00:32:42,988 --> 00:32:44,426
and a governor that I could trust.

530
00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:46,089
And so would most
of the men out there.

531
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:47,761
They're not animals, Mr. Scott.

532
00:32:47,826 --> 00:32:49,257
They're men starved of hope.

533
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,189
Give that back to them,

534
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:53,627
who's to say what could happen?

535
00:32:55,228 --> 00:32:57,394
Why do this?

536
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,634
Why here?

537
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:06,076
Odysseus,
on his journey home to Ithaca,

538
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:07,803
was visited by a ghost.

539
00:33:09,642 --> 00:33:13,771
The ghost tells him
that once he reaches his home,

540
00:33:13,836 --> 00:33:17,045
once he slays all his enemies

541
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,381
and sets his house in order,

542
00:33:18,446 --> 00:33:22,014
he must do one last thing
before he can rest.

543
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:24,918
The ghost tells him
to pick up an oar

544
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:27,389
and walk inland.

545
00:33:27,455 --> 00:33:29,423
And keep walking

546
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:32,392
until somebody mistakes
that oar for a shovel.

547
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,935
For that would be
the place that no man

548
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,736
had ever been troubled by the sea.

549
00:33:39,504 --> 00:33:42,101
And that's where he'd find peace.

550
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:45,270
In the end, that's all I want.

551
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:50,045
To walk away from the sea
and find some peace.

552
00:33:51,678 --> 00:33:53,317
(Door opens)

553
00:33:54,518 --> 00:33:56,211
I think we found it.

554
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,746
Found what?

555
00:33:57,818 --> 00:33:59,952
The Urca's schedule
was taken from me.

556
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:02,247
When were you planning
on mentioning that?

557
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,623
Everything's under control.
We're close to recovering it.

558
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:06,389
Vane just met with Frasier
at the brothel.

559
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:08,082
I assume he's the buyer.

560
00:34:08,155 --> 00:34:12,189
We missed the thief, but he's
using a whore as a go-between.

561
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:14,490
I left Billy
to keep an eye on things.

562
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:18,428
If we get moving, there's half a
chance to get in front of this.

563
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:20,361
Find the cook...
(Voice fades)

564
00:34:28,874 --> 00:34:30,306
(Door opens)

565
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:35,711
Good.
Maybe you can get her to talk.

566
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:39,216
- I'm fine.
- Huh, the fuck you are.

567
00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:42,718
She nearly got herself
killed by Captain Vane.

568
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:44,780
I want to know why.

569
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:47,219
Leave us alone, Noonan.

570
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:50,421
Come on.

571
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,352
- Max, I...
- I'm glad you are here.

572
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:08,487
I was going to send word for you.

573
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:12,222
You and I have a decision to make
and it must be made right now.

574
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:15,593
I'm about to receive a great deal
of money for a service I provided.

575
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:18,266
Max, I need you
to give me the schedule.

576
00:35:18,331 --> 00:35:20,331
Flint's schedule.

577
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,770
When you were talking
this morning about being free

578
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:26,000
from Noonan,
that's what you meant, wasn't it?

579
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:28,439
How do you know this?

580
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,239
It doesn't matter.

581
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:33,277
Max, Flint needs that page.

582
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:35,279
The money he can get
from his prize,

583
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:38,280
it can give this place a future.
It can give us a future here.

584
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:41,655
If the page isn't delivered to Vane,
he will kill me.

585
00:35:43,257 --> 00:35:45,089
I can protect you.

586
00:35:45,162 --> 00:35:47,793
Scott can protect you.
You have to trust me.

587
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:53,631
Leave with me.

588
00:35:53,696 --> 00:35:55,564
- What?
- I have a boat waiting.

589
00:35:55,629 --> 00:35:57,628
I will have enough money
for us to start anew.

590
00:35:57,701 --> 00:35:59,469
- But I can't leave here.
- Why not?

591
00:36:00,935 --> 00:36:06,742
Because I've spent my life
trying to build something here.

592
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:08,846
It's all I have.
I can't just walk away.

593
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:10,382
It is not all you have!

594
00:36:10,447 --> 00:36:13,718
Eleanor, this place is just sand.

595
00:36:13,783 --> 00:36:15,717
It cannot love you back.

596
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:17,757
You know this.
You must know this.

597
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,524
Your father left you.

598
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,724
Your mother was taken from you.

599
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,858
Everyone you have
ever loved you have lost

600
00:36:24,923 --> 00:36:27,162
and it terrifies you.

601
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,594
But not me.

602
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:32,131
I will never, ever leave you.

603
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:34,372
I love you.

604
00:36:37,637 --> 00:36:40,246
- (Knocks)
- GATES: Miss Guthrie.

605
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:47,257
- You brought them here?
- I...

606
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,638
Come with me. Right now.

607
00:36:58,703 --> 00:37:01,878
The boat is waiting.
We can be free of this place.

608
00:37:01,943 --> 00:37:04,341
We can have a life together.

609
00:37:04,414 --> 00:37:06,311
And it can start this very minute.

610
00:37:06,384 --> 00:37:08,984
All you have to do is say yes.

611
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:13,458
Set us both free.

612
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,659
Come in.

613
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:25,660
(Door opens)

614
00:37:33,203 --> 00:37:35,433
Max, I need you to tell me
where the page is.

615
00:37:38,276 --> 00:37:40,045
And if I don't, then what?

616
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:47,426
This doesn't have to go badly.

617
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:49,060
I want her to say it.

618
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,499
I want her to say that
she would sit there and watch

619
00:37:51,564 --> 00:37:54,733
as you beat the answer
out of me to save this place.

620
00:37:56,134 --> 00:37:57,870
Say it.

621
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:06,083
Say it.

622
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:17,559
The wrecks at sundown.

623
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:30,749
- Max, please.
- Get the fuck out.

624
00:38:30,814 --> 00:38:32,581
I meant what I said.
I can protect you.

625
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,714
Get the fuck out!

626
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:44,056
- (Sobbing)
- (Door closes)

627
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:19,880
(Men chattering)

628
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:29,996
- Frightened, Jack?
- Please.

629
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,534
There's nothing in there
but opium addicts,

630
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:36,035
lunatics, and men who thought
themselves too good to wear a condom.

631
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:19,249
The pearls.

632
00:40:19,314 --> 00:40:22,252
He says you give me the pearls.

633
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:28,960
Did he say anything else?

634
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:40,406
No. I want him out here.

635
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,541
Captain.

636
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,740
I know you can hear me!

637
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:47,476
You want your money,
you show your fucking face!

638
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,946
That's the only way this gets done.

639
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:54,849
Captain, I'm afraid
our friend out there

640
00:40:54,915 --> 00:40:56,920
has all the leverage in
this particular situation.

641
00:40:56,985 --> 00:40:59,187
Now, we can rail and shout
and stamp our feet,

642
00:40:59,252 --> 00:41:01,388
but that doesn't change the fact
that unless we give this fellow...

643
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,523
(Groans)

644
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,470
You were saying?

645
00:41:16,945 --> 00:41:20,785
Now, come out here and face me

646
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,050
or these pearls go back
where they belong!

647
00:41:24,892 --> 00:41:26,155
Fuck.

648
00:41:29,394 --> 00:41:31,592
RACKHAM:
Charles, it is important

649
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:33,463
this deal goes through tonight.

650
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:36,693
This is a potential prize
that changes everything for us.

651
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:40,268
- Do not scuttle it by...
- (Soft clatter)

652
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:01,257
He says you give me the pearls.

653
00:42:13,805 --> 00:42:15,908
(Gunshot echoes)

654
00:44:27,057 --> 00:44:28,456
Ah!

655
00:44:32,898 --> 00:44:35,063
(Screams)

656
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,950
(Gasps)

657
00:44:51,287 --> 00:44:53,222
(Coughing)

658
00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:09,104
(Grunts)

659
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:11,776
- Where's the page?
- You can't have it.

660
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:15,008
Not at the moment.
And, please, we should go.

661
00:45:15,081 --> 00:45:16,144
Where have you hidden it?

662
00:45:17,312 --> 00:45:18,910
You're looking at it.

663
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,848
What the fuck
are you talking about?

664
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:24,751
Well, I couldn't be certain I would
escape both the madman and you,

665
00:45:24,824 --> 00:45:27,764
so I took drastic measures

666
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:29,963
for the sake of my survival.

667
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:38,636
Your schedule is up here.

668
00:45:56,751 --> 00:45:58,188
Fuck!

669
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:00,958
You don't have to do this.

670
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,630
Mr. Noonan has men at your door.

671
00:46:06,695 --> 00:46:09,200
And Guthrie's put
three more downstairs.

672
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:14,978
Vane can't get to you here.

673
00:46:15,043 --> 00:46:16,978
I know.

674
00:46:17,043 --> 00:46:19,115
But I cannot stay.

675
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:24,819
Will you help me?

676
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:17,150
(Sniffles)

677
00:47:18,888 --> 00:47:20,719
Meet our thief.

678
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:24,390
- Why is he still alive?
- It's a long story.

679
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:26,696
Do you mind if we stash
him here for the night?

680
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,801
Billy can stand guard.

681
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:54,991
Flint will want
our answer in the morning.

682
00:47:55,056 --> 00:47:56,927
(Pouring liquid)

683
00:47:56,992 --> 00:47:59,897
I know you don't approve of this,

684
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:01,770
but I need to do this.

685
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:03,266
I need it.

686
00:48:11,707 --> 00:48:13,681
Please.

687
00:48:15,715 --> 00:48:17,683
Stay with me.

688
00:48:20,726 --> 00:48:22,223
All right.

689
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:28,197
(Sighs)

690
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:34,302
- (Drums beating)
- (Whooping and cheering)

691
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:19,645
(Fortepiano playing)

692
00:49:27,696 --> 00:49:30,329
(Playing)

693
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:44,714
(Horse whinnying)

694
00:49:44,779 --> 00:49:46,217
(Stops playing)

695
00:49:47,714 --> 00:49:49,515
(Door opens)

696
00:50:00,403 --> 00:50:02,304
Take off your boots.

697
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:04,039
I'll boil some water.

698
00:50:11,447 --> 00:50:13,677
(Grunts)

699
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:21,686
(Exhales)
