1
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,814
(Distant rumbling)

2
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:53,254
(Men shouting)

3
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:57,924
MAN: Sir, she's still closing.
We simply cannot outrun her.

4
00:00:57,998 --> 00:01:00,167
We must surrender
while we still can.

5
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:02,663
Gun crews...at the ready!

6
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:04,167
Gun crews at the ready!

7
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,134
(Men shouting)

8
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:27,853
(Men shouting)

9
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:45,747
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

10
00:01:45,812 --> 00:01:47,779
Why aren't you on deck
with the crew?

11
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:51,216
I think the better question is
why aren't they all down here with us?

12
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:52,583
You could get killed up there.

13
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:55,654
- Oh, so you're a coward, then?
- Yeah. You, too?

14
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,485
I'm no coward.
I'm a cook.

15
00:01:57,558 --> 00:01:59,087
I've no quarters to man.

16
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,456
What do you think
the captain would do

17
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,466
if he found out
you've abandoned yours?

18
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:04,865
Well, if he's dead and I'm alive,

19
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,368
I like my chances.

20
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,036
- Fire!
- Starboard side!

21
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:10,800
MAN:
They shot the muskets!

22
00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:14,471
Bear up, damn it!

23
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:15,975
- You're short!
- Bear up!

24
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,002
Sir, they are out of our range.

25
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,769
(Cannonball whistling)

26
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:25,308
All crews, fire your...

27
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:26,540
(Men screaming)

28
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,474
Get down!

29
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,909
You know who that is out there?

30
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:36,171
That ship flies the banner
of Captain Flint.

31
00:02:36,244 --> 00:02:37,906
(Thumping)

32
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:39,673
Isn't this your problem, too?

33
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:42,649
Good cooks are in short supply,
even for criminals.

34
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:46,047
But you, cowering below decks,
dodging a fight?

35
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:48,119
They'll gut you for sport.

36
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,383
(Cannonfire blasting)

37
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:50,952
(Men screaming)

38
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,092
(Screams)

39
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:11,023
Give me that.

40
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:14,356
- What is that?
- That's nothing.

41
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:16,461
That doesn't seem like nothing.

42
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:19,461
Well, maybe when
Captain Flint gets here,

43
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:20,765
we can let him decide.

44
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,701
You wouldn't want to do that.

45
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:24,566
No? Why not?

46
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:29,071
- Oh.
- (Shouts)

47
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:37,412
- (Gunshots)
- (Grunting)

48
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,190
Fall back!

49
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:45,052
Fall back!

50
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:48,720
- Get up!
- Go!

51
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:51,422
Get out of the way.

52
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:58,229
(Gunshots)

53
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,399
Close us in.

54
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:07,295
Sir, wait. Mr. Fisher.

55
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:09,567
(Groaning)

56
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:12,904
(Gunfire continues)

57
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:19,918
Muskets at the ready.

58
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,686
(Gunfire stops)

59
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:34,736
- (Clattering)
- FISCHER: Let me in, sir.

60
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:37,074
- Please, let me inside.
- Move away from that door!

61
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,408
- Sir, there may still be time.
- Move away from the door!

62
00:04:39,473 --> 00:04:41,700
If we do not surrender now,
Flint will kill us all.

63
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:42,866
(Fisher pounding)
Please let me in!

64
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,372
Please, sir, open the door.

65
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:45,605
Open...
(Groans)

66
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:47,141
(Thumps)

67
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,355
(Wood creaking)

68
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:59,128
(Panting)

69
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:02,194
(Heavy footsteps approaching)

70
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,068
(Man howling)

71
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:11,575
(Men chanting)

72
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:13,847
(Rhythmic pounding)

73
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:27,697
(Pounding stops)

74
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,360
(Rumbling)

75
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,736
(Rumbling stops)

76
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,375
(All screaming)

77
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:48,112
(Gasps)

78
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:53,023
(Muffled shouting)

79
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:55,321
(Muffled gunshots)

80
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,959
(Grunts)

81
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,692
- (Roars)
- (Screams)

82
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,778
(Screaming)

83
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:28,232
MAN:
It's over... Argh!

84
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:33,601
(Shouts)

85
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:36,134
It's done.

86
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:42,575
Wouldn't you agree?

87
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,439
(Men shouting)

88
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,645
Can't sell that. Leave it here.

89
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,049
No.

90
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,322
Shit.

91
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:53,994
(Screams)

92
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:58,231
- Grow up.
- (Laughs)

93
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:04,143
What the fuck is this?

94
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,312
Well, it's blocked, Mr. Gates.

95
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:24,438
Hello.

96
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:30,114
He couldn't handle the thought
of what you might do to him.

97
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:32,949
I, on the other hand,

98
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:35,316
would very much like
to join your crew.

99
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:39,927
My name is John Silver.

100
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,730
And I happen to be
a very good cook.

101
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:54,008
Know this...

102
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:57,482
Now that the fight is over,

103
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:59,648
you have nothing more
to fear from us today.

104
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:05,350
Because we know this fight
was not of your making.

105
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,587
It was the choice of our true enemy.

106
00:10:08,652 --> 00:10:11,451
Your true enemy.

107
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:14,092
The tyrant captain.

108
00:10:17,228 --> 00:10:21,195
Many of us once sailed
on ships like this one.

109
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,331
We know what it is
to be slaves to his whim,

110
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:26,604
his violence,

111
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,707
- his shit wages...
- (Pirates laugh)

112
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:32,275
his insufferable stupidity.

113
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:37,517
So we've made for ourselves
a different life

114
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:39,916
where we don't rely on wages,

115
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:42,450
we own a stake,

116
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:44,252
and where our pleasure isn't a sin.

117
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:47,555
It's a virtue.

118
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:50,692
We also know what it's like
to see our brothers die

119
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:53,765
in the service of no end
other than a tyrant's pride.

120
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,597
This one wants to join.
Says he can cook.

121
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,405
Well, if he keeps that up, this one
won't be the only one looking to join.

122
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,542
- Today is a new day.
- Look at him.

123
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,079
Thinks he's captain already.

124
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:06,786
Today their crimes have been exposed.

125
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:09,920
And they will be punished.

126
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:20,634
We made a full sweep of the hold

127
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:24,231
and we found eight more
casks of whale oil.

128
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:25,662
That's all?

129
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,166
Total tally 400.

130
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:31,870
500, if we manage
to sell the tobacco.

131
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:35,805
Cameron's broken his arm.
Duffy's been shot in the leg.

132
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:40,480
After injury payments, we will
net just under $8 per man.

133
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,121
$8?

134
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:44,154
The crew will not be happy.

135
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:47,123
When are they ever?

136
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:51,765
(Sighs)

137
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,167
When their end is a hell
of a lot richer than $8.

138
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,639
Here, take a look.

139
00:11:59,713 --> 00:12:03,080
Captain's log. It's all there.

140
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:05,354
Vazquez, Port Royal.

141
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,893
Told you this was the ship.

142
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:12,895
Where is the schedule?

143
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,675
Minor obstacle.

144
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:21,444
But we're getting close.

145
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,747
Let me see if I have this right.

146
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:25,579
This is the fourth prize in a row

147
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,485
from which the profits
will barely exceed

148
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,284
the expenses it took to win it.

149
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:33,923
Singleton's out there
trying to convince your crew

150
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:36,425
to torture that poor bastard
of a captain

151
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,560
simply 'cause he hasn't worked out
how to get them to do it to you.

152
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,192
But all is well
because you've discovered

153
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:45,631
that the information we can't
tell anybody we're looking for

154
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:48,963
exists on a page...
that we don't have.

155
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:51,131
Don't have yet.

156
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:53,600
(Door opens)

157
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:58,798
Mr. Duffy is dead.

158
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:02,208
I removed the leg,
but he lost too much blood.

159
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,372
(Men cheering)

160
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:10,814
MAN:
Cut his cock!

161
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:18,023
- Ooh! Yeah!
- (Cheering)

162
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:20,925
Is this necessary?

163
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:28,089
We paid a heavy toll today.
And for what?

164
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:31,263
We all know the prize won't come
close to evening the scales.

165
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:34,727
Someone ought to pay the difference.

166
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,494
Talk to me about recruits.

167
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,634
(Blade rings)

168
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,443
- What's he doing?
- Just give him a minute.

169
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:51,444
Where's the schedule?

170
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:56,482
What are you talking about?

171
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:59,116
The page that was torn
from your log.

172
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:05,224
If you know where it is,
now would be the time to say so.

173
00:14:06,898 --> 00:14:10,200
Five? You want to bring
on five more men?

174
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:12,135
A carpenter,
two carpenter's mates,

175
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,838
a gunner's mate and the cook.

176
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:16,705
Hard to refuse a skilled hand.

177
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:19,114
Is it their hands you want?

178
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:21,210
Or their votes?

179
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:24,283
What a cunning bastard you are.

180
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:26,787
Squarely in the captain's pocket,

181
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:29,492
yet you still got the crew
believing you're their advocate.

182
00:14:29,557 --> 00:14:32,660
Shrewdest quartermaster
I've ever come across.

183
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:35,691
I wonder if you'll afford me
the same wide berth

184
00:14:35,764 --> 00:14:38,867
you give that bastard
once I take his place.

185
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:44,432
You get the cook.
That's all the ship can afford right now.

186
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,441
I told you, I don't have it.

187
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:51,910
- One of my men must have taken it.
- Everyone was searched.

188
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,575
Damn it, if I knew more,
I'd tell you.

189
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,245
Now call off your men.

190
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,981
- Get off it. Get back.
- (Laughing)

191
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:05,615
Pshaw. You can't, can you?

192
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,321
You're their captain,
but you have no control over them.

193
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:14,123
How long before you're the one
they tie to the mast?

194
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:21,205
I won't give you the
satisfaction of crying out.

195
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,006
Good for you.

196
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:25,776
Where are you going?

197
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,416
Justice is about to be done,

198
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:32,678
and you turn your back.

199
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:39,423
MAN:
Sail!

200
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:50,736
Man-o'-war.

201
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:53,169
Royal Navy.

202
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,041
The Scarborough.

203
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:01,283
Scarborough ports in Boston.

204
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:04,114
Not today she doesn't.

205
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:06,524
She's got the wind of us.

206
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,821
Cut us loose. Get us under way.

207
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:23,032
(Men shouting)

208
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:31,804
- (Purring)
- My Boots.

209
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:35,371
Randall.

210
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,747
We've taken on a new cook.

211
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:44,820
Randall, we were clear
this job was only temporary.

212
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:46,483
There's still plenty for you to do.

213
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:52,723
He'll be all right.

214
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:56,229
So both watches mess together at six bells.
Don't be late.

215
00:16:56,302 --> 00:16:57,732
Any supplies you need,
see Dufresne.

216
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,699
He'll fund you out of the
ship's maintenance account.

217
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:01,532
One more thing.

218
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,469
No one gets any special
treatment from you of any kind.

219
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:07,077
No extra rations,
no preferences in cuts of meat.

220
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:08,940
Not for me,
not for the quartermaster,

221
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:11,747
not for the captain.
Here, every man is equal.

222
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:13,748
- All right?
- Even him?

223
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,791
Randall was the ship's boatswain

224
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:21,559
before he got beaten to within an inch
of his life while taking a prize.

225
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:25,363
He lost his wits,
but not our loyalty.

226
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,098
We like Randall.

227
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:31,475
You, we'll see.

228
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:20,053
- He has the votes.
- Beg pardon?

229
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:23,156
Singleton, he has the votes
to remove you as captain.

230
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,795
Not every last one.
Haven't finished canvassing yet,

231
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,500
but when he gets ashore

232
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,036
and he doesn't have to be sneaky
about it, he'll get what he needs.

233
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:31,859
I thought you said
it would never get to this.

234
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:33,234
Now hang on.

235
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,836
I thought you said you put loyal
men in all the right places

236
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:37,542
- so the crew would never turn.
- No, no.

237
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:40,016
I never said never.
I'm too old to be using that word.

238
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:43,050
Don't give me that shit.
I told you there would be some lean days

239
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,417
while we tracked Parrish's ship.

240
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,353
You said the crew would weather it.

241
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:49,325
Days. Lean days.

242
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:51,332
It's been three months
with no profits to speak of

243
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,660
and nobody knows
what it's all been for

244
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,701
because you don't trust
them with the truth.

245
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,136
I don't trust them with the truth.

246
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:59,705
So here we are.

247
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:08,282
Singleton.

248
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,953
They think he has any idea how
to put money in their pockets?

249
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:13,948
All they know or care
about Singleton right now

250
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:15,753
is that he isn't you.

251
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:22,457
I just need a few more days.

252
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:26,160
The page is gone.
It could be anywhere.

253
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:28,731
What makes you think all you
need is a few more days?

254
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:32,939
I'm gonna go and see Richard.

255
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,905
He can help me
recreate the schedule.

256
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,843
- Richard Guthrie?
- Mm-hmm.

257
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:40,710
You think he's gonna help you?

258
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,046
Yes. Yes, I do.

259
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,487
Let's just for fun
say that he doesn't.

260
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:46,856
What then?

261
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:50,591
Then I'll forget about the schedule

262
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,466
and go back to hunting
fat, lazy merchantmen

263
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:54,731
and everyone will be content.

264
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:57,834
This is one of those times

265
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:01,704
where we pretend that we both
don't know that you're lying.

266
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,575
(Knocks)

267
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,806
Landfall.

268
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:09,045
We're home.

269
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,224
Is this English soil?

270
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:13,054
It was once. Now it ain't.

271
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:14,757
Whose is it?

272
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:18,263
Ours.

273
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:20,031
(Laughs)

274
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:26,840
Wait, I don't understand.
The captain asked for me to go?

275
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:28,071
Yes, in a manner of speaking.

276
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:30,570
He doesn't know
I'm coming, does he?

277
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:32,905
No, but I have business here,
so the job falls to you.

278
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:34,642
And what is the job exactly?

279
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:36,410
Captain's gonna ask
Richard Guthrie for a favor.

280
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:38,145
Mr. Guthrie is going to say no.

281
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,878
When that happens, the captain
will most likely react poorly.

282
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:42,276
Your job is to restrain him.

283
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:46,949
Restrain him, you say?

284
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,791
No cargo moves off this island

285
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:52,160
without Mr. Guthrie's
ships and connections.

286
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:55,992
The last crew that ran afoul of him
couldn't buy or sell shit for two months.

287
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,599
That's an outcome I'd like to avoid.

288
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:00,031
Wait.

289
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:02,200
He never listens to me.

290
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:07,743
Nonsense. You're a highly
regarded member of this crew.

291
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:12,005
And I can assure you the captain
regards your input more than you know.

292
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:16,305
Billy's going with you.

293
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,410
Who's Billy?

294
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:26,289
What exactly happens to all this?

295
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:29,056
It goes to the Guthries.

296
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:30,795
They pay up front for it,

297
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,689
take it someplace civilized
and sell it.

298
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:34,128
The Guthries?

299
00:22:34,194 --> 00:22:35,496
Mate, no offense,

300
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:38,694
but the faster we get this loaded,
the faster I can get up the hill

301
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,596
and into the arms of
my sweet, sweet Charlotte.

302
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:06,515
Your recipes?

303
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,146
I left them with our
captain for safekeeping,

304
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:11,084
but I don't see them with
the rest of the journals.

305
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:13,886
All the volumes
from the prize are here

306
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,454
unless the captain took it.

307
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:19,093
In which case,
it's in his cabin on the ship.

308
00:23:19,158 --> 00:23:21,028
He likes his books.

309
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,968
- Is that him?
- Is this necessary?

310
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:32,536
He's just a cook.

311
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:35,502
He meets the new ones.
No exceptions.

312
00:23:35,575 --> 00:23:37,868
Um, what's going on?

313
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:39,538
Who wants to meet me?

314
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:41,567
Blackbeard.

315
00:23:57,448 --> 00:24:01,108
Whatever you do,
don't show fear.

316
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:33,610
You're not Blackbeard.

317
00:24:38,982 --> 00:24:41,189
- Oh. I see.
- (Pirates laughing)

318
00:24:41,254 --> 00:24:43,188
If you get lost in there,
give us a yell.

319
00:24:43,253 --> 00:24:44,892
- (Laughing)
- (Door closes)

320
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:57,105
Rules are rules.

321
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:58,978
And you are ours.

322
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:21,566
(Men shouting)

323
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:26,681
MAN:
Mr. Gates.

324
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,715
I need a moment with your boss.

325
00:25:32,788 --> 00:25:34,820
(Glass shatters)

326
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:36,494
Not a good time.

327
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,231
WOMAN:
Get the fuck out.

328
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:40,430
You want to run at first sign
of trouble, be my guest,

329
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:42,229
but don't expect me
to fucking help you.

330
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,504
And that goes for all of you.

331
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:47,303
If you want to hunt,
my door is open.

332
00:25:47,368 --> 00:25:49,670
But if the mere whiff of the
navy is too much for you,

333
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:52,280
then God bless
and get the fuck out.

334
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:54,617
MAN:
Fuck yourself, cunt.

335
00:25:54,682 --> 00:25:56,616
(Cup clatters)

336
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:06,130
Did you just
tell me to fuck myself?

337
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:12,039
Mr. Scott, who is this man?

338
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,535
Mr. Sanderson.

339
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:16,112
Crews with Captain Burgess
of the Trinity.

340
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:18,049
How much was their last haul?

341
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:21,184
SCOTT: Nearly a thousand in profit.
Best tally in months.

342
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:28,684
Well, Mr. Sanderson.

343
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:31,219
Pleased to be in your company.

344
00:26:31,284 --> 00:26:33,250
Do you know why?

345
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:37,719
Because you're an earner.

346
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:40,454
Can I tell you what happens
when I stand near an earner?

347
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,867
My pussy gets wet.

348
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:53,044
In which case,
I will go fuck myself.

349
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:55,615
(Crowd cheering, laughing)

350
00:26:57,586 --> 00:26:59,722
Mistress Guthrie.

351
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:02,490
Now what the fuck do you want?

352
00:27:02,563 --> 00:27:04,889
I wish you'd get
control of your men.

353
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:07,132
They come in here spouting off

354
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:08,869
they've seen
His Majesty's Navy out there

355
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:10,731
and I have three crews
pulling orders

356
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:12,969
because they haven't got enough
balls to get back in the water.

357
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:14,768
I'll make sure to keep
that in mind, ma'am,

358
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,272
but right now the Scarborough
is the least of my concerns.

359
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,144
We have an agitator.

360
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,177
Fuck does that mean?

361
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,575
Challenger for the captaincy
of the Walrus

362
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:29,018
capitalizing on our friend's
recent rough patch.

363
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,355
I expect him to call a vote soon.

364
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:35,629
I expect it to be close.

365
00:27:35,694 --> 00:27:38,700
Flint's got morale problems.
What do you want me to do about it?

366
00:27:40,271 --> 00:27:42,808
I need money to shore up support.

367
00:27:42,873 --> 00:27:44,946
You want a loan?

368
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:47,679
Flint's made you more money
than any captain here.

369
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:49,951
But lately he hasn't.

370
00:27:50,024 --> 00:27:52,256
Yeah, well, that will change.
But mark my words,

371
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:55,056
without that money,
the most valuable captain on this island

372
00:27:55,129 --> 00:27:57,498
will be out of a job tomorrow.

373
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:03,511
Think of it as an
investment in the future.

374
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:05,773
SCOTT: You steal cargo
at the end of a sword.

375
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:08,738
We sell that cargo to markets
that will never have you.

376
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:12,683
When you are strong,
you are a necessary evil.

377
00:28:12,748 --> 00:28:15,917
When you are not strong,
you are likely soon to be dead.

378
00:28:17,253 --> 00:28:19,589
But what you are not ever

379
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,959
is a sound investment.

380
00:28:26,198 --> 00:28:27,594
How much would you need?

381
00:28:33,364 --> 00:28:36,539
1,000 pieces of eight,
give or take.

382
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:49,889
Take this to Virgil.

383
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,336
He'll see that you get
what you need.

384
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:56,879
Thank you, ma'am.

385
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:05,068
What?

386
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:06,731
I'm wondering what it is

387
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:09,232
exactly
you think you just purchased.

388
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:11,072
It's my money, isn't it?

389
00:29:11,137 --> 00:29:13,301
Must I answer for how I spend it?

390
00:29:13,366 --> 00:29:16,070
To me, no.

391
00:29:16,143 --> 00:29:18,406
But this enterprise
belongs to your father.

392
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:22,272
And I do not believe
he would approve of this...

393
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:25,007
investment.

394
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:28,547
Well, then I suppose it's a good
thing that my father isn't here.

395
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:44,727
(knocking)

396
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:50,733
Mr. Smith to see Mr. Guthrie.

397
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:54,930
He's not expecting me.

398
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:07,409
What does the crew
think of me, Billy?

399
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:10,046
Beg your pardon?

400
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:11,910
You're the ship's boatswain.

401
00:30:11,983 --> 00:30:14,982
You know what's said
behind my back.

402
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:17,252
Um...

403
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:21,187
I know they've always
found me aloof,

404
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,557
too educated.

405
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,956
But now it seems they feel I'm...

406
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:28,891
Too weak.

407
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:31,660
I was gonna say unlucky.

408
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,134
So that's the thinking.

409
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:37,335
We've been attacking ships
with light loads

410
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:39,639
because I'm too weak
to do otherwise.

411
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:41,878
Is that what you think?

412
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:45,708
I...

413
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:49,115
What the hell are you doing here?

414
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,416
Now is that any way
to greet a friend?

415
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:55,449
I much prefer that way.

416
00:30:59,256 --> 00:31:01,888
A sugar factor from Carolina.

417
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,896
Who purchases stolen
cargo from you

418
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:06,894
because he trusts me

419
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:10,462
because I have cultivated
his confidence.

420
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:14,472
And because I keep him from
ever having to lay eyes on you.

421
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:19,706
Then the sooner we get down
to business, the better.

422
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:22,003
(Pipe music playing softly)

423
00:31:37,384 --> 00:31:39,485
A whore for every finger
on your hand,

424
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,684
but your eyes
kept drifting to this.

425
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:45,952
Tell me, what is it
that is so precious to you?

426
00:31:46,017 --> 00:31:48,486
One scream will bring Mr. Noonan.

427
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:50,190
Bring him.

428
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:52,854
I'll let him know his whores like
to steal from their customers.

429
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:55,427
And he can let
your new captain know

430
00:31:55,493 --> 00:31:57,597
you have withheld something
of great value

431
00:31:57,662 --> 00:32:00,698
that rightly belonged
to his latest prize.

432
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:02,760
(Chuckles)

433
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:06,769
So, what now?

434
00:32:08,203 --> 00:32:09,769
This is to sell, is it not?

435
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:13,069
But you cannot know
who best to sell it to.

436
00:32:13,134 --> 00:32:14,973
I could know that.

437
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:17,343
Hmm, and what's that
going to cost me?

438
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,443
- Half.
- (Laughs)

439
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:23,510
Pleasure should be shared equally.

440
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,049
It's the only way
to avoid hurt feelings.

441
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:30,259
Look, this deal,

442
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,562
it's really a terrible idea.

443
00:32:32,627 --> 00:32:35,264
There are so many
ways it could go wrong.

444
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,598
Me, I can't help myself.

445
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:41,060
I see an opportunity, I take it.

446
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,866
It's a sickness. Truly.

447
00:32:43,931 --> 00:32:47,570
But you,
you can still walk away.

448
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:49,138
<i>Bien.</i>

449
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:50,536
Now tell me what it is.

450
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:59,107
I don't know.

451
00:33:20,296 --> 00:33:21,599
(Speaks foreign language)

452
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:32,275
You're not going to throw
your support behind Singleton.

453
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:37,013
I wondered when
this visit would come.

454
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,198
The vote is closer than you think.

455
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:58,567
I know this

456
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:02,373
because I brought
back 16 votes today.

457
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:04,571
Nelson's men are always for sale.

458
00:34:04,636 --> 00:34:07,214
Paying Muldoon got me the Welsh.

459
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,717
As of now,
Singleton is only up eight votes.

460
00:34:11,782 --> 00:34:14,854
And you and your men hold nine.

461
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,151
So...

462
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:18,760
The captain's fate is in our hands.

463
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:21,525
In your hands.
Your men vote with you.

464
00:34:23,032 --> 00:34:24,929
And how much are you
willing to pay

465
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:26,801
for those votes?

466
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:29,106
(Sighs)
Well...

467
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:31,333
Nothing.

468
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:33,573
Spent everything I had
getting this far.

469
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,237
Hmm.

470
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:37,573
Think about your men.

471
00:34:37,638 --> 00:34:39,845
Think about their future.

472
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:43,245
Is it their future
you wish to protect

473
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,045
or your friend's?

474
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:50,146
What difference does it make?

475
00:34:56,288 --> 00:34:58,286
And you will pay us, obviously,

476
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:01,494
from the very first prize we take.

477
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,491
I assumed that went without saying.

478
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,539
(Music playing)

479
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:25,148
(Men laughing)

480
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:30,255
You're in a festive mood.

481
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:35,393
What do you want, Rackham?

482
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:39,329
I'd hoped to toast your coronation
as captain of the Walrus.

483
00:35:39,402 --> 00:35:43,202
Alas, I'm not so sure
that's where we're headed.

484
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:08,066
You should keep your distance till
I signal you to return for me.

485
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:10,702
If anything should happen
and I don't return soon...

486
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:13,833
- I leave.
- Smart girl.

487
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:51,303
FLINT: Let me tell you a story
about a Spaniard named Vazquez.

488
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:56,942
A few weeks ago he staggers
into a tavern on Port Royal.

489
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:00,078
Takes a seat next to
an English merchant captain.

490
00:37:01,582 --> 00:37:04,747
Vazquez, it turns out, is dying.

491
00:37:04,812 --> 00:37:07,746
Bleeding to death from
a knife wound to the belly.

492
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:10,251
The knife wound was courtesy

493
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:12,852
of his former employer,

494
00:37:12,924 --> 00:37:15,057
La Casa de Contratacion,
in Seville.

495
00:37:15,122 --> 00:37:16,592
Colonial intelligence.

496
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:18,993
Naval, more specifically.

497
00:37:19,058 --> 00:37:21,361
One of their top agents
in the Americas.

498
00:37:21,426 --> 00:37:25,235
Responsible for the security
of one particular ship.

499
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:29,938
A ship with a cargo so rich,

500
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:33,412
the king of Spain is very
anxious to see it launched.

501
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:37,272
Vazquez warned
that it was too late.

502
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:38,880
Storm season was upon them

503
00:37:38,946 --> 00:37:40,747
and no escort could
be mustered to guard her.

504
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:45,051
But his superiors
demanded that he sign off.

505
00:37:45,123 --> 00:37:47,891
They advised him that if he
couldn't arrange for an escort,

506
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:51,397
he should plot a course for the ship
unknown to anyone but her captain

507
00:37:51,462 --> 00:37:53,931
and consider that route
to be a state secret

508
00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:55,731
of the highest order.

509
00:37:55,796 --> 00:37:58,929
When Vazquez refused
and threatened to report

510
00:37:59,002 --> 00:38:01,136
his concerns to the court,

511
00:38:01,202 --> 00:38:03,074
things got ugly.

512
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:10,177
The ship in question...

513
00:38:12,515 --> 00:38:14,418
L'Urca de Lima.

514
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:20,186
The largest Spanish treasure galleon
in the Americas.

515
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:21,954
According to Vazquez,

516
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:29,070
total cargo in excess of $5 million.

517
00:38:29,135 --> 00:38:30,804
Marvelous story, Captain.

518
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,835
And how exactly
did you come to hear it?

519
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:40,306
A spy in my employ in Port Royal
who overheard the conversation.

520
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:42,913
I must admit,
I harbored my doubts

521
00:38:42,978 --> 00:38:46,280
to its authenticity
right up until yesterday

522
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:49,151
when I took the merchant
captain's ship

523
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:53,015
and found Vazquez's story
neatly written into his log.

524
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:56,485
Most impressive.

525
00:38:56,558 --> 00:39:00,019
It sounds like your plan
is neatly resolved.

526
00:39:00,092 --> 00:39:02,662
What could you possibly
want of me?

527
00:39:02,727 --> 00:39:06,294
Not quite entirely resolved.

528
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:09,534
A page was torn from the log

529
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,806
with the Urca's course
and schedule written on it.

530
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:14,841
Now I could recreate it
from what's left,

531
00:39:14,913 --> 00:39:16,514
but I'd need help.

532
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:19,481
Someone with expert knowledge
of Spanish operations.

533
00:39:21,587 --> 00:39:23,482
Your man in Havana.

534
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:27,259
I need you to make an introduction.

535
00:39:30,762 --> 00:39:33,192
Absolutely not.

536
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:41,336
Five million Spanish dollars.

537
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:45,240
When I take that ship,
you stand to gain...

538
00:39:45,305 --> 00:39:47,208
When you take it?

539
00:39:47,273 --> 00:39:50,376
Do you have idea how heavily
armed that ship is?

540
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:53,382
- Even without an escort.
- The risk is all mine.

541
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:56,318
The risk is not all yours.

542
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:59,323
If I were to even
make inquiries about this

543
00:39:59,388 --> 00:40:01,996
with colonial intelligence,
they'd see me dead.

544
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:04,995
You may have nothing to lose,

545
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,131
but I have a future planned
I'm not so willing to throw away.

546
00:40:10,932 --> 00:40:12,908
Let me make myself plain.

547
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,309
I will have that name.

548
00:40:18,778 --> 00:40:20,209
(Groans)

549
00:40:20,274 --> 00:40:23,713
Billy, put your pistol
on Mr. Guthrie here.

550
00:40:23,778 --> 00:40:25,984
- (Groans)
- (Pistol hammer clicks)

551
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:36,122
The name, please.

552
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:39,668
I'm telling you it is simply
out of the question.

553
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:40,899
- (Cracks)
- (Groans)

554
00:40:40,964 --> 00:40:42,833
Captain!

555
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:46,939
(Horse whinnies)

556
00:40:47,004 --> 00:40:49,973
(Hoofbeats approaching)

557
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:54,413
- MAN: Hold here.
- MAN 2: Aye, Captain.

558
00:40:57,752 --> 00:40:58,991
What is it?

559
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:07,929
SERVANT: Captain Hume of
His Majesty's Ship the Scarborough.

560
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:14,704
RICHARD:
Captain Hume.

561
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:16,104
You've caught me at business.

562
00:41:16,177 --> 00:41:19,410
I must ask you
to return another day.

563
00:41:19,475 --> 00:41:21,081
My apologies, Mr. Guthrie.

564
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,576
May I ask

565
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:25,483
what sort of business?

566
00:41:25,556 --> 00:41:27,323
I'm sorry?

567
00:41:27,388 --> 00:41:30,924
I asked what sort of business
you're conducting with these men.

568
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,490
Sugar merchants from the colonies

569
00:41:33,563 --> 00:41:36,995
with business I'd just as soon
conclude without interruption.

570
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:41,000
So please, if you'll excuse us.

571
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,634
Tell me something, Mr. Guthrie.

572
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:45,399
Do you have gossip here?

573
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,469
Gossip?

574
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:49,469
I've often wondered
if it can survive

575
00:41:49,534 --> 00:41:51,639
in so remote a location.

576
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:55,411
You see, gossip is what
holds civilization together.

577
00:41:55,476 --> 00:41:58,212
It reinforces shame.

578
00:41:58,277 --> 00:42:00,581
And without shame, well,

579
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:03,550
the world is a very dangerous place.

580
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:05,757
I'm sorry.

581
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:07,726
I don't understand.

582
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:11,559
Do you know what the gossip
is in London about you?

583
00:42:13,229 --> 00:42:15,796
The gossip is that
you make your profits

584
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:17,966
selling ill-gotten cargo

585
00:42:18,031 --> 00:42:21,205
stolen by the pirates
of Providence Island.

586
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,868
There's no truth to that.

587
00:42:25,605 --> 00:42:28,389
We'll certainly find out,
won't we?

588
00:42:28,424 --> 00:42:31,706
Take them into custody.
All of them.

589
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,956
(Grunting)

590
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,145
You told me you
and your men were with me.

591
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:49,713
You gave me your word.

592
00:42:49,778 --> 00:42:52,545
I do what's best for my family.

593
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,082
I'm what's best for your family.

594
00:42:54,147 --> 00:42:55,652
Flint has fucked us all
for long enough.

595
00:42:55,717 --> 00:42:57,958
Can't you see that?

596
00:43:26,652 --> 00:43:29,186
(Shouts, groans)

597
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:31,818
(Gurgling)

598
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:48,832
Captain Vane.

599
00:43:56,476 --> 00:43:58,200
ELEANOR:
Do I even want to know?

600
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:01,071
It's been a long day.

601
00:44:01,136 --> 00:44:02,945
But I am up one vote.

602
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,177
Looks like Flint is safe.

603
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:18,226
Mr. Gates.

604
00:44:22,698 --> 00:44:26,766
When he didn't return,
we came looking for him.

605
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,765
I found him here.

606
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:32,404
He said one word before he died...

607
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,738
Vane.

608
00:44:36,665 --> 00:44:38,600
Damn butcher.

609
00:44:38,673 --> 00:44:42,073
Yeah, but did you figure
him for a clever one?

610
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,673
I know what you're thinking.

611
00:44:45,513 --> 00:44:48,648
And we'd lose that fight.
At least today.

612
00:44:50,785 --> 00:44:53,016
- Fuck that.
- Eleanor.

613
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:54,321
Eleanor!

614
00:44:57,858 --> 00:45:01,457
(Voices overlapping)

615
00:45:05,265 --> 00:45:08,204
Awfully pleased
with himself, isn't he?

616
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:11,644
Why shouldn't he be?
With Mosiah gone,

617
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,781
Flint no longer holds
the votes to remain captain.

618
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:18,211
Once the Walrus's men realize
Mr. Singleton's limitations,

619
00:45:18,284 --> 00:45:22,220
we'll have a host of talented
defectors eager to swell our ranks.

620
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:24,723
And he only gets stronger.

621
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,618
He doesn't get shit
without you bringing up

622
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:28,689
that Singleton business
in the first place.

623
00:45:28,754 --> 00:45:32,396
Yes, well, we all
have our roles to play.

624
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,165
- (Grunts)
- I want to fuck.

625
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:39,536
What, because of what I just said?

626
00:45:39,609 --> 00:45:42,038
Fuck's it matter to you?

627
00:45:42,111 --> 00:45:43,679
All right, then.

628
00:45:47,649 --> 00:45:49,215
Ms. Guthrie.

629
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:57,858
(Crowd gasps)

630
00:45:57,931 --> 00:46:01,266
- (Grunts)
- CROWD: Ooh!

631
00:46:17,848 --> 00:46:21,082
Now, would you like to tell
me what that was all about?

632
00:46:23,553 --> 00:46:25,719
You fucked me tonight.

633
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:28,251
Flint, his captaincy,
I had an interest.

634
00:46:28,316 --> 00:46:30,955
You'll live.

635
00:46:31,452 --> 00:46:32,891
You'll make it right.

636
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,985
Why would I do that?

637
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,920
'Cause if you don't,
you're finished here.

638
00:46:36,993 --> 00:46:39,591
I won't sell another
ounce of your cargo.

639
00:46:39,656 --> 00:46:43,198
See how long you'll last as captain
when your crew can't get paid.

640
00:46:43,263 --> 00:46:46,629
Eleanor, your father sells my cargo.

641
00:46:46,695 --> 00:46:48,829
Whatever it is
you're so upset about,

642
00:46:48,902 --> 00:46:50,867
I doubt he feels the same.

643
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:55,467
When I tell him you put our biggest
earner out of business, he'll...

644
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,704
Remind you that Flint hasn't been your
biggest earner in quite some time.

645
00:46:58,769 --> 00:47:02,543
You'll also be reminded of what you've
always known but never accepted,

646
00:47:02,608 --> 00:47:04,440
that if forced,

647
00:47:04,513 --> 00:47:08,540
your father will always
choose profits over daughters.

648
00:47:12,783 --> 00:47:15,981
Hate your father?
I wouldn't blame you.

649
00:47:16,054 --> 00:47:18,221
Hate me, too, if you'd like.

650
00:47:18,286 --> 00:47:20,693
And if you feel the need,
cling to Flint

651
00:47:20,758 --> 00:47:24,662
and his legend and a past the
rest of us have long outgrown.

652
00:47:24,727 --> 00:47:26,733
But make no mistake about it,

653
00:47:26,798 --> 00:47:30,032
whatever future this place has left,

654
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:31,704
I'm it.

655
00:47:31,769 --> 00:47:35,810
And if you ever challenge me
again in front of my crew,

656
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:38,514
I may just forget
that I loved you once.

657
00:47:43,054 --> 00:47:45,420
- (Music playing)
- (Chatter, laughing)

658
00:47:55,395 --> 00:47:57,203
Have you found us a buyer?

659
00:47:57,268 --> 00:47:59,405
Patience, mon cher.

660
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:02,510
Few here are willing
to cross your captain.

661
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:06,648
And those I have in mind
must be approached with caution.

662
00:48:15,721 --> 00:48:17,856
Excuse me.

663
00:48:47,535 --> 00:48:48,807
Who did this?

664
00:48:51,913 --> 00:48:53,878
Him?

665
00:48:53,943 --> 00:48:55,743
I started it.

666
00:48:55,816 --> 00:48:57,248
(Scoffs)

667
00:49:09,188 --> 00:49:11,228
Why would you do this?

668
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:16,628
(Winces)
Please.

669
00:49:19,469 --> 00:49:22,668
When the sea grows rough,

670
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,139
you come to Max.

671
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:31,079
Max is your harbor.

672
00:49:32,352 --> 00:49:34,551
It's all coming apart.

673
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:39,119
This place, I can feel it
slipping away...

674
00:49:48,134 --> 00:49:50,999
You are so ready to see the worst.

675
00:49:56,572 --> 00:49:58,872
You cannot see

676
00:49:58,937 --> 00:50:01,903
what is right in front
of your nose.

677
00:50:34,671 --> 00:50:37,606
(Gasping)

678
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:41,076
The world is so full of surprises.

679
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:46,317
Let it surprise you.

680
00:50:46,382 --> 00:50:49,055
(Moaning)

681
00:51:14,477 --> 00:51:16,044
What are you doing?

682
00:51:17,748 --> 00:51:20,745
I don't believe any of the men
have ever met him face-to-face.

683
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:23,144
We'll need to find
a safe place to stash him

684
00:51:23,217 --> 00:51:25,279
before he comes to
and starts talking.

685
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:28,245
But in the meantime, I certainly don't
want his clothes giving him away.

686
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:32,716
You're gonna pretend that
isn't Richard Guthrie?

687
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,819
Soon word of Guthrie's arrest

688
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:37,185
will hit the customs
houses of Charleston,

689
00:51:37,258 --> 00:51:39,753
New York, and eventually Boston.

690
00:51:39,826 --> 00:51:42,853
Sooner than later,
Nassau will be unable

691
00:51:42,926 --> 00:51:45,861
to sell to any legitimate market
in the Americas.

692
00:51:45,926 --> 00:51:47,893
I don't want the men
panicked about that

693
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,632
when I need them
focused on the Urca.

694
00:51:49,697 --> 00:51:52,834
Jesus. Can you hear yourself?

695
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:56,707
You spent months lying to us

696
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,442
about what it is
we're hunting out here.

697
00:51:58,507 --> 00:52:01,007
And now when it's clear
it can't possibly succeed,

698
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,245
you want to keep lying.

699
00:52:05,877 --> 00:52:08,983
Maybe Singleton is right.
Maybe it's time we made a change.

700
00:52:16,323 --> 00:52:17,860
Think carefully.

701
00:52:19,295 --> 00:52:21,925
What lies ahead, Mr. Singleton
cannot see you through.

702
00:52:21,998 --> 00:52:23,227
And what is that?

703
00:52:24,764 --> 00:52:26,100
There's a war coming, Billy.

704
00:52:26,165 --> 00:52:27,299
One ship isn't a war.

705
00:52:27,364 --> 00:52:29,066
One ship isn't what's coming.

706
00:52:29,131 --> 00:52:31,137
That man Hume,

707
00:52:31,202 --> 00:52:33,400
the captain of the Scarborough
told you as much.

708
00:52:33,473 --> 00:52:36,504
When a king brands us pirates,

709
00:52:36,569 --> 00:52:39,471
he doesn't mean
to make us adversaries.

710
00:52:39,544 --> 00:52:41,942
He doesn't mean
to make us criminals.

711
00:52:42,007 --> 00:52:44,446
He means to make us monsters.

712
00:52:44,511 --> 00:52:48,919
For that's the only way his
God-fearing, taxpaying subjects

713
00:52:48,985 --> 00:52:53,123
can make sense of men who keep
what is theirs and fear no one.

714
00:52:53,196 --> 00:52:55,627
When I say there's a war coming,

715
00:52:55,692 --> 00:52:57,899
I don't mean with the Scarborough.

716
00:52:57,964 --> 00:53:00,404
I don't mean
with King George or England.

717
00:53:03,173 --> 00:53:06,540
Civilization is coming

718
00:53:06,605 --> 00:53:09,341
and it means to exterminate us.

719
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,011
If we are to survive,

720
00:53:13,076 --> 00:53:16,624
we must unite behind our own king.

721
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:21,057
We have no kings here.

722
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:24,793
I am your king.

723
00:53:30,536 --> 00:53:32,600
(Whistling)

724
00:53:43,508 --> 00:53:45,979
(Crewmen murmuring)

725
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,984
The crew is assembled
for council.

726
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:53,552
Mr. Singleton has called for a vote

727
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:56,830
to select himself as the
new captain of this crew.

728
00:53:58,263 --> 00:53:59,797
I need a minute.

729
00:54:08,003 --> 00:54:09,169
What happened with Richard?

730
00:54:15,305 --> 00:54:17,105
Oh, Jesus.

731
00:54:31,758 --> 00:54:34,097
I thought you said
you'd deal with this.

732
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:37,370
It fell through.

733
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:42,108
You need to figure out what
you're gonna say to them.

734
00:54:42,181 --> 00:54:43,781
They don't care about
anything I have to say.

735
00:54:43,846 --> 00:54:46,054
Well, you need to make 'em care!

736
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,852
Or I don't know what happens next.

737
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:56,835
I can stall 'em
for a few more minutes.

738
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:03,074
And I am sorry.

739
00:55:15,658 --> 00:55:18,667
(Grunts)

740
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,132
(Panting)

741
00:55:42,713 --> 00:55:45,543
(Crewmen murmuring)

742
00:55:52,453 --> 00:55:54,779
(Murmuring stops)

743
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,365
I'm sorry.

744
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:14,506
For the short hauls.

745
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,178
For the trouble I've caused.

746
00:56:16,243 --> 00:56:18,912
But most importantly,

747
00:56:18,978 --> 00:56:21,650
for the disregard
it seems I've shown you.

748
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,326
The most important
element of a healthy ship

749
00:56:26,391 --> 00:56:28,525
is trust.

750
00:56:28,598 --> 00:56:31,431
Trust between men.

751
00:56:31,496 --> 00:56:33,872
Trust between captain and crew.

752
00:56:35,841 --> 00:56:38,007
Without it,

753
00:56:38,072 --> 00:56:40,040
a ship is doomed.

754
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:45,783
For the past few months,

755
00:56:45,848 --> 00:56:48,516
you and I have been on the trail

756
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:52,149
of a prize so rich,

757
00:56:52,222 --> 00:56:55,251
it could upset the very
nature of our world.

758
00:56:56,851 --> 00:56:59,522
And for that reason,
I felt it necessary

759
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:02,162
to keep it secret.

760
00:57:02,227 --> 00:57:04,863
I didn't trust you.

761
00:57:04,936 --> 00:57:06,599
And that was my mistake.

762
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,543
Right now I would like to
tell you that that prize

763
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:14,206
is within our grasp
and we are close.

764
00:57:15,847 --> 00:57:17,246
So close.

765
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:20,044
But it would appear
that my concerns

766
00:57:20,109 --> 00:57:22,244
about secrecy had merit.

767
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,554
Someone on this crew
discovered my plans...

768
00:57:29,418 --> 00:57:31,659
and tore from this log
the very page

769
00:57:31,724 --> 00:57:35,861
necessary to discover that prize.

770
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,499
Stole it for their own gain.

771
00:57:39,564 --> 00:57:42,268
Stole it from us.

772
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,943
And then

773
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:51,049
stoked your resentment
to cover his crime...

774
00:57:52,821 --> 00:57:55,523
and make himself your captain.

775
00:57:55,588 --> 00:57:57,987
What?

776
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,529
I don't know
what he's talking about.

777
00:58:02,594 --> 00:58:06,164
That's a very serious accusation,
Captain.

778
00:58:06,237 --> 00:58:08,838
Thievery is punishable by death.

779
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,375
As is a false accusal of the same.

780
00:58:17,017 --> 00:58:20,220
Then, as per the articles,

781
00:58:20,293 --> 00:58:22,860
the accused has a choice.

782
00:58:22,925 --> 00:58:24,924
He can submit to a trial.

783
00:58:24,996 --> 00:58:27,260
With who as judge? You?

784
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:29,197
No.

785
00:58:29,269 --> 00:58:30,994
No fucking way.

786
00:58:35,864 --> 00:58:37,669
Then swords.

787
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:43,070
Perhaps it's better this way.

788
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:47,077
Be rid of you once and for all.

789
00:58:59,155 --> 00:59:01,357
(Shouting)

790
00:59:01,422 --> 00:59:03,724
(Crew cheering)

791
00:59:25,171 --> 00:59:27,367
CREWMAN:
Come on!

792
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:30,742
Come on, Singleton!

793
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:53,273
Get up!

794
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,075
Come on!

795
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,328
(Cheering)

796
01:00:32,638 --> 01:00:35,100
(Cheering stops)

797
01:00:36,668 --> 01:00:39,234
(Grunting)

798
01:00:40,602 --> 01:00:43,241
(Panting)

799
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:44,462
It's the stolen page.

800
01:01:44,527 --> 01:01:46,997
(Crew murmuring)

801
01:01:53,698 --> 01:01:56,799
Friends,

802
01:01:56,864 --> 01:01:58,505
brothers...

803
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:03,838
the prize that you and I
have been pursuing...

804
01:02:05,703 --> 01:02:07,677
is L'Urca de Lima.

805
01:02:09,246 --> 01:02:11,342
The Hulk.

806
01:02:11,414 --> 01:02:13,782
A prize of almost unimaginable value.

807
01:02:16,014 --> 01:02:19,146
Now with this page securely
in our possession,

808
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:21,419
we can begin our hunt.

809
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:24,956
And we will succeed

810
01:02:25,021 --> 01:02:26,858
no matter the cost.

811
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:28,425
No matter the struggle.

812
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:31,927
I will see that prize is yours.

813
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,432
I'm not just gonna make you rich.

814
01:02:36,497 --> 01:02:39,465
I'm not just gonna make you strong.

815
01:02:39,538 --> 01:02:42,707
I'm gonna make you
the princes of the New World!

816
01:02:42,772 --> 01:02:45,242
(Rhythmic pounding)

817
01:02:47,276 --> 01:02:50,821
(Crew chanting)
Flint! Flint! Flint! Flint!

818
01:02:50,886 --> 01:02:53,286
Flint! Flint! Flint!

819
01:02:53,351 --> 01:02:55,853
(Cheering)

820
01:03:12,181 --> 01:03:14,383
He's downstairs.

821
01:03:36,587 --> 01:03:38,090
Can I help you?

822
01:03:39,386 --> 01:03:42,057
Perhaps we can help each other.

823
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:47,495
I think I have something
you might want to buy.
