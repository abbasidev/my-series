1
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,184
<i>You took one of me best
whores for your private use.</i>

2
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,847
Every day she's not under
my roof costs me money.

3
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:23,816
(grunts)

4
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,477
Wait, listen to me!

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,780
(gagging)

6
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:30,019
Good men will die for some hidden agenda,

7
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:32,049
<i>the Barlow woman's agenda.</i>

8
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:34,781
Things will get better here.
I promise you they will.

9
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:36,317
We'll need some additional items.

10
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:38,254
New guns, 12-pounders.

11
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,854
You'll have it.

12
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:42,619
You want the guns from my
ship to hand over to a pirate?

13
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:43,785
That is correct.

14
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:45,151
<i>Richard: Help me, Mr. Scott.</i>

15
00:00:45,224 --> 00:00:46,851
Please, help me save her.

16
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,113
Why don't I take over?

17
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:51,285
<i>Eleanor: The Andromache, it can't be.</i>

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,980
<i>Captain Bryson hasn't had time to unload.</i>

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,650
He didn't. She's riding low.

20
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:56,184
<i>Those guns are still on board.</i>

21
00:00:56,249 --> 00:00:58,482
- Eleanor: What are we going to do?
- Get them back.

22
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:03,980
<i>(theme music playing)</i>

23
00:02:35,728 --> 00:02:37,665
(wind blowing)

24
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,664
<i>Billy: Captain?</i>

25
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:55,702
We're steady at six
knots, north by northeast.

26
00:02:57,903 --> 00:02:59,713
You don't trust me, do you?

27
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:06,045
<i>With any luck, we'll
sight the Andromache soon.</i>

28
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,552
The battle will begin.

29
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:14,162
You and I will have our roles to play.

30
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:19,639
We have the chance for a
few minutes' honesty first.

31
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:23,375
Honesty?

32
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:30,048
Men died yesterday

33
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:32,810
careening our ship faster than was safe.

34
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,650
Men are going to die today

35
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,418
attacking that merchant ship out there,

36
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,986
and they'll die not knowing
it was all based on a lie.

37
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:41,952
A lie?

38
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:43,983
We don't even know if the
Urca's schedule is accurate.

39
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,920
We're completely relying on the cook.

40
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,822
How can you just pretend you
have no doubts about any of this?

41
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,419
Years of practice.

42
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:53,488
There's always doubt, Billy.

43
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:54,960
No sane man would deny that.

44
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:58,496
No good captain would acknowledge it.

45
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:00,700
Take our present route, for instance.

46
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:03,171
We tacked north by northeast,

47
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:05,703
along Andromache's best point of sail.

48
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:08,538
If you're Bryson, that's the smart course.

49
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:09,771
Yeah...

50
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:11,709
Well, he knows that I know that.

51
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:14,443
So wouldn't he have at least
considered heading northwest

52
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:18,017
to follow the coast, lose us in the dark?

53
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:22,120
Or due east on the chance that
we might sail right past him?

54
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:25,826
There must be at least one chance in three

55
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,687
that that horizon will remain bare

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,892
and we'll never see the Andromache again.

57
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:33,956
That's the truth.

58
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:36,227
But what good would that knowledge do

59
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:40,758
for any man on this crew trying
to focus on doing his job?

60
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:46,032
This crew needs certainty,

61
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:48,305
and I need their support to achieve an end

62
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,907
which is in all our best interests.

63
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,876
So we dance the dance.

64
00:04:57,816 --> 00:05:01,886
Never was there a Caesar
that couldn't sing the tune.

65
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,495
Who's Mrs. Barlow?

66
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:08,599
Ah.

67
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,366
You've heard the stories, haven't you?

68
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,934
She's a witch who pledged
my soul to the devil,

69
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,976
and anoints me with the blood of infants

70
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,442
to keep me safe in battle.

71
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:25,820
- Come on, I'm not stupid.
- No, you're not.

72
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:29,622
So you can probably
guess it isn't as much fun

73
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:32,125
to tell stories about how
your captain makes a home,

74
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,398
with a nice Puritan woman
who shares his love of books.

75
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:41,300
Is that the truth?

76
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:44,303
<i>Man: Sails!</i>

77
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,176
<i>Man your posts!</i>

78
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:48,209
<i>Man 2: Posts!</i>

79
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,778
<i>Man 3: Have a look.</i>

80
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,650
<i>Man: It's the Andromache!</i>

81
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:54,049
<i>(crew shouting)</i>

82
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,926
<i>(bird trilling)</i>

83
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,623
<i>(dogs barking)</i>

84
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:15,777
Well, this is a stupid fucking idea.

85
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,780
Given the straits we're in, I would
suggest there is no such thing.

86
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,053
If we don't find a way to
earn an income and soon,

87
00:06:21,118 --> 00:06:23,987
we will lose what little
we have left of a crew.

88
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,881
Or worse yet, we will be eaten

89
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:28,554
<i>by what little we have left of a crew.</i>

90
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,788
Wish me luck.

91
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:32,492
You gave him permission, dear.

92
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:34,029
We must stand by our word.

93
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:37,472
But I said he could put one
finger in my bum, not three.

94
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:40,472
Then next time, charge him by the digit.

95
00:06:40,537 --> 00:06:42,805
Mrs. Mapleton, a word, please.

96
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,806
What the fuck are you doing here?

97
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,078
Mr. Noonan expressly
forbade it, did he not?

98
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:50,615
It turns out Mr. Noonan
has had a change of heart.

99
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:57,553
A transfer? What is this?

100
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,486
It means, madam, that the dispute

101
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:02,023
over the whore with Mr.
Noonan has been settled

102
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:04,667
through an agreement to
purchase this establishment

103
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:07,202
from him... by us.

104
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:10,899
<i>- Noonan sold you the inn?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

105
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,602
And where is he now?

106
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:16,307
From the tone in his voice,
it sounded as if Mr. Noonan

107
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:18,203
couldn't wait to be rid of this place

108
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:20,671
and of its screeching pig of a bawd.

109
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:23,870
His words, not mine.

110
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,342
The last I saw him, he was
seeking passage to Port Royal,

111
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:28,214
and then to who knows where.

112
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,748
You're telling me that Mr. Noonan,

113
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:34,951
who just a few hours ago had the intent
of seeing your captain beaten to a pulp,

114
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:39,190
that Mr. Noonan decided instead
to sell you his life's work?

115
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:40,688
Yes.

116
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,298
And you expect me to accept it

117
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:44,635
based on a piece of paper and your word?

118
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,363
And to keep my mouth shut about it

119
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:49,773
<i>when any half-wit can see
that there's foul play at hand?</i>

120
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:51,037
Yes.

121
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:54,080
I want a raise.

122
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:56,583
- What did you make before?
- Three percent of gross.

123
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:58,447
I'll give you 40.

124
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,152
Welcome aboard, sonny.

125
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:11,257
We are the proud new owners of a brothel.

126
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,869
Let's hope no one notices.

127
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,403
No one has seen or heard
from Scott all morning.

128
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:23,371
He must have left with Bryson.

129
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,845
You're certain he said nothing
to you about why he would do this?

130
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,616
Nothing, ma'am.

131
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,647
- Before I knew what was happening...
- Get my horse ready.

132
00:08:29,712 --> 00:08:32,118
I'm going to see my father. I want
to know what the fuck's going on here.

133
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:37,420
(sighs)

134
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:42,261
Hello.

135
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:44,293
What the fuck are you doing in my office?

136
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,398
Flint stashed me here.

137
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:48,102
Presumably to stop what's in my head

138
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:50,333
from spilling onto the
deck of the Andromache.

139
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:54,605
Oh, that's Randall.

140
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,743
Why is Randall lying on my sofa?

141
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,311
(chuckles)

142
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,511
Well, he's not exactly going
to be leading the charge

143
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:02,143
after the day he had yesterday.

144
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:04,617
Why are you chained to him?

145
00:09:04,682 --> 00:09:06,456
So I don't try to run.

146
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:09,393
Thank you.

147
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:18,796
Sorry, have I done something to you?

148
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:20,363
Excuse me?

149
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:22,932
Well, you seem to harbor quite
a bit of anger towards me,

150
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:25,002
<i>and considering we hardly
even know each other,</i>

151
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,766
I'm wondering if there's
something I'm missing.

152
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:29,661
Flint and his crew offer you a
life of freedom and prosperity

153
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,835
for which you repay them
by stealing the product

154
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,498
of months of their labor and sacrifice.

155
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:35,835
But you're not finished. Then you
lure Max into your selfish scheme.

156
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,107
Hold on.

157
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:39,174
I specifically tried to talk her out

158
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:41,277
of getting wrapped up in my selfish scheme.

159
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:44,779
I know all I need to know
about the kind of man you are.

160
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:48,543
Ma'am, you should come outside right away.

161
00:09:50,112 --> 00:09:52,451
<i>Richard: For years, we've
all profited in this place,</i>

162
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:55,820
trading on the stability
of my family's name.

163
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:59,492
<i>But unfortunately, our
circumstances have changed.</i>

164
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:04,164
A fortnight ago, His Majesty's Navy
attempted to place me under arrest.

165
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,932
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

166
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,805
I am, since that day, a fugitive

167
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,344
marked for execution by the Crown.

168
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,009
(crowd groaning)

169
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:15,745
Unbeknownst to me, my family in Boston

170
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:19,015
learned of this and ordered Captain Bryson

171
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,917
to liquidate our holdings here.

172
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:22,582
<i>- (crowd yelling)
- Man: What about our goods?</i>

173
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,125
I convinced him to leave behind
the contents of our warehouse,

174
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,460
but that is all.

175
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,092
<i>To those of you owed credit</i>

176
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:33,027
or for whom we held goods on consignment,

177
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:37,896
I leave it to my daughter to see
you made whole as best we can.

178
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:40,927
But once that is settled,
our business with you

179
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,664
must be considered complete.

180
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:44,168
<i>(crowd groaning, yelling)</i>

181
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:47,502
I'm very sorry. Godspeed to you all.

182
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,007
<i>Man 2: I want my money back!</i>

183
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:52,177
<i>- (grunting)
- (Water splashing)</i>

184
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,586
We aren't closing on her!

185
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,891
I said to raise all the canvas!

186
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:14,721
<i>- What's our speed?
- Sails are all raised!</i>

187
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:16,257
No, they're not.

188
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,529
Where are my t'gallants
on the main and mizzen?

189
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,066
<i>De Groot: Captain, we're fully loaded.</i>

190
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:22,299
If we raise the t'gallants,
the mast won't hold.

191
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:24,868
<i>Man: Stand by to stretch that starboard!</i>

192
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:34,284
Time.

193
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,883
Present speed: six knots.

194
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:42,817
We need at least another knot
if we're to catch up by dark.

195
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:50,792
- Raise the t'gallants.
- Captain...

196
00:11:50,865 --> 00:11:53,061
Shift aft the back stays if
you're worried about the masts.

197
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:54,765
Shift 'em to the stern if you have to.

198
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,532
Even if the back stays
hold at such an angle,

199
00:11:56,597 --> 00:11:58,497
and I wager they won't,
the load on the sails

200
00:11:58,562 --> 00:12:00,560
will exceed capacity and
she'll dig in hard at the bow.

201
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:01,799
She'll hold.

202
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:04,167
Hard enough to shake
loose the rigging entirely.

203
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:08,708
Captain, Mr. De Groot makes a good point.

204
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:11,276
The speed we'll pick up will
come with dire risks for the ship.

205
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:16,746
But I think she can take it.

206
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:23,617
<i>Mr. De Groot, quickly, please.</i>

207
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,653
<i>- Raise the t'gallants!
- Man: Raise the t'gallants!</i>

208
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:33,465
<i>Man 2: Out of the way!</i>

209
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,602
Brace up another five degrees!

210
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,569
- Five degrees!
- Five degrees!

211
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:45,946
Bring her up into it.

212
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:51,418
(wind gusting)

213
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:54,115
(grunting)

214
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,892
More!

215
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:06,902
Brace up a little more!

216
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:08,071
More!

217
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:12,209
That's well!

218
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:14,379
<i>- That's well.
- Man 2: Hold on!</i>

219
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,853
(yells, grunts)

220
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:28,429
Now bring her up into it.

221
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,774
More, damn it. (grunts)

222
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:38,277
Like this!

223
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:41,379
(yelling)

224
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,557
Aye, Captain!

225
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:55,190
There.

226
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:56,925
Hold it there. Hold her tight.

227
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:03,233
Speed! Again, please!

228
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:05,441
Time!

229
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:09,839
Seven and a half knots!

230
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:12,976
(crew cheering)

231
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,350
All right, ladies, get some rest.

232
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:26,020
In a few hours, things are
gonna get awfully interesting.

233
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:43,168
Good morning, dear.

234
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:48,008
"Orders from Boston,

235
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:51,343
unbeknownst to me."

236
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:53,775
You sent Bryson away.

237
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:55,016
Yes.

238
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:57,785
You lied to my face, you shit.

239
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,720
And what choice did you leave me?

240
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:03,522
You let Flint seduce you

241
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:06,429
into his madness about the Spanish galleon

242
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,798
all in furtherance of the fantasy

243
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:11,103
that you can resist English rule,

244
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:15,607
that your authority in this place
is yours to do with as you please.

245
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:18,209
I am more to this place than you ever were.

246
00:15:18,281 --> 00:15:19,544
You are a child.

247
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:23,584
I'm fully aware that Captain Flint

248
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,019
left in pursuit of the
Andromache last night.

249
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,523
But you should know

250
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:30,722
Captain Bryson sailed the Velasco route

251
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:32,824
for 10 years and was never boarded.

252
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:34,328
Not once.

253
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:39,972
Flint will be returning either
empty-handed or not at all.

254
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:42,406
This treasure galleon business is over.

255
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,742
As for our future here,

256
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:47,215
I am working on a deal
that'll make a safe place

257
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,250
for us among the farmers in the interior.

258
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,188
- (scoffs)
- When the pirates are gone,

259
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:53,524
<i>the landowners will drive commerce here.</i>

260
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:56,124
<i>They'll be indispensable to
the lords and to Whitehall,</i>

261
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:58,662
<i>and so we will make allies of them.</i>

262
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:02,104
We will adapt and we will survive.

263
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:06,140
<i>I won't ask you to walk
out with me right now.</i>

264
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,204
I know your pride would never permit it.

265
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:11,846
The Barlow cunt who was
supposed to watch over you,

266
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:14,616
that's Flint's problem.

267
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:17,118
But Scott...

268
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:19,022
what the fuck did you
have to threaten him with

269
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:20,591
to get him to betray me?

270
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:26,298
We talked like men and he saw reason.

271
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,533
Fuck you.

272
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:42,883
I been sayin' it. You ain't been listening.

273
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:44,315
And now it's come to pass.

274
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,586
<i>The day that gentleman and his daughter</i>

275
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:48,586
<i>tell you that the money they took</i>

276
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:50,586
<i>ain't never coming back.</i>

277
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:52,524
<i>(crowd yelling)</i>

278
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,165
<i>Lilywhite: Yeah, that
were just fucking theft!</i>

279
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:57,996
<i>Right now, that little girl</i>

280
00:16:58,061 --> 00:17:00,131
<i>is sitting in there counting your money</i>

281
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:02,170
<i>and laughing her scrawny ass off</i>

282
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:05,172
on how much she has
lifted out of your pockets.

283
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:06,706
This is fucking nuts!

284
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:10,137
- We're not working!
- Good riddance, yeah!

285
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,409
(gasps)

286
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:19,153
I thought my men could help
keep tempers from boiling over,

287
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:20,984
for a while at least.

288
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:23,660
But for those owed money out there,

289
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:25,926
<i>it's only a matter of
time before their tempers</i>

290
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:28,065
<i>can no longer be held in check.</i>

291
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,202
Now, if I may, I suggest an
announcement of payments to settle debts.

292
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:33,707
The longer it takes them to hear it,

293
00:17:33,772 --> 00:17:35,677
the more fuel Lilywhite
can throw on the fire.

294
00:17:35,742 --> 00:17:37,348
I can't pay them all.

295
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:40,780
You're short?

296
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,853
How short?

297
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:46,085
Well, get out your books, then.

298
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:49,125
Certain crews may defer
their debts if I ask them.

299
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,892
<i>Any leads you have on future
scores would soften the blow.</i>

300
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:54,995
<i>Troublemakers we need
to pay off first...</i>

301
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,131
No.

302
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,561
I'm not winding things up here.

303
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:01,402
My business continues.

304
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:06,811
Captain Naft of the Intrepid.
Mr. Walker, her quartermaster.

305
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:09,777
Captain Lawrence of the
Black Hind and Mr. Harrison.

306
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:12,548
And our friend Mr. Frasier.
Get them all here now.

307
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:14,951
Miss Guthrie?

308
00:18:16,953 --> 00:18:19,658
I'm not sure you recognize
the gravity of this situation.

309
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:23,634
Have a drink. Relax.

310
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:25,636
Everything's under control.

311
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,710
<i>(crowd yelling)</i>

312
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,046
<i>Hamund: She's fucking done!</i>

313
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,646
That Guthrie cunt is done.

314
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:38,747
Have you not heard?

315
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:40,545
We've heard.

316
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:42,816
Well, then what the fuck
are we doing in here?

317
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:44,583
At the moment, I'm
remembering what it feels like

318
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:45,951
to have food in my belly.

319
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:48,518
- Care to join us?
- Jesus, Jack.

320
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,521
We're free of her. Free to hunt again.

321
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:54,258
So get off your ass and find us a ship.

322
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:57,065
To assume that we've seen
the last of Eleanor Guthrie

323
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,433
is, well, not to know her.

324
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:02,504
The fact that she appears to have Captain
Hornigold and his men propping her up

325
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:03,935
only adds to my conviction.

326
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,775
Right now, we'd do well
to keep our mouths shut,

327
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,208
be thankful we have some
income from this place,

328
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,438
for the moment, and bide our time.

329
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:12,774
Fuck that.

330
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:15,643
She's got no ships. She's got no business.

331
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,378
That means she's out.

332
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:21,715
And I'm going over there
to make sure she knows it.

333
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,282
Captain?

334
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:29,721
I'll be upstairs.

335
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:37,437
Well, then, fuck you both.

336
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:39,300
Who's with me?

337
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:44,399
Nothing can ever be simple.

338
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:47,500
(scoffs) I can make it simple.

339
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:51,068
Darling, this is a lovely stopgap,

340
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:53,511
but if we are to ever hunt
as a proper crew again,

341
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:56,783
we will need, well, a crew.

342
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:59,515
Right now, those men are all we have.

343
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:00,948
It's unfortunate, perhaps,

344
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:02,420
but no less a reality.

345
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:07,589
Why don't we take advantage of
Mr. Hamund's momentary distraction

346
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:09,589
and have Mrs. Mapleton tend
to the whore on the beach?

347
00:20:09,662 --> 00:20:11,293
(drops fork)

348
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:15,994
(scoffs)

349
00:20:25,103 --> 00:20:27,562
<i>- Man: Two six!
- Heave!</i>

350
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:29,298
<i>- Two six!
- Heave!</i>

351
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:31,033
<i>- Two six!
- Heave!</i>

352
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:34,441
<i>Stand by! Stand by!</i>

353
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:52,997
<i>(knock on door)</i>

354
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,001
Ahem.

355
00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:00,936
Yes, Mr. Hayes?

356
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,039
<i>Hayes: The Walrus will be
upon us in roughly four hours,</i>

357
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:04,543
<i>present speed.</i>

358
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:06,512
I assume preparations have been made.

359
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:08,216
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

360
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:10,250
And the shipment of china plate?

361
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:13,049
I beg your pardon?

362
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:16,355
We have 70 plates of Chinese
porcelain in the hold,

363
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:19,892
which I have undertaken to
deliver to Boston unharmed.

364
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,159
May I suggest more straw in the chest?

365
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,396
Yes, sir.

366
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:32,434
He's certain this is all we have?

367
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,298
We emptied the girl before we careened her.

368
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:36,499
This is the best I could
do before we set sail.

369
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:38,235
Same for food and water, I assume?

370
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:41,640
Food, water, powder, all of it.

371
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:44,073
Right. Take it all up top.

372
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:45,644
No reserves on this one.

373
00:21:45,717 --> 00:21:48,749
Either we take Bryson's ship or we're...

374
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:52,190
I believe the word you're
looking for is "fucked."

375
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:54,526
- Yeah, thank you.
- Yeah.

376
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:58,188
Dufresne?

377
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,229
You can't be serious.

378
00:22:04,332 --> 00:22:06,530
Andromache's manned like a warship.

379
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:09,339
60 men at least, and they're fighters.

380
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:11,938
So we'll need every body we can
muster on this one, yours included.

381
00:22:12,003 --> 00:22:13,504
Come on.

382
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:20,006
<i>(birds screeching)</i>

383
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,447
<i>(dogs barking)</i>

384
00:22:23,712 --> 00:22:26,319
<i>(goats bleating)</i>

385
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:33,654
Come on, everything's at sixes and sevens

386
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,390
back at the house

387
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,263
and I have to come and tend to this.

388
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,666
All right. Come on, love.

389
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:44,668
Here we go.

390
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:48,108
Open your legs.

391
00:22:49,276 --> 00:22:50,905
<i>- (water squirts)
- (Winces)</i>

392
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:53,343
Oh, hush, unless you want to find yourself

393
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:56,415
carrying one of those fools' brats.

394
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:05,491
<i>- (water squirts)
- Ow!</i>

395
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:07,225
Get out.

396
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,328
(whimpers)

397
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,239
She wasn't using enough lotion.

398
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:37,981
<i>- (water squirting softly)
- (Whimpering)</i>

399
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,952
You could've left.

400
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:44,584
<i>(water squirting softly)</i>

401
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:47,760
When that cunt beat Hamund
off of you, you could've left.

402
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:49,560
You didn't.

403
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,998
Thought you could
sweet-talk them all, did ya?

404
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,832
What do you care?

405
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:59,070
Once, one of them came and put his balls

406
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:01,806
on my shoulder whilst I was asleep.

407
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:04,269
Thought it was funny.

408
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,838
Last time he put them anywhere.

409
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:16,809
If you take it, they'll give it.

410
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:20,758
Why do you say these things?

411
00:24:22,455 --> 00:24:25,526
You were the one who threw
me to them in the first place.

412
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:29,997
I only thought they'd kill you.

413
00:24:38,804 --> 00:24:42,108
<i>Lilywhite: Do you feel that
soreness between your haunches?</i>

414
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:43,844
Yeah, well, that's what you get

415
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:46,473
when you let some cunt
who's never raised a sail,

416
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:49,145
set foot on a deck tell you your business!

417
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,410
<i>(crowd shouting)</i>

418
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:51,946
<i>Next thing you know,</i>

419
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:53,480
<i>she'll have her boot on your throat</i>

420
00:24:53,552 --> 00:24:55,752
<i>and her hand in your fucking pocket.</i>

421
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:58,058
I think he's talking about you.

422
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:00,658
<i>Lilywhite: That's what you get when
you're letting a wench tell you...</i>

423
00:25:00,723 --> 00:25:02,690
If you're pretending to remain unconcerned

424
00:25:02,763 --> 00:25:05,028
for my peace of mind, please don't.

425
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:07,237
It amuses me that you think
I would even give a shit

426
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:09,933
<i>- about your peace of mind.
- Silver: Of course.</i>

427
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:13,508
Still, I don't think you're giving that
problem out there its due attention.

428
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:14,772
<i>(door opens)</i>

429
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:16,972
Naft and Walker just
arrived. That's everyone.

430
00:25:21,413 --> 00:25:23,917
You've never seen a mob turn, have you?

431
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,591
<i>Funny thing.</i>

432
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:28,024
The people most surprised when it happens,

433
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:30,463
usually the ones that gave
rise to it in the first place.

434
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:35,627
Can you join me, please, Captain?
I want you to hear this, too.

435
00:25:35,692 --> 00:25:37,627
<i>Hamund: Is the cunt still here?</i>

436
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,965
- Out on the street, friend.
- Where is she?

437
00:25:45,872 --> 00:25:48,006
It's a rough world out there, isn't it?

438
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:53,876
Someone opens their mouth,

439
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:55,611
you can lose everything.

440
00:25:58,986 --> 00:26:01,585
Tell me, lass...

441
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:03,154
how's it feel?

442
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:07,026
Out now.

443
00:26:08,962 --> 00:26:11,024
Well, if we're not welcome in here,

444
00:26:11,097 --> 00:26:13,191
I suppose we can go spend more time

445
00:26:13,263 --> 00:26:15,197
with our friend on the beach.

446
00:26:15,262 --> 00:26:16,735
<i>(pirate chuckles)</i>

447
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,305
Oh, wonderful lass she is.

448
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:23,337
So, um...

449
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:24,872
resilient.

450
00:26:24,944 --> 00:26:27,312
<i>(pirates laugh)</i>

451
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,683
So appreciative of what she's given.

452
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,254
We'll send her your love.

453
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,095
(laughs)

454
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,129
<i>- Come on, boys.
- (Pirate laughs)</i>

455
00:26:51,036 --> 00:26:52,877
(speaks African dialect)

456
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,074
<i>Billy: Gentlemen...</i>

457
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,680
I think we all know what
we're up against today,

458
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:02,281
so let's just get to it.

459
00:27:03,614 --> 00:27:06,611
As we close the distance to the Andromache,

460
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:10,883
the captain believes
Bryson will attack port

461
00:27:10,948 --> 00:27:13,755
and set himself for a
clean broadside volley.

462
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,218
He'll loose his guns, pay off downwind,

463
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,387
and continue running.

464
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:18,922
Now, ordinarily,

465
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:21,194
we would either match him and return fire

466
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:24,431
or slip into his wake and
make a run at his stern.

467
00:27:24,504 --> 00:27:27,134
<i>Unfortunately, we're too
outgunned for the former,</i>

468
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:29,405
and Bryson is too skilled
a captain for the latter.

469
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,973
<i>He'll just keep shooting and delaying</i>

470
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:32,709
and shooting and delaying until nightfall,

471
00:27:32,774 --> 00:27:34,677
at which point he'll just slip away.

472
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:35,845
So...

473
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,411
So, if we can't shoot at her

474
00:27:38,476 --> 00:27:39,945
and we can't get close to her,

475
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,376
how the hell do we board her?

476
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:44,746
(murmuring)

477
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:47,785
We go straight at her.

478
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,248
Without the bow chasers, we'll
be sitting ducks for her guns.

479
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:51,950
She'll rake us bow to stern.

480
00:27:52,023 --> 00:27:54,719
<i>Logan: Not to mention we'd
be boarding bow to midship.</i>

481
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:56,391
For all you virgins in the room,

482
00:27:56,456 --> 00:27:58,359
that's also known as fucking suicide.

483
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:01,232
<i>Billy: Of course we'd need
to board alongside her.</i>

484
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:04,494
We just need Captain Bryson to cooperate

485
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:07,673
and bring the Andromache
about for us to do so.

486
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:10,539
And how the hell do we get him to do that?

487
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:13,674
Mr. Beauclerc is going to convince him.

488
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:19,876
(blows)

489
00:28:32,265 --> 00:28:33,928
You're a natural, son.

490
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:36,232
When this is all over, I'll
be lucky to still have a job.

491
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,599
(laughs)

492
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:41,595
- What...
- I keep accounts.

493
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:43,233
That's what I'm good at.

494
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:46,663
Do you see this number here?

495
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:49,561
That's how much I've saved
this crew this last year alone.

496
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:51,329
Can you say of any other man here

497
00:28:51,402 --> 00:28:52,937
that they've earned as much?

498
00:28:53,002 --> 00:28:55,903
Every man on this crew had a first time.

499
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,301
You're overdue.

500
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:59,172
But I've never even shot a pistol.

501
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,102
Well, that's all right.

502
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:03,706
Half the time they don't even fire.

503
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:11,405
I'm sorry.

504
00:29:14,943 --> 00:29:18,350
Time has come for us to tell those who aim

505
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:20,687
<i>- to make us slaves.
- (Knock on door)</i>

506
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:23,191
<i>Woman: Mr. Rackham asked me to tend to you.</i>

507
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:27,023
<i>Lilywhite: Yeah, well, that's what you get.</i>

508
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:33,800
He said I wasn't to take no for an answer.

509
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:42,573
They're saying she may be finished.

510
00:29:42,638 --> 00:29:44,005
She's finally got her due.

511
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:49,783
All I meant is that...

512
00:29:49,848 --> 00:29:53,288
that it should please
you after what she did.

513
00:29:53,353 --> 00:29:57,859
You hate her. I hate her.

514
00:29:57,924 --> 00:29:59,659
They all hate her.

515
00:30:01,363 --> 00:30:03,697
Look what's good it's done us.

516
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,506
No captain on this island's
ever known that kind of power.

517
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:13,043
Power that doesn't care how
many votes you can tally,

518
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:15,979
who loves you, who hates you,

519
00:30:16,044 --> 00:30:18,979
who fears you.

520
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:21,253
Power that just is.

521
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:23,419
Truth is,

522
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:26,787
none of us have any
right to hate her for it.

523
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:31,962
She's strong and we're weak.

524
00:30:32,027 --> 00:30:33,963
That's the reality of things here.

525
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:41,541
And no one down there is strong
enough to change anything.

526
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,406
<i>Not you?</i>

527
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:53,750
You're not strong enough?

528
00:30:53,823 --> 00:30:55,593
I don't know.

529
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:59,256
But I think it's time I probably found out.

530
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:03,229
(creaking)

531
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:20,805
What if he's wrong?

532
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,472
There's a chance Bryson just
keeps running, isn't there?

533
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:27,641
- That's it, steady.
- Right?

534
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:31,240
<i>Bryson could still gain speed.</i>

535
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:32,543
I mean, there has to be a chance

536
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,543
this fight will never materialize.

537
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:36,449
Come on.

538
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:39,018
Come on, you bitch.

539
00:31:39,091 --> 00:31:40,986
Come on.

540
00:31:49,494 --> 00:31:51,597
There she goes!

541
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:56,298
(crew shouting)

542
00:31:57,363 --> 00:31:59,328
Why isn't he attacking?

543
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,802
Because he knows he'll
never board us if he does.

544
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,606
I will say this for him. He's no coward.

545
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:09,416
200 yards, you may fire at will.

546
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:17,122
(shouting)

547
00:32:22,498 --> 00:32:24,496
I don't think I can do this.

548
00:32:24,561 --> 00:32:25,863
Yes, you can.

549
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:30,733
Listen. Listen to me.

550
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:32,806
You will make it through this.

551
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:35,608
No one eats it their
first time over the side.

552
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:37,746
I'm telling you, it's never
happened. Not on this crew.

553
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:39,884
Don't ask me why, it just is.

554
00:32:39,949 --> 00:32:41,717
Men die all the time. It can't be true.

555
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,085
No, not first-timers.

556
00:32:44,158 --> 00:32:46,021
Name one.

557
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,724
You're gonna be all right.

558
00:32:51,564 --> 00:32:52,996
Come on.

559
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:54,629
Damn it.

560
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,139
I hope you know what you're doing.

561
00:33:01,204 --> 00:33:02,834
So do I.

562
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:09,516
Mr. Beauclerc? Range?

563
00:33:11,316 --> 00:33:12,978
Almost there!

564
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:14,787
50 more yards, Captain!

565
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,788
Fire!

566
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:26,554
- Let her go.
- Fire!

567
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,756
- Incoming!
- (Men scream)

568
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:31,060
Fire!

569
00:33:32,564 --> 00:33:34,763

570
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:36,196

(yelling)

572
00:33:38,037 --> 00:33:40,173
Get 'em back into the cookroom!

573
00:33:40,238 --> 00:33:42,512
<i>- Get 'em back!
- (Yelling)</i>

574
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:44,746
We can't take much more of this.

575
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:47,586
Aye. Mr. Beauclerc!

576
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:56,560
- Two six!
- Heave!

577
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,928
- Two six!
- Heave!

578
00:33:57,993 --> 00:34:00,128
Hayes, another volley right away!

579
00:34:00,193 --> 00:34:01,896
Right cannon round!

580
00:34:01,961 --> 00:34:04,632
Mr. Burnett, prepare to bear
away and bring us into the wind.

581
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:08,303
Man the braces!

582
00:34:08,368 --> 00:34:10,102
Fire!

583
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:12,774
<i>(man screams)</i>

584
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:19,676
- (yells)
- Beauclerc, do it!

585
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:31,084
Stay where you are!

586
00:34:31,157 --> 00:34:33,551
Bring us to starboard
before we lose the wind!

587
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:45,362
- Mr. Harris, take the helm!
- Aye, sir!

588
00:34:50,528 --> 00:34:51,662
Fire.

589
00:35:04,713 --> 00:35:06,375
<i>Man: We've lost the wind, Captain.</i>

590
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:13,383
Prepare to repel boarders!

591
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:19,391
Bring us around to the port side!

592
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:21,655
On the rails!

593
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,160
(shouting)

594
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:02,251
<i>- (guns firing)
- (Gasping)</i>

595
00:36:18,665 --> 00:36:20,263
Now!

596
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:24,209
20 yards! At the ready.

597
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:27,717
Get across the gap, choose your targets!

598
00:36:27,782 --> 00:36:30,084
<i>Pistols at zero range.</i>

599
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:32,717
Don't waste a shot.

600
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,920
Nets in!

601
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:37,958
(crew shouting)

602
00:36:38,023 --> 00:36:39,958
Nets up, nets up, nets up!

603
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,766
<i>Get it!</i>

604
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:46,534
10 yards! Go, go, go!

605
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:48,205
Over! Get it over!

606
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,731
Hold, get down! Hold, hold!

607
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:52,768
<i>- (gunfire continues)
- Hold!</i>

608
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,310
(all grunt)

609
00:37:05,578 --> 00:37:07,307
(exhales)

610
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,982
Go, go, go!

611
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:12,288
(all shouting)

612
00:37:40,102 --> 00:37:42,775

617
00:38:01,788 --> 00:38:04,362

<i>(buzzing)</i>

Dufresne?

620
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,205
Jesus.

621
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,646
Come on.

622
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:10,879
(cheering)

623
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:12,487
No fucking longer!

624
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:19,594
Gentlemen, you all heard
my father this morning,

625
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:22,627
that the Guthrie trading
operation here in Nassau is dead.

626
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,927
<i>To that, I just
have this to add...</i>

627
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,400
fuck him and fuck that.

628
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:33,839
Mr. Frasier, you hold a charter from the
Massachusetts Bay Provincial Authority

629
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,145
to ship rare items abroad, is that correct?

630
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,412
That's correct, yes.

631
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:40,850
And, theoretically, that
charter should pass muster

632
00:39:40,915 --> 00:39:42,983
at any customshouse in the colonies, yes?

633
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:46,684
Well, I suppose so, but...

634
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,885
Gentlemen, by my count,

635
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,790
the Black Hind and the Intrepid

636
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:54,463
have accumulated prizes
totaling approximately

637
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:57,801
1,600 pieces of eight since the new year.

638
00:39:57,866 --> 00:40:01,704
That's gross. That's both ships.

639
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,874
That barely exceeds your
operating costs over the same time.

640
00:40:03,939 --> 00:40:05,539
If you brought us
here to insult us...

641
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,578
It's not an insult, it's a fact.

642
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:10,408
You command the two least
profitable ships on the island

643
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:12,175
as a function of basic arithmetic.

644
00:40:13,816 --> 00:40:16,748
But they are ships, and large ones at that.

645
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:19,812
At this table, we have a legitimate front.

646
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:23,354
We have ships and crews
that can ferry heavy cargo.

647
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:26,120
We have relationships with
the merchants and customs men

648
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:27,888
that kept my father's trade moving.

649
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:29,720
Your father said he'll take
no part in any further...

650
00:40:29,785 --> 00:40:31,919
They're my relationships now.

651
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,524
We're going to recreate
my father's system here...

652
00:40:38,598 --> 00:40:41,196
without my father.

653
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:44,197
A consortium, with all of
you sharing in the profits.

654
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,510
- You're mad.
- How so?

655
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:52,777
My men aren't merchant sailors.

656
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:53,978
They're hunters.

657
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,753
Yes, but they're bad at it, Geoffrey.

658
00:40:56,818 --> 00:40:58,082
What good is that doing anyone?

659
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,891
I put this to them, they'll vote me out

660
00:40:59,956 --> 00:41:01,292
before I stop to take a breath.

661
00:41:01,357 --> 00:41:03,230
I'm amazed they haven't
voted you out already,

662
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,797
given the shit prizes you've been chasing.

663
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:08,500
Your men will earn three times
as much in half the time...

664
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:12,236
- (scoffs)
- Not facing a single sword or pistol in the process.

665
00:41:12,301 --> 00:41:14,005
You're telling me that you can't sell that?

666
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,971
I can sell that.

667
00:41:19,142 --> 00:41:20,941
(sighs)

668
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:23,844
And you're supporting this?

669
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,990
I don't know. Am I?

670
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:31,359
None of this matters

671
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:33,695
unless we can get people
to agree to sell through us.

672
00:41:33,761 --> 00:41:37,236
We need a respected captain
to stand up and bless it.

673
00:41:37,301 --> 00:41:41,030
And we need a strong captain to
ensure that no one dares fuck with us.

674
00:41:41,103 --> 00:41:42,501
You're both.

675
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:46,374
You know that I want nothing more

676
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,480
than to make this place strong and stable.

677
00:41:49,545 --> 00:41:53,048
I think you want the same things.

678
00:41:53,113 --> 00:41:55,482
Bless this endeavor and we can have them.

679
00:41:57,293 --> 00:41:58,452
I'll do that...

680
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:02,694
the moment you lift
the ban on Captain Vane.

681
00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:06,632
- Excuse me?
- Listen to that mob outside.

682
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:09,072
They're tired of your
edicts, your rule by fear.

683
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:12,145
They believe you to be
a tyrant in a petticoat.

684
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,713
Your action against Captain Vane
is, to them, the most egregious case.

685
00:42:15,778 --> 00:42:16,914
You want me to lift the ban on Charles Vane

686
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,884
to appease a handful of
malcontents on the street?

687
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:21,221
Those malcontents will be a
problem to anyone in this room

688
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:23,221
who stands behind you today.

689
00:42:23,294 --> 00:42:25,631
<i>Provocation, even sabotage.</i>

690
00:42:25,696 --> 00:42:27,767
And then you'll ask my men to assume

691
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:30,066
the responsibility of
defending all of you from it.

692
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:32,675
Charles Vane is an animal, as
are the men that remain with him.

693
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,611
Because they saw fit to
punish a thieving whore.

694
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,907
I'm not about to say otherwise for
the benefit of Captain Lilywhite

695
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,778
or any of the other idiots
out there listening to him.

696
00:42:38,843 --> 00:42:40,747
I'm listening to him.

697
00:42:43,988 --> 00:42:46,587
Your commitment to this place is admirable,

698
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:49,957
but you're young and you're rash.

699
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,526
<i>Show everyone your motive
here is for the common good.</i>

700
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,767
Show them that you can be trusted

701
00:42:54,832 --> 00:42:58,042
to keep petty animosity
separate from business.

702
00:42:58,107 --> 00:43:01,977
Rescind the ban on Captain
Vane and show me that.

703
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:04,776
Do it and I'll back you as
your father's successor here,

704
00:43:04,842 --> 00:43:07,218
the boss behind all trade.

705
00:43:07,283 --> 00:43:10,282
<i>Until then, I'm sorry. I can't help you.</i>

706
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:12,650
I won't do it.

707
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:16,796
You have until dark to come to your senses.

708
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:19,491
At that point, I will withdraw my men

709
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:22,734
<i>and the business of the street
becomes your business alone.</i>

710
00:43:24,272 --> 00:43:26,871
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

711
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,511
Ah!

712
00:43:43,919 --> 00:43:45,489

00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,619
<i>Man: Take this.</i>

715
00:44:16,684 --> 00:44:18,283
Checked all the dead and injured.

716
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,359
None of them are Bryson.

717
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:23,066
He only left three men to
defend the quarterdeck bunker.

718
00:44:23,131 --> 00:44:25,097
How does that make sense?

719
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,234
<i>Gates: The vanguard are on their
way to clear the cargo hold.</i>

720
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:31,304
<i>Maybe Bryson is hiding down there.</i>

721
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:33,104
Something's not right.

722
00:44:33,177 --> 00:44:36,080
Captain, the rudder's not responding.

723
00:44:36,145 --> 00:44:38,741
Someone must've cut the
mechanism below decks.

724
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:42,845
Call back the vanguard.

725
00:44:47,749 --> 00:44:49,820
- (gunfire)
- (All yell)

726
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:55,665
<i>- (labored breathing)
- (Metal squeaking)</i>

727
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,342
Three men dead on their end, Captain.

728
00:45:11,415 --> 00:45:14,818
<i>Perhaps it's time we sent them our terms.</i>

729
00:45:58,785 --> 00:46:00,919
I do apologize for this.

730
00:46:02,624 --> 00:46:06,393
<i>Mr. Guthrie's orders were explicit.</i>

731
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:10,297
No matter what, I was to make
sure that you were on this ship.

732
00:46:10,363 --> 00:46:12,401
This was not the deal.

733
00:46:12,466 --> 00:46:14,537
(chuckles)

734
00:46:14,602 --> 00:46:18,167
Assist the Andromache to depart unmolested

735
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,743
<i>and you can remain with the girl</i>

736
00:46:19,808 --> 00:46:22,407
<i>and pick up the pieces
and explain yourself.</i>

737
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,878
<i>Mr. Scott, you sided with
his daughter against him.</i>

738
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,182
You forgot your duty.

739
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:32,581
You must have known there
would be consequences.

740
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:38,732
But we men of duty must often
put our feelings aside...

741
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:41,899
as you're about to witness.

742
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:47,278
(speaks West African Pidgin English)

743
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:58,250
Do it.

744
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,249
(groans)

745
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:08,863

<i>(crowd chanting)</i>

748
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:40,333
At the risk of overstepping my bounds,

749
00:47:40,405 --> 00:47:43,006
<i>I think you should agree to
Captain Hornigold's terms.</i>

750
00:47:45,106 --> 00:47:48,367
Lift the ban. What
do you care about...

751
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,040
They're beating her.

752
00:47:51,474 --> 00:47:52,810
She chose it.

753
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:56,419
(scoffs) "She chose it"?

754
00:47:56,484 --> 00:47:59,756
"She chose it."

755
00:47:59,821 --> 00:48:01,695
I've been repeating those words to myself

756
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,265
for well over a week now
and I find them wanting.

757
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:08,370
Now he asks me to back off Charles,

758
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:11,540
to proclaim to the world that
what happened to Max is acceptable,

759
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:14,674
to apologize to those animals
for having ever said otherwise,

760
00:48:14,739 --> 00:48:16,744
and smile while they lord it over me.

761
00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:20,508
To make a dangerous situation
a lot less dangerous.

762
00:48:22,707 --> 00:48:24,841
Then convince me.

763
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,847
Convince me that I should
betray her a second time...

764
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:34,448
because that's what it
feels like I would be doing.

765
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:39,523
Max chose.

766
00:48:39,596 --> 00:48:43,131
Why? I don't know.

767
00:48:43,196 --> 00:48:47,375
Maybe it was spite, maybe it was strength,

768
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,910
maybe it was who the fuck knows what.

769
00:48:49,975 --> 00:48:52,403
To be perfectly honest, I don't care

770
00:48:52,476 --> 00:48:54,410
because the moment I start making choices

771
00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:56,275
based on her decisions,

772
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,843
I've given her a hell of a
lot more power over my life

773
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:01,651
than I am quite comfortable
ceding to a perfect stranger.

774
00:49:04,785 --> 00:49:06,881
Guilt is natural.

775
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:12,424
It also goes away if you let it.

776
00:49:13,722 --> 00:49:16,761
<i>Losing your life's work...</i>

777
00:49:16,826 --> 00:49:19,295
<i>that doesn't go away.</i>

779
00:49:24,635 --> 00:49:26,641
Captain?

780
00:49:26,706 --> 00:49:29,304
Charles?

781
00:49:29,377 --> 00:49:33,807
Do I understand correctly
that you've requested a skiff?

782
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,983
I suppose that's none of my business,

783
00:49:36,048 --> 00:49:40,152
but you do realize that we
may be able to hunt again soon.

784
00:49:40,217 --> 00:49:42,553
What I'm hearing is all
second and thirdhand,

785
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:46,291
but something is happening in that tavern.

786
00:49:47,365 --> 00:49:49,765
Our problem isn't in there.

787
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,534
Never was.

788
00:49:55,744 --> 00:49:57,976
What the hell are you talking about?

789
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:00,145
Chaz?

790
00:50:05,486 --> 00:50:07,451
Where are you going?

791
00:50:12,587 --> 00:50:14,018
Where is he?

792
00:50:14,091 --> 00:50:15,586
<i>Gates: He's in a reinforced hold</i>

793
00:50:15,658 --> 00:50:17,089
<i>directly beneath us here.</i>

794
00:50:17,154 --> 00:50:19,024
<i>Forward end of the lower gundeck.</i>

795
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:22,728
Doors as thick as the
outer hull, as is the roof.

796
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:24,729
Impossible to breach from here.

797
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:27,695
<i>He's also sitting right in
front of a powder magazine,</i>

798
00:50:27,768 --> 00:50:29,767
<i>so if we try to blow our way through,</i>

799
00:50:29,832 --> 00:50:32,271
<i>this whole ship is going down fast.</i>

800
00:50:32,336 --> 00:50:33,838
Unless we can find a way in,

801
00:50:33,903 --> 00:50:35,940
there's no way to get
the guns off the boat.

802
00:50:36,005 --> 00:50:39,075
<i>Anybody we send down there is
just gonna get cut to shreds.</i>

803
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,178
And we cannot sail.

804
00:50:42,243 --> 00:50:43,776
And we cannot sail.

805
00:50:45,473 --> 00:50:47,079
It doesn't make sense.

806
00:50:49,784 --> 00:50:51,752
If Bryson wants to force us to withdraw,

807
00:50:51,817 --> 00:50:54,719
what's to stop me from
burning the ship once we leave?

808
00:50:57,858 --> 00:50:59,993
We're missing something.

There you are.

00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:19,086
Been looking all over for you.

812
00:51:19,151 --> 00:51:21,750
Thought I'd get a head start
going through Bryson's papers.

813
00:51:25,729 --> 00:51:27,961
Jameson.

814
00:51:28,026 --> 00:51:30,631
Beg your pardon?

815
00:51:30,696 --> 00:51:33,895
You said no man ever died
his first time over the side,

816
00:51:33,968 --> 00:51:36,770
but you forgot about Tom Jameson,

817
00:51:36,835 --> 00:51:39,809
boatswain's mate, about two years back.

818
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,642
That's right.

819
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:46,181
Also Christian Thoms,
Will Robbins, Jean DuBois,

820
00:51:46,254 --> 00:51:48,250
that Portuguese
guy with the lisp...

821
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:50,847

00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,087
- That is funny.

823
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,627
Thank you...

824
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:57,121
for doing that.

825
00:51:59,558 --> 00:52:00,819
It helped.
