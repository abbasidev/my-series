1
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:15,145
<i>Morley: I'm not wrong about Flint.</i>

2
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:17,847
<i>- To him we're all disposable.
- I don't believe that.</i>

3
00:00:17,898 --> 00:00:21,234
That's because you don't
know about Mrs. Barlow.

4
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:22,535
You found the schedule.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,871
What if I forgo payment for the schedule

6
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:26,906
in exchange for my share of the prize?

7
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:28,325
We'll need some additional items.

8
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,744
<i>- New guns... 12-pounders.
- You'll have it.</i>

9
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:32,212
Without the Urca we have nothing.

10
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:34,364
Without Vane we don't have the Urca.

11
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:37,217
Our friend tried to protect
you. You left anyway.

12
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:40,870
- Why?
- How did you feel when she threw you aside?

13
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:43,056
<i>- (Max screaming)
- Eleanor, wait.</i>

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,208
(grunting)

15
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:47,727
<i>Eleanor: Listen to me
carefully. You are finished.</i>

16
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:50,597
Unless you decide to join
the crew of Captain Flint.

17
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:52,048
Looks like she just gave us a ship.

18
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:54,184
Ship with no captain.

19
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:56,486
- So sorry he did this to you.
- He didn't do this to me.

20
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:58,021
You did.

21
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:03,159
<i>(theme music playing)</i>

22
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:40,647
<i>(bell rings)</i>

23
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:52,575
Captain Gates.

24
00:02:54,778 --> 00:02:56,663
(knocks)

25
00:02:57,998 --> 00:03:00,166
It's time.

26
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:09,959
(crew murmuring)

27
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,189
First item for the council
concerns leadership.

28
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:25,892
As you know, I've been
asked to serve as captain

29
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:28,645
of the Ranger when next we sail.

30
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:31,013
Obviously that means less
time spent with you idiots.

31
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,682
- (crew laughs)
- So...

32
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:36,352
you will need somebody to act as
your quartermaster in the meantime.

33
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:39,855
Unless anybody's got any better ideas,

34
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:42,024
I was thinking Billy Bones.

35
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:43,993
(cheering)

36
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:49,382
I thought so.

37
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:51,167
Billy.

38
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:55,088
<i>Billy: Ahem.</i>

39
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:58,541
Next item... careening.

40
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,760
<i>- (grumbling)
- Man: Bad start, Billy.</i>

41
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:03,479
She's long overdue. If
we're gonna win the Urca,

42
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,348
the Walrus must be shipshape.
That means we tip her.

43
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,517
Plain and simple. The question is,

44
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:09,235
where do we do the tipping?

45
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,321
- Wherever there's plenty of rum.
- (Laughing)

46
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,190
As always, the ship's account is open.

47
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:17,577
Rum casks and Mr. Simpson's
buttered oranges are on their way.

48
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:20,113
And the pigs are being
readied for Mr. Silver's spit.

49
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:23,733
Now, to return to the issue of location.

50
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:25,168
What about the fuck tent?

51
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:27,870
That's probably something we can discuss.

52
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:31,124
(crew chanting) Fuck tent! Fuck tent!

53
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:33,793
Mr. De Groot.

54
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,748
You may not like what I have to say,

55
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:41,718
<i>but if it remains unsaid, I fear the worst.</i>

56
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,919
<i>I've inspected the shoreline
proposed by the captain</i>

57
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:46,472
for this undertaking and
it is simply unsuitable

58
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:48,941
to the task at hand. The anchorage is poor.

59
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:50,926
<i>The incline too steep.</i>

60
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:53,596
I cannot endorse it. The
risk for calamity is too high.

61
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:56,616
<i>With the crew's assent,</i>

62
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,269
I ask for time to find
a more suitable beach.

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,704
<i>Flint: And delay our efforts by how long?</i>

64
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:04,824
Two weeks? A month?

65
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:09,879
A clean hull

66
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:13,132
means an extra knot or two in speed,

67
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:16,118
five degrees or more in coming about.

68
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,888
It's essential to the job at hand.

69
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,426
If we had weeks, we'd surely take them.

70
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:25,961
But we must sail within days

71
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:27,963
<i>if we are to meet the Urca.</i>

72
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:30,433
Now, Mr. De Groot's concerns are valid...

73
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:34,520
<i>but they come at a price.</i>

74
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:38,991
$5 million in Spanish gold, to be exact.

75
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:42,278
(crew murmuring)

76
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:51,654
All those in favor of the captain's plan

77
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:52,922
to careen here near the bay?

78
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:55,508
All: Aye!

79
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:57,510
It would appear the ayes have it.

80
00:05:57,594 --> 00:05:59,128
Nay.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,353
Mr. Morley's dissent is noted
along with Mr. De Groot's.

82
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:11,891
All right, let's beach this bitch.

83
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:15,645
Yeah, quick question, then. Where
are we on the issue of the fuck tent?

84
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:18,948
- Crew: Yeah!
- This job is gonna happen fast.

85
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:22,451
That means more risk, more danger.

86
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,203
Now you've put a great deal of trust in me

87
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:26,489
to serve in Mr. Gates' absence,
and I take that seriously.

88
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,076
So given the potential
for distraction and delay

89
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,878
at a time that we need to be at our best,

90
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:34,664
perhaps we can all agree to forgo,

91
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:38,251
just this once, a fuck tent.

92
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,341
<i>(thumping)</i>

93
00:07:01,224 --> 00:07:03,326
(flies buzzing)

94
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:05,444
You shouldn't have.

95
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:14,537
(men shouting)

96
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:23,296
Stale winds, still waters.

97
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,015
Don't be such an old lady.

98
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:27,433
The men will rise to it.

99
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:30,085
What say you, Mr. Quartermaster?

100
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:32,254
You think it's a good idea?

101
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:34,473
Yeah, I think the captain
knows what he's doing.

102
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:39,278
<i>(bell rings)</i>

103
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:42,899
That's because you don't
know about Mrs. Barlow.

104
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:46,319
Who's Mrs. Barlow?

105
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:51,774
Number of years back,

106
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:54,744
before you crewed up with us,

107
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:58,247
Flint had us hunting a merchant ship,

108
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:00,616
the Maria Aleyne.

109
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,284
Sephardic trade...

110
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:05,721
gold, pearls, jewels.

111
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:09,425
"More than we'd ever know
what to do with," he said.

112
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:12,178
But that's Flint's gift, isn't it?

113
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:16,515
Always knows just what
to say to push us harder,

114
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,319
further, make us all pull
together for the cause.

115
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:22,905
We tracked that bitch for months

116
00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:25,441
without refitting or careening,

117
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:28,194
till finally we spotted her.

118
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:31,163
We lost good men taking her

119
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:34,867
for a haul nowhere near
what Flint had promised.

120
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:38,320
While I was exploring the hold,

121
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:41,624
I chanced upon a cabin
and that's when I heard it.

122
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:45,878
'Twas a man and a woman
begging for their lives.

123
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,716
"Spare us, and our fortune's yours."

124
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:54,854
For a moment, I thought all our shares

125
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:57,189
were gonna be worth a whole lot more.

126
00:08:57,274 --> 00:09:01,027
But that's when the screams began.

127
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:07,483
And when I watched the murderer leave,

128
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:10,119
I saw him plain.

129
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,624
Did you tell anyone?

130
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:17,660
Gates.

131
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:22,798
He was unmoved, to say the least.

132
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:27,169
"Just one rich bastard
less in the world," he said.

133
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,222
At the time, I'll admit, I took his point.

134
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:34,593
But days later we come ashore.

135
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:38,097
I see a lady waiting for Flint.

136
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:42,151
The rest of the crew thought she's
just some fancy bit of Puritan tail.

137
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:44,570
But when Flint reaches her,

138
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:48,190
<i>two words escape his lips.</i>

139
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:49,942
<i>"They're dead."</i>

140
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:52,578
Hunting the Maria Aleyne

141
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:55,164
was never about money.

142
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:57,033
It was an execution.

143
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:59,618
<i>All those men we lost taking her,</i>

144
00:09:59,703 --> 00:10:02,571
they died so Flint could settle

145
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:06,408
<i>some personal vendetta for her.</i>

146
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,295
You watch.

147
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:13,099
Good men will die for some hidden agenda.

148
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:15,351
The Barlow woman's agenda.

149
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:17,103
Mark my words, Billy.

150
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:21,440
It's all happening again.

151
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:28,464
<i>(thumping)</i>

152
00:10:37,624 --> 00:10:39,625
(moaning)

153
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:42,545
<i>(thumping, moaning continues)</i>

154
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:48,417
(gasps)

155
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:01,814
(sighs)

156
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:18,364
<i>Miranda: Will you be staying long?</i>

157
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,784
I have to get back.

158
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:29,291
If you're upset with me,
I'd appreciate you saying so.

159
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:33,796
You know why I'm upset.

160
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:36,665
Because I read to him?

161
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:38,834
There's a whole shelf full of books.

162
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:41,336
Why'd you have to read him that one?

163
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:44,473
Perhaps because I am no longer willing

164
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:47,693
to bury it on a shelf and
pretend it has no meaning for me.

165
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:56,702
That book is something
I shared with Thomas.

166
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:03,242
<i>I just missed it.</i>

167
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:07,196
Our life then

168
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:09,832
when he was alive.

169
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:14,003
I can feel myself forgetting it

170
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:15,421
and I don't want to forget it.

171
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:21,727
This place, this life that
we've been living here,

172
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:25,014
it doesn't feel like living anymore.

173
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:30,853
I can't be alone in feeling this way.

174
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:35,824
Some part of you must feel it, too.

175
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,093
Things will get better here.

176
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:58,264
I promise you they will.

177
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,144
Here you go.

178
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,538
Christ.

179
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:25,824
<i>One week without a ship and
you go completely to hell.</i>

180
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:28,127
Is it too much to ask
that you not pick a fight

181
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:30,713
over every insult thrown our way?

182
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,465
<i>Especially when I'm out there
swallowing what little pride I have left</i>

183
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,251
trying to set things right.

184
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:40,055
I see we've graduated to opium.

185
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:48,480
Miss Guthrie has dealt us quite a blow.

186
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:51,016
But we still have assets.

187
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:54,320
<i>Eight loyal men, my wits,</i>

188
00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:56,805
<i>and an unshakable captain.</i>

189
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:58,440
(sniffs)

190
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:00,776
I'm doing what I can to
regain us our livelihood,

191
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:03,279
but once that's done,
this crew, such as it is,

192
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,948
will need its captain back.

193
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:07,866
See what you can do about finding him.

194
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:16,709
Fuck you, Jack.

195
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:48,957
It was an isolated incident.

196
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:51,627
No cause for concern.

197
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:54,863
Your girl humiliated one of
this island's strongest earners,

198
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:56,665
threatened his crew with embargoes

199
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:59,385
so they had no choice
but to toss him aside.

200
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:01,053
I've had three other captains approach me

201
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:02,805
all asking the same question...

202
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:04,973
who's next to lose their livelihood

203
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,975
<i>because they crossed her on the wrong day?</i>

204
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:08,560
No one is next.

205
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:12,931
Every morning for months now
when I walk the beach into town,

206
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:16,068
I see Captain Lilywhite
standing on his stoop

207
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:18,053
and jabbering away to
anyone who will listen

208
00:15:18,104 --> 00:15:20,773
<i>about the evils of a centralized fence.</i>

209
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:23,192
Arguing that this island will never be free

210
00:15:23,243 --> 00:15:26,695
until we all come together to
cast off the tyrannical yoke

211
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:29,448
of Queen Eleanor.

212
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:31,617
I see him out there, too.

213
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:34,903
And I have never seen
any more than three men

214
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:36,571
paying him any attention.

215
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:37,790
Half-wits, all of them.

216
00:15:37,874 --> 00:15:39,792
There were 12 of them this morning.

217
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:44,179
This business with Vane has changed things.

218
00:15:45,298 --> 00:15:47,883
Get control of her, Mr. Scott,

219
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:49,518
before it's too late.

220
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:55,774
Sail spotted. The Andromache.

221
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:01,864
<i>(door closes)</i>

222
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,651
Captain Bryson is
arriving on the Andromache.

223
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:07,102
<i>You'd best get down to the beach.</i>

224
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:08,620
What did Captain Hornigold want?

225
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:14,576
Let me guess.

226
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:16,161
The captains grousing about last week

227
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:17,496
think I've lost my grip on reason.

228
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,882
<i>Fuck Hornigold.</i>

229
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:21,633
Fuck the captains and fuck anyone else

230
00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:23,719
who doesn't like the
way I manage this place.

231
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:33,178
What we're about to
attempt with Captain Bryson,

232
00:16:33,263 --> 00:16:35,481
it is very risky.

233
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,349
If he will not cooperate,

234
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:39,435
we cannot, under any circumstances,

235
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:41,487
attempt to detain him.

236
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:43,188
- What makes you think I'd try?
- 'Cause I know you.

237
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:45,073
I know what you think is at stake.

238
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:47,693
And I know you think you
cannot take no for an answer.

239
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:49,528
Why should I?

240
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:54,616
Eleanor, if you make a move

241
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,452
against Captain Bryson or his ship,

242
00:16:56,503 --> 00:16:59,087
you'll be making a move against
the Guthrie Trading Company.

243
00:16:59,155 --> 00:17:01,039
A direct affront to your grandfather

244
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:02,841
<i>and his interests in Boston.</i>

245
00:17:02,926 --> 00:17:04,993
That ship belongs to him.

246
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:06,595
When he finds out what you've done,

247
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:10,048
no one... not I nor your father...

248
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:13,635
will able to protect you
from the consequences.

249
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:17,439
If Bryson balks, we must let him go.

250
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:21,393
And the guns Flint needs? What about them?

251
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:23,145
We'll find them some other way.

252
00:17:24,564 --> 00:17:26,681
I never ask anything of you.

253
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:28,450
This I must insist on.

254
00:17:29,953 --> 00:17:31,703
Tell me you understand.

255
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:37,493
I understand.

256
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:53,976
(playing)

257
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:56,094
(laughing)

258
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:07,439
- How we doing?
- Ahead of schedule.

259
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:10,559
Ready to raise the keel. I think
we might actually pull it off.

260
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,945
We'll have Billy to thank for that.

261
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:14,413
<i>I have no idea how he's done it,</i>

262
00:18:14,497 --> 00:18:16,164
<i>but he's kept them to a schedule.</i>

263
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:17,699
<i>I don't think I've ever seen a crew</i>

264
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,084
<i>work this fast and this hard.</i>

265
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,754
<i>A few more days, we'll
have the keel cleared</i>

266
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,791
<i>and tarred and she'll be ready
to go back into the water.</i>

267
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,793
Excuse me, Captain.

268
00:18:29,512 --> 00:18:31,630
That's it. Secure these ropes.

269
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:33,966
<i>Man: Listen here, you smart-mouthed fuck.</i>

270
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,968
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

271
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:39,304
I said I've got the shits. What
part of that don't you understand?

272
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:40,806
What's going on?

273
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,258
His rotten pig gave the lot
of us the bloody squirts.

274
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:44,893
It's possible it wasn't the pig, you know.

275
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:46,478
Some people have weak constitutions.

276
00:18:46,563 --> 00:18:48,864
Hey! Settle down.

277
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:51,900
(flies buzzing)

278
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:58,273
Mmm. It's delicious.

279
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:00,125
It's likely as not it wasn't the pig.

280
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:02,744
It's just something that's
going around. Get back to work.

281
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:08,300
Thank you. I'm glad someone here likes...

282
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:11,753
(spitting) What the
fuck did you do to that?

283
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:13,555
I cooked it... ?

284
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:15,140
You absolutely did not.

285
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:16,842
The men seemed to think it looked done.

286
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:19,094
Yes, well, they'd eat it raw
if left to their own devices.

287
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,597
(chuckles) That's awfully cynical.

288
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:23,599
<i>(laughs)</i>

289
00:19:29,606 --> 00:19:30,856
Go get another pig.

290
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:35,193
Do exactly as I say.

291
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:48,457
<i>(man moaning)</i>

292
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,127
(panting)

293
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:01,219
Now you see how it can be?

294
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:04,056
When I'm made to feel comfortable,

295
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,694
<i>you are made to feel le toucher de dieu.</i>

296
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:14,316
<i>It's like our bodies
are all made up of these</i>

297
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:16,685
secret little compartments, she says,

298
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:19,371
what's got pleasures hidden inside 'em.

299
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:22,124
And it just takes someone

300
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:25,661
who knows how to unlock 'em. That's it.

301
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:55,824
Your friends, they have seen the reward

302
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:57,909
<i>for gentle obedience.</i>

303
00:20:57,994 --> 00:21:00,562
If pleasure is what you want,

304
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:04,249
I assure you I can give
it to you if you let me.

305
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,124
(grunts)

306
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:15,210
Indeed.

307
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:18,180
<i>(Max sobbing)</i>

308
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:26,888
<i>(Max sobbing)</i>

309
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:55,717
- Captain Bryson.
- Mistress Guthrie.

310
00:21:58,554 --> 00:22:00,589
I trust your passage was comfortable.

311
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,141
My cargo will be inventoried
and off-loaded in the morning.

312
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:04,810
You'll find the books in good order.

313
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:07,095
That's good to hear, but I was
hoping we could have a word.

314
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:12,133
Seeing as our every word only
prolongs my stay in this cesspool,

315
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:14,135
I trust you'll make it quick.

316
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:16,738
I thought it best you heard from me first.

317
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:19,825
One of our crews intends
to hunt the Urca de Lima.

318
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:23,945
A move against a state asset?

319
00:22:23,996 --> 00:22:25,614
And your father hasn't quashed it?

320
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:28,316
- No, he hasn't.
- Why on earth not?

321
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:30,168
Why don't you ask him yourself?

322
00:22:30,253 --> 00:22:32,454
He'll be in my tavern shortly.

323
00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:40,846
I understood you meant
to hide his presence here.

324
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,131
We did until this morning.

325
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:46,551
Stand up, please, sir.

326
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:54,609
Once upon a time Mr. Scott
was my personal houseboy.

327
00:22:55,862 --> 00:22:57,896
Until he proved himself worthy

328
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,848
of greater responsibility.

329
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:01,900
That earned him an education

330
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:04,202
which he then passed on to my daughter.

331
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:06,538
And look where that's gotten me.

332
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,075
I'm afraid I still don't follow.

333
00:23:11,878 --> 00:23:15,297
Captain Bryson commands the
largest of my supply ships.

334
00:23:15,364 --> 00:23:17,966
My daughter needs the guns from that ship

335
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:19,701
to arm Captain Flint

336
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:22,637
for his move against the
Spanish treasure galleon.

337
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:25,390
Parting Bryson from his guns, however,

338
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:27,676
will require some convincing.

339
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:31,313
Evidently, Eleanor knows better
than to try to do it herself.

340
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,232
And how can she be sure
you won't betray her

341
00:23:34,317 --> 00:23:38,186
and alert Captain Bryson
to the fact of your arrest?

342
00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:41,523
Because Bryson would have no choice
but to liquidate our holdings here

343
00:23:41,574 --> 00:23:43,859
and return me to Boston a failure.

344
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,946
Therefore, whatever resentments
I might feel towards my daughter

345
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,333
and your friend the
captain, I must put aside.

346
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,753
Absorb the blow, as it were.

347
00:23:54,837 --> 00:23:56,588
Like a rocky promontory.

348
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:01,927
At any rate, I have a meeting to attend.

349
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,301
Shall we?

350
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:15,223
<i>(door opens)</i>

351
00:24:15,274 --> 00:24:16,925
<i>(door closes)</i>

352
00:24:16,976 --> 00:24:18,393
(men shouting)

353
00:24:26,953 --> 00:24:28,954
When I get my share of that Spanish gold,

354
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:31,940
I'm going to fuck my
way through high society.

355
00:24:31,991 --> 00:24:34,576
Nary a duchess's snatch be uncharted.

356
00:24:34,627 --> 00:24:36,711
<i>(men laugh)</i>

357
00:24:39,332 --> 00:24:41,333
What the fuck is this?

358
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:42,968
You said tie it to the palm.

359
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:45,136
That palm. That one.

360
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:47,889
<i>You tied it to the wrong fucking tree.</i>

361
00:24:50,676 --> 00:24:52,594
Yes, it matters.

362
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:54,596
Jesus, fix it, will you, please?

363
00:24:58,768 --> 00:25:00,134
Christ.

364
00:25:00,186 --> 00:25:02,854
Give a man a little bit of power.

365
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:04,689
What the fuck difference does it make?

366
00:25:04,774 --> 00:25:06,474
They're both trees, ain't they?

367
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:08,660
Agreed.

368
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:12,414
Quick fuck?

369
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:19,955
(creaking)

370
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:28,296

<i>Morley: Shove over, Randall.</i>

374
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:45,313
The shade's mine for the next hour.

375
00:25:45,364 --> 00:25:47,015
Don't want no arguments.

376
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:49,067
Did you bring me barnacle?

377
00:25:49,151 --> 00:25:51,152
Oh, fuck.

378
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:53,371
Sorry, mate.

379
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:55,373
I forgot.

380
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:58,376
You promised. For Betsy.

381
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:01,162
You're right.

382
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:03,581
Hold my spot.

383
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,421
What the... ?

384
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,309
Hey, what the fuck is your problem?

385
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:15,977
Morley: No problem at all, sir.

386
00:26:16,045 --> 00:26:18,212
Just doing my share for a worthy cause.

387
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:20,598
Oh, so what is it? You tell me a story

388
00:26:20,683 --> 00:26:22,734
and I'm supposed to fall
in lockstep behind you?

389
00:26:22,818 --> 00:26:25,386
You wouldn't even raise your voice

390
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:28,356
to question the captain's
plan. Didn't even consider it.

391
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:31,326
Maybe I considered it and
decided it was making sense.

392
00:26:31,393 --> 00:26:32,944
Maybe.

393
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:36,531
Or maybe there's something
you'd rather not say out loud.

394
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:40,835
Thought when that lackey
Gates stepped aside,

395
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:42,704
we might have finally
gotten a quartermaster

396
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:44,789
who wasn't fully in the captain's pocket.

397
00:26:46,926 --> 00:26:48,626
Guess I was mistaken.

398
00:27:05,644 --> 00:27:08,947
How exactly does the most
feared captain of the high seas

399
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:10,949
learn how to spice and glaze a pig?

400
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:12,984
What do you care?

401
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:16,654
Well, I don't, really.

402
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:18,823
It's just that there's
something we need to talk about

403
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:21,409
and I thought a little
small talk beforehand

404
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,877
might be better than diving right in.

405
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:25,246
What the hell are you talking about?

406
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:29,667
What are we going to do about Billy?

407
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,804
Beg your pardon?

408
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:35,306
As much as it pains me to say this,

409
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:38,093
as he has been nothing but
warm and welcoming to me,

410
00:27:38,144 --> 00:27:41,646
he appears to be straining at the seams.

411
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,149
<i>I thought maybe we ought to have...
- Stop.</i>

412
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:48,136
There is no we. Billy
Bones is a dutiful boatswain

413
00:27:48,187 --> 00:27:51,739
who commands enormous respect from
his crew as well as from myself.

414
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:54,442
I trust him a thousand times more

415
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:56,811
than I would a rodent like yourself.

416
00:27:56,862 --> 00:27:58,947
Understood.

417
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,617
- All that being said...
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

418
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:04,702
I saw Billy speaking with Mr. Morley

419
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:06,337
late last week.

420
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:08,289
At night.

421
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,757
In secret.

422
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:11,960
That supposed to mean something to me?

423
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:15,180
Well, he lied about the page being blank.

424
00:28:15,264 --> 00:28:17,265
I believe it's wearing on him.

425
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:19,601
I told you once,

426
00:28:19,668 --> 00:28:21,436
I won't tell you again.

427
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:23,388
I trust Billy.

428
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:24,856
<i>Trust me.</i>

429
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,559
I'm purely in this for
myself and you know this.

430
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:30,445
I've no reason to tell you
anything other than the truth.

431
00:28:30,512 --> 00:28:32,981
Both our futures depend on this.

432
00:28:33,032 --> 00:28:35,516
I haven't decided yet whether
you even have a future.

433
00:28:35,568 --> 00:28:37,368
But I can tell you this,

434
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:39,704
trying to play me against my own crew

435
00:28:39,788 --> 00:28:42,157
will not help your cause.

436
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:47,462
Turn your pig. It's almost done.

437
00:28:57,223 --> 00:29:00,008
<i>- (wind blowing)
- (Lantern squeaking)</i>

438
00:29:03,712 --> 00:29:06,231
(creaking)

439
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,591
- I can't do it, Jack.
- Of course you can.

440
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:36,577
You simply present my crew's haul to
Miss Guthrie as if it were your own.

441
00:29:36,629 --> 00:29:38,463
You get a percentage. Everybody wins.

442
00:29:38,547 --> 00:29:40,381
I get caught selling a
grain of salt for you,

443
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:42,934
the girl puts my crew
on the outs same as you.

444
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:46,104
<i>I just can't risk it.</i>

445
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:48,439
It ain't you she has a problem with, Jack.

446
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:50,391
Why stick with him?

447
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,478
<i>Anne: It's a good question.</i>

448
00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:55,313
No, it's not.

449
00:29:55,397 --> 00:29:56,931
There are other ships.

450
00:29:56,982 --> 00:29:58,933
Had a few offers, have you?

451
00:29:58,984 --> 00:30:01,486
Makes sense. You'd be an asset to any crew.

452
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,322
Now ask how many offers
good old Jack has received

453
00:30:04,406 --> 00:30:06,658
since our run-in with the lady Guthrie.

454
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:08,743
(blows)

455
00:30:08,794 --> 00:30:10,945
My only assets are my wits,
and as the man who just lost

456
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:13,281
5,000 pesos of his ship's own money,

457
00:30:13,332 --> 00:30:14,949
they are ill-valued at the moment.

458
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,835
Join another crew right now, the only task

459
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,639
I will be trusted with is
swabbing out the piss buckets.

460
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:23,958
And that, my darling, I feel
compelled to state out loud,

461
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:27,178
life is simply too fucking short!

462
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:31,516
What, you're angry with me, too?

463
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,568
Hey! Jack Rackham!

464
00:30:33,635 --> 00:30:36,487
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- A word.

465
00:30:36,572 --> 00:30:38,906
I'm sorry, I'd prefer you made an
appointment. Quite a full day ahead.

466
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:41,826
You took one of my best
whores for your private use.

467
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,997
Every day she's not under my
roof fucking costs me money.

468
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:48,316
Ah, yes, but my crew
sees her as responsible

469
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,084
for the loss of a great
deal of their money.

470
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:52,086
They see this as a debt
being repaid, nothing more.

471
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,088
Well, I see it as thieving bullshit.

472
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:55,840
Then I believe we're at an impasse.

473
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:01,596
Disagreement without
prospect of resolution.

474
00:31:01,663 --> 00:31:03,164
Fuck you, Jack. Give me back the whore.

475
00:31:03,215 --> 00:31:06,017
You'd take her back yourself
if you had the balls.

476
00:31:10,856 --> 00:31:13,558
A few less men outside
that tent than yesterday,

477
00:31:13,642 --> 00:31:16,361
which had fewer than the day before.

478
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,847
Maybe I'll take you up on that offer

479
00:31:19,898 --> 00:31:21,983
sooner than later.

480
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:29,540
What the hell was that?

481
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:32,126
Do you have some problem with
us holding onto that whore?

482
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:37,715
You do realize she's the only thing
keeping what's left of our crew at our side.

483
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:41,336
Fuck you.

484
00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:49,344
(sighs)

485
00:31:49,395 --> 00:31:51,396
You want the guns from my ship...

486
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,149
to hand over to a pirate?

487
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:56,717
That is correct.

488
00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:58,686
Have you lost your mind?

489
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:01,856
You know as well as I do your
family would never approve of this.

490
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:04,492
What my family approves or does not approve

491
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,662
rests solely on one thing... Eleanor... ?

492
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:09,580
Profit.

493
00:32:09,665 --> 00:32:12,233
Eleanor's arranged a plan to deliver them

494
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:15,203
<i>quite a bit of it upon the
success of this operation.</i>

495
00:32:15,254 --> 00:32:18,289
Enough to assuage any fears they
may have about repercussions.

496
00:32:18,374 --> 00:32:20,291
I find that hard to believe.

497
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,744
You're a brilliant seaman, Dyfed.

498
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:26,547
But in this instance,
you're out of your depth.

499
00:32:27,966 --> 00:32:31,352
Commerce in this place requires bold moves.

500
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,056
I'm fortunate enough to have a
daughter who has found one for us.

501
00:32:41,096 --> 00:32:42,980
Perhaps you're right.

502
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:47,618
<i>Maybe I am out of my depth.</i>

503
00:32:49,788 --> 00:32:52,323
And yet this feeling persists.

504
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:53,958
And what feeling is that?

505
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:56,961
I wonder, Mr. Guthrie, if
this might have something to do

506
00:32:57,045 --> 00:33:00,081
with His Majesty's Ship the Scarborough
currently docked at Harbour Island.

507
00:33:00,132 --> 00:33:02,216
Docked outside your home.

508
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:06,471
<i>My intent was to stop there first
and unload the slaves in my hold,</i>

509
00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:08,122
<i>but when I saw her, I thought better of it.</i>

510
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:12,310
His Majesty's ships often
use my port for resupply.

511
00:33:12,394 --> 00:33:15,430
What are you implying?

512
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:21,235
I'd like to speak with your father alone.

513
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:25,773
Whatever you can say to
him, you can say to me.

514
00:33:25,824 --> 00:33:28,443
Eleanor, it's all right.

515
00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:42,006
<i>(door opens)</i>

516
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,043
<i>(door closes)</i>

517
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:51,516
Your father can handle this.

518
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,301
He'll get you those guns.

519
00:33:53,352 --> 00:33:55,303
Perhaps.

520
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,534
I couldn't leave it to chance.

521
00:34:11,787 --> 00:34:14,822
Let us be frank.

522
00:34:14,873 --> 00:34:16,624
You and I both know the low regard

523
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:18,409
in which your family in Boston holds you.

524
00:34:18,494 --> 00:34:21,546
Quite frank, it seems.

525
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,048
If I returned unarmed and they find

526
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:25,967
that I did so under these circumstances

527
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:28,920
with only your orders as justification,

528
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:32,557
I'll be buried in a shallow
grave somewhere out in Cambridge.

529
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:35,876
And what exactly do you believe
"these circumstances" to be?

530
00:34:35,928 --> 00:34:38,479
The Navy on your doorstep.

531
00:34:38,547 --> 00:34:40,398
You and your daughter

532
00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:43,434
supporting a plan as reckless as this.

533
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,771
It would seem, sir, that something's gone
terribly wrong with the operation here

534
00:34:46,855 --> 00:34:50,024
and you two are scrambling
to save yourselves.

535
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,161
Tell me I'm wrong.

536
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:59,750
Let me tell you how wrong you are.

537
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:01,953
I knew you wouldn't approve.

538
00:35:02,037 --> 00:35:04,705
But I couldn't let him leave
here without giving up those guns.

539
00:35:04,756 --> 00:35:06,374
I'm sorry.

540
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:08,175
With everything we've been through,

541
00:35:08,243 --> 00:35:10,244
with everything I've done for you...

542
00:35:10,295 --> 00:35:12,547
- I'm doing this for us both.
- You lied.

543
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,102
Shame on you.

544
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,793
The guns are yours.

545
00:35:44,129 --> 00:35:45,463
Mr. Hayes.

546
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,510
Richard: Truly something
to behold, this place.

547
00:35:59,595 --> 00:36:01,262
You should be proud.

548
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:05,433
Come now, Mr. Scott.

549
00:36:05,484 --> 00:36:08,486
It's as much your work as Eleanor's.

550
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:12,106
What is this if not the
moment of your vindication?

551
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:15,159
It's time we got you back.

552
00:36:15,243 --> 00:36:17,278
She'll get herself killed.

553
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,002
If she proceeds with this
Spanish galleon business,

554
00:36:25,087 --> 00:36:27,004
attempting to steal
treasure from one empire

555
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:28,656
to finance a war against another,

556
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:30,541
she will get herself killed.

557
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:33,494
Whether by English noose or Spanish sword,

558
00:36:33,545 --> 00:36:35,796
it's inevitable and you know it.

559
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:39,300
If she proceeds...

560
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:42,937
what did you say to Bryson in that room?

561
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:46,357
Rest assured I had a plan.

562
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:48,559
Not just to end this insanity,

563
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:51,345
but to contend with what comes next.

564
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:53,898
To keep her safe.

565
00:36:53,982 --> 00:36:55,866
I don't envy you.

566
00:36:55,951 --> 00:37:00,037
You know that she'll stop at
nothing to save this place.

567
00:37:00,122 --> 00:37:01,822
A place where she matters.

568
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:04,358
<i>A place where you matter.</i>

569
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:07,411
Except that in your
heart you know the truth.

570
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:12,917
Places like this aren't meant to last.

571
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:16,754
Help me, Mr. Scott.

572
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,807
Please.

573
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:22,677
Help me save her from herself.

574
00:37:36,942 --> 00:37:38,859
<i>(branch snaps)</i>

575
00:37:43,582 --> 00:37:45,700
Well, hello.

576
00:37:48,453 --> 00:37:50,421
There's no need to be afraid.

577
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,543
You could help me if you like.

578
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:00,715
Aren't you the Gladwin boy?

579
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:06,303
Does your father know
you're out here all alone?

580
00:38:06,388 --> 00:38:08,055
I can take you to him.

581
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:12,026
Oh!

582
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:14,361
Witch!

583
00:38:33,381 --> 00:38:35,249

584
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:39,420

585
00:38:39,471 --> 00:38:42,506
Captain. Visitor.

586
00:38:49,147 --> 00:38:51,965
The guns are yours.

587
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:54,185
Captain Bryson's preparing
to off-load them as we speak.

588
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:57,471
Mr. O'Malley is on the
lookout to ensure he complies.

589
00:38:57,522 --> 00:38:59,573
Take a seat.

590
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:09,867
To our endeavor

591
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:12,953
and success close at hand.

592
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,092
What's wrong?

593
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,211
Your father step out of line?

594
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:22,346
It's Mr. Scott.

595
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,549
In order to guarantee
Captain Bryson's acquiescence,

596
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:28,135
I put a plan into place
without Mr. Scott's knowledge.

597
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:32,022
I lied to him.

598
00:39:32,107 --> 00:39:33,891
<i>Betrayed his trust.</i>

599
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:36,393
I didn't want to, but I just
didn't think he would understand.

600
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:38,395
Well, you can't expect him to.

601
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,198
Nobody will believe it's
possible until we show them.

602
00:39:41,283 --> 00:39:43,350
But when that day comes,

603
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:46,370
you know what they'll say?

604
00:39:46,454 --> 00:39:49,323
They'll say that it was inevitable.

605
00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:55,496

Randall!

00:41:15,126 --> 00:41:17,578
- I'll go.
- Captain, there's no time.

623
00:41:17,629 --> 00:41:19,413
The mainmast is holding too much weight.

624
00:41:19,464 --> 00:41:20,831
We have to cut her loose!

625
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,716
Save the mast. Don't wait for me.

631
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,908
It's taking too long.

632
00:41:52,614 --> 00:41:54,949
How much time do we have?

633
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,116
We don't.

634
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:59,920

Shit.

653
00:44:12,637 --> 00:44:15,139
I talked to De Groot. You
did everything you could.

654
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:20,094
Not everything.

00:44:20,145 --> 00:44:21,512
<i>I should have stopped Flint.</i>

656
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:23,964
Honestly, son,

657
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:25,933
how could you have done that?

658
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,771
Careful, Billy.

659
00:44:35,193 --> 00:44:38,245
Flint pushed it through and I
went along when I knew better.

660
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:40,364
Because you know what's at stake here.

661
00:44:40,448 --> 00:44:42,282
You know he's right.

662
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:44,201
That's not why I...

663
00:44:50,792 --> 00:44:52,960
It's because I'm afraid of him.

664
00:45:21,689 --> 00:45:24,324
Billy and Morley.

665
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:26,460
That night on the ship,

666
00:45:26,527 --> 00:45:28,412
what were they talking about?

667
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:31,698
Well, I didn't hear much,

668
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:34,635
but it sounded like they
were talking about a woman.

669
00:45:34,702 --> 00:45:36,970
Somebody Barlow.

670
00:45:53,154 --> 00:45:55,189
<i>(harpsichord music playing)</i>

00:46:31,726 --> 00:46:33,527
Would you mind?

674
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:43,904
The music you were playing,

675
00:46:43,955 --> 00:46:47,374
<i>that's Purcell's Chaconne
if I'm not mistaken.</i>

676
00:46:51,246 --> 00:46:52,579
You have an educated ear.

677
00:46:53,948 --> 00:46:56,750
My father employed a
tutor for all his children

678
00:46:56,801 --> 00:46:59,052
so that they might learn
to appreciate music.

679
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,306
I took to it the least of my siblings.

680
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:05,759
But for reasons beyond
me, some of it stuck.

681
00:47:10,298 --> 00:47:13,100
<i>There's a pronounced sense of sadness</i>

682
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,302
<i>in Purcell's pieces.</i>

683
00:47:15,353 --> 00:47:17,971
Considering your circumstances,

684
00:47:18,022 --> 00:47:19,606
I can understand their appeal.

685
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:24,661
And what is it you think you
understand of my circumstances?

686
00:47:24,746 --> 00:47:26,580
Truthfully,

687
00:47:26,647 --> 00:47:29,449
I might know everything, Mrs. Hamilton.

688
00:47:31,753 --> 00:47:33,587
<i>Don't be alarmed.</i>

689
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:37,007
<i>I have no intention of disclosing
your identity to anyone.</i>

690
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:40,927
I'm sorry, sir. I think you have
me mistaken for someone else.

691
00:47:40,995 --> 00:47:43,714
The portrait in your room depicts you

692
00:47:43,798 --> 00:47:45,832
alongside Lord Thomas Hamilton,

693
00:47:45,883 --> 00:47:48,335
son of Alfred Hamilton,

694
00:47:48,386 --> 00:47:51,355
the lord proprietor of
these Bahama Islands.

695
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,558
Forgive me.

696
00:47:54,642 --> 00:47:57,644
I must have gotten
disoriented and wandered.

697
00:48:00,281 --> 00:48:03,283
You see, I've had extensive dealings
with the earl over the years,

698
00:48:03,351 --> 00:48:06,987
and so I'd long heard of the tragedy

699
00:48:07,038 --> 00:48:09,790
that befell his eldest son.

700
00:48:09,857 --> 00:48:12,025
<i>But Thomas's wife,</i>

701
00:48:12,076 --> 00:48:15,212
long rumored to be the cheating sort,

702
00:48:15,296 --> 00:48:17,247
had begun a torrid affair

703
00:48:17,332 --> 00:48:19,750
with her husband's closest friend,

704
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:23,754
a promising young officer
in His Majesty's Navy.

705
00:48:26,474 --> 00:48:29,343
And upon discovering the affair,

706
00:48:29,394 --> 00:48:32,062
Thomas went mad with grief.

707
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:35,932
<i>His despair so great,</i>

708
00:48:36,017 --> 00:48:39,069
<i>even the asylum couldn't
protect him from himself.</i>

709
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:45,359
As for Thomas's wife,

710
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:48,862
she's said to have fled
London along with her lover.

711
00:48:48,913 --> 00:48:51,915
Partly out of shame,

712
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:55,202
<i>partly to escape retribution.</i>

713
00:48:55,253 --> 00:48:57,838
Given the facts at hand,
I am forced to assume

714
00:48:57,905 --> 00:49:00,123
that the lover is none other

715
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:02,843
than our friend Captain Flint.

716
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:07,080
<i>Please understand, I raise this issue</i>

717
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:09,766
<i>not to disturb or harass you.</i>

718
00:49:09,851 --> 00:49:13,637
In fact, I wish to help you.

719
00:49:15,807 --> 00:49:17,357
Help me?

720
00:49:17,425 --> 00:49:21,027
I can only assume that
your exile in this place

721
00:49:21,095 --> 00:49:23,980
has been less than ideal.

722
00:49:25,766 --> 00:49:28,368
I understand how desperation

723
00:49:28,436 --> 00:49:30,287
may have driven you here,

724
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:34,408
but perhaps it's time
you were offered a hand

725
00:49:34,459 --> 00:49:36,626
and a return to civilization.

726
00:49:40,715 --> 00:49:43,133
And you could offer me that?

727
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:49,639
Boston is quite a different
animal from London.

728
00:49:52,977 --> 00:49:55,145
More forgiving of one's past

729
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:57,097
in a general sense.

730
00:49:57,148 --> 00:49:59,132
And in this specific sense,

731
00:49:59,183 --> 00:50:01,902
with my family's assistance,

732
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:05,856
one might find total absolution there.

733
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,358
<i>New identities.</i>

734
00:50:08,443 --> 00:50:11,328
<i>A clean start. A new life.</i>

735
00:50:11,412 --> 00:50:13,447
I could do that for you.

736
00:50:13,498 --> 00:50:15,949
Why on earth would you?

737
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,002
<i>Because I know what it
is to be judged unfairly.</i>

738
00:50:19,086 --> 00:50:21,037
And because it's just possible that,

739
00:50:21,122 --> 00:50:23,924
while I am uniquely situated

740
00:50:23,991 --> 00:50:26,426
to offer you your freedom,

741
00:50:26,494 --> 00:50:29,296
you may be able to do the same for me.

742
00:50:47,064 --> 00:50:48,782
<i>Eleanor: Hello, Charles.</i>

743
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:59,359
You've looked better.

744
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:01,194
Fuck you.

745
00:51:01,245 --> 00:51:03,580
<i>We're alone.</i>

746
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:08,468
You don't have to pretend with me.

747
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:13,507
The fuck did I ever do to you?

748
00:51:15,092 --> 00:51:17,177
You made me look weak.

749
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:21,648
Standing beside you, I was your lesser.

750
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:26,903
I was a girl.

751
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:30,774
<i>From the moment you met me,</i>

752
00:51:30,858 --> 00:51:33,026
<i>you must have known I'd
never settle for that.</i>

753
00:51:35,062 --> 00:51:37,397
For being less than.

754
00:51:37,448 --> 00:51:39,416
That's why I loved you.

755
00:51:42,503 --> 00:51:44,204
And you destroyed me.

756
00:51:46,123 --> 00:51:48,408
<i>I exposed you.</i>

757
00:51:48,459 --> 00:51:51,044
The weakness behind the mask.

758
00:51:55,433 --> 00:51:57,350
The fear.

759
00:52:00,087 --> 00:52:03,723
So much I have taken from you.

760
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:07,561
And yet still...

761
00:52:10,114 --> 00:52:12,732
you know you could take it all back.

762
00:52:15,236 --> 00:52:17,904
You could be strong again.

763
00:52:17,955 --> 00:52:20,574
<i>You could resist me.</i>

764
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:25,378
You could take this whole
fucking island from me.

765
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:32,252
You know exactly what it is you need to do.

766
00:52:32,303 --> 00:52:35,972
Where it is you need to go to do it.

767
00:52:38,009 --> 00:52:39,926
(man's voice) If only you
weren't so goddamn afraid.

768
00:52:39,977 --> 00:52:42,128
(gasps)

769
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:44,648
<i>(dogs barking)</i>

770
00:53:50,464 --> 00:53:51,831
(grunts)

771
00:53:51,882 --> 00:53:54,634
(groaning)

772
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:01,174
Ain't this a sad sight?

773
00:54:06,263 --> 00:54:09,716
Miss Guthrie should
have just had you killed.

774
00:54:09,767 --> 00:54:12,218
It would have been more merciful.

775
00:54:12,269 --> 00:54:15,188
Now, are you going to
give me back me whore?

776
00:54:18,776 --> 00:54:21,394
Jesus! On my shoe!

777
00:54:21,445 --> 00:54:23,747
<i>Oh, fuck it. Put him out of his misery.</i>

778
00:54:31,622 --> 00:54:32,905
(sizzles)

779
00:54:32,957 --> 00:54:34,591
Oh, for Christ...

780
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:42,932
(screams)

781
00:54:43,017 --> 00:54:45,719
(screaming)

782
00:54:50,775 --> 00:54:53,193
Wait!

783
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,477
Listen to me!

784
00:55:00,568 --> 00:55:02,068
The whorehouse,

785
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:04,788
<i>I'll cut you in for half.</i>

786
00:55:04,872 --> 00:55:07,407
We'll be partners.

787
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:08,941
Please.

788
00:55:08,993 --> 00:55:11,995
(growls)

789
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,463
<i>(gagging)</i>

790
00:55:13,547 --> 00:55:15,965
<i>(cracks)</i>

791
00:55:31,515 --> 00:55:33,767
<i>(door closes)</i>

792
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,489
Do you know who I am, Pastor?

793
00:55:39,573 --> 00:55:41,574
I do.

794
00:55:41,642 --> 00:55:45,111
You're the reason this island
is infested with criminals.

795
00:55:46,497 --> 00:55:49,649
God teaches us not to
cheer when others stumble.

796
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:53,002
In your case, I may ask His forgiveness.

797
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:56,489
And what does God say about redemption?

798
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,542
Accept His love and you'll find it.

799
00:55:59,627 --> 00:56:01,044
What if I was prepared to go further?

800
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:02,712
Further?

801
00:56:02,797 --> 00:56:06,165
Penance for my past sins.

802
00:56:06,217 --> 00:56:09,435
<i>Good works.</i>

803
00:56:09,503 --> 00:56:11,387
<i>And they begin tonight.</i>

804
00:56:11,472 --> 00:56:13,473
Who's there?

805
00:56:13,524 --> 00:56:15,692
Mr. Scott.

806
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:17,861
What are you doing here?

807
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:19,896
I thought you might use a hand.

808
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:24,818
Bastard's finally bringing
in the first of the guns.

809
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:27,821
Took him long enough.

810
00:56:29,907 --> 00:56:31,991
He takes his cargo seriously.

811
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:37,914
You look tired. Why don't I take over?

812
00:56:37,998 --> 00:56:40,834
Miss Guthrie told me I was to see
those guns off with my own eyes.

813
00:56:42,887 --> 00:56:45,171
I understand.

814
00:56:45,222 --> 00:56:47,006
(grunts)

815
00:56:54,565 --> 00:56:57,567
<i>Richard: I brought the
fiends to this place.</i>

816
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:01,020
Encouraged them.

817
00:57:01,071 --> 00:57:03,072
Enriched them.

818
00:57:03,157 --> 00:57:05,525
Empowered them.

819
00:57:07,328 --> 00:57:10,196
It seems as though my penance
ought to be a simple one.

820
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,534
I will see to it

821
00:57:14,585 --> 00:57:16,619
that they are cast out of this place.

822
00:57:17,922 --> 00:57:20,089
Soon.

823
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:22,175
And for good.

824
00:57:26,213 --> 00:57:28,097
The Andromache. It can't be.

825
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:29,682
Captain Bryson hasn't had time to unload.

826
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,684
He didn't. She's riding low.

827
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:34,053
<i>Those guns are still on board.</i>

828
00:57:34,104 --> 00:57:35,471
<i>Eleanor: What are we going to do?</i>

829
00:57:38,726 --> 00:57:40,727
Get them back.

830
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:48,134
