1
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:15,141
There is a place not far from here

2
00:00:15,193 --> 00:00:17,411
where you could be feared and respected.

3
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:19,913
Eight men who support
Hamund. You said it yourself.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,449
<i>We kill him, they all
become threats to both of us.</i>

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,702
<i>They disappear all at once tonight.</i>

6
00:00:25,787 --> 00:00:29,172
Between you and Flint, I'm not
certain who I should be more afraid of.

7
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:32,042
- Leave with me.
- I've spent my life trying to build something here.

8
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:35,429
- (sobbing)
- What if I forgo payment for the schedule

9
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:37,130
in exchange for my share of the prize?

10
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:39,332
When the time comes for me
to reveal the last piece,

11
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:40,667
I will be right by your side.

12
00:00:40,718 --> 00:00:43,019
It wasn't Singleton that stole the page.

13
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:44,971
<i>- It was him.
- You're lying to them.</i>

14
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:47,340
If no one knows, everyone wins.

15
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:49,526
I believe in this place.
If there's anyone who can do

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,345
what's necessary to make it
something better, it's you.

17
00:00:52,396 --> 00:00:54,681
Once we have the money, Flint dies.

18
00:00:54,732 --> 00:00:57,651
- No argument.
- Not from me.

<i>Ça va?</i>

25
00:03:06,864 --> 00:03:10,083
Mr. Rackham, a word.

26
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,670
I've been expecting you, please, sit.

27
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:15,956
Won't you tell me what you
think of our little production?

28
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:17,791
The theme is "Evenings in Paris."

29
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:19,325
I'll give you three
guesses whose idea it was.

30
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:22,462
Mr. Rackham, I just saw the bursar.

31
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:25,181
He says I'm no longer to
receive my distribution

32
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:27,517
of the house's profits. Your instruction?

33
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:29,803
Yes, I did some rough
calculations to figure the amount

34
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:32,806
you've been skimming from the take
since we first began this arrangement.

35
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:35,892
It only seems fair to garnish
your proceeds to account for it.

36
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:39,312
(laughs) Mr. Rackham, I
understand your new friend

37
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:41,398
has helped to bring the girls into line,

38
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:45,702
<i>has them reporting their
income in a most honest fashion.</i>

39
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:47,854
<i>That must be very nice for you.</i>

40
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:50,356
But let us get something very straight.

41
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:52,993
I'm not one of the girls.

42
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:54,861
I will have my cut

43
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:58,331
or everyone in this street will
know what became of Mr. Noonan.

44
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:03,503
- You would do that?
- Don't you dare doubt it.

45
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:08,842
Well, Mrs. Mapleton, that sounds
like gross insubordination to me.

46
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:11,210
That, coupled with the graft
you've been responsible for,

47
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:13,930
leaves me with no choice but to
terminate your employment here.

48
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:16,433
- What?
- You're dismissed.

49
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,485
Thank you for your service.

50
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:20,386
Pardon me, but have you lost your mind?

51
00:04:20,438 --> 00:04:22,322
Not that I'm aware of, no.

52
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:25,025
I just told you that I am fully willing

53
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:27,243
to inform every merchant in Nassau

54
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:30,563
that you murdered your way
into ownership of this place.

55
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:33,333
They will band together to see you hanged.

56
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,785
Which ones exactly?

57
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:40,924
<i>Which merchants will
see Mr. Rackham hanged?</i>

58
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:42,342
Mr. Connors the wheelwright?

59
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,294
(laughing)

60
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:46,463
Or perhaps Mr. Peterson the butcher.

61
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:52,302
Maybe Mr. Rusch the lapidary?

62
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:55,088
<i>They all have enjoyed
steep discounts here lately.</i>

63
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,091
Affordable now that the
books are in good order.

64
00:04:58,142 --> 00:05:01,761
I wonder, given their fondness
for the new management,

65
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:05,815
which one of them would much care
what you think happened to Mr. Noonan?

66
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,601
You forgot the only
name that matters, dear.

67
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:11,437
The lady across the street.
She finds out about this...

68
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:13,990
Oh, Madam Guthrie knows.
She's fine with it.

69
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:17,077
But by all means, go ahead, tell her
again. I can't see any harm in it.

70
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:23,383
<i>You will regret this, sir.</i>

71
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,302
I'm sure I won't. Au revoir.

72
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:28,588
<i>(thunder rumbles)</i>

73
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,307
(chuckles)

74
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:34,060
Please don't judge me,
but I really enjoyed that.

75
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:36,596
You do not believe she will
attempt to strike back at you?

76
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:38,732
I wouldn't put it past her.

77
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:41,935
But at the moment I'll live with
the potential for future trouble

78
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:44,738
over the certainty of actual
trouble she was causing.

79
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,190
To a profitable venture.

80
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:50,026
And a partner significantly
more pleasing to the eye.

81
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:53,663
<i>(wind whistling)</i>

What am I supposed to do with this?

86
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:24,177
If he's to continue on the ship, the
crutch is too much of an impediment.

87
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:26,896
<i>He shall have to wear this

88
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,115
Come on, Randall.

89
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:32,202
Dr. Howell made this 'specially for you.

90
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:34,704
<i>Help you move around better.</i>

91
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,991
Perhaps you'll even be able to visit the
shitter once in a while without needing my help.

92
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:43,329
Whoa, easy there.

93
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:49,669
You're responsible for him.

94
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,471
You figure it out.

95
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,894
"Oh, Mr. Silver."

96
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:00,313
How can I ever thank you?

97
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,683
<i>First you save me from ending up as
a stain on the Walrus's underside.</i>

98
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:06,019
<i>Then you secured my position on the crew</i>

99
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,570
<i>on the verge of an historic haul.</i>

100
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:09,689
And if that weren't enough,

101
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,158
you're still trying to
find something comfortable

102
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:13,576
to put at the end of my stump.

103
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:17,113
<i>"From the bottom of my heart, thank you."</i>

104
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:22,535
You're welcome.

105
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:25,622
(thumps)

106
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:31,344
<i>(thunder crackles)</i>

107
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:35,298
Launch from the Ranger.

108
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:37,300
Captain Gates is coming over.

109
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:39,552
Crazy bastard.

110
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:41,087
What could be so fucking important

111
00:07:41,138 --> 00:07:43,606
that he has to row through
all that shit out there?

112
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:50,730
<i>(thunder crackles)</i>

We make landfall in the morning.

115
00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:30,770
The last part of the
schedule if you don't mind.

116
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:41,197
What's that?

117
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:43,199
My own reconnaissance.

118
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:47,086
There are a dozen bays and inlets
within a day's journey from here

119
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:49,488
<i>that will make reasonable locations
for the Urca to take on water.</i>

120
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,425
If the course you write
down leads to one of them,

121
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:54,627
odds are that your information is accurate.

122
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:56,713
And if it doesn't?

123
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,932
<i>(thunder crackles)</i>

124
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:34,250
Division Bay.

125
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,502
The course leads to Division Bay.

126
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,673
Shoals on the eastern shore,

127
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:42,508
but if we approach from the windward,

128
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,677
we should be able to take
up a strong opening position.

129
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:48,848
Take this to Mr. De Groot.

130
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,817
Tell him to adjust our course accordingly

131
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:52,852
and set up our final
approach for the morning.

132
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,323
Something else?

133
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:01,828
Well, now that I've fulfilled
my end of the bargain,

134
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:04,664
I'm just wondering where you and I stand.

135
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:06,833
Keep wondering.

136
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:22,932
I best be getting back.

137
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:24,600
Let's not tempt fate.

138
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:31,274
Talbot Rhodes. Private stock.

139
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:34,444
I've been waiting for an occasion.

140
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:40,066
My reckoning is tomorrow

141
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:42,702
we'll either be able to
afford a lot more of it or...

142
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:44,904
We'll be too dead to care.

143
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:54,780

(knocking)

147
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:26,913
Captain asked me to pass these to you.

148
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,948
A new course.

149
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:35,505
The captain accepted the last
segment of the Urca route as valid?

150
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:37,173
One thing you should not doubt.

151
00:11:37,257 --> 00:11:39,709
Certainty is not a word
I throw around lightly.

152
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:42,428
Now this information, I am
quite certain I have it right.

<i>(door opens, closes)</i>

154

the prospect of imminent
wealth beyond reason.

156
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:07,320
Ma'am.

157
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:10,406
What are you doing here?

158
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:12,691
Captain Hornigold asked me to sit in

159
00:12:12,743 --> 00:12:15,745
on Captain Lawrence's final
preparations before departure.

160
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:17,880
<i>They're just finishing upstairs.</i>

Mm.

162
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:23,719
I'm fine.

163
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,338
Believe it or not, this
place didn't collapse

164
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:26,756
the moment you walked out the door.

165
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,476
You really believe my
concern is for this place?

166
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:36,349
It's a ship killer out there.

167
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,352
I can't even imagine what
it's like further north.

168
00:12:39,403 --> 00:12:42,655
You'd been opposed to hunting
the Urca from the beginning.

169
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:45,992
Perhaps God's on your side of this one.

170
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:51,897
I just think of all the trouble
that fucking schedule caused.

171
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:54,000
The trouble it caused Max and I.

172
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,418
Caused you and I.

173
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:58,254
The thought that it could all
end up being for nothing...

174
00:12:58,338 --> 00:13:01,924
Perhaps the trouble was
going to happen anyway.

175
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:04,126
Schedule or no.

176
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:06,245
Perhaps.

177
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:09,348
Tomorrow a thing that you conceived

178
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,017
out of thin air becomes real.

179
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:13,302
<i>A thing that will give this place</i>

180
00:13:13,387 --> 00:13:16,389
<i>a chance to find some
small measure of peace.</i>

181
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,058
That is not nothing.

182
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:24,230
<i>(thunder rumbles)</i>

183
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:27,900
Henderson?

184
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:29,318
It wasn't Henderson.

185
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:32,154
It was something like
Henderson. Harrison? Harvey?

186
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:33,623
I don't know who the
fuck you're talking about.

187
00:13:33,707 --> 00:13:36,292
The man that nicked that
bottle was called Cregg.

188
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:38,327
Cregg! That's him. Cregg.

189
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:41,631
Mr. Cregg. Carpenter's mate.

190
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:44,550
Had a nose for sniffing out booze

191
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:46,502
on a prize ship like a fucking bloodhound.

192
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:50,139
Oh, Cregg. I remember
walking in on him once,

193
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:52,791
digging through a stash on a prize.

194
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:55,595
(laughs) He...

195
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:58,297
he found this bottle of
booze behind a baseboard.

196
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:02,351
Now he's convinced that the prize
captain's been hiding his best liquor.

197
00:14:02,436 --> 00:14:06,322
So he pops the cork and takes this big swig

198
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:07,690
in front of all of us.

199
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:10,476
- And it was piss.
- It was piss.

200
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:13,362
(both laughing)

201
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:17,149
Aye, Cregg.

202
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,918
- Oh, God.
- Flint: Oh, Cregg.

203
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:20,703
I brought him over with me, you know.

204
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:22,838
We served together under
Avery when we was kids.

205
00:14:22,923 --> 00:14:25,491
Huh. He was my first bunkmate.

206
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:29,178
For years he went on how he'd got this

207
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:33,382
huge stash hidden away.

208
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:35,184
And I should live to survive him

209
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,720
because one day I will be a rich man.

210
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:42,141
As you know, we lost him on the Pembroke.

211
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:46,362
So I open his locker and what do I find?

212
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:50,866
12 pesos, a busted pocket watch,

213
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:53,185
and a letter with instructions

214
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:55,020
to deliver it to his sister in New York.

215
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:58,124
<i>Lying sack of shit</i>

216
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,293
was Mr. Cregg.

217
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:04,964
<i>So I bought the boys
a round with the pesos,</i>

218
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,049
<i>traded the pocket watch for a bit of tail,</i>

219
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:10,035
<i>and spent two weeks that winter in New York</i>

220
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:13,472
trying to deliver that
fucking letter to his sister.

221
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,558
Looked high and low.

222
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:18,144
Never found her.

223
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:20,713
<i>So on the way home,</i>

224
00:15:20,764 --> 00:15:22,481
<i>I waited till we were in open water</i>

225
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:23,983
<i>and I could see no land in any direction,</i>

226
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,352
and I dropped it over the side.

227
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:29,905
Returned to the sea.

228
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:39,949
There are no legacies
in this life, are there?

229
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:45,254
No monuments. No history.

230
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:49,759
Just the water.

231
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,747
It pays us

232
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:57,049
and then it claims us.

233
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:00,269
Swallows us whole.

234
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,391
<i>As if we'd never been here at all.</i>

235
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:15,201
Well...

236
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:17,036
I better be getting back.

237
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:30,499
<i>(door creaks, closes)</i>

238
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:36,756
(children talking)

239
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:41,260
(men grunting)

240
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:51,804
How the fuck can you cut Mapleton
loose without even telling me?

241
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:54,156
I'm sorry. I wasn't aware you
were her attorney in this matter.

242
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:56,776
She'll run her mouth all over
the fucking island about Noonan.

243
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:59,662
Who cares? The only people who
could conceivably make trouble for us

244
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:02,331
are currently elbow deep in
free prostitute downstairs.

245
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,650
What's worse, you keep
counsel with a whore about it.

246
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,585
Wait, what?

247
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:08,454
You think you can trust her, you dumb shit?

248
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:10,005
That's what this is about? Max?

249
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,841
You fucked her, didn't you?

250
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:13,542
Jesus H. Christ. I can't win with you.

251
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:16,011
She's in the camp with the
men and it's, "Come on, Jack",

252
00:17:16,096 --> 00:17:18,347
let's go kill everybody and see
if we can't get her out of there.

253
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:19,965
"Hope you don't mind. Made
that decision on your behalf."

254
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,167
And now she's out, making us
a small fortune, by the way,

255
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:23,836
and you're pissed off about that, too.

256
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:26,388
Might you consider making up your
fucking mind about it, please?

257
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:27,940
- Fuck you, Jack.
- "Fuck you, Jack."

258
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,809
Yes, I know. Fuck me.

259
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:34,947
<i>(door slams)</i>

260
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:04,737
Listen here!

261
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:11,243
When we crest the point ahead
and spot the Urca in anchor,

262
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:13,612
we'll begin our final run at her.

263
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:16,549
<i>- Take it.
- The Spanish banner may earn us a few hundred yards</i>

264
00:19:16,616 --> 00:19:19,885
<i>of confusion before the captain
identifies us and opens fire.</i>

265
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:22,254
So we'll close fast on her,

266
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:24,256
hammer her well with our guns,

267
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:26,675
and then take the fight to her decks.

268
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,311
<i>That fight will be the fight of our lives,</i>

269
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:31,764
<i>make no mistake.</i>

270
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:34,900
But on the other side

271
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:36,685
lies paradise.

272
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,822
(cheering)

273
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:42,307
I'll see you there. Mr. De Groot?

274
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,610
A full complement, if you please.

275
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:47,162
- (whistles)
- Signal the Ranger.

276
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,782
<i>- Aye, captain.
- Full sail, final approach.</i>

277
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,353
Check our position.

278
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:30,155
- This is the course.
- Well, check it again.

279
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:32,207
Captain, this is the
location you requested.

280
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:05,607
Your true manifest. Your false manifest.

281
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:08,077
And, most importantly, your bribe money.

282
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:09,411
Godspeed, Captain.

283
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:11,947
Perhaps we should go over
the details one more time.

284
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:14,399
The harbormaster's name is Singer.

285
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:16,168
The foreman's name is Smith.

286
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,836
The warehouse manager's Clay,

287
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:19,171
and the customs man is Kent.

288
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:21,573
<i>Now if you don't let me board my ship</i>

289
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:23,175
<i>and leave this place,
none of it will matter</i>

290
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:26,578
as the goods in my hold will
be rotten by the time I arrive.

291
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:28,764
- Goodbye.
- Godspeed.

292
00:21:34,688 --> 00:21:36,421
I have to hand it to you,

293
00:21:36,473 --> 00:21:38,390
you said you'd rebuild things
here without your father,

294
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:40,592
and damned if you didn't do just that.

295
00:21:40,643 --> 00:21:43,028
Still one step yet to accomplish.

296
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:47,316
Removing my father entirely.

297
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,767
Excuse me?

298
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:50,486
I know he's out in the Underhill estate.

299
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,404
If you think he isn't
scheming to undo everything

300
00:21:52,455 --> 00:21:53,939
we've done here, you're kidding yourself.

301
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,041
You are truly amazing.

302
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:58,994
In a moment when stability is at
hand and the world is at your feet,

303
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,997
your first instinct is to go out
in search of someone new to fight.

304
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:03,949
Captain, a moment.

305
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,417
God.

306
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:09,171
Can't believe you left
me for that old lady.

307
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:10,789
Captain Hornigold is right.

308
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,759
<i>(cannon fire blasts)</i>

309
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,260
What the fuck?

310
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:19,815
<i>- Where did that come from?
- (Cannon fire rumbles)</i>

311
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:27,189
Jesus Christ, Ben, why are your
men firing on their own ship?

312
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:29,074
My men aren't the ones doing the firing.

313
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:32,411
<i>(cannon fire continues)</i>

314
00:22:32,478 --> 00:22:33,946
We need to get you off the beach now.

315
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,758
Is someone shooting the guns off out here?

316
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:47,176
What the hell is going on?

317
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,678
Someone has taken over the fort.

318
00:22:49,763 --> 00:22:51,880
<i>(cannon fire continues)</i>

319
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:06,028
Captain, after an inventory of our stores,

320
00:23:06,112 --> 00:23:07,896
the men have assented to your plan.

321
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:10,532
Provided we find a suitable
place to land the Walrus,

322
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:12,367
you'll have two days to send out scouts

323
00:23:12,452 --> 00:23:14,236
and hopefully locate the Urca.

324
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,456
Given their mood, I'd say we
were lucky to get that long.

325
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,909
Do it, then.

326
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:27,633
- What?
- It's Mr. De Groot.

327
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,885
He's put his foot down.

328
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:32,337
Once we make landfall, he
wants Flint tried immediately.

329
00:23:32,388 --> 00:23:34,173
Oh, Jesus.

330
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:36,675
He's bitter about the fact that we
didn't listen to him regarding the cook.

331
00:23:36,726 --> 00:23:38,143
He says there's no Urca out here

332
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:40,045
and that justice has
been delayed long enough.

333
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:42,598
That's not gonna happen,
so let's discuss reality.

334
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,716
He said that you'd say that.

335
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:47,236
And after all your talk,
you're just protecting Flint.

336
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,655
I'm protecting all of us.

337
00:23:49,722 --> 00:23:51,490
These men are right on the edge

338
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,891
and he wants to rile them up more

339
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:55,060
by talking about a lying, thieving captain,

340
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:58,230
then stand on a deserted beach
and talk about an election.

341
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:01,366
Before you know it, half a dozen men
will have laid claim to the captaincy.

342
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:03,202
Camps will divide.

343
00:24:03,253 --> 00:24:05,537
It won't be dark yet
before the fighting starts.

344
00:24:07,841 --> 00:24:10,242
We're gonna see Flint pay for his crimes.

345
00:24:10,293 --> 00:24:12,794
But we'll do it at home

346
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:15,631
and we'll do it like civilized men.

347
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:18,383
That's how we avoid the abyss.

348
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:22,638
We knew you spent the
night drinking together.

349
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:25,107
How can we take you at your word?

350
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:30,562
You don't have to take my word.

351
00:24:37,203 --> 00:24:38,954
Good enough for you?

352
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:42,741
Mr. Gates...

353
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:47,379
<i>Logan: Sails!</i>

354
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:48,964
To the south!

355
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:50,716
Is it the Urca?

356
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,472
Captain, is it her?

357
00:24:57,557 --> 00:24:59,758
Captain, is it the Urca?

358
00:25:02,896 --> 00:25:05,964
Man-of-war! She's a man-of-war!

359
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:07,649
<i>Spanish banners!</i>

360
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:09,318
In less than half an hour,
she'll be right on top of us.

361
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:11,403
Get orders to the Ranger.

362
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,238
Tell her to raise the black

363
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:15,857
and fire two shots over our bow.

364
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:18,143
<i>- Mr. De Groot.
- Captain?</i>

365
00:25:18,194 --> 00:25:20,362
<i>Rig a spring to the forward
anchor, then drop her immediately.</i>

366
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:22,281
Drop anchor?

367
00:25:22,332 --> 00:25:23,949
You mean to fight her?

368
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,951
You all have your orders!

369
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:33,091
Captain, join me.

370
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:35,794
- We don't have time.
- Make time.

371
00:25:41,768 --> 00:25:44,019
If he engages that ship
in battle, we're dead.

372
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:45,520
- I know.
- I know you know.

373
00:25:45,605 --> 00:25:47,556
But does Mr. Gates?

374
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:56,514
I can't let you go down this road.

375
00:25:56,566 --> 00:25:58,650
As far that man-of-war knows,

376
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:01,403
we're Spanish merchantmen
under attack by pirate raiders.

377
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:03,205
We order the Ranger to flee,

378
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:04,790
the Spaniard passes us to give chase,

379
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:06,825
and before she realizes her
error, we've got her trapped.

380
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:08,493
She's got 100 guns.

381
00:26:08,544 --> 00:26:11,246
We do this properly, she'll
never get a chance to use them.

382
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:12,748
We'll rake her stern to bow,

383
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:14,299
the Ranger will rake her bow to stern.

384
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:16,051
With a little luck, we'll
hammer her into submission

385
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:17,636
before she can bring
her broadsides to bear.

386
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:19,871
To accomplish what, exactly?

387
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:22,758
The Urca. She's here. Can't you see that?

388
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:25,143
All I can see is an empty bay,

389
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:26,645
a guardacosta warship,

390
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,647
and a captain that's lost
his fucking grip on reality.

391
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,849
Guardacosta? You think
that ship's here on patrol?

392
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,318
That she just happened by
this place at this time?

393
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:34,903
That ship is an escort.

394
00:26:34,988 --> 00:26:36,271
It's the only explanation.

395
00:26:36,356 --> 00:26:38,824
The Urca has no escort.

396
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:41,726
Was that not the justification
for this entire endeavor?

397
00:26:41,778 --> 00:26:43,996
They altered their plans.
Found a ship they could spare.

398
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:48,116
I'm taking the Ranger and I'm leaving.

399
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:50,502
What did you just say?

400
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:53,422
I'm gonna weigh anchor and
I'm gonna make a run for it.

401
00:26:53,506 --> 00:26:54,790
If I can keep ahead of it before dark,

402
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:56,625
there's just a chance we can slip away.

403
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:59,795
Without the Ranger, I have
no chance against that ship.

404
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,764
I know.

405
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,273
So you're deliberately
challenging my authority here?

406
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:13,725
Deliberately violating your duty?

407
00:27:15,311 --> 00:27:17,979
My duty?

408
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:21,700
My duty is to them, not to you.

409
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:24,069
Although I have violated it more times

410
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,871
than I can remember in your defense.

411
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:28,040
<i>Helped you deceive good men</i>

412
00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:30,792
who put their trust in
me because I was convinced

413
00:27:30,877 --> 00:27:32,794
they would be better off for it.

414
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:35,080
Well, not here. Not this.

415
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,132
This is fucking madness.

416
00:27:37,216 --> 00:27:38,717
Mr. Gates, if you walk through that door

417
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,585
with the intent of subverting my plans,

418
00:27:40,636 --> 00:27:44,139
I will have no alternative but to
interpret that as an incitement of mutiny.

419
00:27:44,223 --> 00:27:46,791
You think I'm inciting mutiny?

420
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:49,144
- You are inciting mutiny.
- I'm managing one!

421
00:27:49,228 --> 00:27:51,629
There are men out there right now

422
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:52,981
that know about Singleton,

423
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:55,484
the book, the cook, all of it.

424
00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:59,104
They know. And they mean
to see you hanged for it.

425
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,640
You told them?

426
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:04,642
After Billy, I just...

427
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:08,280
I didn't want to believe you could be
capable of doing something like that.

428
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:10,916
But I couldn't convince
myself that you weren't.

429
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:15,170
<i>That's when I realized,
this has got to end.</i>

430
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:17,122
So what, then?

431
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:21,543
You preside over a trial
that sees me hanged?

432
00:28:23,763 --> 00:28:25,430
No.

433
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:27,349
We're going to go home

434
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:30,168
and I will see you and
Mrs. Barlow secreted away

435
00:28:30,219 --> 00:28:32,304
before anybody knows you're gone.

436
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:34,839
<i>You're gonna go to Boston.</i>

437
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:38,110
<i>You're gonna take the pardon
that she's offered you.</i>

438
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:41,563
And that is the last that you
and I will ever see of each other.

439
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,317
Please.

440
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:48,737
Please, don't do this.

441
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:52,791
I'm sorry.

442
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:55,660
Take a moment.

443
00:28:57,296 --> 00:29:00,382
I'll deal with them.

444
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,306
<i>(door opens)</i>

445
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,811
(choking)

446
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:15,063
This is not what I wanted.

447
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:17,516
This is not what I wanted.

448
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:20,936
(whimpers) I'm sorry.

449
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,104
(cracks)

450
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:30,579
I'm sorry.

451
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:34,866
I'm sorry.

452
00:29:36,752 --> 00:29:39,004
(sobbing) I'm sorry.

453
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:43,208
I'm sorry.

454
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:47,045
(sobs)

455
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:49,381
I'm sorry.

456
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,220
<i>(door creaks)</i>

457
00:29:56,522 --> 00:29:58,223
I came to lend credence to your case

458
00:29:58,274 --> 00:30:00,475
that the Urca is still to be won.

459
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:14,439
What the fuck are you doing to him?

460
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,958
- Making sure there's nothing incriminating...
- Stop. Stop.

461
00:30:18,828 --> 00:30:20,795
There's no way out of this.

462
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,616
Take it from me,

463
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:27,002
there's always a way.

464
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:37,979
Sir.

465
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:46,488
- What is it?
- A small band of men were seen approaching the fort

466
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:49,974
from the west this morning. No
one's been able to identify them.

467
00:30:50,026 --> 00:30:51,443
Are all the home crews accounted for?

468
00:30:51,494 --> 00:30:53,411
Aye. Every one. They had
nothing to do with this.

469
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:55,813
<i>Naft: Could this be a first move
by England to reclaim the island?</i>

470
00:30:55,865 --> 00:30:57,332
<i>Frasier: Without a single ship involved?</i>

471
00:30:57,416 --> 00:31:00,285
This does not have the air of a
state move. This is something else.

472
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:02,287
Captain, how easily are the great guns

473
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:04,789
<i>- on the fort repositioned?
- What difference does that make?</i>

474
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,491
He's asking if the fort
can turn her guns around

475
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,843
<i>and bring them to bear
on the street... on us.</i>

476
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:12,347
Let's hope whomever's up there is
not mad enough to consider that.

477
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:14,666
That's less than confidence-inspiring.

478
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:16,384
I have lieutenants calling in favors

479
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:18,803
from the crews of the
Colonial Dawn and the Medusa.

480
00:31:18,854 --> 00:31:23,191
I'll have 250 men assembled and ready
to storm the fort in a matter of hours.

481
00:31:23,276 --> 00:31:26,361
By first light tomorrow,
I'll be back in my chair

482
00:31:26,445 --> 00:31:28,697
and whoever did this will
be hanging by his goddamn...

483
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:30,482
- What is it?
- Quick, you all need to see this.

484
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:40,825
<i>Man: Go back inside.</i>

485
00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:51,836
Miss Guthrie.

486
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:56,808
I think it's time we talked.

487
00:32:10,156 --> 00:32:12,574
Mr. Gates's heart has given out.

488
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,327
He's dead?

489
00:32:17,496 --> 00:32:19,247
Mr. Logan.

490
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:21,416
<i>Signal Mr. Thompson on the Ranger.</i>

491
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,585
Inform him he's now in command.

492
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:25,453
His orders are to sail north.

493
00:32:25,538 --> 00:32:29,090
When we fire on the target, he's to
tack hard to port and do the same.

494
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:31,843
Hoist the signals from the
foremast below the yard.

495
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,713
Get 'em up and down quickly
before the Spaniard sees them.

496
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,227
(door closes)

497
00:32:55,284 --> 00:32:57,702
The question you need to ask yourself

498
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,572
is "What good can I do?"

499
00:33:00,623 --> 00:33:02,607
<i>You can call this murder.</i>

500
00:33:02,658 --> 00:33:04,242
<i>A number of the men might even believe you,</i>

501
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:07,278
but will that be enough

502
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:09,464
to stop this fight that is about to happen?

503
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:13,668
<i>Because if it's not, a fight we might win</i>

504
00:33:13,753 --> 00:33:16,171
<i>becomes a battle we are doomed to lose.</i>

505
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:20,058
<i>Because the men went into it
infected with your suspicions,</i>

506
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:23,144
<i>with your doubts.</i>

507
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:28,132
So, Mr. Quartermaster,

508
00:33:28,184 --> 00:33:31,403
is that truly what's
in their best interests?

509
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,676
St. Augustine.

510
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,044
Beg pardon?

511
00:33:56,128 --> 00:33:57,295
When the warship draws close,

512
00:33:57,346 --> 00:33:59,130
she'll ask our last port of call.

513
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:01,099
St. Augustine's the closest.

514
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,167
<i>And as she's likely a customs ship,</i>

515
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:05,770
<i>we must identify our cargo
as anything but tobacco.</i>

516
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:08,690
Seville regulates the trade heavily.

517
00:34:11,393 --> 00:34:13,528
Thank you, Mr. Dufresne.

518
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:33,465
What the fuck did you do?

519
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:36,551
Spend enough time on an island,

520
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:39,637
begin to forget there's
a whole world out there.

521
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:43,007
A world where the rules are different.

522
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:50,064
I went out there, found men
who don't know the rules here

523
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:52,934
and who don't much care to learn them.

524
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:55,570
They helped me surprise
Captain Hornigold's men,

525
00:34:55,654 --> 00:34:59,190
we took his fort, and not
once were any of them burdened

526
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:02,944
with the thought, "What if this
were to upset Eleanor Guthrie?"

527
00:35:04,663 --> 00:35:08,032
Well, they're about to
learn the rules, Charles.

528
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,702
The hard way. You think
I'm gonna let this stand?

529
00:35:10,753 --> 00:35:13,588
That Hornigold will? We have men lining up

530
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:15,790
<i>in droves to back us in retaking it.</i>

531
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:18,543
I'd expect nothing less.

532
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:20,261
Just out of curiosity,

533
00:35:20,346 --> 00:35:23,014
how long do you think that's gonna take?

534
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:26,601
Can you take back that fort before...

535
00:35:26,685 --> 00:35:28,770
I sink another ship in the bay?

536
00:35:28,854 --> 00:35:31,088
Three more?

537
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,141
All of them?

538
00:35:33,225 --> 00:35:35,059
<i>Who knows?</i>

539
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,028
<i>If my men hold out long enough,</i>

540
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:38,930
<i>we may just decide to sink the Walrus</i>

541
00:35:38,981 --> 00:35:41,616
when she returns with
your precious Spanish gold

542
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,285
just out of spite.

543
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,237
So that's what this is.

544
00:35:46,288 --> 00:35:48,773
You're annoyed at me, so you're
gonna destroy everything I've built.

545
00:35:48,824 --> 00:35:50,608
Never said I wanted to destroy anything.

546
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:52,276
Then what do you want?

547
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:54,913
Hornigold controlled the fort.

548
00:35:54,964 --> 00:35:58,383
The fort controls the bay.
The bay controls commerce.

549
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,218
That meant he was your partner.

550
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:04,255
<i>Now, I control the fort.</i>

551
00:36:05,474 --> 00:36:07,809
So I will be your partner.

552
00:36:08,928 --> 00:36:10,728
You are kidding me.

553
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:13,014
I was a tenant in this
place for a long time.

554
00:36:13,098 --> 00:36:14,799
Didn't work out so well.

555
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,601
Now I'd like a stake.

556
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:19,103
You've absolutely lost your mind.

557
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:22,440
I remember the first time I saw you.

558
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:25,159
You were about 13.

559
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:27,144
You'd snuck down to the beach

560
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:29,447
despite Mr. Scott's rules forbidding it.

561
00:36:29,498 --> 00:36:32,367
A girl that age

562
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:34,919
looking like you did.

563
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:38,256
And you just walked up
and down between the camps

564
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,291
like you owned the place.

565
00:36:40,342 --> 00:36:41,709
Fearless.

566
00:36:41,794 --> 00:36:45,162
Then you saw me watching
you and you didn't look away.

567
00:36:45,214 --> 00:36:47,265
Didn't cower.

568
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,684
You just gave me this look...

569
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:51,719
this little smile...

570
00:36:51,804 --> 00:36:54,439
that said you refused to be afraid of me.

571
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:57,558
What the fuck are you talking about?

572
00:36:57,643 --> 00:37:00,177
I know you.

573
00:37:00,229 --> 00:37:03,347
<i>Better than your father, better than Scott.</i>

574
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:04,816
<i>Maybe better than anyone.</i>

575
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:07,819
You don't give a shit
about money or respect.

576
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:10,354
Or the things you've built here.

577
00:37:10,406 --> 00:37:12,740
I think you're just tired of fathers

578
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:14,959
telling you what to do.

579
00:37:16,378 --> 00:37:20,081
And so I'm offering you
a life free from them.

580
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:24,218
With me in that fort, you do as you like.

581
00:37:24,303 --> 00:37:26,054
As long as it doesn't cross me,

582
00:37:26,138 --> 00:37:29,173
you'll hear no complaints.

583
00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:33,761
You know I have no choice but to say yes.

584
00:37:35,064 --> 00:37:37,765
But before I do, know this,

585
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,352
<i>you'll sit in that fort for a
while. You'll get comfortable.</i>

586
00:37:41,403 --> 00:37:45,523
And that's the day I'm
gonna push you and your men

587
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:48,109
right into the fucking sea.

588
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,747
God, I missed that look.

589
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:01,005
Ben.

590
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:06,794
What the hell did he say?

591
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:09,881
He wants your seat on the
consortium. To be a partner to us.

592
00:38:09,932 --> 00:38:13,634
Well, I have 300 men out there
more than happy to deny him.

593
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,520
- You can't, Ben.
- Oh, watch me.

594
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:17,939
I told him about the tunnels.

595
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:21,275
The tunnels that you would use to
launch a surprise attack into the fort.

596
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,695
- I told him.
- Jesus!

597
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:26,364
You told me to keep emotion
from clouding judgment.

598
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:28,783
To act in everyone's best interest.

599
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:30,535
I believe that's what I'm doing.

600
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:33,454
This is not the end of this.

601
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:40,461
Captain. Welcome back.

602
00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:42,947
I hear congratulations are in order.

603
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:45,967
Steward of the fort. Stroke of pure genius.

604
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:48,886
In some ways, Jack, it had to come to this.

605
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:51,222
- Don't you think?
- Come to what?

606
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:53,641
Me deciding if you live or die.

607
00:38:53,726 --> 00:38:54,926
Captain, I don't know what you've heard...

608
00:38:54,977 --> 00:38:56,928
Hamund pulls you out of bed...

609
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,648
<i>marches you down to the wrecks</i>

610
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:04,736
to look for a stash of stolen pearls.

611
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:08,689
And somehow, only you and
your dog make it back alive.

612
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,778
<i>- (sighs)
- Quite a moment.</i>

613
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:16,914
Jack Rackham with nothing to say.

614
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:20,251
<i>Had I a shrewd quartermaster right now,</i>

615
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:23,087
<i>he would tell me that I
can't let what you did stand.</i>

616
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:25,423
He would say an offense like that

617
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,159
demanded an example be made of both of you.

618
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,628
<i>The bloodier the better.</i>

619
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:37,552
But today, I'm a little less worried

620
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:40,354
about perception than I used to be.

621
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,723
As long as I hold that fort,

622
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:44,609
doesn't really matter.

623
00:39:48,363 --> 00:39:50,865
So the street will know what you did.

624
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:54,819
<i>They will know you betrayed
your brothers for a woman.</i>

625
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:58,856
That story will spread far and wide

626
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:01,159
and you'll never sail
beneath the black again.

627
00:40:02,961 --> 00:40:06,030
<i>You'll sit in this place and rot</i>

628
00:40:06,081 --> 00:40:08,633
with the rest of the whores.

629
00:40:10,135 --> 00:40:12,837
Something tells me that'll
sting worse than dying.

630
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,591
<i>Loyalty, Jack.</i>

631
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:18,559
<i>It's supposed to mean something.</i>

632
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:21,262
It does to me, anyway.

633
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:25,933
Oh.

634
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:28,686
Love what you've done with the place.

635
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:44,535
(speaking Spanish)

636
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:50,875
Here she comes.

637
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:01,135
(speaking Spanish)

638
00:41:02,804 --> 00:41:05,773
Cazadora. Marco Fernandez, captain.

639
00:41:05,858 --> 00:41:10,027
Cazadora. Marco Fernandez, capitán.

640
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:12,113
(speaking Spanish)

641
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:18,653
St, Augustine. Tobacco trade.

642
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:21,205
(speaking Spanish)

643
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:27,628
If I'm not mistaken,
you told him to name us

644
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:29,380
anything but a tobacco trader, did you not?

645
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:31,082
I did.

646
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:34,468
He means to prove that that
ship is not guardacosta.

647
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:35,953
That it's here for the same reason we are.

648
00:41:36,004 --> 00:41:37,755
The Urca.

649
00:41:37,806 --> 00:41:39,307
That ship lets us pass,

650
00:41:39,391 --> 00:41:41,809
he will have managed to both
renew the men's lust for gold

651
00:41:41,894 --> 00:41:44,812
and their faith in his judgment.

652
00:41:44,897 --> 00:41:46,814
<i>(speaking Spanish)</i>

653
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,579
Hello.

654
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:14,875
All hands to their stations.

655
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,660
Quietly, if you please.

656
00:42:16,712 --> 00:42:18,679
At 300 yards, we open fire.

657
00:42:20,382 --> 00:42:23,267
Time and again he gambles with our lives.

658
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:26,187
That is, when he's not
taking them in cold blood.

659
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:29,673
And once more his influence grows.

660
00:42:29,725 --> 00:42:31,976
And we're at his mercy with
no way to challenge him.

661
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:33,694
No, sir.

662
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:36,314
It only looks that way.

663
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:48,793
Turn us around slowly, boys.

664
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,795
They need to think we're just drifting.

665
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:09,814
Range?

666
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:11,599
Hundred yards, Captain.

667
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:18,489
- Open.
- Crewman: Open.

668
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,445
(men shouting)

669
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:31,919
<i>- Come right a few degrees.
- Aye, Captain.</i>

670
00:43:32,004 --> 00:43:35,339
We only get one shot at
this. We miss, we die.

671
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:38,876
- Clear, tack hull.
- Range?

672
00:43:38,927 --> 00:43:41,128
Approaching 200 yards, Captain.

673
00:43:41,213 --> 00:43:43,931
All crews, fire on my mark.

674
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:47,685
Steady.

675
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:53,557
Almost there.

676
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,062
Captain Flint.

677
00:43:59,698 --> 00:44:03,234
As quartermaster, I hereby accuse you

678
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:05,486
of tyrannical crimes against your crew.

679
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:07,571
All crews, fire!

680
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:10,124
<i>Dufresne: Belay that order!</i>

681
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:17,331
Your duties as a member of
this crew have reached an end.

682
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:19,633
Take a seat.

683
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,672
Beginning with the
murders of Mr. Singleton,

684
00:44:24,756 --> 00:44:27,975
Billy Bones, and Mr. Gates.

685
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,794
What exactly do you hope
to accomplish by doing this?

686
00:44:30,846 --> 00:44:33,681
In your case, Mr. Silver, justice.

687
00:44:33,765 --> 00:44:37,017
Once Dufresne exposes Flint's
lies in their totality,

688
00:44:37,102 --> 00:44:38,635
the crew are gonna want
answers from you, too.

689
00:44:38,687 --> 00:44:40,771
And as I explained to Mr. Dufresne,

690
00:44:40,822 --> 00:44:42,823
it's his word against Flint's.

691
00:44:42,908 --> 00:44:44,241
Why would anyone believe him?

692
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:46,810
I hold in my hand a letter

693
00:44:46,862 --> 00:44:50,664
written by Mr. Gates
confessing his knowledge

694
00:44:50,749 --> 00:44:53,701
and complicity in the
captain's myriad crimes.

695
00:44:53,785 --> 00:44:56,653
We're going to lose them.
We don't have time for this.

696
00:44:56,705 --> 00:45:01,125
As well as his knowledge of the
captain's continued treachery

697
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:05,179
up to and including his plan to steal

698
00:45:05,263 --> 00:45:09,049
a portion of the treasure
fleet proceeds for himself.

699
00:45:09,134 --> 00:45:11,469
I gave you all an order! Fire!

700
00:45:14,106 --> 00:45:15,556
Fire!

701
00:45:17,842 --> 00:45:19,727
Mr. Logan.

702
00:45:24,783 --> 00:45:26,317
It's in Mr. Gates's hand.

703
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:29,703
Where are you going?

704
00:45:31,656 --> 00:45:33,324
<i>- (gunshot flashes)
- (Grunts)</i>

705
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:39,213
(groans)

706
00:45:46,638 --> 00:45:48,839
(grunting)

707
00:45:52,894 --> 00:45:54,979
Justice, thief.

708
00:45:55,046 --> 00:45:56,514
This time there's no escaping it.

709
00:46:01,353 --> 00:46:04,188
You're welcome.

710
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:07,741
Raise the sails. We're going home.

711
00:46:16,535 --> 00:46:18,335
Who's shooting?!

712
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:20,921
Sorry.

713
00:46:21,006 --> 00:46:22,623
Had to be done.

714
00:46:23,758 --> 00:46:25,543
There's no running now.

715
00:46:29,347 --> 00:46:32,216
<i>Logan: The Ranger's coming about.</i>

716
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:36,303
The Spaniards have got men in the rigging.

717
00:46:36,388 --> 00:46:38,806
Fire, Mr. Dufresne. Everything you've got.

718
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,524
Don't waste this moment.

719
00:46:51,987 --> 00:46:53,571
(cannon fire blasts)

720
00:46:56,992 --> 00:46:59,994
All cannons, open fire!

721
00:47:00,078 --> 00:47:02,079
<i>Open fire!</i>

722
00:47:10,972 --> 00:47:13,424
(cheering)

723
00:47:14,593 --> 00:47:17,144
(shouting) Reload!

724
00:47:19,764 --> 00:47:22,650
Gunner: Ready with this cannon!

725
00:47:22,734 --> 00:47:23,934
Fire!

726
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:26,103
<i>The Ranger's opened fire!</i>

727
00:47:26,154 --> 00:47:27,171
Again!

728
00:47:37,866 --> 00:47:39,917
<i>Fire!</i>

729
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:47,207
She's coming about!

730
00:47:49,878 --> 00:47:51,128
Fire!

731
00:48:00,171 --> 00:48:02,273
Fire!

732
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,810
<i>Below!</i>

733
00:48:10,848 --> 00:48:13,817
<i>To your stations!</i>

734
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,244
(cannon fire roars)

735
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:36,890
(screams)

736
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:43,347
(screams)

737
00:48:45,066 --> 00:48:46,517
Set sail!

738
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:56,360
(men shouting, screaming)

739
00:49:03,034 --> 00:49:04,368
(screams)

740
00:49:07,505 --> 00:49:09,873
Doctor! Doctor!

741
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:21,301
(screams)

742
00:49:29,894 --> 00:49:31,945
<i>(screams fade)</i>

743
00:49:49,714 --> 00:49:52,833
- (men screaming)
- (Gasps)

744
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:30,788
<i>Max: No-man's-land.</i>

745
00:50:32,624 --> 00:50:35,092
There was a time when stopping
halfway across this bridge

746
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,877
would have been unthinkable to you.

747
00:50:36,962 --> 00:50:39,496
How things change.

748
00:50:39,548 --> 00:50:40,715
I can see that.

749
00:50:45,637 --> 00:50:48,005
Max, I know we haven't spoken,

750
00:50:48,056 --> 00:50:49,640
but I just want you to
know how sorry I am...

751
00:50:49,691 --> 00:50:51,475
Don't.

752
00:50:53,445 --> 00:50:56,513
You have nothing to be sorry about.

753
00:50:56,565 --> 00:50:59,700
I was standing between you
and your dreams for this place.

754
00:50:59,785 --> 00:51:01,319
You did what you had to do.

755
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,405
I thought you said this
place was just sand.

756
00:51:04,489 --> 00:51:06,624
Sand has its virtues.

757
00:51:06,691 --> 00:51:08,359
On sand, nothing is fixed.

758
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:10,328
Nothing is permanent.

759
00:51:10,379 --> 00:51:12,363
And fates change so quickly.

760
00:51:12,414 --> 00:51:15,716
Yesterday Captain Hornigold
was immovable from that fort

761
00:51:15,801 --> 00:51:18,970
and Captain Vane was a beggar.

762
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:20,554
Now look at them today.

763
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,225
<i>Yesterday I was a whore
of little consequence,</i>

764
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:26,210
easily dismissed,

765
00:51:26,261 --> 00:51:28,145
easily forgotten.

766
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,264
<i>Today I am a madam</i>

767
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:33,050
with an income and allies

768
00:51:33,101 --> 00:51:37,655
<i>and a woman who has learned
the most important of lessons.</i>

769
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:41,192
Never let anyone stand in
between you and your ambitions.

770
00:51:42,911 --> 00:51:44,996
Thank you for teaching it to me.

771
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:49,367
Ma'am, they're ready.

772
00:51:51,203 --> 00:51:54,705
Congratulations on the launch
of your endeavor, by the way.

773
00:51:54,756 --> 00:51:58,042
Today you have everything
you have ever wanted.

774
00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:03,047
I suppose we can only guess
what tomorrow will bring.

775
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:12,950
(coughing)

776
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,768
They think it'll be a while
before she sails again.

777
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:35,506
<i>In the meantime, you
and I have been charged</i>

778
00:53:35,557 --> 00:53:38,442
<i>with provoking this whole mess.</i>

779
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:49,820
Why am I still alive?

780
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:53,157
Why didn't you kill me?

781
00:53:58,797 --> 00:53:59,914
Get him up.

782
00:54:12,394 --> 00:54:14,228
(groans)

783
00:54:27,242 --> 00:54:31,111
Told you I was certain about my
information regarding the Urca.

784
00:54:31,196 --> 00:54:33,781
Unfortunately, you and I failed
to take into account the weather.

785
00:54:51,633 --> 00:54:54,351
The Urca de Lima wrecked at sea last night.

786
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:56,020
Dashed by the storm.

787
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:45,236
