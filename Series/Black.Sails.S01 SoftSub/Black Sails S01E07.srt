00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:14,483
<i>Flint: Somewhere under there is our thief.</i>

2
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:15,478
Where's the page?

3
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:17,364
Your schedule is up here.

4
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:19,916
You want to kill Hamund? Then
you have to kill them all.

5
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:21,835
<i>- Ah!
- Rackham: When you and Miss Guthrie</i>

6
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:23,337
were plotting this little coup,

7
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:24,838
<i>the two of you come up with some idea</i>

8
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:26,456
<i>how to deal with the
captain when he returns?</i>

9
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,408
<i>Bonny: You don't know
where he's gone, do you?</i>

10
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:30,210
Eleanor: You could be strong again.

11
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:32,579
You could take this whole island from me.

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,465
You know exactly what it is you need to do,

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,550
<i>where it is you need to go to do it.</i>

14
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:40,053
I certainly didn't expect
to find you down in the hold,

15
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:43,023
<i>not after you betrayed Miss
Guthrie on behalf of her father.</i>

16
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,025
Found in Bryson's cabin.
It's from the Barlow woman.

17
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:47,060
<i>She wants a pardon for Flint in Boston.</i>

18
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:49,396
<i>She says we're going to kill him
when we learn of his betrayal.</i>

19
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:51,481
<i>Gates: The Scarborough!</i>

20
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,266
<i>Flint: Man overboard!</i>

21
00:00:53,317 --> 00:00:56,403
- It's Billy! He fell!
- We can't turn back.

22
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:04,044
<i>(theme music playing)</i>

23
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:37,797
<i>- (wind blowing)
- (Birds calling)</i>

24
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:43,977
<i>Lambrick: Easter is upon us...</i>

25
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:47,848
an opportunity for renewal and rebirth...

26
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,270
both in spirit and the flesh.

27
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:55,856
And yet we may also ask ourselves,

28
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:59,776
"When the spirit is renewed
and the body resurrected,

29
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,195
what becomes of the sin?"

30
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:06,333
Will not a trace of it linger

31
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,586
to mock and torment us,

32
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,339
to remind us of the roiling pit of despair

33
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:15,292
that awaits the unrepentant
beyond this life?

34
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:18,762
And yet does it not often feel
as if life itself is the pit?

35
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:20,597
Yah!

36
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:36,196
Ma'am!

37
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:38,949
<i>Captain Flint's returned.</i>

38
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:42,786
<i>Eleanor: Captain.</i>

39
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:47,040
<i>Captain.</i>

40
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,793
<i>Captain!</i>

41
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:53,713
Sorry, you were asking
about the Scarborough?

42
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:56,333
I was, specifically how the
hell did she find you out there?

43
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:59,285
A trap laid by your father,

44
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:02,138
for which he will be answering
as soon as I'm finished here.

45
00:04:03,457 --> 00:04:05,792
He won't be the only one, I assume.

46
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:09,646
<i>Your friend Mrs. Barlow
understood she was responsible</i>

47
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,348
for keeping him under lock and key.

48
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:13,149
You trusted her.

49
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:14,651
We trusted her and she betrayed us.

50
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:18,605
Perhaps he managed to secrete
a message past her men.

51
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:20,941
That hardly rises to the level of betrayal.

52
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:23,193
(scoffs)

53
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:27,080
Captain, yesterday morning,
my father walked into town,

54
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:28,748
stood out on the steps of the warehouse

55
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,617
<i>and proclaimed to the world
that the Guthries' business</i>

56
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:32,485
is finished here in Nassau.

57
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:34,037
What was the reaction?

58
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,990
The men elected representatives,

59
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,426
we agreed upon an agenda,

60
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:42,929
and we spoke about the merits
of mutual cooperation over tea.

61
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:45,932
So it was bad?

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,517
Bad? It was fucking chaos.

63
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:50,387
<i>- Yeah.
- Eleanor: For about an hour,</i>

64
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:52,338
<i>I thought they had
burned down all of Nassau.</i>

65
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,140
But it's been handled.

66
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:57,060
As of last night, I've
instituted a new trading system

67
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:59,646
and the street has embraced it.

68
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:02,282
A consortium with myself at its head,

69
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:05,151
Captains Naft and Lawrence
as a means of shipping,

70
00:05:05,202 --> 00:05:08,488
<i>and Mr. Frasier as its corporate seal.</i>

71
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:10,156
Hmm.

72
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:12,158
All this since yesterday?

73
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:18,548
I will address the situation
with Mrs. Barlow immediately.

74
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,300
<i>You have my word.</i>

75
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:23,303
(clears throat)

76
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,088
Captain, one more thing.

77
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:28,058
<i>The consortium wasn't founded easily.</i>

78
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,352
It required the assistance
of a few other parties.

79
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:33,513
Among them indispensably was Mr. Silver.

80
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:36,266
Is that so?

81
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,884
<i>Eleanor: I tell you this because I imagine</i>

82
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:40,320
<i>you might still hold
some resentment toward him.</i>

83
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,772
And I've given him my word
in exchange for his assistance

84
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:45,742
that I'll stand between
him and your resentment.

85
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:49,112
In other words,

86
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:51,831
if Mr. Silver doesn't return from the Urca,

87
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,501
you and I may find ourselves
with problems of our own.

88
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:00,540
What a day I missed.

89
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:08,214
Come on.

90
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:12,769
(panting)

91
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:23,096
The fuck, Jack?

92
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:25,815
It's gone limp again.

93
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,235
Really? I hadn't noticed.

94
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:33,073
Well, do you want something up your ass?

95
00:06:33,124 --> 00:06:35,208
No.

96
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:36,876
No, thank you.

97
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:41,131
(grunts)

98
00:06:43,718 --> 00:06:45,559
What the fuck is your problem?

99
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,398
I'm terribly sorry if
I've ruined your morning,

100
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:51,791
but at the moment I happen to
have quite a lot on my mind.

101
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:54,844
Ship purloined, captain
and crew a distant memory,

102
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:57,430
<i>no prospects at all,</i>

103
00:06:57,481 --> 00:06:59,315
except for this shithole of a brothel,

104
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,936
which by some miracle of economics
seems incapable of turning a profit.

105
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:06,139
How can you run a brothel
here and not make money?

106
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,575
I have no fucking idea!

107
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:12,112
Ain't you always the one telling
everyone how fucking clever you are?

108
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:16,916
Figure it out.

109
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:21,454
Don't you dare leave me here.

110
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:24,257
<i>- Don't you...
- (Door slams)</i>

111
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:27,260
<i>(distant donkey braying)</i>

112
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:40,723
Alice made you her porridge.

113
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:44,128
Thicker than snot, but it'll
help you get your strength back.

114
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:51,451
A couple of us are wondering
what you plan to do now.

115
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,570
Why would anyone care what I do?

116
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:56,189
Darling, you're all anyone's
talking about out there.

117
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,208
All of us wondering what
kind of voodoo you used

118
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:00,794
to get eight of Vane's crew to just...

119
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,361
up and disappear.

120
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:04,914
Haven't you heard?

121
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:06,883
They left for Port Royal.

122
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:09,287
Hmm, and I'm Henry fuckin' Avery.

123
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,700
If you've got any thought
of working here again,

124
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:17,010
- I wouldn't wait too long.
- What do you mean?

125
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:19,679
Mr. Rackham's got no idea
how to run this place.

126
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,314
We've all got a hand in his pocket.

127
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:22,816
<i>Mapleton would tell him,</i>

128
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:24,818
but she's too busy stealing for herself.

129
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:28,221
<i>Mapleton: Idelle! Downstairs. Customer.</i>

130
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:31,274
All I'm saying is get in
while the getting's good.

131
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:35,161
<i>(door closes)</i>

132
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:40,233
(grunts)

133
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:43,670
Jesus! The fuck did they do to you?

134
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:45,404
<i>Postelection initiation, I'm told.</i>

135
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:47,423
All done in good fun.

136
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:48,925
At least... (chuckles)

137
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,127
I think it was all done in good fun.

138
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:54,797
- Congratulations, Mr. Quartermaster.
- Thank you.

139
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,382
Unfortunate, to say the least,

140
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,184
that we find ourselves in the need of one.

141
00:08:58,252 --> 00:08:59,769
Yes, very.

142
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:02,889
But I'm humbled by the crew's faith in me.

143
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:06,001
Well, if Billy were here,

144
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:07,443
I'm sure he would agree with me

145
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:09,646
when I say that the crew chose well.

146
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,866
Well, much to do.

147
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,747
Mr. Dufresne, quartermaster.

148
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,790
Who would've seen that coming?

149
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,992
- I think he's up to it.
- I'm sure he is.

150
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:26,162
I just wouldn't have thought the crew
capable of coming to that conclusion.

151
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,781
Well, chew a man's throat out,
it tends to make an impression.

152
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:31,834
(both chuckle)

153
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,239
You'll be heading to see her now, then?

154
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:39,125
Mrs. Barlow.

155
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:40,793
You said you'd be holding her to account.

156
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:43,980
I assumed you'd not want to wait.

157
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,710
I'll be back before dark.

158
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:50,653
We'll continue preparations
for our departure then.

159
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:02,315
<i>Gates: Just one more thing, Captain,</i>

160
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:05,318
before you leave to see Mrs. Barlow.

161
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:08,788
I think you and I need to discuss
the letter that Billy found...

162
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:12,508
and why exactly it is that she believes

163
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:14,510
you're gonna betray your crew.

164
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:24,437
- (grunts)
- Hey, get back.

165
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:26,172
Jesus, Randall.

166
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:27,357
(panting)

167
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:29,309
De Groot: Mate.

168
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:35,148
Randall would like a word with you.

169
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,533
- Council just voted. He's out.
- Out?

170
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:39,902
<i>De Groot: I suppose it's my fault.</i>

171
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:42,507
I raised the concern about the fire hazard

172
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:45,124
a one-legged man in the
galley might present.

173
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:47,410
And like most things before the council,

174
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:48,911
it spun out of control.

175
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,197
What's that got to do with me?

176
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:53,532
He's got a raw deal, Mr. Silver.

177
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:56,552
The least we can do is
let him say his piece.

178
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,590
<i>(Silver sighs)</i>

179
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:02,392
Randall.

180
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:05,561
It's not fair. I can cook.

181
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:09,232
Yes, I think you might have mentioned that.

182
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:12,218
You know, it's been my experience

183
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:16,406
setbacks such as these,
they often go hand in hand

184
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,108
<i>with new and unexpected opportunities.</i>

185
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:20,443
He's a thief.

186
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:26,399
What are you talking about, Randall?

187
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,703
He thought I was asleep
at Miss Guthrie's tavern.

188
00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:33,423
<i>I heard him talking.</i>

189
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:36,876
Wasn't Singleton stole
the page, it was him.

190
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:43,633
I don't know what he's talking about.

191
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:47,470
Randall, are you being truthful?

192
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:50,440
He said he has the schedule in his head,

193
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:53,609
that he learned it to stop
Flint from murdering him.

194
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:56,729
All due respect, but he
spent the last two days

195
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,198
beneath a rather heavy cloud of opiates.

196
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:02,618
- He doesn't know what he heard.
- Get the quartermaster in here.

197
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:05,455
Right now.

198
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:14,280
Bear with me.

199
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:16,416
<i>One minute, please.</i>

200
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:19,669
Uh, apologies.

201
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:21,914
(snaps fingers) Give me it.

202
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:30,146
Ah! Here it is.

203
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:34,267
It is with great pleasure
that we shall now commence

204
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:38,488
our inaugural meeting of the Guthrie
Frasier Naft Lawrence Consortium

205
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:40,189
for the Purposes of Shipping and Trade

206
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:42,942
in the West Indies, Excelsior.

207
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:51,701
Reginald, add to the agenda
discussion of a shorter name.

208
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:54,120
Jesus.

209
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:56,873
First item of business...

210
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:58,958
our maiden voyage.

211
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,094
Captain Lawrence,

212
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:04,630
the status of the Black Hind, please.

213
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:07,266
(clears throat)

214
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:10,836
We've begun alterations
to expand our holds.

215
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:13,005
<i>- But as I predicted...
- O'Malley: Ma'am.</i>

216
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,724
A good number of the crew have defected

217
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:17,477
upon learning of their new vocation.

218
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,149
Any suggestions for a new source of
labor would certainly be welcomed.

219
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,683
What happened to you?

220
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:27,520
I told him to get the fuck
out, but he wouldn't go.

221
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:28,988
He who?

222
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:46,782
<i>Eleanor: Quite the story I heard out there</i>

223
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:48,674
<i>from the Walrus' men.</i>

224
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,203
They say you rallied the slaves

225
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:53,729
in the Andromache's hold,

226
00:13:53,814 --> 00:13:56,766
single-handedly turned
the tides against Bryson.

227
00:13:57,621 --> 00:14:00,862
Imagine what they'd say if
they knew that you're the reason

228
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:02,888
that they had to chase that
ship in the first place.

229
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,075
- I would like the chance to explain myself.
- I'm listening.

230
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:12,999
What I did, I did out of love.

231
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,617
(scoffs)

232
00:14:14,676 --> 00:14:17,596
And with every intention of staying
here with you to help you find a safer,

233
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:20,373
more settled life, a life you deserve.

234
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,460
It was not a betrayal.

235
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:25,628
It was...

236
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:27,746
It was not your decision to make.

237
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,915
My life is my own.

238
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:32,927
It's not Benjamin Hornigold's,
it's not Charles Vane's,

239
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:35,388
it's not my father's and it's not yours.

240
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:38,140
Do you understand?

241
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:42,061
You're right. I'm sorry.

242
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:44,947
And what?

243
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:47,066
Now you think you can
just waltz back in here

244
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:50,397
and pick up from where we
left off like nothing happened?

245
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:55,291
Where else would I go?

246
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:58,294
I belong to you.

247
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:02,248
Chattel property of the Guthrie estate.

248
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:09,589
You... you know I've
never seen you that way.

249
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:16,262
<i>Eleanor, I must ask a favor of you.</i>

250
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:27,273
<i>(bird screeching)</i>

251
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:30,276
<i>(distant chopping)</i>

252
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,837
He's waiting.

253
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:42,848
Sit.

254
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,025
You wish to do business?

255
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:58,114
There's a place...

256
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:02,418
there's a place not far from here.

257
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:05,504
A place fueled by plunder.

258
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:07,206
A place of great wealth

259
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:10,126
run by its crews and flying no flag.

260
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,911
I know of Nassau.

261
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:15,914
What of it?

262
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:17,416
She's weak,

263
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:20,419
<i>so she's ripe for the taking.</i>

264
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,856
A man with enough strength
could get his hands

265
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:26,425
wrapped around her throat
in a matter of hours,

266
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:30,229
control the flow of trade, get rich.

267
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:34,099
My men are rich.

268
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:37,903
Wood sells well and we don't
rely on the mercy of the sea.

269
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:43,626
No man is rich who could
have a lot more by doing less.

270
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,295
(flies buzzing)

271
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:51,333
When you sailed as captain of these men,

272
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,552
they sacked Campeche for you.

273
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,722
They sacked Cartagena for you.

274
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,557
Give me a dozen of them

275
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,394
and I will bring Nassau in line.

276
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:05,264
What's your name?

277
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:10,603
Charles Vane.

278
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:15,574
I know that name.

279
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:19,528
<i>These are my men.</i>

280
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:22,981
<i>Why would I let any of
them call you captain?</i>

281
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,983
Each man gets a share,

282
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:28,987
plus one share to you in
tribute for every six men.

283
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,924
That's a sizeable piece
of a fucking fortune.

284
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:34,126
And all you need do is
give them your leave.

285
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:43,686
How did you know to seek me out?

286
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:48,808
<i>Is my name spoken as far as Nassau?</i>

287
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:54,146
Is there someone there that connects us?

288
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:59,318
<i>Or is it something else?</i>

289
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:03,706
The fuck do you care?

290
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:10,412
Do we have a deal or don't we?

291
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:18,671
Three men.

292
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:24,560
My tribute... a share for every three men.

293
00:19:24,644 --> 00:19:26,061
Four shares in all.

294
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:30,516
Yes or no?

295
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,621
You're not answering the question.

296
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:39,108
I'm trying to answer the question.

297
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:40,860
So you're saying she's lying?

298
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:42,528
That the letter is just a fiction?

299
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:45,948
I'm saying that my relationship
with her is a complex one...

300
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,452
that it's hard for me
to understand at times.

301
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:53,455
But what is clear is that she
desperately wants to leave this place

302
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,575
and will say anything in
order to make me go with her.

303
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,711
Oh, for fuck's sake, enough.

304
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:02,131
This is what we do.

305
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:06,018
You orate and you dissemble,
and I look the other way,

306
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:08,888
convince myself that supporting you

307
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:10,856
is in everybody's interests.

308
00:20:10,924 --> 00:20:13,559
But not today.

309
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,227
Not after what happened last night.

310
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:17,358
After what happened last night?

311
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:19,949
What happened to Billy, Captain?

312
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:24,203
He fell.

313
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,630
Why? What are you saying happened?

314
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,768
He thought you saw us all as expendable.

315
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:33,579
- Expendable?
- Pawns to be used for your own ends.

316
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,550
I have fought and bled alongside my men.

317
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:41,787
I have sacrificed more than you
could possibly know for their futures.

318
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:46,258
I know what happened on the Maria Aleyne.

319
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:47,760
You told me the man you killed

320
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,812
was reaching for a weapon.

321
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:51,814
You told me it was self-defense,

322
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:54,900
but there were no weapons in that cabin.

323
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,903
I went and I looked.

324
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:02,241
And I still kept my mouth shut.

325
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:04,142
I don't know why,

326
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:08,414
but I know you used the crew
to assassinate those people.

327
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:10,666
Men died that day.

328
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,251
Our men.

329
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:14,169
And I suspect there's been other times

330
00:21:14,254 --> 00:21:16,255
when we've been expendable to you.

331
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:19,508
And if yesterday was one of those days,

332
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:22,044
then you and I have a problem,

333
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:25,848
because Billy wasn't expendable

334
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:27,800
to me.

335
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:32,805
He was a son to me.

336
00:21:34,364 --> 00:21:36,284
Then perhaps you should have acted

337
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:38,844
like a better father towards him.

338
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,896
What the fuck did you just say?

339
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:43,315
You let his suspicions run rampant.

340
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:46,902
You let his paranoia
fester to the point at which

341
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:49,989
when he should have been focused
on the Scarborough's guns,

342
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,209
he was focused on hurling
unfounded accusations at me.

343
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:56,295
So I'm to blame for what happened to Billy?

344
00:21:56,362 --> 00:21:57,796
Perhaps if you had intervened

345
00:21:57,864 --> 00:21:59,965
when he first came to
you with these fantasies,

346
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,468
perhaps if you helped him understand

347
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:04,736
the world in which he lived...

348
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:08,667
he'd still be here right now.

349
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:16,849
Where are you going?

350
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:20,686
I'm tired of this.

351
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:26,942
I'm tired of the energy
it takes to believe you.

352
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:31,030
To believe in you.

353
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:37,536
I'm taking this to the crew.
You're their problem now.

354
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:41,206
I'm taking it.

355
00:22:45,261 --> 00:22:48,097
After the Urca has been secured

356
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,966
and the money warehoused
before distribution...

357
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:56,722
I intend to sequester a portion of it.

358
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:58,891
- Sequester?
- A portion of it.

359
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:04,005
Every man on that crew will still be richer

360
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,315
than their wildest dreams.

361
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,200
But you know as well as I do

362
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:10,202
that no matter how much
money they're given,

363
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:12,788
they will drink, whore and piss it away.

364
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:15,374
Now, they have a chance at
something better than that,

365
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:18,460
but it isn't gonna happen
unless somebody makes it happen.

366
00:23:18,545 --> 00:23:19,611
You're lying to them.

367
00:23:19,662 --> 00:23:21,830
And if I don't, who will?

368
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:25,634
Everyone's lied to for their own good...

369
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,920
every mother who tells their child

370
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,255
that everything will be all right,

371
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:32,307
every soldier who's told by his commander

372
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:33,892
that courage will see them through,

373
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,511
every subject who's told by...

374
00:23:35,595 --> 00:23:37,062
His king?

375
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:42,735
Is that what you are to us now?

376
00:23:42,802 --> 00:23:46,739
A sovereign levying a tax?

377
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:52,644
If no one knows, everyone wins.

378
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:55,247
<i>- Don't play games with me.
- I'm quite serious.</i>

379
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:57,533
Who loses?

380
00:23:57,617 --> 00:23:59,118
Absent their worst instincts,

381
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:01,370
their pride, their greed, their suspicion,

382
00:24:01,454 --> 00:24:04,623
in the light of pure reason,

383
00:24:04,674 --> 00:24:07,760
who says no to this?

384
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:10,662
They'll be rich men in a safe place

385
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:14,216
rather than dead thieves on a long rope.

386
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,272
I'm gonna deliver them, Hal.

387
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:22,975
I'm gonna deliver them
into something better.

388
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:32,367
<i>I will sail with you
tomorrow to take this prize.</i>

389
00:24:32,452 --> 00:24:35,537
I'll follow your lead in battle.

390
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:38,824
And I'll take your orders as consort.

391
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,909
But when it's done,

392
00:24:40,994 --> 00:24:44,296
you and I will quietly
go our separate ways.

393
00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:48,801
And I'll thank you not to protest.

394
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:05,601
No one else knows about this?

395
00:25:05,685 --> 00:25:08,237
Look, as far as I can tell,
it's just the three of us.

396
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:10,322
<i>Then again, this is
Randall we're talking about.</i>

397
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:13,826
If he had told anyone
else, we'd have heard.

398
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:16,445
Does it make any sense to you?

399
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:19,231
Well, Flint finding that page on Singleton

400
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:22,034
does seem awfully convenient in hindsight.

401
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:25,003
Jesus.

402
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:28,173
A fine mess here, Randall.

403
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:30,001
<i>Randall: You're a thief.</i>

404
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:32,127
(sighs) Quite sure you're wrong.

405
00:25:32,212 --> 00:25:34,930
But the good news is it's not
too late to repair the damage.

406
00:25:35,014 --> 00:25:37,299
I know what I heard.

407
00:25:37,383 --> 00:25:38,884
Randall, you were doped.

408
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:40,719
<i>You have no idea what you heard.</i>

409
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:48,927
Say you're successful in
convincing our friends out there

410
00:25:48,978 --> 00:25:51,230
to believe your story.

411
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:55,100
I'm not sure you've given proper
consideration to what happens next.

412
00:25:55,151 --> 00:25:57,769
Do you think they'd just haul
me up in front of the crew,

413
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,789
air your story, and that's the end of it?

414
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:02,741
No, Randall.

415
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:06,044
I think you've forgotten
one very important detail.

416
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:07,796
The money.

417
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:10,415
That has to be considered, does it not?

418
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:13,085
If we go tell the crew now,
there's a very good chance

419
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:16,421
they simply hang the cook
right along with the captain.

420
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:18,456
If Randall's right,

421
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:21,176
<i>that would be the end of the Urca hunt.</i>

422
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:23,762
Are you suggesting we keep this secret?

423
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:27,182
Lie to the crew? Right along with Flint?

424
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:29,184
He's suggesting that acting hastily

425
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:31,737
could come with a very hefty price.

426
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:35,741
Even if I was convinced, there's
still Randall to contend with.

427
00:26:38,578 --> 00:26:42,018
Are you suggesting there's some
way to guarantee his silence?

428
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:44,449
I can think of one way.

429
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,337
- They wouldn't.
- Wouldn't they?

430
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:52,174
A one-legged halfwit versus
a chance at a fortune?

431
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:55,127
The odds are decidedly not in your favor.

432
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:58,663
Well, you were confused or delirious.

433
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:01,666
Take your pick, but tell them now.

434
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:03,769
Then even if they wanted to go to the crew,

435
00:27:03,836 --> 00:27:05,887
they'd have lost their chief witness.

436
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:08,056
And no one has to die.

437
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:16,514
- You're a thief.
- I'm a thief. Right.

438
00:27:16,566 --> 00:27:19,484
Well, good luck, Randall.

439
00:27:19,535 --> 00:27:22,487
<i>It was nice knowing you.</i>

440
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:26,375
<i>Albinus: For as long as you sail with him,</i>

441
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:29,244
<i>his orders are my orders.</i>

442
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:32,464
And when your work is done,
this place will have you back.

443
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,968
They'll serve you well.

444
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:50,015
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

445
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:08,083
You were one of ours.

446
00:28:10,203 --> 00:28:12,587
You were just a boy yourself.

447
00:28:18,928 --> 00:28:21,680
Could not have been easy coming back here.

448
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,883
Must have taken great strength.

449
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:28,687
<i>Go on.</i>

450
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:30,522
Take these men.

451
00:28:31,691 --> 00:28:34,192
Make me rich.

452
00:28:53,162 --> 00:28:57,215
You don't know me, but you once did...

453
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:00,836
when I was the lowest among you.

454
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:06,341
Now I've returned.

455
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:10,011
And I offer you a chance
to be free of this place.

456
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:13,815
I'm Charles Vane.

457
00:29:15,968 --> 00:29:19,488
And you were a strong crew once,

458
00:29:19,572 --> 00:29:21,356
<i>proper pirates.</i>

459
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:23,641
Feared, as you should have been,

460
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:26,361
before he dragged you away from the sea,

461
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:30,499
<i>before he convinced you
to live here like animals.</i>

462
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:33,285
Because it suits his weaknesses.

463
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:34,920
<i>There is a place not far from here</i>

464
00:29:34,987 --> 00:29:39,624
where strong men live lives
of pleasure, not labor,

465
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:41,293
a place where you

466
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:44,996
<i>could be feared and respected once again.</i>

467
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:48,967
Follow me, and I will
show you what life is.

468
00:30:17,046 --> 00:30:18,997
(panting)

469
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:22,467
Are you done? Are you done?

470
00:30:25,304 --> 00:30:26,505
Oh!

471
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:37,232
(grunts)

472
00:30:47,326 --> 00:30:48,276
(groans)

473
00:31:03,092 --> 00:31:05,043
I'm proud of you.

474
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:22,227
Randall.

475
00:31:24,363 --> 00:31:27,699
I need a word with Mr. Silver alone.

476
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:35,657
- (laughs)
- What's so funny?

477
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:38,243
Just that I warned Randall
something like this was coming.

478
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:39,961
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

479
00:31:40,046 --> 00:31:44,082
Mr. De Groot's inclined to
hand you over to the crew.

480
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:46,134
He's given me exactly five minutes,

481
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:49,721
at which point he intends to call
council so Randall can share his story,

482
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:52,140
after which our hands are clean

483
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:56,678
and you are most likely, well, dead.

484
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:01,600
What's that?

485
00:32:01,651 --> 00:32:03,518
A page from one of Dr. Howell's manuals

486
00:32:03,603 --> 00:32:06,238
and your last chance at living
to see the sun rise again.

487
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:10,825
You have exactly five minutes
to commit it to memory,

488
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:14,029
after which you will reproduce this
page to the best of your ability.

489
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:16,331
If you can do so to Mr.
De Groot's satisfaction,

490
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:20,151
then maybe... just
maybe he can be convinced

491
00:32:20,202 --> 00:32:23,121
to keep your secret for
the sake of the Urca haul.

492
00:32:23,172 --> 00:32:25,123
- It's a test?
- Exactly.

493
00:32:25,174 --> 00:32:27,626
- It's a terrible test.
- Believe me, I'm aware.

494
00:32:28,805 --> 00:32:31,805
If I was the thief, which
I am by no means admitting,

495
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,848
I could have read that
schedule a hundred times over

496
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:35,600
before I was forced to destroy it.

497
00:32:35,668 --> 00:32:37,602
Whether or not I can memorize this page

498
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,170
in five minutes proves nothing.

499
00:32:39,221 --> 00:32:42,440
Mr. De Groot doesn't
believe that he can trust

500
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:44,342
the information inside your head,

501
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:46,177
certainly not enough to risk his own life,

502
00:32:46,228 --> 00:32:50,315
not to mention committing
poor Randall to an early grave.

503
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:54,703
He says if he's to go down
that road, he needs certainty.

504
00:32:54,787 --> 00:32:56,655
It's the best I could do.

505
00:32:58,541 --> 00:32:59,624
Four minutes.

506
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,964
(sighs)

507
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,135
<i>(rooster crows)</i>

508
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:12,003
Wait.

509
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:17,478
Compliments of the new consortium.

510
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:22,180
A dead cargo is a worthless cargo.

511
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:26,551
<i>Eme: Did you ask her?</i>

512
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:29,904
I implored Miss Guthrie
to facilitate your release.

513
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:33,191
I told her she would not have her guns
without yours and the others' help.

514
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:34,826
What did she say?

515
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:40,198
She said she would take
it under advisement.

516
00:33:40,249 --> 00:33:42,033
(sighs)

517
00:33:43,502 --> 00:33:46,705
I warned you this place
would not be any different.

518
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:52,844
But do not give up hope.

519
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:03,388
I'll need to know your secret.

520
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:07,192
To putting up with her.

521
00:34:09,228 --> 00:34:12,030
My decision whether or not
to partake in this consortium

522
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:13,782
was predicated on her agreement

523
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:16,901
to lift the ban on Charles Vane's crew.

524
00:34:16,952 --> 00:34:19,771
I understand she did.

525
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:21,706
Begrudgingly.

526
00:34:21,774 --> 00:34:25,943
And shortly after, all eight disappeared.

527
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:28,380
Left for Port Royal, I am told.

528
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:31,216
And you think Eleanor had
something to do with this?

529
00:34:31,283 --> 00:34:32,717
It doesn't matter either way.

530
00:34:32,785 --> 00:34:35,303
Short of my retrieving eight
corpses from her armoire,

531
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:37,222
nothing would dissuade the other captains

532
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:40,392
from the course that she's set now.

533
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:43,728
Which I'd wager she knew would be the case.

534
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:46,097
I'd wager you're right.

535
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:48,650
I asked you once to get her under control.

536
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:53,571
The truth is there is no
controlling her, is there?

537
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:01,279
You forced her hand in front of men

538
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,248
whose respect she demands

539
00:35:03,315 --> 00:35:06,785
in order to run this business.

540
00:35:06,836 --> 00:35:09,037
Really, Captain,

541
00:35:09,121 --> 00:35:11,039
what choice did you give her?

542
00:35:18,514 --> 00:35:20,515
<i>(hoofbeats approaching)</i>

543
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,967
<i>- (dog barking)
- (Horse neighs)</i>

544
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:33,728
Miranda: Mr. Guthrie isn't here.

545
00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:40,485
<i>He's taken sanctuary on
Mr. Underhill's estate.</i>

546
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:51,119
Do you know what you've done?

547
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:55,467
<i>What madness possessed
you to write that letter?</i>

548
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:57,034
I tried to tell you.

549
00:35:57,086 --> 00:36:00,004
Billy found it.

550
00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:02,390
If he'd have shown anyone
before I discovered him,

551
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:05,009
but for dumb luck,

552
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,511
I'd be dead.

553
00:36:06,562 --> 00:36:08,096
I'm sorry.

554
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,883
You know I would never intentionally
put you in any kind of danger.

555
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:13,902
What was your intent?

556
00:36:13,986 --> 00:36:16,271
What was it?

557
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:20,057
To destroy everything we've tried
to build here for the past 10 years?

558
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:22,327
Or was it just to embarrass me?

559
00:36:22,394 --> 00:36:24,913
To show you a way out
of all this, to free you.

560
00:36:24,997 --> 00:36:26,564
A way out?

561
00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:29,417
Have you no memory of how we got here?

562
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:31,452
What they took from us?

563
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:36,674
What does it matter now?

564
00:36:36,742 --> 00:36:39,460
What does it matter?

565
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:41,629
What does it matter what happened then

566
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:43,915
if we have no life now?

567
00:36:43,966 --> 00:36:45,550
Because there is no life here.

568
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:47,585
There is no joy here.
There is no love here.

569
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:50,722
- There's no love here.
- What are you talking about?!

570
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:53,224
What do you think I'm
out there fighting for

571
00:36:53,275 --> 00:36:56,027
if not to make all those
things possible here?

572
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:58,112
You'll fight a war so we can make a life?

573
00:36:58,197 --> 00:37:00,097
You don't get one without
the other, my sweet.

574
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:03,151
No. You're wrong.

575
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,956
I sent that letter to
show you that you're wrong.

576
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:12,160
There is a life in Boston.

577
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:16,447
There is joy there and music

578
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,333
and peace.

579
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:20,802
The door is open.

580
00:37:20,886 --> 00:37:22,453
I've opened it for you.

581
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:26,174
And it requires no war and
no blood and no sacrifice.

582
00:37:26,258 --> 00:37:28,259
It requires an intolerable sacrifice.

583
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,094
To accept a pardon?

584
00:37:30,145 --> 00:37:32,263
To apologize.

585
00:37:32,314 --> 00:37:34,599
Apologize? Who will you be apologizing to?

586
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,150
To England!

587
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:42,273
They took everything from us.

588
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:46,477
And then they called me a monster.

589
00:37:46,528 --> 00:37:48,488
The moment I sign that pardon,

590
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:51,148
the moment I ask for one,

591
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,252
I proclaim to the world
that they were right.

592
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:57,038
This ends

593
00:37:57,122 --> 00:38:00,792
when I grant them my forgiveness...

594
00:38:02,094 --> 00:38:03,795
not the other way around.

595
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:07,265
This path you're on...

596
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,969
it doesn't lead where you think it does.

597
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:16,641
If he were here, he'd agree with me.

598
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:31,406
Three days with the Urca's schedule,

599
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,409
three minutes with
whatever the fuck this is.

600
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:37,161
I'll remind them.

601
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:40,164
Before you go, just one question.

602
00:38:40,215 --> 00:38:42,417
Harebrained as this test was,

603
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:43,918
you had to be quite certain

604
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:46,170
I was the thief to even think of it.

605
00:38:46,221 --> 00:38:48,756
And I don't believe you
have near that kind of faith

606
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:51,175
in our friend Randall here.

607
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:54,178
Who told you about me?

608
00:38:54,229 --> 00:38:55,930
Billy?

609
00:39:01,654 --> 00:39:03,895
Randall, we need to talk.

610
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:06,991
- You're a thief.
- Randall, pay attention.

611
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:09,577
Right now at this moment,
it is just as likely

612
00:39:09,662 --> 00:39:12,413
you're the one that dies as I am.

613
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:15,616
What if there was a way
neither of us had to die today?

614
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:19,954
I go to the crew and I
offer to be your caretaker.

615
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,789
I'll promise to look
after you day and night

616
00:39:21,874 --> 00:39:24,175
and give my personal guarantee
should anything happen,

617
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:26,010
it comes out of my share.

618
00:39:26,078 --> 00:39:28,763
I think I could persuade
the crew to accept that.

619
00:39:28,847 --> 00:39:30,465
And then you're back on the ship.

620
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:34,719
All you have to do is change your story.

621
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:37,472
You're a thief.

622
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:39,837
Are you fucking kidding me?!

623
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:42,643
(sighs) All right.

624
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:46,197
Yes, I'm a thief.

625
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:49,033
I took the page and I shouldn't have.

626
00:39:49,101 --> 00:39:51,069
I should have counted my blessings

627
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,121
to be let off that merchant ship.

628
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:54,622
But what can I say, Randall?

629
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:57,959
I'm not a joiner. I never have been.

630
00:39:58,043 --> 00:40:01,295
But I'm willing to do it now.

631
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,797
So pull your head from your ass

632
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:05,416
and let's both live to fight another day.

633
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:09,170
<i>Dufresne: Sorry, Mr. Silver.</i>

634
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:19,564
- You're a thief.
- Yes, we understand.

635
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:24,435
Randall?

636
00:40:24,486 --> 00:40:26,938
You're a thief.

637
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,524
Randall, what's gotten into you?

638
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:33,027
You're a thief.

639
00:40:33,112 --> 00:40:35,913
What the hell is going on here?

640
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:38,149
It would appear Mr. Randall

641
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,035
has reconsidered his position.

642
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,422
If you intend to accuse
Mr. Silver before the crew,

643
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:46,207
you do so without a witness.

644
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:53,848
<i>(knocks)</i>

645
00:40:53,932 --> 00:40:55,967
<i>(door opens)</i>

646
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,990
Give us the room, please.

647
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:09,147
As you can imagine,
money is tight right now.

648
00:41:09,198 --> 00:41:12,200
The Walrus crew are unwilling
to manumit a hold full of slaves,

649
00:41:12,284 --> 00:41:15,284
nor do I have the funds to
purchase their release outright.

650
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:20,208
<i>So here's what I've done.</i>

651
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:22,526
The able-bodied males will be taken

652
00:41:22,578 --> 00:41:24,528
onto the Black Hind under Captain Lawrence

653
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,464
to fill a recent rash of desertions.

654
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:28,692
The consortium has reached an agreement

655
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,201
with Mr. Dufresne of the Walrus

656
00:41:30,252 --> 00:41:33,212
to trade future subsidies
and credits to cover the cost.

657
00:41:35,808 --> 00:41:38,375
Six women remain thereafter,

658
00:41:38,427 --> 00:41:40,061
for whom I was able to scrounge together

659
00:41:40,145 --> 00:41:42,930
<i>enough money to cover their cost.</i>

660
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:45,733
They'll be offered a wage in my employ.

661
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,687
Thank you.

662
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:52,740
- As for us...
- Eleanor, I...

663
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:54,742
I know how much you worry about me.

664
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:56,777
But I hope the events of the last few days

665
00:41:56,862 --> 00:41:59,262
prove that I can handle myself.

666
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:02,750
It does.

667
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:05,119
I'm not blind to Flint.

668
00:42:05,204 --> 00:42:07,955
I know he keeps things from me.

669
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,841
But there's no reason
for you to feel threatened

670
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:11,759
by my partnership with him.

671
00:42:11,844 --> 00:42:13,928
<i>If you're to stay with me, I
need to know that I can trust you.</i>

672
00:42:14,012 --> 00:42:16,931
Eleanor, Captain Hornigold has extended me

673
00:42:17,015 --> 00:42:18,633
an offer to join his crew.

674
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:25,523
And you've accepted?

675
00:42:29,611 --> 00:42:32,530
If you need me, I will be here for you.

676
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:39,287
But as long as you insist on pursuing
this course with Captain Flint,

677
00:42:39,371 --> 00:42:42,490
<i>I will always be tempted to interfere.</i>

678
00:42:42,574 --> 00:42:44,492
Please get out.

679
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:56,453
(moaning)

680
00:42:56,505 --> 00:42:58,756
I'm sorry, but the income you've
reported for the past two days

681
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:00,675
is simply too low to be believed.

682
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:03,978
I'm going to have to ask you to vacate
your room, make way for someone else.

683
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:07,398
Oh, yes, yes.

684
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:08,733
Here it comes.

685
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,601
(crying)

686
00:43:12,137 --> 00:43:13,971
Ugh.

687
00:43:14,022 --> 00:43:17,308
I'll have you know I have slit
men's throats while they have wept,

688
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,828
begging my forbearance, and
slept soundly that very night.

689
00:43:20,913 --> 00:43:24,282
If you were hoping to manipulate me,
you are barking up the wrong tree.

690
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,034
(crying continues)

691
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,453
The wrong tree.

692
00:43:31,924 --> 00:43:33,341
Jesus Christ.

693
00:43:33,425 --> 00:43:34,842
<i>- Alice: Mr. Rackham.
- What?</i>

694
00:43:34,927 --> 00:43:36,728
<i>- Five pieces.
- (Coins clink)</i>

695
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,164
Oh, look who's up and about.

696
00:43:40,215 --> 00:43:41,966
Who did you just service?

697
00:43:43,018 --> 00:43:44,018
What's that?

698
00:43:44,102 --> 00:43:47,021
Who paid you those coins?

699
00:43:47,105 --> 00:43:49,840
It was Captain Hallindale I saw
leaving your room, was it not?

700
00:43:49,891 --> 00:43:52,843
A man whose sole desire
is to be swaddled in canvas

701
00:43:52,894 --> 00:43:55,529
while he sucks on a fat, milkless breast

702
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:57,531
like a nursing child.

703
00:43:57,616 --> 00:43:59,450
And the price we have
always charged for mothering

704
00:43:59,517 --> 00:44:02,203
is 20 pieces, not five.

705
00:44:02,287 --> 00:44:05,456
Who the fuck do you think you're accusing?

706
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:07,358
A handjob pays five.

707
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:10,378
All Captain Hallindale had
time for today was a tug.

708
00:44:11,867 --> 00:44:15,108
Will your story hold when
I ask him to confirm it?

709
00:44:15,133 --> 00:44:17,418
Or will you confess your crime now

710
00:44:17,502 --> 00:44:19,920
and pray that our new
patron is more forgiving

711
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:22,365
than Mr. Noonan would have been?

712
00:44:25,344 --> 00:44:28,763
I swear on the body and
blood of our Lord Jesus Christ

713
00:44:28,847 --> 00:44:30,381
this will never happen again.

714
00:44:30,432 --> 00:44:33,150
For your sake, it had better not.

715
00:44:39,524 --> 00:44:42,276
In my experience, if you
do not discipline a whore,

716
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:44,841
she will always take advantage.

717
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,284
Get your fucking house in order.

718
00:45:05,467 --> 00:45:07,351
Hmm?

719
00:45:37,582 --> 00:45:39,133
I thought you were going to report back

720
00:45:39,217 --> 00:45:41,502
once you returned from Mrs. Barlow's.

721
00:45:49,761 --> 00:45:51,846
Do you really think it's wise to get pissed

722
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,598
in full view of any of your
men that may stumble in here

723
00:45:54,649 --> 00:45:56,233
just before they're about to embark

724
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:58,701
on the most dangerous
journey of their lives?

725
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:03,741
Wise?

726
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:06,277
Probably not.

727
00:46:07,529 --> 00:46:10,647
But then there was 36 hours before castoff,

728
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:12,816
so I thought

729
00:46:12,868 --> 00:46:14,785
why not live dangerously?

730
00:46:16,254 --> 00:46:19,090
36 hours is plenty of time

731
00:46:19,157 --> 00:46:21,842
for them to find reason to doubt you.

732
00:46:24,513 --> 00:46:27,548
Perhaps a little doubt in me is called for.

733
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:38,309
What happened out there?

734
00:46:44,783 --> 00:46:47,902
Tell me

735
00:46:47,986 --> 00:46:50,538
we're not crazy, you and I.

736
00:46:52,124 --> 00:46:54,041
<i>Crazy?</i>

737
00:46:57,212 --> 00:47:00,864
To put ourselves through all this

738
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:03,834
when the outcome's so uncertain.

739
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:10,007
The outcome is only uncertain
for those who disbelieve.

740
00:47:12,978 --> 00:47:15,513
I believe in this place.

741
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,960
And I believe if there's anyone
who can do what's necessary

742
00:47:19,985 --> 00:47:21,885
to make it something better,

743
00:47:21,937 --> 00:47:23,771
it's you.

744
00:48:02,093 --> 00:48:04,311
<i>(men shouting)</i>

745
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:08,983
(grunting)

746
00:48:09,067 --> 00:48:11,569
<i>(chickens clucking)</i>

747
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:16,740
Oi, where are you going?

748
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:18,375
Eyes on Randall at all times...

749
00:48:18,443 --> 00:48:19,877
wasn't that the deal?

750
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:26,800
(chuckles)

751
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,755
Randall, you are a fucking puzzle.

752
00:48:31,806 --> 00:48:34,975
Part of me thinks you must be the
luckiest halfwit in the colonies,

753
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,677
the way this all played out.

754
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:42,433
But part of me suspects there's
something else going on here.

755
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,321
I'm forced to wonder if you didn't
orchestrate this whole little drama

756
00:48:47,405 --> 00:48:51,492
knowing it would corner me into
securing your return to the crew.

757
00:48:53,495 --> 00:48:55,145
I'm forced to consider the possibility

758
00:48:55,196 --> 00:48:56,947
there is a lot more of the old Randall

759
00:48:56,998 --> 00:48:59,416
in that head of yours
than you'd like to let on.

760
00:49:02,203 --> 00:49:04,488
That you're no halfwit at all,

761
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:07,174
but a very shrewd operator

762
00:49:07,259 --> 00:49:08,825
who's managed to gain the benefits

763
00:49:08,877 --> 00:49:12,046
of sailing with these men
while avoiding all the risk.

764
00:49:13,932 --> 00:49:16,600
That perhaps,

765
00:49:16,668 --> 00:49:19,053
just perhaps,

766
00:49:19,137 --> 00:49:21,722
you're a goddamn genius.

767
00:49:25,677 --> 00:49:27,978
(farts)

768
00:49:40,075 --> 00:49:41,992
(men shouting)

769
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:07,184
<i>(chatter and laughter)</i>

770
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:09,937
Mr. Gates.

771
00:50:10,021 --> 00:50:11,739
Mr. Quartermaster.

772
00:50:16,272 --> 00:50:18,672
The crew seem in good spirit.

773
00:50:18,697 --> 00:50:21,365
All things considered.

774
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:28,539
What about our friend the cook?

775
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,875
It appears to be resolved for now.

776
00:50:33,077 --> 00:50:35,078
Though I must tell you,
he discerned that I knew

777
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,014
about the missing page beforehand.

778
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:39,967
He assumed Billy told me.

779
00:50:40,051 --> 00:50:41,602
I can see how he might think that.

780
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:44,021
I did nothing to dispel that notion,

781
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:46,329
though it may not take
him a long time to realize

782
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:49,309
who it was that actually
brought me into this.

783
00:50:49,394 --> 00:50:52,396
Well, we'll have to deal with our situation

784
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:54,398
as it develops,

785
00:50:54,449 --> 00:50:56,367
won't we?

786
00:50:56,434 --> 00:50:57,368
Aye.

787
00:51:01,906 --> 00:51:03,940
There's something else.

788
00:51:03,992 --> 00:51:06,460
It's Messrs. Howell and De Groot.

789
00:51:06,544 --> 00:51:08,128
Give them a couple of days.

790
00:51:08,213 --> 00:51:11,454
Once we're at sea, the work will
take their focus off Randall.

791
00:51:13,501 --> 00:51:17,588
Actually, it's not Randall
that's troubling them.

792
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:19,306
It's you.

793
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:22,793
Having had some time to think about it,

794
00:51:22,844 --> 00:51:26,430
they're not certain that you're
up to doing what's necessary.

795
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:31,468
<i>The lying we could forgive.</i>

796
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:32,986
<i>Singleton we could forgive.</i>

797
00:51:33,071 --> 00:51:35,522
We could forgive all of it.

798
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:39,076
But not Billy.

799
00:51:41,279 --> 00:51:43,831
<i>That requires an answer.</i>

800
00:51:46,117 --> 00:51:47,701
<i>When the time comes, we need to know</i>

801
00:51:47,786 --> 00:51:50,087
<i>that you won't stand in the way.</i>

802
00:51:52,507 --> 00:51:54,591
<i>I understand he's your friend.</i>

803
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:57,544
But once we have the money,

804
00:51:57,629 --> 00:51:59,263
Flint dies.

805
00:52:00,882 --> 00:52:02,883
<i>No argument.</i>

806
00:52:07,439 --> 00:52:09,473
Not from me.

807
00:53:14,105 --> 00:53:17,040
<i>(rustling)</i>

808
00:53:30,088 --> 00:53:32,756
<i>- Eleanor's voice: You could be strong again.
- (Gasps)</i>

809
00:53:32,824 --> 00:53:34,691
<i>You could resist me.</i>

810
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:40,314
<i>You could take this whole
fucking island from me</i>

811
00:53:40,398 --> 00:53:43,951
<i>if only you weren't so goddamned afraid.</i>

812
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:11,094
(chatter and laughter)

813
00:54:16,684 --> 00:54:18,936
<i>- (squelches)
- (Groans)</i>

814
00:54:18,987 --> 00:54:20,237
