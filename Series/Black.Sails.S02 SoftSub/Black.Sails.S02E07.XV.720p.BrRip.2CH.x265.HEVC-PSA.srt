1
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:15,202
Tonight I will submit myself
as captain of this combined crew.

2
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:17,537
I intend to lead the men
in retaking the fort,

3
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:20,207
having ended your tyranny
over this place for good.

4
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:23,043
She's adrift.
Alone in the most terrifying way.

5
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:24,878
You know who I am?

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,547
I think you know who that is.
I will protect you.

7
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:29,216
The captain of Scarborough,

8
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:32,886
he offered me and nine men
of my choosing full pardons

9
00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:36,523
if I would aid him in the capture
of a fugitive from justice.

10
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:38,358
You understand what
I'm asking you to do?

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,526
Go back and watch the gold.

12
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:41,194
Keep watch on the Spanish soldiers

13
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:42,529
who are watching the gold.

14
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:44,698
Her father is a very influential man.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,368
If I return her to him,
I believe that I can win him as an ally.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,204
Courting Lord Ashe and
retrieving the Urca gold

17
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:52,539
are working against each other.

18
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,541
If you prevent any further
attack on the fort,

19
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:56,376
I will bring the girl down from the hill

20
00:00:56,378 --> 00:00:57,711
and deliver her to you.

21
00:00:57,713 --> 00:01:00,033
You are no longer a hostage.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

22
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:40,192
I remember music...

23
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:45,068
in her home.

24
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,024
It was always so warm there, so lovely.

25
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,365
And I remember when I would
visit there with Mother and Father,

26
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,200
how she would lean down

27
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:02,419
so her face was very near mine

28
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:04,788
and she's smile.

29
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:10,427
I remember hoping
I'd be so beautiful one day.

30
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:16,383
And I remember watching her talk
with my mother from across the room

31
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:19,052
and how she'd make my mother laugh.

32
00:03:25,026 --> 00:03:27,193
And you're saying she's here?

33
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:29,195
Lady Hamilton is on this island?

34
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:32,031
She is. She's a friend

35
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:33,867
and she wants to help
rescue you from this place.

36
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:35,869
But I don't understand.

37
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:39,873
Captain Vane gave me his word
I'd be unharmed here.

38
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,875
Things have changed.

39
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:44,377
Things are changing as we speak tonight.

40
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:46,546
You are now worth more to him as part

41
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:48,548
of a very dangerous
game here on the island.

42
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,049
As such, he has no intention

43
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:53,219
of returning you to your
father any time soon.

44
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:57,340
Trust me. Trust Mrs. Hamilton

45
00:03:57,342 --> 00:03:59,676
and know that we must
leave this place now.

46
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:02,095
How?

47
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:04,597
There is a network of tunnels
that run beneath the fort.

48
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,933
And the entrance to
one of them isn't far.

49
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,601
By the time anyone
realizes you are gone,

50
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:11,271
you will be safely away from here
and in the care of Captain Flint.

51
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,914
I remember Lady Hamilton's face.

52
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,869
But I know Captain Flint's name.

53
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:28,371
My father's mentioned it in his letters.

54
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:31,508
He says Captain Flint is the most
wicked of the New World pirates.

55
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,177
That he's evil.

56
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:38,515
Promise me that my escape
isn't some awful ruse

57
00:04:38,517 --> 00:04:41,551
to deliver me from one madman
into the hands of another.

58
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,890
Captain Flint is a good man.

59
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:52,695
If you don't trust my word about it...

60
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:54,898
trust hers.

61
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:02,906
Where do we go?

62
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:08,127
Shut up. Just get it done.

63
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:23,560
Where's your count?

64
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:27,180
Hard to tell.

65
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:30,683
Everyone's holding this one close.

66
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:33,353
Well, I'm hearing you're up three.

67
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:35,522
I have it as four.

68
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:37,023
- You have Dobson as a nay.
- Yes.

69
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:38,691
- Brewer's a nay.
- Yes.

70
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,693
- Winslow?
- Winslow?

71
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:42,362
No, he's a yea vote.

72
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:44,197
When did you ask him?

73
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,033
A little while ago.
Why, has something happened?

74
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:49,536
He got into it with
Muldoon over last mess,

75
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:52,539
said Muldoon was chewing
too loud or something.

76
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,375
Muldoon brought his mother into it.

77
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:58,711
Muldoon's in your camp,
so Winslow flipped as a "fuck you."

78
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:03,266
Seriously.

79
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:05,435
- That's a good one.
- Yeah.

80
00:06:05,437 --> 00:06:06,936
My seamanship,

81
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:10,557
my prospects for garnering plunder,

82
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,692
my skill in a fight,
the sound of my voice,

83
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:14,527
the sound of another man's eating.

84
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:16,696
I suppose at the end of the day,

85
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:18,698
they're all functionally equivalent.

86
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,735
A man casts his vote for the same
reason he does anything in his life.

87
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:26,372
Why's that?

88
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:29,375
Because it feels good.

89
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:32,378
Three votes, four votes.

90
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,748
30 of them will change their minds
before they raise their hands tonight.

91
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:39,552
The thing that will decide this vote

92
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:40,920
hasn't happened yet.

93
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:45,341
You're going to convince
them they'll feel better

94
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:46,676
about voting for you over him.

95
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:49,846
I think I've got a pretty strong case.

96
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:52,181
His way, a lot of them will die tonight.

97
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:54,851
My way, they won't
and we'll gain the favor

98
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:58,738
of a man who could move this place
a step closer to sustainability.

99
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:03,443
Perhaps.

100
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:06,613
Though, still, his argument
would seem to be the easier one.

101
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:09,282
- You think?
- Sure.

102
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:13,369
"Captain Flint will betray
anyone to get what he wants."

103
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:17,006
Yesterday it was Mr. Gates,
today it was me.

104
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:19,542
"Which one of you would
like to be tomorrow?"

105
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:24,213
Captain?

106
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,885
They're ready.

107
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,566
There's only one item for
consideration tonight.

108
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:47,403
Captain Hornigold?

109
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:02,752
A man asks for your trust,

110
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:06,756
he asks and offers you
things in the future.

111
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:10,426
And the brighter those things may be,
the more you must ask yourself,

112
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:14,397
"What is it they are intended
to blind me to in the present?"

113
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,853
It's no surprise that that man

114
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:24,023
wants to shift your
attention to the future.

115
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:26,859
To the things he says he can give you.

116
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:29,529
To the hardships he can remove.

117
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:33,700
A most shining future
it would have to be

118
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:36,202
for him to blind you to the cowardly

119
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:38,871
and devious acts of his past...

120
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:42,542
theft, betrayal, lies, murder!

121
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:46,713
When we first elected
to merge these crews...

122
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:48,214
Where the fuck have you been?

123
00:08:48,216 --> 00:08:50,383
A launch landed on the
beach a short while ago.

124
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:52,719
The news it brings is of
the upmost importance.

125
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:54,887
More important than losing
our ship to Captain Hornigold?

126
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:56,689
Yes.

127
00:08:56,691 --> 00:09:00,359
...have been wrenched from us
by men of the worst sort...

128
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,895
They're supposed to be watching
over the gold until we arrive.

129
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:04,564
What the fuck are they doing back?

130
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:06,899
Because there's no longer
any gold to watch over.

131
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,402
It's gone.

132
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:10,570
- It's gone.
- Did he say gone?

133
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:12,038
Did someone say gone?

134
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,207
The gold is gone.
You hear that? It's gone!

135
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:20,213
- The gold is gone!
- I don't believe it.

136
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:21,914
Who could've taken it?

137
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:37,897
This is clean.

138
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:01,037
It is as if it never happened.

139
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,674
Anything tying you to
yesterday's events is gone.

140
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:07,009
There will be questions, of course,

141
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:08,845
but should any find their way to you,

142
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:12,849
know that the other girls are
discussing openly downstairs

143
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:16,519
Charlotte and her lover's decision
to escape together to Providence.

144
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:19,222
All you need to do is say the same.

145
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:36,489
These will not fit you,
but they are clean.

146
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:39,992
When you are ready, I will be downstairs

147
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:43,379
and we can discuss what comes next.

148
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:52,054
I was married to a man once.

149
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:57,343
Rotten fuck...

150
00:10:57,345 --> 00:11:00,012
raised his hands at me,

151
00:11:00,014 --> 00:11:02,765
burned me,

152
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,984
shared me with his men.

153
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:08,738
I didn't know any different,

154
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,773
didn't know I could
do anything about it.

155
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,527
Even if I had,

156
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:16,863
I wouldn't have thought I had it in me.

157
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:21,701
One day, we were in a tavern.

158
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:25,037
He was hurting me.

159
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,040
And a man saw it.

160
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:31,544
And he walked over...

161
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:33,546
and he slit his throat.

162
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:39,719
That was Jack.

163
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,391
I was 13.

164
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:52,531
I always thought
he saved me from something.

165
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,901
Always been so fucking grateful.

166
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:58,571
Now I wonder...

167
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,408
maybe Jack took me from something

168
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,961
I was supposed to figure
my own way out of.

169
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:11,133
Maybe he took away the chance
to get strong enough to save myself.

170
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:15,888
To grow up.

171
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:21,510
Instead, I went with him,

172
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:24,180
did what he did,

173
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:26,565
did what the others did.

174
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:31,570
Thought I'd become one of them.

175
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:42,031
If I'm not what I was when I was born,

176
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,750
and I ain't what I've become instead...

177
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:49,205
what the fuck am I?

178
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:05,137
She's going to rest for now.

179
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:10,276
I know this is the last
thing you need to hear,

180
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:12,561
but me and the girls were talking.

181
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:17,867
We know what risks
we face with the turns.

182
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:21,070
How to avoid them, protect against them.

183
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,824
- What she did to Charlotte...
- Don't.

184
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:27,493
That's not something we
know how to protect against.

185
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:29,829
Shouldn't we be focusing on
getting her out the door right now

186
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:32,331
before it's one of us next?

187
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,001
Please don't be the voice of this.

188
00:13:35,003 --> 00:13:37,503
If you're concerned that by
removing her from this place

189
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:39,839
she could get violent with you,

190
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:42,008
there are men we can talk to

191
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,676
about making sure she can't hurt you.

192
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,845
I don't want to hear that again.

193
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:48,564
Not from you,
not from the other girls, ever.

194
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:53,019
When no one in the world...

195
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:56,856
no one... no one...

196
00:13:56,858 --> 00:14:00,359
could care less about what those men
were doing to me on the beach,

197
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,578
she did.

198
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,914
That means something to me.

199
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:09,919
So for as long as she desires,
this place will be a safe place for her.

200
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:14,206
And those men you would talk
to about solving this problem?

201
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,375
They value their relationship with me

202
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:19,545
far more than they do
yours or Isabella's

203
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:23,049
or anyone on that floor.

204
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:26,719
If I hear from those men that
inquiries have been made about them,

205
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:30,222
I will not receive that news well.
Is that clear?

206
00:14:37,365 --> 00:14:39,398
Idelle...

207
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:46,572
please let the girls know
I understand their concern.

208
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,210
If any one of them wish to come to me,

209
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:53,546
my door is open.

210
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:55,414
I will.

211
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:04,423
Two guardacosta men-of-war sitting
right in the bay when we arrived.

212
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,258
We made our way down to
the ridge and watched

213
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,427
while they ferried it
all into their holds.

214
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:12,348
Watched that gold disappear
from that beach piece by piece,

215
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,517
and watched them weigh
anchor and set sail.

216
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,686
When it was all clear,
we walked the beach.

217
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:19,688
Not a fucking piece left behind.

218
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,525
Not a fucking piece.

219
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:24,243
Thank you.

220
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:36,172
What's happening out there?

221
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:39,175
They've called council to
debate how they wish to proceed.

222
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:40,843
That should be productive.

223
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:43,345
The good news for you
is Hornigold's support

224
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,347
has disappeared completely.

225
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:47,850
There's not a soul among
them that has any appetite

226
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:49,685
for fighting over the fort tonight.

227
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:52,521
Without the gold,
it all seems rather pointless.

228
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:56,025
- And the bad news?
- It's chaos out there.

229
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:58,694
Likely to be for some time.

230
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:02,948
There are as many proposals for
what ought to be our next score

231
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,617
as there are men to voice them,

232
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:07,453
including ransoming that
hostage girl of yours

233
00:16:07,455 --> 00:16:09,738
for cash instead of favors.

234
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,041
If she's ever delivered to us.

235
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:16,662
One way or the other,
those men want to get paid.

236
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:18,047
And soon.

237
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,568
May we have the room, please?

238
00:16:29,677 --> 00:16:32,011
What a fucking mess.

239
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:35,014
We have to think very carefully

240
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:38,684
about how to navigate these next steps.

241
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:40,853
The case for returning
the girl to Charles Town

242
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:44,023
in exchange for reconciliation
cannot come from me.

243
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:46,358
I've just had my authority challenged.

244
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,361
Even on it's merits,
the argument would seem desperate

245
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:52,364
and invite doubt and suspicion.

246
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:56,202
But if it came from you,
we might just stand a chance...

247
00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:58,370
Let me stop you right there.

248
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:01,040
There is no "we."

249
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,926
We stopped being a thing of any
relevance about an hour ago.

250
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:05,761
Is that so?

251
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:09,098
I believe I've been clear about
the nature of my investment here.

252
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,884
The gold was the inducement.

253
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:14,720
- Now no gold...
- It's an unfortunate development

254
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:16,689
that we have to adapt, and quickly.

255
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:20,025
Adapt? I've had about my
fill of adapting lately.

256
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:22,361
Doing your bidding,
keeping the crew in line for you.

257
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:24,196
I wasn't the only one
to benefit from that.

258
00:17:24,198 --> 00:17:26,198
It certainly seemed that way.

259
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,367
Even now you're the only
one benefitting from it.

260
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:31,036
What are you saying,
that I'm benefitting

261
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:32,705
from the gold having disappeared?

262
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:35,407
It certainly solved a number
of problems for you, didn't it?

263
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:39,044
I have half a mind to wonder
if you didn't orchestrate

264
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:41,380
this whole thing to your advantage.

265
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:43,882
Listen to me.

266
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:46,385
I understand your disappointment
at this recent news.

267
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:48,504
I share it.

268
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:50,673
But I need your help.

269
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:53,509
- They need your help.
- Oh, please.

270
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:56,178
Don't try to convince me to do it
for the sake of their futures.

271
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,563
For the sake of your own.

272
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,768
Those men listen to you. They give
a shit about what you have to say.

273
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,104
What you think,
what you want them to think.

274
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:08,274
Where else in the world is that true?

275
00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:11,277
Where else would you wake up
in the morning and matter?

276
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:16,915
You walk out on this,
and where the fuck are you going?

277
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:25,874
You'll address the men?

278
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:29,511
Yeah.

279
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:32,014
Many of them won't want to hear it.

280
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:34,883
Don't you want to discuss
how you'll approach them?

281
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,390
I know what I'm doing.

282
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,460
Some fuckin' day, huh?

283
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:09,251
I'm sure you idiots had half
that money spent already.

284
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:12,338
What were you gone do with it?

285
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,173
- Me?
- Mm.

286
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:17,343
I was gone walk away from all
you people and never look back.

287
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,181
I mean it. That money was license

288
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:24,516
for me to leave all of this

289
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:27,853
and all of you behind.

290
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,856
And any one of you who says he didn't
at least consider doing the same

291
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:33,359
is a lying sack of shit.

292
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:35,694
Truth is,
there's only one kind of person

293
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:40,032
who'd want to do what we do
if there was an easier way to survive.

294
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:44,536
And because I don't believe there is
a rotten, murdering fuck amongst you,

295
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:47,706
I don't imagine I'm alone
in having taken some comfort

296
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,709
in the idea of all of
this coming to an end.

297
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:57,049
But now...

298
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:58,550
no gold.

299
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:05,524
We're back to the same two choices
we've known our entire lives...

300
00:20:05,526 --> 00:20:08,861
toil for another man's benefit

301
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:11,730
or steal for our own.

302
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:16,902
Unless...

303
00:20:18,873 --> 00:20:21,907
Captain Flint just
showed us a third way.

304
00:20:25,713 --> 00:20:27,079
Reconciliation.

305
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:32,551
Pardons.

306
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:35,888
And not because we need to
apologize for what we've done.

307
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:40,726
Not because we got any desire to
go back to where we came from.

308
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:46,014
But because maybe...

309
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:48,851
with a little help...

310
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:52,404
this place could be the reason
we never have to do either again.

311
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,860
The question then becomes

312
00:20:57,862 --> 00:21:01,029
what do we have to lose?

313
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:03,268
Truly amazing.

314
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:06,785
With that one and the captain aligned,

315
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,587
there would seem to be no
limits to their ability

316
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:10,956
to manipulate sentiment among the men.

317
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:18,013
Perhaps the men are swayed
by the strength of the argument.

318
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:22,351
A political alliance with the most
dogged pirate hunter in the New World?

319
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:24,887
Because once they were friends?

320
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:30,225
I think it's clear what
needs to happen next, Billy.

321
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:37,199
So easy for you to betray your oath?

322
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:40,402
I'm aware of my oath.

323
00:21:42,373 --> 00:21:46,492
Those men are my brothers,
same as yours.

324
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:49,661
But because they would
march blindly to their end,

325
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:52,664
does that mean we must as well?

326
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:57,002
If you and I know we have the opportunity
to save eight of them from that fate,

327
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:59,505
give eight of them a real future,

328
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:02,591
and we can actually deliver,

329
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:05,761
doesn't our oath compel us to do so?

330
00:22:05,763 --> 00:22:08,981
Are those eight men not
our brothers as well?

331
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:17,523
Do you think you could find eight men
that would see things the same way?

332
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:20,359
I do.

333
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:25,030
Men who would be willing
to betray the captain,

334
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:27,199
assist us in subduing him,

335
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:30,369
and deliver him to the Navy by force?

336
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,040
I do.

337
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:43,882
Then find them.

338
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:46,051
We'll meet at the bluffs in an hour,

339
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:47,886
then we move.

340
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,252
Sit.

341
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:10,936
I have some business to attend to.

342
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:12,521
Eat.

343
00:24:12,523 --> 00:24:15,557
When I return,
you and I will discuss the road ahead.

344
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:33,875
It's better on Wednesdays.

345
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:46,838
Alice gets the leavings
from the tavern on Tuesdays,

346
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,558
so on Wednesdays, it is a bisque.

347
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:54,563
Friday, it's more of a stew.

348
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:57,683
And Saturday... I'm not even sure Alice

349
00:24:57,685 --> 00:25:00,018
knows what to call that
for her Saturday's.

350
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,270
Don't you know who I am?

351
00:25:02,272 --> 00:25:04,940
No, why? You famous?

352
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:09,578
- No.
- Me, either.

353
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,530
Though I am working on it.

354
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:17,703
Jacob Garret,
carpenter's mate with the Intrepid.

355
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:23,375
So you don't want to tell me your name?

356
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:27,713
All right, suit yourself.

357
00:25:27,715 --> 00:25:31,049
Yeah, a couple of the guys
and I are working on a plan

358
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:34,052
to split off and start our own crew.

359
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,854
Now, I only tell you this
so when you start hearing

360
00:25:35,856 --> 00:25:37,355
Captain Jacob Garret stories,

361
00:25:37,357 --> 00:25:39,191
you'll be able to put a face to a name.

362
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:42,694
Jesus Christ, Jacob.
She don't need your life story.

363
00:25:42,696 --> 00:25:45,864
Take her upstairs, fuck her already.

364
00:25:45,866 --> 00:25:48,400
We ain't got all night.

365
00:25:50,204 --> 00:25:52,871
If it makes you feel any better,
Captain Jacob Garret

366
00:25:52,873 --> 00:25:55,073
would never have a man
like that on his crew.

367
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:03,298
Why me?

368
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:06,084
Because you're new.

369
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:08,136
And you seem nice.

370
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:11,890
What do you think?

371
00:26:51,515 --> 00:26:53,381
So, aren't you gonna tell me the rules?

372
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:57,719
No?

373
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:00,856
You're supposed to
tell me what's allowed.

374
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,274
I tell you what I want.

375
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:05,443
You tell me how much it costs.

376
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:08,780
No? All right. Not a problem.

377
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:10,782
Well, why don't we...

378
00:27:10,784 --> 00:27:12,868
look, all right,

379
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,203
usually the girls would
charge me five pieces...

380
00:27:18,492 --> 00:27:22,711
I'm thoroughly boring, not into any
of the weird or controversial stuff.

381
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,000
What do you think?

382
00:27:29,002 --> 00:27:31,887
Does that sound fair to you?

383
00:27:57,197 --> 00:28:00,031
Are you kidding me?

384
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:03,752
You can't do this.
I'm sorry, she's new.

385
00:28:03,754 --> 00:28:06,755
Left another man downstairs under the
impression he was her guest for the night.

386
00:28:06,757 --> 00:28:08,924
Look, I wasn't trying to
make any trouble, all right?

387
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:11,293
This is her fault, not yours.

388
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,713
In fact,

389
00:28:14,715 --> 00:28:17,215
the management would like
me to make it up to you.

390
00:28:19,052 --> 00:28:22,220
On account of the confusion.

391
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:58,700
I'm sorry, ma'am, but may I ask,

392
00:29:58,702 --> 00:30:01,036
how did you arrive in this place?

393
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:03,989
My father brought me
here when I was a child.

394
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:05,991
Was he one of them?

395
00:30:05,993 --> 00:30:08,543
No, he was most assuredly
not one of them.

396
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,497
I remember when my father

397
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:14,883
told me he was leaving for Carolina.

398
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:18,169
He left me behind.

399
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:21,840
He said Charles Town was far
too coarse and violent a place

400
00:30:21,842 --> 00:30:23,391
to bring a child into.

401
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:28,179
But you seem a formidable woman, ma'am.

402
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:31,016
Perhaps it was exposure to
the challenges of this place

403
00:30:31,018 --> 00:30:33,401
that made you the person you are.

404
00:30:36,023 --> 00:30:38,189
I suppose that's one way to look at it.

405
00:31:27,707 --> 00:31:29,707
We staggered our departures from camp

406
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,709
so as not to arouse suspicion.

407
00:31:31,711 --> 00:31:33,745
Did you secure the skiff?

408
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:39,084
Billy, someone's coming.

409
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,397
What is this?

410
00:31:54,684 --> 00:31:57,018
Have you ever been tortured?

411
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,853
What?

412
00:31:58,855 --> 00:32:01,940
Suffered pain applied by men

413
00:32:01,942 --> 00:32:04,275
who saw you as less than a man?

414
00:32:04,277 --> 00:32:06,444
Saw you as an animal?

415
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:11,282
'Cause it isn't actually
the pain they're inflicting

416
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:12,700
that's the most frightening part of it.

417
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:16,004
It isn't the fear of future pain.

418
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:19,007
It's the knowledge

419
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:21,176
that even when the pain stops,

420
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:24,345
even if they were to let you go,

421
00:32:24,347 --> 00:32:26,047
that they've changed you.

422
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:32,187
That pain, that fear,

423
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:34,389
that despair...

424
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,860
has made you someone else,

425
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:42,363
someone you barely recognize.

426
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:44,232
Against your will.

427
00:32:47,537 --> 00:32:51,489
I said what I had to say
to get out of that place,

428
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:55,043
but I have no intention
of honoring their offer.

429
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,466
10 pardons.

430
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:08,256
I would fight to the death
to ensure not a single one

431
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:11,392
of my brothers ever has
to face what I faced.

432
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:15,847
Now, if there's a man on this
crew that feels differently,

433
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:17,348
that feels as though he'd be willing

434
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,018
to accept another brother
suffering that fate

435
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,354
so that he might avoid it,

436
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:26,357
then that's a man I need
to remove from my crew.

437
00:33:28,695 --> 00:33:31,863
Right now, Mr. Dufresne here
has identified you men

438
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:34,699
as the most likely to
represent such a problem.

439
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:38,703
Was he right?

440
00:33:38,705 --> 00:33:40,872
Don't appreciate
being fucked with, Billy.

441
00:33:40,874 --> 00:33:43,875
If you ain't got the balls to
stand up to Flint, maybe you...

442
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:05,446
There will be no more dissent
against Captain Flint.

443
00:34:07,734 --> 00:34:11,069
There will be no
subversion of his plans.

444
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:13,538
There will be nothing but adherence

445
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,542
to the principal that
we are none of us safe

446
00:34:17,544 --> 00:34:20,745
until we are all safe.

447
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:26,417
Does anyone have a problem with that?

448
00:34:31,174 --> 00:34:33,057
Then be on your way.

449
00:34:51,528 --> 00:34:53,528
Fuck!

450
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,862
Is there another way around?

451
00:34:54,864 --> 00:34:57,532
Not without going back
through the courtyard.

452
00:34:57,534 --> 00:34:59,534
And if they haven't checked
your cell yet, they will soon.

453
00:34:59,536 --> 00:35:00,868
When they see that you've gone,

454
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,587
they'll search every inch
of this fort until they...

455
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:17,218
They're coming.

456
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:21,723
Oh, God.

457
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:05,316
Let me help.

458
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,025
Now go.

459
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:17,695
Here, take this.

460
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:03,241
I saved your life.

461
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:07,245
I killed him for you.

462
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:09,414
Low and his crew.

463
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:11,883
I killed them all to protect you.

464
00:37:11,885 --> 00:37:14,585
You didn't do it for me.

465
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:19,724
You will turn on absolutely anyone,
won't you?

466
00:37:21,678 --> 00:37:23,845
So what's the plan?

467
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:26,848
Leave me to answer for
this among the men?

468
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,683
Assume they'll tear me to pieces

469
00:37:28,685 --> 00:37:31,018
for granting access to the woman

470
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,021
who stole the girl out from under us?

471
00:37:34,023 --> 00:37:36,357
My death sentence?

472
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,910
Listen to me clearly.

473
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:45,032
Put down that key,
walk back through that gate,

474
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:47,368
return the girl,

475
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:50,171
and I will sort this with the men.

476
00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:52,840
You have my word.

477
00:37:52,842 --> 00:37:55,009
But lock that gate

478
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:59,046
and there is no walking back
through it, ever.

479
00:38:01,768 --> 00:38:03,601
And I assure you,

480
00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:06,637
you will hear from me again.

481
00:38:50,683 --> 00:38:52,683
I know how you feel.

482
00:38:52,685 --> 00:38:56,354
Not that long ago, I was lost.

483
00:38:56,356 --> 00:38:58,022
Without friends.

484
00:38:58,024 --> 00:39:00,691
Without identity.

485
00:39:00,693 --> 00:39:03,244
I thought there was no life
for me that I understood

486
00:39:03,246 --> 00:39:07,415
and I felt as though that
meant there was no life at all.

487
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:09,250
But I was wrong.

488
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:12,036
Especially in this place.

489
00:39:12,038 --> 00:39:14,205
There is always a life,

490
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:17,208
there is always a future,

491
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:20,711
as long as one is willing
to build it for themselves.

492
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:23,881
Now, though,
I am beginning to understand

493
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:26,384
there are limits to what
one can build alone.

494
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:32,523
I can only scavenge leads
generated by Eleanor for so long.

495
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:34,859
I have an appetite for
something larger than that,

496
00:39:34,861 --> 00:39:37,228
and it requires expanding.

497
00:39:39,365 --> 00:39:41,198
Proper spies.

498
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,368
Perhaps off the island as well.

499
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,038
For this, I need a partner
with knowledge of the sea

500
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,407
and I need a partner I can trust.

501
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:04,005
No word?

502
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:05,389
No, no word.

503
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:12,013
If Eleanor says she'll come
down that hill with Abigail,

504
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:14,015
she will.

505
00:40:14,017 --> 00:40:16,517
I understand that once
the girl is delivered

506
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,687
and Captain Flint's set sail
to return her to Charles Town

507
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:22,189
that you intend to join
them for the voyage.

508
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:24,859
Is that true?

509
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:28,696
With all due respect, Mr. Guthrie,

510
00:40:28,698 --> 00:40:30,698
what concern is it of yours?

511
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,869
Charles Town, ma'am, is not London.

512
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:37,338
It may appear to you to
be a civilized place,

513
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,509
but rest assured,
it only appears that way.

514
00:40:41,511 --> 00:40:45,680
Governor Ashe and his militia
are men of the most brutal kind

515
00:40:45,682 --> 00:40:48,215
when it comes to
enforcement of the laws.

516
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,209
Hello, Abigail.

517
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:21,215
I'm Miranda Hamilton.
Do you remember me?

518
00:43:02,268 --> 00:43:04,769
I don't suppose
you'd mind sharing that bottle?

519
00:43:07,774 --> 00:43:11,525
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer to be alone.

520
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:14,695
Shame.

521
00:43:14,697 --> 00:43:18,082
Because there is something
we really ought to discuss.

522
00:43:19,368 --> 00:43:21,869
If this is about Charlotte
and Mr. Logan, I assure you...

523
00:43:21,871 --> 00:43:24,872
I heard on the beach
they're in Providence.

524
00:43:26,843 --> 00:43:28,876
Why, did you hear something different?

525
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,047
Then what is it you wish to discuss?

526
00:43:36,185 --> 00:43:38,385
Best we do this in private.

527
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,870
Can I have a word?

528
00:43:59,992 --> 00:44:01,959
Of course.

529
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:07,081
I'm waiting on a final tally,

530
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:11,135
but I believe we've lost around
18 defectors over the last few hours.

531
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:16,674
Some due to loss of the gold,

532
00:44:16,676 --> 00:44:19,844
some following Hornigold out
the door out of loyalty to him.

533
00:44:19,846 --> 00:44:22,179
Anyone we'll miss?

534
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:23,848
Mr. Dufresne.

535
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,683
Really?

536
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:28,185
He saw the crew's
overwhelming support for you,

537
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:30,521
felt his resentment towards
you had become an impediment

538
00:44:30,523 --> 00:44:32,523
in his existing amongst them.

539
00:44:32,525 --> 00:44:36,193
So we are without a quartermaster.

540
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:39,864
For the moment.
We should take care to steer the men

541
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:42,032
towards a replacement
from Hornigold's men.

542
00:44:42,034 --> 00:44:44,034
Someone to fold the two crews together

543
00:44:44,036 --> 00:44:46,871
but not someone who's gone offer
you any personal resistance.

544
00:44:46,873 --> 00:44:49,373
I was thinking Mr. Scott
might be an ideal candidate.

545
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:52,710
Billy, I don't mean to be blunt,
but what the fuck are you doing?

546
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,546
Why am I supporting your captaincy?

547
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:57,214
Yes.

548
00:44:58,718 --> 00:45:02,269
When I went into the water that night

549
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:04,388
after Andromache,

550
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:09,059
I remember losing my
footing on the bowsprit.

551
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:11,362
I remember as I was falling,

552
00:45:11,364 --> 00:45:15,366
reaching out, grasping your hand.

553
00:45:15,368 --> 00:45:18,702
And the last thing I remember
before I went into the water

554
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:21,205
was feeling it slip away.

555
00:45:21,207 --> 00:45:25,376
Now, I told the men
you tried to save me.

556
00:45:25,378 --> 00:45:27,544
But the truth is

557
00:45:27,546 --> 00:45:31,715
it's just as likely you let go

558
00:45:31,717 --> 00:45:34,385
and dropped me into the sea.

559
00:45:34,387 --> 00:45:37,171
Which do you think it was?

560
00:45:37,173 --> 00:45:40,674
Doesn't much matter,
as far as I can tell.

561
00:45:40,676 --> 00:45:43,177
I'll likely never know for certain.

562
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:46,180
It's possible you'll never
even know for certain.

563
00:45:46,182 --> 00:45:48,682
And right now, I'm more focused

564
00:45:48,684 --> 00:45:52,019
on what comes next than what's passed.

565
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:55,522
I believe you were right.

566
00:45:55,524 --> 00:45:57,691
I believe that for what comes next,

567
00:45:57,693 --> 00:46:01,028
the men of this crew will
need your leadership.

568
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,113
So I will do what needs to be done

569
00:46:03,115 --> 00:46:05,449
to preserve it and protect it.

570
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:08,919
Mr. Gates turned his back on you.

571
00:46:08,921 --> 00:46:12,339
Don't think for a second
I'll make the same mistake he did.

572
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:16,844
- Captain?
- Yes?

573
00:46:16,846 --> 00:46:19,880
Word from the tavern.
Miss Guthrie's asked for you.

574
00:47:00,506 --> 00:47:03,307
Why don't you introduce yourself?

575
00:47:22,862 --> 00:47:24,862
Don't be frightened.

576
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,700
I'm a friend of your family's.

577
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:34,204
And I'm a friend of yours.

578
00:47:38,544 --> 00:47:40,377
You're Captain Flint?

579
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:43,213
My name is James.

580
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:48,719
James McGraw.

581
00:48:01,033 --> 00:48:03,117
Where are you headed?

582
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:08,238
That's a very good question.

583
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,042
I'm far too recognizable
for the English colonies.

584
00:48:12,044 --> 00:48:14,878
I'd spend the rest of my days
looking over my shoulder.

585
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,047
It's shameful...

586
00:48:17,049 --> 00:48:20,551
for a man who's defended
this place for so long.

587
00:48:20,553 --> 00:48:22,052
Cast aside by it.

588
00:48:22,054 --> 00:48:24,505
Perhaps it has cast me aside.

589
00:48:24,507 --> 00:48:27,508
Or perhaps it's just taken me this long

590
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,394
to realize this place has
been dying for a long time.

591
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:34,681
I may be an old man, but I see no reason

592
00:48:34,683 --> 00:48:37,851
to allow it to drag me into my grave.

593
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:40,521
What if you didn't have to go anywhere?

594
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:42,523
Oh, England will have
her island back, son.

595
00:48:42,525 --> 00:48:45,859
The day that happens,
it'll be a bad day to be a pirate here.

596
00:48:45,861 --> 00:48:48,695
Unless we had something to offer them

597
00:48:48,697 --> 00:48:52,032
that might change their
thinking about us.

598
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:53,700
You think there's
something valuable enough

599
00:48:53,702 --> 00:48:56,370
to make the British Navy forget
that you and I are pirates?

600
00:48:58,174 --> 00:49:01,592
And what do you think would
have that kind of value to them?

601
00:49:01,594 --> 00:49:03,594
Not what.

602
00:49:03,596 --> 00:49:05,462
Who.

603
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:13,520
How soon before you can sail?

604
00:49:13,522 --> 00:49:16,390
First light. No need to delay.

605
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:20,194
My father has left for the
interior to lay the groundwork

606
00:49:20,196 --> 00:49:22,696
with Mr. Underhill for the partnership.

607
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:25,532
With any luck, by the time you return,

608
00:49:25,534 --> 00:49:28,819
you and Governor Ashe will be
greeted by a group of handsome men,

609
00:49:28,821 --> 00:49:32,656
pretty wives, and rosy-cheeked children.

610
00:49:32,658 --> 00:49:35,325
Lawful citizens of
New Providence Island,

611
00:49:35,327 --> 00:49:38,162
who, after decades of struggle,
have finally have found a way

612
00:49:38,164 --> 00:49:40,881
to sell their sugarcane
to honest markets.

613
00:49:43,002 --> 00:49:46,170
You know, if you and I aren't careful,

614
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:48,722
we might actually see
this thing through.

615
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:55,345
I took her.

616
00:49:55,347 --> 00:49:57,231
Without his consent.

617
00:49:59,185 --> 00:50:00,851
You know that, don't you?

618
00:50:00,853 --> 00:50:03,020
I had the thought.

619
00:50:05,024 --> 00:50:08,525
His men warned him not to trust me.

620
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:11,195
They told him that I
would betray them all.

621
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:17,034
Do you think there's any
chance he'll survive this?

622
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:27,544
The things I have destroyed
to reach this moment...

623
00:50:29,215 --> 00:50:32,382
everything and anything
that stood in it's way.

624
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:37,020
And for all that effort,
for all that sacrifice,

625
00:50:37,022 --> 00:50:40,557
it is now entirely reliant upon you.

626
00:50:42,194 --> 00:50:44,528
Trust is a funny thing.

627
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,863
When I pledged my
support to Captain Flint,

628
00:50:46,865 --> 00:50:50,033
I believed the trust between
us to be of the strongest kind.

629
00:50:50,035 --> 00:50:53,370
We both desperately
wanted the same thing.

630
00:50:53,372 --> 00:50:56,039
And that makes for good partners.

631
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:58,375
But over the past few days,
it's become clear to me

632
00:50:58,377 --> 00:50:59,876
that the prize we both wanted

633
00:50:59,878 --> 00:51:03,630
is becoming less a prize to
him and more an obstacle.

634
00:51:05,084 --> 00:51:07,251
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

635
00:51:07,253 --> 00:51:09,753
The Urca gold.

636
00:51:09,755 --> 00:51:12,172
I have feared for days that Flint

637
00:51:12,174 --> 00:51:14,675
might not want that
gold to ever be found,

638
00:51:14,677 --> 00:51:18,345
that it would interfere with plans
he held more important than gold,

639
00:51:18,347 --> 00:51:20,013
more important than wealth.

640
00:51:20,015 --> 00:51:23,734
And I have felt the ground
rushing towards us ever since.

641
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,187
And my greatest fear has
been that in the moment

642
00:51:27,189 --> 00:51:30,357
he decided to end the
hunt for the Urca gold,

643
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:34,578
the moment he decided it was in
his interest to betray my trust...

644
00:51:35,864 --> 00:51:38,532
that he would find a way to do so

645
00:51:38,534 --> 00:51:40,367
by deception, by force,

646
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:42,369
by who the fuck knows how.

647
00:51:42,371 --> 00:51:46,673
But what I do know is that he would
ask my help to make it happen.

648
00:51:46,675 --> 00:51:51,011
And by that point,
the gold would be as good as gone.

649
00:51:51,013 --> 00:51:55,182
Any resistance I offered would be futile

650
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:57,017
and I would be just another tool

651
00:51:57,019 --> 00:52:00,354
that he'd used and then
promptly discarded.

652
00:52:00,356 --> 00:52:03,307
Why are you telling me this?

653
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:15,369
A few hours ago, a launch arrived.

654
00:52:17,323 --> 00:52:20,157
Two of our men who were
scouting the Urca gold

655
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:23,160
were returning to the island
against their instructions.

656
00:52:23,162 --> 00:52:26,163
You see, they had been told
very clearly by Captain Flint

657
00:52:26,165 --> 00:52:28,832
to remain with the Urca until we arrived

658
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:33,003
to help us prepare our assault
on the Spanish beach.

659
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:36,173
So the moment I saw them approaching,

660
00:52:36,175 --> 00:52:39,676
my first thought was that the only
reason they'd be returning early

661
00:52:39,678 --> 00:52:42,846
was if the gold was no longer there.

662
00:52:42,848 --> 00:52:45,065
And I thought, "My God...

663
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:48,685
did Flint do this?

664
00:52:50,022 --> 00:52:54,024
Through some kind of luck
or guile or fucking sorcery,

665
00:52:54,026 --> 00:52:55,859
did he reach across an ocean

666
00:52:55,861 --> 00:52:59,529
and make $5 million in gold vanish?"

667
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,417
And sure enough,
just a few minutes later,

668
00:53:03,419 --> 00:53:05,252
those scouts were standing
in front of Captain Flint

669
00:53:05,254 --> 00:53:07,754
reporting to him the gold was gone,

670
00:53:07,756 --> 00:53:10,607
on its way back to Spain.

671
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:14,711
They told Flint the gold was gone.

672
00:53:14,713 --> 00:53:17,214
Yes.

673
00:53:17,216 --> 00:53:19,216
What did they tell you?

674
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,353
The two scouts reported to me

675
00:53:23,355 --> 00:53:26,022
what they had observed on the beach,

676
00:53:26,024 --> 00:53:29,025
what had driven them to leave
their post ahead of schedule

677
00:53:29,027 --> 00:53:32,729
and return to Nassau
with the utmost haste.

678
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:46,910
That a tropical disease had
befallen the Spanish camp.

679
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,880
Dozens dead or dying.

680
00:53:49,882 --> 00:53:52,249
Many more suffering, weakened.

681
00:53:54,386 --> 00:53:58,722
Only a handful of men defending it,
most barely even able to stand.

682
00:54:03,762 --> 00:54:06,763
The Urca gold is on that beach

683
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:10,434
exactly where we left it.

684
00:54:10,436 --> 00:54:13,520
And owing to a most
fortuitous act of God,

685
00:54:13,522 --> 00:54:17,240
it is almost entirely undefended.

686
00:54:19,361 --> 00:54:22,863
So I offered those two scouts a deal
they simply could not reject.

687
00:54:22,865 --> 00:54:26,032
Help me tell a very simple lie,

688
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:30,003
I will employ a smaller
crew to retrieve the gold,

689
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:32,506
and our three shares

690
00:54:32,508 --> 00:54:35,041
increase five-fold.

691
00:54:37,513 --> 00:54:41,181
So, do you know of a crew

692
00:54:41,183 --> 00:54:43,383
who might be willing to
aid in this endeavor?

693
00:55:10,913 --> 00:55:12,879
Go have a look.
