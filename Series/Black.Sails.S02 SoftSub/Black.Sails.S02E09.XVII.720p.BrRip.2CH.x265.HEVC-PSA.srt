1
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:15,215
The only way to truly ensure
that the Urca gold doesn't return here

2
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,440
is to eliminate everyone with the knowledge
of where it is and how to retrieve it.

3
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:20,192
Are you angry with Anne for leaving

4
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:23,613
or are you angry with me for
offering her the opportunity?

5
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:25,247
You think there's something valuable enough

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,084
to make the British Navy forget
that you and I are pirates?

7
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:29,919
Not what, who.

8
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:32,872
Acquiring the partnership of a
plantation the size of Mr. Underhill's

9
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:35,037
could help bolster commerce
on my side of the island.

10
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:36,926
Richard Guthrie betrayed Nassau.

11
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:39,679
As far as you and I,
I was warned about you.

12
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:41,681
Warned you would betray me.

13
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:43,883
I made clear the price for the girl.

14
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:46,719
You should know me well enough
to know I will claim it.

15
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:50,189
My father said there would
be law in the Americas

16
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,692
the day Captain Flint
swung over Charles Town.

17
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:54,944
- You're Captain Flint?
- I am.

18
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:57,113
And you wish an audience with Lord Ashe?

19
00:00:58,866 --> 00:00:59,899
Welcome to Charles Town.

20
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:16,952
I can't say enough, miss,

21
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:20,706
how saddened we all are by this loss.

22
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:22,458
All my life I was a pauper.

23
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:25,377
With your father's help I plied a trade.

24
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:27,880
I'll always be grateful for that.

25
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:42,528
Do you need a respite, ma'am?

26
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:03,582
Some bread and fruits from the girls.

27
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:05,835
May I sit?

28
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:23,686
Thank you.

29
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:27,940
I can imagine how difficult this must be.

30
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:32,661
Being the daughter they expect you to be.

31
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:34,446
I would think that at least with me,

32
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:36,115
you would know that I know the truth

33
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,784
about how complicated
the situation is for you.

34
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,837
Your relationship with him.

35
00:04:41,923 --> 00:04:44,540
Your relationship with Captain Vane.

36
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,927
And because of that,
you would not pretend otherwise.

37
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:50,930
And that that might bring
some small measure of comfort.

38
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:53,933
There is no part of this
that is complicated.

39
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:56,802
I crossed Charles, he retaliated.

40
00:04:56,888 --> 00:04:59,138
That is what happens in a war.

41
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,940
A war?

42
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:03,642
A state of affairs in
which resolution only comes

43
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,394
when one side has suffered enough pain

44
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,696
it's willing to concede its principles.

45
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:10,699
I presume you've heard Charles's manifesto.

46
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:13,035
I heard it's been read aloud on the beach.

47
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:18,073
Everyone must take a side, he says...

48
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:21,493
with him against
reconciliation with England

49
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:23,913
or with me.

50
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:26,548
Those people out there heard him

51
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:30,252
and they came to my door
not to pay their respects,

52
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:32,171
not because they loved my father...

53
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:37,226
but because when this war begins,

54
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:40,179
they want to make sure I don't
mistake them for enemies.

55
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:43,515
Is that why you've come?

56
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,569
Or have you yet to choose a side?

57
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,943
I'm interested to see what she does now.

58
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:03,202
How did that go?

59
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:07,289
I have seen what Eleanor Guthrie can build

60
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,258
when she is feeling ambitious.

61
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:13,178
I have seen what she can
destroy when she is angered.

62
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:14,880
Which of the two was she just now?

63
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:19,101
She was something else entirely.

64
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:23,272
How soon can you be ready to sail?

65
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:25,357
Just finalizing the route,
sorting out supplies.

66
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:28,193
I assumed we'd depart
tomorrow at some point.

67
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:34,199
Leave as soon as possible.

68
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:36,151
There are foul things brewing here.

69
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:50,416
Yes?

70
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:01,093
They're here.

71
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,897
Do you know why you're here?

72
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:06,515
Yes, ma'am.

73
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,818
Good.

74
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:17,026
Then we move at sundown.

75
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:26,035
The proposal that I have
come all this way to make

76
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,705
is one that may at first
strike you as implausible.

77
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,708
However, I ask that you remember that...

78
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,347
I love my daughter.

79
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,967
More than life itself.

80
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:44,853
When I received that despicable letter

81
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,439
I was given to dark thoughts, rage.

82
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:51,443
A desire to visit revenge upon those men

83
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,446
that put her through that ordeal.

84
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:56,198
It would seem only reasonable, then,

85
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:58,700
that I bear an equal measure of gratitude

86
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:00,903
to the man who rescued her from it.

87
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:04,823
Were it not for that gratitude,
you and I would not be speaking like this.

88
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:09,828
You and Colonel Rhett would be
having a very different conversation.

89
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,498
Because while I knew you once,

90
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,583
called you friends once,

91
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:17,669
I cannot fathom

92
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:20,722
how those people I knew turned into you.

93
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:23,225
Ask me, then.

94
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,010
Anything you want to know.

95
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:26,512
I will be truthful.

96
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:29,565
Anything?

97
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:33,685
When did you first arrive in Nassau?

98
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:37,022
Two months after we saw you last in London.

99
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:38,690
February, thereabouts.

100
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:40,576
The first accounts of Captain Flint raiding

101
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:42,611
shipping in the area began in June.

102
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:46,832
You became the captain of a
pirate crew in four months?

103
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:49,952
I became the captain of a
pirate crew faster than that.

104
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:53,122
It took us four months to secure
our first significant prize.

105
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:54,706
How did you manage that so quickly?

106
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,041
I met a man in a tavern.

107
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:58,760
Quartermaster of a well-respected crew.

108
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:00,963
I persuaded him

109
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:03,298
that I was someone worth listening to.

110
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:05,384
A crew followed shortly thereafter.

111
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:06,885
And how long after that was it

112
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:10,472
that you decided to murder Alfred Hamilton?

113
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:17,729
I received a letter
from a former servant.

114
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,866
She mentioned innocently

115
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:23,869
that Alfred was travelling in secret.

116
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:27,239
And she mentioned the name of the ship.

117
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:31,660
I encouraged James to find him.

118
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,079
And to kill him.

119
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,750
If you're going to blame anyone for it,

120
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:41,720
please, blame me.

121
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:47,593
The governor may know who you are.

122
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:49,344
I only know what you are.

123
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,647
Let us agree that if either one of you

124
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:54,016
gets any closer to the
governor than you just did,

125
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:56,685
I will be forced to consider
that a threat to his person

126
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,104
and I will shoot you where you stand.

127
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:14,920
I cannot stand before you

128
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:17,923
and claim to be without sin.

129
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,292
When we received that letter from you

130
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:23,212
informing us of Thomas's death,

131
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:25,464
the damage wrought by Alfred Hamilton

132
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:27,432
was too much for us to bear.

133
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:31,720
We were angry.

134
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:36,024
We allowed that anger to
drive us to a dark deed.

135
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:40,479
But I ask you not to
judge me by that one deed.

136
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:45,150
Judge me by the ends that I
have come here in service of.

137
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:47,369
The redemption of Nassau

138
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:50,405
in accordance with the
principles that you and I

139
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,658
and she and Thomas Hamilton

140
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:55,877
committed ourselves to all those years ago.

141
00:10:55,963 --> 00:11:00,249
I ask nothing from you but your ear.

142
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,175
I'm listening.

143
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:25,274
Footrope. Bitch of a spot.

144
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:28,243
Fucking death trap if it isn't
fixed before we set sail.

145
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,869
Let's try this again.

146
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,706
You idiots are the fucking
riggers of this ship.

147
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,457
So which of you would like to volunteer

148
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:44,626
to repair our topsail yard footrope

149
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:47,212
so that when Captain Flint returns,
he returns to a ship

150
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:49,464
that can hoist its fucking
sails without fatalities?

151
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,600
It's a bad omen.

152
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:54,386
A man died on them ropes.

153
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:56,855
Can't touch it till it's fixed.

154
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:04,229
You're all good people.

155
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:19,328
Tell me something.

156
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:21,046
Is he going to find anything up there?

157
00:12:21,081 --> 00:12:22,664
What would he find?

158
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,084
An indication that the rope
didn't just fray on its own.

159
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,136
No. Absolutely not.

160
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:32,007
It'd be almost impossible.

161
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:37,763
What?

162
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:56,448
What is it?

163
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,368
I thought I saw something in the water.

164
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:08,794
Tell the watch on the main so
they can keep an eye on it.

165
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:10,512
I'm sure it was nothing.

166
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:12,514
Tell them anyway.

167
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:33,485
The Lord is my shepherd.
I lack nothing.

168
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:35,987
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

169
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:38,540
Leaves me beside the quiet waters.

170
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,325
Refreshes my soul.

171
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:41,960
He guides me along the right path

172
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,962
for His name's sake.

173
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:46,164
Even though I walk through
the darkest valley,

174
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,301
I will fear no evil, for You are with me.

175
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:52,337
Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.

176
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:55,674
You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

177
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,143
You anoint my head with oil.

178
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:00,512
My cup overflows.

179
00:14:00,564 --> 00:14:04,099
Surely Your goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life

180
00:14:04,184 --> 00:14:07,152
and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord evermore.

181
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:08,987
- Amen.
- Amen.

182
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,452
Mr. Underhill.

183
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,342
All his wealth, all his ambitions,

184
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:33,929
yet here he rests.

185
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:37,883
One might see a lesson in that.

186
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:42,437
Before you return home,

187
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:44,806
I had hoped that you and
I might share a word.

188
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,777
Privately.

189
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:51,646
What do you wish to speak about?

190
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,983
Ambition, sir.

191
00:14:56,153 --> 00:14:57,619
Yours and mine.

192
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,493
Total reconciliation?

193
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:06,077
This is what you're suggesting?

194
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:07,879
A return to colonial rule

195
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:10,465
with an existing power structure in place.

196
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:15,136
And I am to believe that
500 hardened pirate raiders

197
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:17,422
will voluntarily step down,

198
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:20,809
fall in line with this plan of
yours and volunteer their labor?

199
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:23,595
Not all of them.
A lot of them. Most of them.

200
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,730
Enough to resist those that won't.

201
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:29,017
Enough to make it worth
giving them a chance.

202
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:31,520
I made an appeal to my crew of 100 men.

203
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:34,155
And better than 70 of
them are sitting right now

204
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:37,325
just outside your harbor
in full support of it.

205
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:40,445
It is exactly as Thomas proposed

206
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:42,280
- all those years ago in London.
- Yes.

207
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:43,949
But then we were talking
about less than half

208
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:46,952
the number of criminals on the island.

209
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:51,122
We were talking about a failing colony,
not a failed one.

210
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:53,458
We also didn't have the
most respected captain

211
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:56,711
on the island standing
in advocacy of our plan.

212
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,096
Now we do.

213
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,298
We didn't have the trade boss of the island

214
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:02,467
actively working to reform operations then.

215
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,135
Now we do.

216
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:06,972
And we didn't have a man
who has established himself

217
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:10,475
as the New World's most committed
pirate hunter endorsing it.

218
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:26,958
The first thing that they
will ask for is a name.

219
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,248
- A name?
- It is as true now as it was then.

220
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:36,334
New Providence will only ever succeed

221
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:38,587
insofar as its governor can make it so.

222
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:43,892
Were I to make this case to
the men I know in Whitehall...

223
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,727
the first question that they will ask

224
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:48,680
is who will oversee all this?

225
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:52,901
Who will be responsible
for its success or failure?

226
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:54,903
You?

227
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:03,995
There are things that I can do to
help protect the fledgling colony.

228
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:08,033
I can help establish the militia.

229
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:09,951
I can organize the navy.

230
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:12,203
But beyond that,

231
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:16,374
I don't think that there's a part
for Captain Flint in Nassau's future.

232
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,209
Not with the blood on his hands.

233
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:23,882
He will have to go away

234
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:26,885
and leave James McGraw and Lady Hamilton

235
00:17:26,937 --> 00:17:30,138
to retire to the interior in peace.

236
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,693
Yes?

237
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:40,649
Father, Mrs. Tyler says it's time

238
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:42,400
to turn the room over for dinner.

239
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:44,402
Please ask Mrs. Tyler to arrange a room

240
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:46,237
for our guests to retire to in the interim.

241
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,500
Something wrong?

242
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:04,089
Nerves.

243
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:06,091
I'm fine.

244
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:41,459
If we're so worried he's gonna
find something up there...

245
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,130
what are we still doing here?

246
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:48,183
Where exactly do you think we'd go?

247
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:50,385
Charles Town is sleeping with one eye open

248
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,138
and a knife under its pillow tonight.

249
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:54,973
Any one of us sets foot on that sand

250
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:57,025
absent an engraved
invitation from the governor

251
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,527
is likely to greet the sunrise swinging.

252
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:04,816
We arrived on this ship.

253
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:09,154
Until and unless Captain Flint
is successful in his endeavor,

254
00:19:09,236 --> 00:19:11,519
this ship is the only
way we leave here alive.

255
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:22,447
If he was suspicious,
he'd have come down by now.

256
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,700
I'm going to find Randall.

257
00:19:25,752 --> 00:19:28,203
See who I can ridicule
for the crew's amusement.

258
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:53,394
Randall.

259
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,564
Crew address is due at next bells.

260
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:58,696
If you have anything new
for me by the way of gossip,

261
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:01,069
now... would...

262
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:04,455
be the...

263
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:09,244
time.

264
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:02,430
DeGroot!

265
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,098
Danger!

266
00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:31,295
Secure!

267
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:35,106
Tie 'em up.
Down in the well with 'em.

268
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:42,613
Take them alive.

269
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,574
He doesn't want to consider it.

270
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,828
He spent so many years hardening
himself to these ideas.

271
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:02,083
But I don't think he can
work out how to say no.

272
00:23:02,135 --> 00:23:05,420
If he says no, it means there's
a part of him that is no more.

273
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,806
A part of him he doesn't want to let go of.

274
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:10,508
Did you mean it?

275
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,813
Earlier.

276
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:18,933
You said Captain Flint
would have to disappear

277
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:20,568
for this plan to work.

278
00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:23,104
Are you truly ready to let him go?

279
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:31,195
Did I ever tell you where
that name came from?

280
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,582
No.

281
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:40,621
I told you of my grandfather who raised me.

282
00:23:40,673 --> 00:23:42,957
A fisherman in Padstow.

283
00:23:45,178 --> 00:23:48,379
Well, in his youth

284
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:51,382
he was a deckhand on a privateer

285
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:53,468
off the coast of Massachusetts.

286
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,022
And one night he was
alone on the late watch

287
00:23:58,108 --> 00:23:59,891
at anchor in the Boston Harbor

288
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:03,895
when he sees this man

289
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,448
climbing out of the
water and onto his ship.

290
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:09,233
A stranger.

291
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,788
Now, my grandfather thought
about ringing the bell,

292
00:24:13,823 --> 00:24:16,874
but curiosity got the better of him.

293
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:20,661
The stranger approaches my grandfather

294
00:24:20,747 --> 00:24:22,830
and asks him for a little rum.

295
00:24:22,882 --> 00:24:27,085
Man said that he'd fled
his fishing trawler.

296
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,387
Accused of killing another man.

297
00:24:29,472 --> 00:24:32,006
And when asked his name,

298
00:24:32,092 --> 00:24:35,510
the man simply replied

299
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:37,095
Mr. Flint.

300
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,433
This stranger, he never said whether

301
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,771
he was guilty of the killing
or why he chose that ship

302
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:49,774
or where he was bound, he just...

303
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:53,444
just sat there.

304
00:24:55,698 --> 00:24:57,448
Eventually, he asked my grandfather

305
00:24:57,534 --> 00:25:00,201
for a little more rum from below.

306
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:02,286
My grandfather went off to fetch it,

307
00:25:02,372 --> 00:25:06,124
but when he returned...

308
00:25:07,877 --> 00:25:10,344
the man was gone.

309
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,214
My grandfather was in Boston
for a month after that.

310
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,016
Never heard a word about a killing

311
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:18,519
or a fugitive at large.

312
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,641
It was as if the sea had
conjured that man out of nothing

313
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:27,228
and then taken him back

314
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,864
for some unknowable purpose.

315
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:38,406
When I first met Mr. Gates

316
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,324
and he asked me my name...

317
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:46,080
I feared the man I was about to create.

318
00:25:48,635 --> 00:25:51,502
I feared that someone
born of such dark things

319
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:54,255
would consume me were I not careful.

320
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:56,974
And I was determined only
to wear him for a while

321
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,596
and then dispose of him when
his purpose was complete.

322
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:04,015
And I thought of that story.

323
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:14,292
Am I ready to let him go?

324
00:26:17,581 --> 00:26:19,080
Truth is...

325
00:26:20,968 --> 00:26:22,417
every day I've worn that name

326
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:24,753
I've hated him a little more.

327
00:26:27,808 --> 00:26:30,926
I've been ready to return him
to the sea for a long time.

328
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:36,598
James...

329
00:26:40,854 --> 00:26:42,320
They're ready for you downstairs.

330
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:32,737
What the fuck do we do now?

331
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:35,907
The moment this ship is clear of the area,
if not sooner,

332
00:27:35,993 --> 00:27:37,626
Captain Vane will put the crew
to the sword, yes?

333
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:39,327
Most likely.

334
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:43,498
Eventually,
they find us down here and do the same.

335
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:46,718
So either we swim to the beach
and likely face the noose,

336
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:49,337
or else do nothing,
in which case it's the sword.

337
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,706
Come with me.

338
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:26,207
Where are we going?

339
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:29,210
To execute the third option.

340
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:32,047
Persuade Captain Vane
to surrender the ship.

341
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:38,553
Governor Ashe? He's coming here?

342
00:28:38,605 --> 00:28:41,056
Plans are underway as we speak.

343
00:28:41,108 --> 00:28:44,059
When he arrives,
I propose that you and I greet him together

344
00:28:44,144 --> 00:28:47,228
and we explain to him our joint
venture to reclaim Nassau.

345
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,232
My ships, your sugar.

346
00:28:51,318 --> 00:28:54,736
The return of legitimate
commerce and the return of law.

347
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:57,989
For so many years

348
00:28:58,075 --> 00:29:00,542
I have watched you and your kind

349
00:29:00,577 --> 00:29:03,545
thieve and whore

350
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,631
and kill like a plague upon this island,

351
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:08,967
doing whatever you please because you can.

352
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:11,836
I've heard your appeal.

353
00:29:14,758 --> 00:29:17,425
How could I be expected
to trust one of you?

354
00:29:17,477 --> 00:29:19,427
How could you trust a pirate?

355
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,730
Exactly.

356
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:24,432
I am no pirate, sir.

357
00:29:24,484 --> 00:29:26,234
I'm an Englishwoman.

358
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:28,103
I'm my father's daughter.

359
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:31,690
And I will be the end of piracy in
this place and it begins tonight.

360
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:34,359
What do you mean?

361
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:37,529
I discovered a plan by
one of the crews on the beach

362
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:41,199
to reclaim a prize that is so large
it would upset our world here.

363
00:29:41,284 --> 00:29:45,036
Embolden piracy for years,
possibly decades to come.

364
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:47,255
I identified the members of that crew

365
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,791
with the specific knowledge of
the whereabouts of that prize.

366
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:53,461
And I have ended their
endeavor before it began.

367
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:56,715
You've ended it? How?

368
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:15,116
Shh.

369
00:30:34,337 --> 00:30:36,254
You're back.

370
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,223
Just landed.

371
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:54,189
I shouldn't have left the way I did,

372
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:55,990
without telling you.

373
00:30:57,694 --> 00:31:00,528
Wasn't your fault what happened.

374
00:31:00,614 --> 00:31:02,447
It was a hard fucking choice put on you.

375
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:04,866
I didn't think I was gonna see you again.

376
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,839
I thought you'd just get to Port Royal
and board a ship and never look back.

377
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,626
I thought about it.

378
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:22,934
But then I...

379
00:31:30,477 --> 00:31:31,643
What?

380
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:35,980
Then I...

381
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:34,289
My lord,

382
00:32:34,374 --> 00:32:36,708
I know there are many reasons
to say no to this, however...

383
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:39,043
- Colonel Rhett.
- Yes, sir.

384
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:44,849
I'd like everyone to clear the room.

385
00:32:44,935 --> 00:32:46,718
Sir?

386
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:51,222
I'd like to speak with my
guests privately for a moment.

387
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:54,275
Wait in the hall, please.

388
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,880
I believe there is a
way that I can help you

389
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:18,499
achieve your intentions
for the future of Nassau.

390
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:21,419
And I am ready to do it.

391
00:33:23,556 --> 00:33:24,923
However,

392
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:28,810
my plan will require an act of you,
Mr. McGraw,

393
00:33:28,845 --> 00:33:31,012
if it is to succeed.

394
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:37,018
And I don't think you're going to like it.

395
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:45,024
Are you hurt?

396
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,725
Mostly unscathed, thanks to Anne.

397
00:33:54,235 --> 00:33:57,486
Mr. Stayton and Mr. Atz are dead.

398
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:00,456
Jesus.

399
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:03,208
It would be wise not
to tempt fate any further.

400
00:34:03,244 --> 00:34:06,161
Eleanor will be returning from
the interior sooner than later.

401
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:08,547
Can you sail without those men?

402
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,420
Yes.

403
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:16,722
Fuck it.

404
00:34:16,757 --> 00:34:19,091
Fuck her.

405
00:34:19,176 --> 00:34:21,093
We leave now.

406
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:28,400
Go get us our prize.

407
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:14,313
Shift capstan bars.

408
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:16,398
Snap and go, boys.

409
00:35:16,484 --> 00:35:18,650
Raise anchor.

410
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:24,957
Wait. You certain this is a good idea?

411
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:28,127
Yes. We sever the forestay,
the ship can't sail till it's repaired

412
00:35:28,162 --> 00:35:29,922
- which could take hours, yes?
- Yeah, but...

413
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:31,663
The longer Captain Vane
remains in this harbor,

414
00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:33,165
the more dangerous it is for him

415
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,417
and the more likely it
is that Captain Flint

416
00:35:35,503 --> 00:35:37,002
might just win over the governor

417
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,837
and bring his militia to
bear to retake the ship.

418
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:42,057
I understand that, but the moment
you go out there to sever that line,

419
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:44,560
they'll send a team of men down
here to clear the hold again.

420
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:46,145
We evaded them once.

421
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,897
Which makes trying it a second
time that much more insane.

422
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:52,818
Perhaps.

423
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:06,865
But I see no other way that I...

424
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:11,036
we survive this ordeal.

425
00:36:11,122 --> 00:36:12,122
I can.

426
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:14,590
We swim and hope for the best.

427
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:18,127
It'd be dangerous,
but it wouldn't be suicide.

428
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:19,628
Just tell me this,

429
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:22,181
are you suggesting we do
this to save ourselves

430
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:24,850
or are you suggesting we
do it to save the crew?

431
00:37:16,937 --> 00:37:20,439
You're the boatswain.
Mr. Gates's boy, aren't you?

432
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:30,616
I've got a confession to make.

433
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:32,751
The Singleton affair,

434
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:35,454
when Jack and I attempted to
alter the vote on your ship,

435
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:37,873
see Flint deposed,

436
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:42,461
it was intended to induce key
men on your crew to defect.

437
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:45,797
Then to recruit them ourselves.

438
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:48,717
But most specifically,

439
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:51,103
it was with an eye toward recruiting you.

440
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:53,805
We'd heard about you.

441
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:55,838
Not some petty thief in it for coin.

442
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:58,624
Not some coward

443
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,877
in need of a bottle to find
his courage in a fight.

444
00:38:01,962 --> 00:38:04,296
A proper pirate

445
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,382
committed to our way of things.

446
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,267
Committed to a life free of the yoke...

447
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:09,518
Fuck you.

448
00:38:11,305 --> 00:38:13,689
And loyal to a fault.

449
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,395
You can see how that

450
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,865
is a man we'd have wanted
on our side of things.

451
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,154
A man I could still use now.

452
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:37,162
You have no fucking idea
what's going on here,

453
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,664
do you?

454
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,300
Flint stole from me and
I'm making it right.

455
00:38:41,335 --> 00:38:43,886
Exactly. You hate Flint.

456
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,673
I hate Flint.

457
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:54,346
But right now he's talking about
how we survive what comes next.

458
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:57,182
And you're talking about
what you think is yours.

459
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,685
When the navy arrives,
they aren't gonna give a fuck

460
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,820
what belongs to you or what belongs to me.

461
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:05,824
Because to them,
there is no difference between you and me.

462
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,610
He has you so afraid of an imagined threat.

463
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:11,497
Nah.

464
00:39:11,532 --> 00:39:15,617
I saw it with my own eyes.

465
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:18,036
The garrison on Harbour Island.

466
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,706
Royal Marines, a full company of them.

467
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,791
200 men in support.

468
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:24,760
The Scarborough anchored.

469
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:26,879
And a commander just waiting for the order

470
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,714
to begin his assault against us

471
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,549
and exterminate every last one us.

472
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,435
There is nothing imagined about the threat

473
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,888
we all face, I assure you.

474
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,273
And right now your only
plan to reckon with it

475
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:39,892
is to try and fight them head to head,

476
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,728
each crew for themselves?

477
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:49,118
Right now, Flint's plan is the only plan.

478
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,430
Forestay!

479
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:21,099
Forestay, Captain!

480
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,783
- What's going on?
- We lost the forestay.

481
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,785
Lost it? Fuck you mean, we lost it?

482
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:44,373
Sabotage. We must have missed someone.

483
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:45,791
Can we sail without it?

484
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,460
Not without seriously
risking losing that mast.

485
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,963
Drop the anchors. Repair the stay quickly.

486
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,598
I'll get a team, clear the hold.

487
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:54,132
No.

488
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,884
I don't want to divert men
away from the prisoners.

489
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,188
We can't leave a saboteur down there.

490
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:00,772
I don't intend to.

491
00:41:12,286 --> 00:41:14,870
There are men in Whitehall
who could potentially find

492
00:41:14,955 --> 00:41:17,990
a proposal such as yours to be plausible.

493
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:22,044
On religious grounds, on economic grounds.

494
00:41:22,129 --> 00:41:24,079
I know some of these men.

495
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:27,165
You could almost certainly
win them to your side.

496
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,752
But there are other men who
will oppose it categorically

497
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:34,840
for the same reason all men
refuse to do things they should.

498
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,142
Pride.

499
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,930
You think they're too proud
to put pardons on the table?

500
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:43,515
I think they fear you.

501
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,684
And to capitulate to something one fears

502
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:49,354
is a humiliation that
powerful men cannot accept.

503
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:52,691
If we are to persuade
them to ally with you,

504
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,193
then we have to completely redefine

505
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,496
their understanding of who you are,

506
00:41:57,531 --> 00:41:59,414
what you are.

507
00:42:00,868 --> 00:42:03,585
How do you propose we do that?

508
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:05,754
With the truth.

509
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,625
I will come with you to Nassau,
survey the situation.

510
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,209
If it is as you say it is,

511
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,180
you and I will sail to London together.

512
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:17,466
And when we arrive,

513
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:20,636
you will stand up

514
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:22,387
and you will tell your story.

515
00:42:25,392 --> 00:42:27,309
My story?

516
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,563
What part of my story?

517
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,532
All of it.

518
00:42:37,905 --> 00:42:40,989
You will tell them about
the affair with Thomas.

519
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:46,244
You will tell them how it ended.

520
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:49,214
You will explain to them
what it drove you to do.

521
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,584
You will reveal everything.

522
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,087
And when you do,

523
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,673
Captain Flint will be unmasked,

524
00:42:57,758 --> 00:42:59,508
the monster slain.

525
00:43:01,228 --> 00:43:05,564
And in his place will stand
before all the world a flawed man,

526
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,933
a man that England can relate to

527
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,936
and offer its forgiveness.

528
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:36,962
What you're asking of me...

529
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:41,717
I wish there were another way,

530
00:43:41,802 --> 00:43:44,636
but I have given it great
thought and I cannot find it.

531
00:43:49,476 --> 00:43:51,777
Tell me this is something
that you are willing to do,

532
00:43:51,812 --> 00:43:54,863
and you and I will walk
out of this house together,

533
00:43:54,948 --> 00:43:58,066
announce our partnership to the street,

534
00:43:58,152 --> 00:44:00,652
and prepare to set sail for Nassau.

535
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,907
Your clock by the wall...

536
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:41,026
where did you obtain it?

537
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,863
What?

538
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,115
It looks very much like
one that used to reside

539
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:49,167
in my husband's parlor in London.

540
00:44:49,203 --> 00:44:51,203
Identical, in fact.

541
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,171
I don't remember gifting it to you.

542
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:54,673
It was there when I left.

543
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:57,342
So I ask again,

544
00:44:57,377 --> 00:45:00,128
how is it you came to possess that clock?

545
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,549
It was a gift.

546
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:05,767
From whom?

547
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,977
From Alfred Hamilton.

548
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:21,566
The earl was no friend of yours,

549
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,902
yet he grants you gifts from his own home.

550
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,487
Why would he do that?

551
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,660
All these years it never sat right with me

552
00:45:31,745 --> 00:45:35,213
how Alfred was able to turn
the navy against James.

553
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:37,582
He was far too admired by his superiors

554
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:41,586
for his career to be dashed
by solely on hearsay.

555
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:46,475
Alfred would have known that.

556
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,093
He wouldn't have gone to them

557
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,763
armed only with unfounded suspicions.

558
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,732
He would have needed a witness,

559
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:57,686
someone who knew Thomas

560
00:45:57,771 --> 00:45:59,738
and James well enough

561
00:45:59,773 --> 00:46:02,107
to give the accusation credibility.

562
00:46:05,112 --> 00:46:07,579
Alfred came to you, didn't he?

563
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:11,917
Asked you to betray Thomas
in exchange for which he'd...

564
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:14,786
see you made a king in the New World.

565
00:46:23,463 --> 00:46:25,764
Perhaps this is an opportunity for us all

566
00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:27,465
to find a little forgiveness.

567
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,351
Forgiveness?

568
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:33,138
What forgiveness are you entitled to

569
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,357
while you stand back in the shadows

570
00:46:35,442 --> 00:46:37,976
pushing James out in front of the world

571
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:40,979
to be laid bear for the sake of the truth?

572
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,399
Tell me, sir, when does the truth

573
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:46,284
about your sins come to light?

574
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,988
You know nothing of my sins.

575
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,290
Were you there when
Alfred Hamilton threatened

576
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:54,826
my family's standing, my daughter's future

577
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,328
if I failed to cooperate?

578
00:46:56,413 --> 00:47:01,249
Were you there when I visited
Thomas at the hospital

579
00:47:01,335 --> 00:47:03,835
to confess my sins and heard him offer

580
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,338
his full and true forgiveness?

581
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,557
He knew I had no choice in the matter.

582
00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:11,509
- No choice?
- A hard choice.

583
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,728
Made under great duress,
but with the intent

584
00:47:13,814 --> 00:47:16,097
to achieve the least awful outcome.

585
00:47:16,183 --> 00:47:18,516
You wish to return to civilization.

586
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:21,069
That is what civilization is.

587
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:30,028
I am so very sorry for
what you have suffered

588
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,197
and for any part I may have played in it.

589
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,032
Please believe that.

590
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,751
But at this point, the most important thing

591
00:47:36,837 --> 00:47:39,170
is what comes next, what we make of this.

592
00:47:39,206 --> 00:47:42,007
- You destroyed our lives!
- Miranda.

593
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:44,259
- You caused our exile!
- I am sorry for what I did.

594
00:47:44,344 --> 00:47:47,545
- Thomas died in a cold, dark place...
- I am trying to help you.

595
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,431
- What more do you want from me?
- What do I want?

596
00:47:49,516 --> 00:47:51,466
I want to see this whole goddamn city,

597
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,887
this city that you purchased
with our misery, burn.

598
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,857
I want to see you hanged
on the very gallows

599
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:01,893
you've used to hang men for
crimes far slighter than this.

600
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:04,229
I want to see that noose around your neck

601
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,865
and I want to pull the fucking
lever with my own two hands!

602
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:14,155
This is not what I wanted.

603
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:15,740
Do not shoot him.

604
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,293
Don't shoot!

605
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,606
We have a deal, then?

606
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:51,776
Yes.

607
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:58,950
We must get back before we're missed.

608
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,618
We have much work to do.

609
00:49:01,955 --> 00:49:04,122
Your father...

610
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,291
when he came to me seeking sanctuary,

611
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:09,127
telling me he wished to resist the
continued presence of the pirates,

612
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:13,381
he told me he'd repented for his past sins.

613
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:15,100
He seemed so genuinely contrite.

614
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,688
I knew his reputation.
I knew he was most likely

615
00:49:19,773 --> 00:49:22,807
telling me the story I wanted to hear,

616
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,777
but his contrition was utilitarian at best.

617
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:28,613
But you,

618
00:49:28,648 --> 00:49:31,533
you don't even seem to be
wanting to appear that way.

619
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:36,821
The time for storytelling is past.

620
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:39,240
Now is the time for cold, hard truths.

621
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,889
What is this?

622
00:49:54,975 --> 00:49:57,008
Who are you?

623
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:01,229
Are you Underhill?

624
00:50:01,314 --> 00:50:04,682
- I am.
- Then I suggest you step aside, sir.

625
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,351
We've no quarrel with you.

626
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:10,739
However, we will be taking the girl.

627
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:05,994
Launch approaching!

628
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:26,764
Hello.

629
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,776
Hello.

630
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,200
Man your stations.

631
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:47,118
Ready the guns.

632
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:52,090
- What's happening?
- Shut the fuck up.

633
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,304
So...

634
00:52:08,308 --> 00:52:10,975
what do you suppose happens next?

635
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,862
Pirate vessel!

636
00:52:13,947 --> 00:52:16,114
Pirate vessel!

637
00:52:16,149 --> 00:52:19,150
What follows is a message

638
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,370
from the Lord Governor
of the Carolina Colony.

639
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:24,572
"I trusted the good faith of your arrival

640
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:27,158
and I accepted Captain Flint as my guest

641
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,294
in the same spirit.

642
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:31,629
But I now regret to inform you

643
00:52:31,665 --> 00:52:34,916
that he has violated that trust
in a most deceitful manner."

644
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:38,836
- What?
- "Therefore I've placed him under arrest.

645
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:42,173
This trial and its resulting sentence

646
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:45,810
will be swift, just, and final.

647
00:52:45,845 --> 00:52:49,264
And it will reestablish
beyond any shadow of a doubt

648
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:53,401
that the rule of law lives in Carolina,

649
00:52:53,486 --> 00:52:56,521
that the men and women of this place

650
00:52:56,573 --> 00:53:00,108
will not shrink from you, from any of you,

651
00:53:00,193 --> 00:53:02,694
from any like you,

652
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:05,530
and that the death of
piracy in the New World

653
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:09,450
has never been nearer than today.

654
00:53:09,536 --> 00:53:11,536
At the conclusion of this trial,

655
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:16,090
if your ship remains,
I will seize or sink her."

656
00:53:25,885 --> 00:53:29,887
Now, let me tell you what happens next.

657
00:54:07,594 --> 00:54:09,093
You were right.

658
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:16,017
Right about what?

659
00:54:16,102 --> 00:54:19,354
They can't tell the
difference between you and I.

660
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:26,995
Nassau is strongest when she's feared.

661
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,163
And if what promises
to happen here tomorrow

662
00:54:29,249 --> 00:54:32,166
actually happens, a trophy

663
00:54:32,252 --> 00:54:36,287
made of one of her most notorious captains,

664
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,840
she may never be feared again.

665
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:42,760
So I suggest we do something about this.

666
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:46,214
I suggest we...

667
00:54:46,299 --> 00:54:48,266
get him the hell out of there.

668
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,368
Captain Hume.

669
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:12,490
I understand you hold in
your possession 10 pardons

670
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:17,211
for whomever was to deliver
you Captain James Flint.

671
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:19,213
I wonder if I can't do better.

672
00:55:30,143 --> 00:55:33,177
This is Eleanor Guthrie,
the trade boss of Nassau,

673
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:36,981
the woman who lorded over
a savage pirate kingdom

674
00:55:37,016 --> 00:55:39,016
as if it were a plaything.

675
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:42,487
And without whom it cannot function.

676
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,773
Imagine, sir, how London would react

677
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:48,359
to the arrival of the queen of thieves.

678
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:50,828
Imagine the spectacle of her trial.

679
00:55:52,198 --> 00:55:53,998
Imagine the celebrity

680
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:56,667
that'll be heaped upon her captor.
