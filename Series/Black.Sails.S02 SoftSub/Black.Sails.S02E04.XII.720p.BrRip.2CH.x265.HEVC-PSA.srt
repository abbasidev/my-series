1
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:14,151
Land ho!

2
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:15,853
I'd like to go back and retrieve the gold.

3
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:17,855
Refit, hire a consort, finish the job.

4
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:20,108
- Is that possible?
- Well, it might have been possible.

5
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:22,359
Before the bay fell into
the hands of a madman.

6
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:24,078
Either we act now to
remove him or no one will.

7
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:26,580
Congratulations, Jack.

8
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:28,916
Now you know what it's like
to rise from the grave.

9
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:31,035
We're gonna sail again.

10
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:33,587
Your judgment with her is clouded at best.

11
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:35,422
And there's nothing I can do to counter it

12
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,208
when I'm on the wrong side of that door.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,044
Found the prize they was hiding.

14
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:41,545
Her father is Lord Peter Ashe,

15
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:43,264
governor of the Carolina colony.

16
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:45,215
Lord Ashe won't be trifled with.

17
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:47,351
I have no intentions of trifling with him.

18
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:50,938
Charles Vane and the animals he commands

19
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:54,391
have until sunrise tomorrow
to vacate that fort

20
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:56,443
or, so help me God,

21
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,129
I will rain holy hell down upon him.

22
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,266
Go on.

23
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,937
"If you fail to meet these demands,"

24
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:39,022
if you remain when the deadline arrives,

25
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:41,391
I will respond swiftly and definitively.

26
00:03:41,444 --> 00:03:45,395
And as I currently sit fully
outside your means of retaliation,

27
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:49,199
this response will continue
unabated until you,

28
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:52,903
your men, and that structure
are rendered fully incapacitated.

29
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:55,539
"Until dawn, Captain James Flint."

30
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:08,001
Get him out of here.

31
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:11,505
Put him behind a door somewhere.

32
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:14,424
I want him whole when
he delivers my answer.

33
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,539
Make ready the guns in the northwest.

34
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:24,234
Move everything we have
to the southwest bastion.

35
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,571
He's telling the truth.
The southwest bastion

36
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:30,491
is too weak to support
any batteries at all.

37
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:35,946
We have no guns that
can reach his position.

38
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:41,952
Somehow Flint knew exactly
where to sit to take advantage.

39
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:46,874
Then find out how close I can get.

40
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:49,426
Now.

41
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:06,476
Tell me right now you had
nothing to do with this.

42
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:09,062
- Charles, look at me.
- Tell me this isn't part of your plan

43
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:11,365
- to push me into the sea.
- Look at me.

44
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,989
I had no idea this was coming.

45
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,375
I had no idea that Flint
would be so fucking reckless

46
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,493
as to threaten the fort itself.

47
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:25,913
I had no idea Hornigold
would be so fucking petty

48
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:27,548
as to divulge secrets about its weaknesses,

49
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,083
risk its destruction for
his own personal gain.

50
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:32,336
I told you what I would do
if challenged like this.

51
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:33,921
- I know.
- I may not be able to hit his ship,

52
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:35,505
but I can hit the rest of them.

53
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:37,841
I can turn that whole
goddamn bay into a graveyard.

54
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:40,177
- But you won't.
- You doubt me?

55
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:44,014
No, I have faith in your ability

56
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:46,266
to formulate a plan more
effective than this.

57
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:53,073
The initial barrage will be
targeted at the southeast bastion.

58
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:54,942
Once the turrets are destroyed,
we'll turn our aim

59
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:57,194
to the weaker of the defensive walls.

60
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:59,529
Hammer them until the interior is exposed

61
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:03,033
and the fort is vulnerable to
an assault from the ground.

62
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:06,587
At this point, there's no limit
to the damage we can inflict.

63
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:09,206
- How long to rebuild?
- Rebuild?

64
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:12,042
After we secure possession
of what's left of the fort,

65
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:14,894
how long will it take you and your
men to rebuild what we've destroyed?

66
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:19,049
10 weeks before the batteries are restored.

67
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:21,885
Twice that to resecure the interior.

68
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:23,887
It is a risk,

69
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,857
but a relatively short
window in the grand scheme.

70
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:29,443
A short window that coincides
with a British warship

71
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:31,945
sitting in anchor 40 miles from here

72
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:34,982
and my having stolen a Spanish warship

73
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:37,067
in full view of a company
of Spanish soldiers.

74
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:44,408
We'll just have to keep our fingers
crossed for a while, then, won't we?

75
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,827
Are you suggesting the threat we posed

76
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,464
to Captain Vane is an empty one and we
have no intent of following through?

77
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:52,499
I am fully committed, as are we all,

78
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:55,085
to the removal
of Captain Vane from that fort.

79
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:57,170
But we'd be fools to ignore

80
00:06:57,222 --> 00:06:59,506
the catastrophic risks
that lie down this road.

81
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:02,009
I have committed men
and resources to aid you

82
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:03,727
in retrieving the Urca gold.

83
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:06,596
In exchange for which you've
assured me of your assistance

84
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:10,434
of expelling Captain Vane from
that fort by any means necessary.

85
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:13,270
Now, as I hear you waver,

86
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:17,441
I feel forced to ask,
if the sun rises tomorrow

87
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:19,943
and Vane has not ceded to our demands,

88
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:22,112
then what will you do?

89
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:45,518
I was told it was urgent.

90
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,570
He said he wanted to see you right away.

91
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,825
What about?

92
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,577
It's all right.
It has nothing to do with you and I.

93
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,209
He'll be arriving in less than two hours.

94
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:13,077
I'm sorry, who?

95
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:15,799
The fourth Earl of Ashbourne.

96
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:18,635
Lord Proprietor to the Carolina colony,

97
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,186
including the Bahama Islands,

98
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:21,721
and peer of the realm.

99
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:23,807
Lord Alfred Hamilton.

100
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:26,192
My father.

101
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:29,279
I'm told he expects a
full report of our efforts

102
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:32,399
to devise a plan for the
management of Nassau.

103
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:35,702
And you're concerned how he'll receive it?

104
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:38,405
I'm concerned about how he'll
receive one particular part of it.

105
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:42,158
The part you and I have yet to discuss.

106
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:45,545
I didn't think we had one of those.

107
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:51,668
These past few months

108
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,304
I have come to trust you.

109
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:56,923
Very much.

110
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:59,509
Which is why I feel I
can ask for your help.

111
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:02,345
When my father arrives,
I intend to propose something to him

112
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:04,347
which could be very dangerous politically.

113
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:06,816
What is it you want me to help you with?

114
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:10,603
I want you to try to talk me out of it.

115
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:47,557
Yes?

116
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,810
Ma'am, you're needed.

117
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:52,612
All right.

118
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:22,676
It's a Spanish warship!

119
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:26,913
There's a Spanish galleon
anchored in the harbor!

120
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:30,167
Is today some sort of holiday
that I've forgotten about?

121
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:33,036
Spanish warship anchored in the bay.

122
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:35,205
Word is it's Flint's crew sailing her.

123
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:38,508
And it's scaring the shit
out of everyone on the beach.

124
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:42,045
Flint's sailing a Spanish warship?

125
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:44,347
Think we should try and
lure some of them inside?

126
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:52,189
Wait. Does he have it?

127
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:53,774
Does he have what?

128
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:55,559
Did Flint get to the Urca gold?

129
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:56,893
I don't know.

130
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:22,419
Hold there.

131
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,007
The fuck are you doing?

132
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,176
The situation is as we feared.

133
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:32,095
That warship is fully
outside our field of fire.

134
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:36,149
And given our severe disadvantage,

135
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:39,186
might she provide us valuable leverage?

136
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,938
Make sure Flint knows the
moment he fires those guns,

137
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,275
her body gets dumped over the wall.

138
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:47,077
Your reply to Flint will be significantly

139
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:48,445
more effective if it
comes from me personally.

140
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:50,330
You might want to keep quiet now, miss.

141
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:54,117
You have questions about my loyalties

142
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:56,086
as it relates to Miss Guthrie?

143
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,926
Then accuse me. Challenge me. Fight me.

144
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:05,762
Or shut the fuck up about it.

145
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,299
Open the gate!

146
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:08,325
What are you doing here?

147
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:11,111
Putting an end to this.

148
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:19,787
Miss Guthrie.

149
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:23,757
Captain Vane has issued a
reply to your ultimatum.

150
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:26,092
It's being read aloud on
the beach as we speak.

151
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:29,963
I think you should see it.

152
00:13:37,306 --> 00:13:40,056
Give us the room.

153
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:42,475
- I have as much right...
- Now, please!

154
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,960
"You must ask yourselves who represents"

155
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:04,080
the greater threat to your interests...

156
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:07,383
my men in this fort

157
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:09,635
"or the madman on the water."

158
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:11,637
It's effective.

159
00:14:11,673 --> 00:14:13,923
Mm, I can see that.

160
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:18,478
What I cannot see is how
Charles Vane alone was clever enough

161
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:20,813
to turn this all into political theater

162
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:24,267
in which he is the defender
of the island's welfare.

163
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:26,602
Are you suggesting he had
help in crafting his reply?

164
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:29,238
Did he?

165
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:32,024
Were I to have aided
Captain Vane against your efforts,

166
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:35,361
helped him move into a more
favorable position last night,

167
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:39,699
what would such a move say about the
trust you and I are supposed to share?

168
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:42,418
I believe I was clear yesterday
about the danger he represents

169
00:14:42,453 --> 00:14:44,704
and my desire to see him
removed from that fort.

170
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:46,372
Though you conveniently omitted the part

171
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:48,257
about how you were prepared
to use a Spanish warship

172
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,009
to annihilate the fort to achieve that end.

173
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:52,461
Your refusal to acknowledge the urgency

174
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:54,630
of the situation gave me no choice but...

175
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:58,601
But to do what? Disregard our partnership?

176
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,970
Ignore the resources and influence
and trust I have invested in you?

177
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:03,472
This isn't personal.

178
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,641
It's too important for that.

179
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:09,312
All right, then.

180
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:11,230
What is it you wish to accomplish here?

181
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:14,951
To see him removed from the fort.

182
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:18,788
Then this is a stupid fucking
way of going about it.

183
00:15:18,823 --> 00:15:21,958
He'll never voluntarily leave if he
thinks it will show weakness to do so.

184
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:23,993
You want him out, here's how you do it.

185
00:15:23,995 --> 00:15:27,914
You move this ship.
You allow him to save face on this score.

186
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:32,468
And then you and he and I sit down
at a table and we sort it out.

187
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:37,473
Eleanor,
I don't care if he leaves voluntarily.

188
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:42,645
If I give up this position,
I will never regain it.

189
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,681
And without this position,
the decision is his and his alone.

190
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,400
No, I simply cannot risk that.

191
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:48,818
Not with what's at stake.

192
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:50,519
You are talking about rendering this bay,

193
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:52,655
rendering Nassau completely unprotected.

194
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,358
I know!

195
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,660
And I am perfectly aware of
the danger that presents.

196
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,664
But when it comes to Charles Vane, you and
I simply do not see him in the same way.

197
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:06,953
Now, if you can see a way,

198
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:09,622
an effective, credible way out of this

199
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:11,624
that doesn't involve disabling the fort,

200
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:13,542
I would love to hear it.

201
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,011
If you think that he will hear reason.

202
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:16,762
Not with you holding a gun to his head.

203
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:18,547
Then I suggest you talk to him.

204
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:20,933
Because one way or another,
he is leaving that fort.

205
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:23,219
And right now my way is the only way

206
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:24,770
that I can be certain of that.

207
00:17:09,017 --> 00:17:11,934
My name is Charles Vane
and you are now my guest.

208
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:15,855
As such, no harm will come to you
as long as you do exactly as I say.

209
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:18,357
You understand?

210
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:24,280
The other one, he said no talking.

211
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,249
Captain Low?

212
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:31,287
You don't need to worry about him anymore.

213
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,006
How can you be sure?

214
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:37,543
I cut his head off.

215
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:45,468
Good.

216
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:51,974
Now, your father is Lord Peter Ashe,

217
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:55,227
governor of the Carolina colony.
Is that right?

218
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:58,898
What is the total value of his estate?

219
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,483
I don't know.

220
00:18:00,535 --> 00:18:03,870
How many rooms in his house?
How many slaves?

221
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:06,823
Honestly, I don't know.
Haven't seen him in years.

222
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,077
I've been at school in London.

223
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:12,545
Are you close with him?

224
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:14,497
What?

225
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:17,217
I'm asking if there's any
reason I should expect

226
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:21,387
he may not be willing to pay
to ensure no harm comes to you?

227
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,344
You're asking if he loves me?

228
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:36,903
He'll pay you what you ask.

229
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:45,361
Can you write?

230
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:48,748
Of course.

231
00:18:48,783 --> 00:18:51,167
Then write the following.

232
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:57,373
You're a prisoner of the
pirate Captain Charles Vane.

233
00:18:57,425 --> 00:19:00,831
Your ransom, should your father
ever wish to see you alive again,

234
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:03,045
is £250,000.

235
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:05,014
The next contact I'll
make will be to arrive

236
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:06,966
in Charlestown harbor
with you in my possession.

237
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:10,553
If I sense a trap or my demands are unmet,

238
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:13,522
I'll kill you and throw
your body into the bay.

239
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:19,779
Do you understand?

240
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:10,613
She's writing the letter now.

241
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:12,915
I want it on its way to Charlestown

242
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,751
before whatever's going to
happen here tomorrow happens.

243
00:20:15,786 --> 00:20:17,620
Right.

244
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:19,755
Who are they?

245
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,209
Friends from the beach.

246
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:27,963
They have pledged
their services to Captain Vane

247
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:31,934
to defend the fort and to
discourage any move against it.

248
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:35,271
It seems his pronouncement
has had the intended effect.

249
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:40,392
And 40 men becomes 60

250
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:42,728
and the fight ahead only gets bloodier.

251
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,314
Then get out there. Sit with the captains.

252
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:46,815
Talk some sense into them.

253
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:48,784
Tell them that it's their ships and cargo

254
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:51,987
that will be subject to his
extortion the moment it suits him.

255
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:53,656
I'll get to the beach.
Appeal directly to the crews.

256
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,708
If we can stop anyone
else from going up there,

257
00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:57,383
we can keep this from getting out of hand.

258
00:21:09,924 --> 00:21:13,392
Can I assume when you say
you'll go to the beach

259
00:21:13,427 --> 00:21:15,844
to make this appeal, you mean me?

260
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,266
All right, then.

261
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:25,354
Why do you think they went up that hill?

262
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:29,692
Beg your pardon?

263
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:31,994
If we're to stop any more
men from joining his side,

264
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:34,330
isn't it a prerequisite
that we try and understand

265
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:36,415
the thinking of the men who
have already joined him?

266
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:40,869
Sorry, are you asking my opinion?

267
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:46,375
Oh.

268
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:50,045
Well, uh...

269
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:54,350
I suppose one could argue
that it's simple fear.

270
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:57,219
Their fear of losing the fort

271
00:21:57,271 --> 00:22:00,606
being greater than their
fear of Vane remaining in it.

272
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:02,107
But then again,

273
00:22:02,143 --> 00:22:04,944
it's possible this has
nothing to do with the fort.

274
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:06,895
Nor with Vane.

275
00:22:06,897 --> 00:22:10,282
Perhaps it's just them expressing
their opinions about you.

276
00:22:10,318 --> 00:22:12,651
So you think that they see me

277
00:22:12,703 --> 00:22:14,486
as the villain in this particular story?

278
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,458
I think that would explain
their decision, yes.

279
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:25,798
And you? What do you think?

280
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,916
You see me as the villain here?

281
00:22:29,754 --> 00:22:33,839
I see you as the agent most likely

282
00:22:33,891 --> 00:22:36,392
of securing my share of
the gold on that beach.

283
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:38,677
As long as that remains true,

284
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:41,563
I am not bothered in the
least by whatever labels

285
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,399
anyone else decides to affix to you.

286
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,322
Why?

287
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:54,243
What do you think about it?

288
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:58,447
I'm sorry?

289
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:03,836
It bothers you, doesn't it?

290
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:05,754
What they think?

291
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:11,010
With the things you've done...

292
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:14,463
My God.

293
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,768
It must be awful being you.

294
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:25,724
Time is short.

295
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:28,310
You'd better be off.

296
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:39,655
We have reasonable proposals to
recruit men for the expedition.

297
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:41,657
To procure supplies and to ferry them.

298
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:43,959
But it will be the approach to
dealing with the Nassau pirates

299
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:45,711
by which the entire plan will be judged.

300
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:47,663
I feel that's where we're strongest.

301
00:23:47,665 --> 00:23:50,749
Targeted raid on the beach
under cover from two men-of-war.

302
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:53,802
Public trials and hangings of
roughly a dozen of the ringleaders.

303
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:56,672
And the replacement of the governor
with an officer of our choosing.

304
00:23:56,674 --> 00:23:58,223
It's precise, it's affordable,

305
00:23:58,259 --> 00:23:59,675
and it'll play well with the Sea Lords.

306
00:23:59,677 --> 00:24:02,311
I understand that's the expected proposal.

307
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:05,064
The safest one.
But it's not the one I would like to make.

308
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:08,484
When my father arrives,
I would like to propose to him

309
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:10,903
that we don't hang the pirates.

310
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:14,356
- That we pardon them.
- I'm sorry, what was that?

311
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:17,693
I want to pardon them.

312
00:24:17,745 --> 00:24:19,445
- You want to pardon them?
- Yes.

313
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:24,750
- How many?
- All of them.

314
00:24:24,785 --> 00:24:26,745
- All right.
- The island needs commerce to survive.

315
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:29,838
It needs labor. It needs men and
women vested in its interest.

316
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:31,314
Don't these men fit that description?

317
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:32,541
Couldn't they become part of the solution?

318
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:34,510
You don't need me to answer that.

319
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:35,794
- They're men.
- They're traitors to the Crown.

320
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:38,547
- What difference does that make?
- Makes some difference to the Crown.

321
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:40,432
Just answer me this, would it work?

322
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:44,520
To pardon a traitor is the act of a coward.

323
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:46,722
And given our current war footing,

324
00:24:46,774 --> 00:24:49,942
precisely no one in Whitehall
wants to wear that label right now.

325
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:52,277
If you propose this to your father,

326
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:56,398
he will almost certainly distance
himself from it and most likely from you.

327
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,650
Now, I only know
what I've heard of your father,

328
00:24:58,702 --> 00:25:00,819
but if half of what I've heard is true,

329
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:02,988
he's not a man one wants as an enemy.

330
00:25:04,992 --> 00:25:07,326
If you're asking me as your
liaison to the Admiralty,

331
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:09,995
my advice to you

332
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:12,831
is that this is a maneuver
only to be approached

333
00:25:12,883 --> 00:25:14,466
with utmost caution.

334
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:19,588
But as your friend,

335
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,591
I suggest you forget
you ever thought of it.

336
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:29,431
They came through the gate like locusts,

337
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:31,099
Vane and his men.

338
00:25:31,152 --> 00:25:33,402
Brothers of mine being hacked to pieces.

339
00:25:33,437 --> 00:25:35,938
I swear to Christ Almighty,

340
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,107
it wasn't the screams that haunt me most.

341
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:41,777
It was their laughter.

342
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:45,914
I thought they said no one survived
the raid from Captain Hornigold's crew.

343
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,585
Well, I guess one of them
must have gotten away.

344
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,089
So what do you make of this business
between Captains Flint and Vane?

345
00:25:56,594 --> 00:25:59,211
Thank you. Lovely performance.

346
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:09,771
Hello, friend.

347
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:13,775
Man around the bend has something to say
about this business at the fort.

348
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:18,647
The fuck's going on in there?

349
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:20,649
Pulled a man out of the water.

350
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:22,651
Up by the north point.

351
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:24,620
That's lucky.

352
00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:26,955
We were just about to send for one of you.

353
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:28,156
Excuse me?

354
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:30,242
You're a Walrus man, aren't you?

355
00:26:30,294 --> 00:26:31,710
Sorry, what are you talking about?

356
00:26:31,745 --> 00:26:33,212
He's one of yours.

357
00:27:05,863 --> 00:27:09,948
I assume Captain Flint wasn't
amenable to your suggestion.

358
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,201
He's not listening to me and
this place is slipping into ruin.

359
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:16,955
It's my commitment to
see this fort protected

360
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:19,508
from all enemies, all threats.

361
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:22,210
So as you consider where
to lay your support,

362
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:25,931
consider which of us represents
the greatest threat...

363
00:27:25,966 --> 00:27:29,017
my men in this fort or
the madman on the water?

364
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:32,137
- How many criers did you pay?
- Four total, as you asked.

365
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:33,555
Sent to the ends of the camps.

366
00:27:33,557 --> 00:27:35,190
But what I don't understand

367
00:27:35,225 --> 00:27:37,109
is why we're supporting
Captain Vane's position.

368
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:38,894
We're not supporting it, we're relaying it.

369
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:42,314
With all due respect,
I can't see the difference.

370
00:27:42,366 --> 00:27:43,982
I think I can live with that.

371
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:45,450
So what do we do now?

372
00:27:46,737 --> 00:27:48,298
The only one who can stop this is Flint.

373
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:51,073
I'll just have to find
someone to convince him.

374
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:56,795
He's moving in a direction
that promises unimaginable chaos.

375
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,464
He won't listen to me,

376
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,050
but perhaps he would listen
to an appeal from you.

377
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:08,223
I appreciate your frustration.

378
00:28:08,258 --> 00:28:10,698
Were there something I could do to help,
I assure you I would.

379
00:28:10,728 --> 00:28:13,395
You can make him see how
destructive his actions would be.

380
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,647
- You can make him...
- If you believe...

381
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:18,100
if you believe anyone can
make him see anything,

382
00:28:18,102 --> 00:28:20,018
you must not know him very well at all.

383
00:28:22,106 --> 00:28:24,990
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

384
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:27,409
You weren't here the last time they came.

385
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:30,078
200 Spanish soldiers walked onto the beach.

386
00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:33,115
They burned the huts on the beach
and then the structures in town.

387
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,617
When the whole of Nassau
was a smoking wreck,

388
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:37,669
they turned their eye inland.

389
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:40,172
They raped, they murdered,

390
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:41,873
they laid waste.

391
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:44,376
And all because there was
no fort to protect the bay.

392
00:28:44,428 --> 00:28:47,129
The men in charge had allowed
it to fall into disrepair.

393
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:52,801
Please, help me to dissuade him

394
00:28:52,853 --> 00:28:55,053
from putting us on that path again.

395
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:57,389
If you're concerned for your safety,

396
00:28:57,441 --> 00:28:58,974
perhaps you should request sanctuary

397
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:00,692
along with your father
at the Underhill estate.

398
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:01,977
I'd be happy to carry the message.

399
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:03,812
You think this is about me?

400
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:07,065
You asked me for my help
yesterday with Mr. Underhill.

401
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:09,651
I gave it my best efforts.
You asked me today again for my help,

402
00:29:09,703 --> 00:29:11,036
but I'm sorry,

403
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:13,872
what you ask is simply impossible.

404
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:16,742
You don't give a shit
about the rest of us, fine.

405
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:21,713
But Flint. Don't you care enough about him

406
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:24,166
to at least try to stop
him from doing this?

407
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:27,719
Don't I care about him?

408
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:29,838
He's the one in the most immediate danger.

409
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,890
- And you would do nothing...
- You who have enabled him,

410
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:33,975
encouraged his violence,

411
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:37,012
you ask if I care about him?

412
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:39,848
How dare you?

413
00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:44,236
Get out of my house.

414
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:12,380
Yes? What?

415
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:14,850
- New recruits?
- Mm-hmm.

416
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:18,270
It would appear your reconciliation
with Captain Vane has borne fruit.

417
00:30:18,305 --> 00:30:21,523
Though, perhaps,
of the low-hanging variety.

418
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:24,226
Thank you for your concern.

419
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:27,479
Did you know?

420
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:30,398
Before she opened the door?

421
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
No, I didn't know.

422
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,989
You must care for her a great deal.

423
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:41,576
Not once all night did you so
much as look in my direction.

424
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,464
I've seen enough to know to
keep my distance from you,

425
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:47,048
thank you very much.

426
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:49,251
The situation was not of my making.

427
00:30:49,303 --> 00:30:51,086
If it was anyone's, it was yours.

428
00:30:51,138 --> 00:30:52,971
I'm sorry, what?

429
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:56,091
The conflict within her.
I had it under control.

430
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:58,927
Right until the moment you
walked in on her and me.

431
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:03,098
For that was the moment you began
the competition between you and me.

432
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,684
What is happening here, the three of us,

433
00:31:05,736 --> 00:31:07,486
it is only temporary.

434
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:10,939
A state of denial until
she finally makes a choice.

435
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:13,275
A choice between you and I?

436
00:31:15,996 --> 00:31:18,446
Anne and I have been by each other's sides

437
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:21,166
since she was 13 years old.

438
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:24,336
We have sailed together.
We've killed together.

439
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:27,289
We have shared things you
couldn't begin to imagine.

440
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:30,041
You've shared a bed with her for a week.

441
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:33,295
You'd be amazed what can
change in a week in my bed.

442
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,467
I understand you're feeling
quite indispensable of late.

443
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,470
But rest assured, it only seems that way.

444
00:31:42,472 --> 00:31:44,472
I wouldn't get too comfortable were I you.

445
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:48,977
And what if I can get you
back on the water with a crew?

446
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:52,197
Would I still only
seem indispensable then, too?

447
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:55,901
One of the girls has a lead?

448
00:31:55,953 --> 00:31:58,153
Mm, but which one?

449
00:31:58,155 --> 00:32:02,290
They're so mistrustful of
male authority figures.

450
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:06,044
It'll take some time before they
report these things to you and not me.

451
00:32:10,334 --> 00:32:12,133
Come.

452
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:19,341
Mr. Featherstone.
Been a regular for months now.

453
00:32:19,393 --> 00:32:21,509
The navigator on the Colonial Dawn.

454
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:24,312
Finest on the island, so he says.

455
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:27,015
He's all right. Go on.

456
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:30,185
Put my tongue in his bum,
he'd tell me anything.

457
00:32:30,187 --> 00:32:33,154
So I did and he did.

458
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,357
He's looking to move.

459
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,159
Said the men were split badly
over the mess on the beach.

460
00:32:38,195 --> 00:32:40,362
Some backing Flint,
some saying he'd gone mad.

461
00:32:40,364 --> 00:32:42,998
Said the crew been fraying
for some time, anyway.

462
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:48,086
Said in all likelihood, a lot of those men
would follow him wherever he went

463
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:49,754
on account of his skills.

464
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:54,042
And we have a plan
to sway him and his men to our camp?

465
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:56,211
I'm going to fuck the
living shit out of him.

466
00:32:58,265 --> 00:33:01,466
If he chooses to join
Captain Rackham's crew,

467
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:04,052
that decision must be heartfelt.

468
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:06,221
It cannot be cast into doubt
the moment the pleasure fades.

469
00:33:06,273 --> 00:33:08,356
And for that, you cannot just fuck him.

470
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:09,891
You must seduce him.

471
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,981
Yes, there is a difference.

472
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,199
The breath in his ear.

473
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:21,486
The arch in your back when he
thinks he is making you finish.

474
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:24,406
The look in your eyes when
you finally breathe again

475
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:27,292
that tells him you would do
anything he asked in that moment.

476
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:29,911
Anything at all without hesitation.

477
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:33,248
The story you tell him that night
about when you were a little girl,

478
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,885
about the place you hid from your mother
where the world was quiet.

479
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,256
A story you've never told another soul.

480
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:43,391
The look of confusion you show him

481
00:33:43,427 --> 00:33:45,093
when you wake up the next morning

482
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:47,679
that tells him despite
the thousand other men

483
00:33:47,731 --> 00:33:51,099
you've awoken beside, that he is unique.

484
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:53,401
That he has seen you vulnerable.

485
00:33:53,437 --> 00:33:55,353
And that you cannot live without him.

486
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:00,075
I completely understand.

487
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,498
Just so we're clear,
I still fuck the shit out of him, yes?

488
00:34:08,251 --> 00:34:10,251
Yes.

489
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:13,088
Is there anything else
you would like to add?

490
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:17,125
Uh, no. No, I don't think so.

491
00:34:28,271 --> 00:34:29,804
Tell me again,

492
00:34:29,856 --> 00:34:32,140
who are those men camped out
in your family's storehouse?

493
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:33,525
What men?

494
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,310
Perfect.

495
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:42,117
We're doing wrong.

496
00:34:42,152 --> 00:34:44,202
He can't be on the ship right now.

497
00:34:44,237 --> 00:34:47,072
Captain is holding things
together with both hands

498
00:34:47,124 --> 00:34:49,290
and Billy will, understandably,

499
00:34:49,326 --> 00:34:51,993
have some feelings about the
events of this past week.

500
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:54,713
If those feeling were expressed right now,

501
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:58,917
it could spoil whatever chances
we have to retrieve the Urca gold.

502
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:07,008
Where is this?

503
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:11,179
It's all right. You made it home.

504
00:35:21,024 --> 00:35:22,357
What was that?

505
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:27,746
Get... Gates.

506
00:35:53,356 --> 00:35:56,141
Featherstone and Idelle?

507
00:35:56,193 --> 00:35:59,310
- Max told me.
- Ah.

508
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:02,730
Been in there going on three hours.

509
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:04,783
Do you think she can do it?

510
00:36:04,818 --> 00:36:06,618
Swing him our way?

511
00:36:06,653 --> 00:36:09,571
I think I have underestimated my last whore

512
00:36:09,623 --> 00:36:11,573
for a while,
given the week I've been having.

513
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:19,214
I've put a lot of bodies in
the ground for you, haven't I?

514
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:22,917
Excuse me?

515
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,636
Watched your back.

516
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:25,920
Cleaned up your messes.

517
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:28,756
Carried out your plans.

518
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
I didn't always understand.

519
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:35,513
Didn't always agree.

520
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,650
But I did it.

521
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:41,653
Some fucked-up, awful shit
'cause I knew you needed it done.

522
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:44,856
I don't think the night you had last night

523
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:46,774
comes even close to
something to bitch about.

524
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:50,778
I know you know this is
significantly more complicated

525
00:36:50,831 --> 00:36:53,698
than the quantity of tits I have
access to at any given moment.

526
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,868
I know she's dangerous.

527
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,537
Especially to me.

528
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:02,540
I ain't in my right head about her.

529
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,626
She knows it.

530
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:06,544
And it ain't hard to imagine her intent

531
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:09,013
is to play us off one against the other.

532
00:37:09,049 --> 00:37:12,100
But I'm asking you to do this for me.

533
00:37:13,854 --> 00:37:15,687
I'm asking you to watch my back

534
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:18,223
on the other side of that door.

535
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:21,776
'Cause I know as long as you are, there
ain't shit she can do to get between us.

536
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:01,432
Mr. Featherstone will announce
to his shipmates tomorrow

537
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:03,434
that he has joined a new crew.

538
00:38:03,486 --> 00:38:04,852
Your crew.

539
00:38:12,412 --> 00:38:13,695
What?

540
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:21,502
He believes a number of
his men will join him

541
00:38:21,538 --> 00:38:23,504
upon hearing this news.

542
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,707
At least 28 men.

543
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,460
That's more than half his crew.

544
00:38:29,512 --> 00:38:30,878
In addition to these new recruits,

545
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,716
you will be granted command
of their ship as well.

546
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:38,803
Congratulations, Captain.

547
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:58,573
A few more men in the fort
now than two hours ago,

548
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:01,492
though I believe we stemmed the tide there.

549
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:05,913
The captains I've spoken with are
on firm agreement with our position.

550
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:07,632
Several of them have
committed men and resources

551
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:09,584
to the final assault up the hill.

552
00:39:09,586 --> 00:39:12,971
Though we have yet to hear
from your man Mr. Silver,

553
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:15,306
word has come in from the beach.

554
00:39:15,342 --> 00:39:16,841
Support is in our favor,

555
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:19,761
though division amongst the
remaining crews is rampant.

556
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:23,648
Reports of skirmishes amongst and
within the camps has been arriving...

557
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:25,600
Numbers, please.

558
00:39:25,602 --> 00:39:27,485
Pardon?

559
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,939
We're well aware of the discord
caused by Captain Vane's entreaty.

560
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:35,076
I want to know what we'll be
facing if we go down this road.

561
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,618
Roughly 65 men in the fort,
plus or minus 10.

562
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,453
We bring to bear 90 men on our own

563
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:48,790
plus 50 pledged by sister crews.

564
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:51,342
On rough terrain and
fighting an entrenched enemy,

565
00:39:51,378 --> 00:39:53,928
I think it's safe to assume that casualties

566
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:56,714
will number threescore on our side.

567
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:58,800
As I've said, we ought harbor no illusions

568
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:00,768
about the blood that will
be spilled on that hill.

569
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:07,392
Father, how was your travel
from the country?

570
00:40:09,362 --> 00:40:11,646
Wet.

571
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,483
Well, I think you're most optimistic

572
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:17,735
about the Admiralty's willingness to outfit

573
00:40:17,787 --> 00:40:20,822
these ships you assume you can procure.

574
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:22,740
But as for the rest of it,

575
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:24,876
seems like a reasonable proposal.

576
00:40:24,911 --> 00:40:26,878
Do you agree, Lieutenant?

577
00:40:26,913 --> 00:40:28,880
Yes. Yes, I would, sir.

578
00:40:28,915 --> 00:40:33,751
I see. Well, then, perhaps we can discuss

579
00:40:33,803 --> 00:40:38,473
the one element you so
conveniently elected to ignore.

580
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:40,558
What about the pirate raiders of Nassau?

581
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:48,015
I want to put them to work.

582
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:49,984
To work? At what?

583
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:51,819
Tilling, harvesting, coopering,

584
00:40:51,855 --> 00:40:54,021
building, smithing, fishing.

585
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:56,157
What are you talking about, Thomas?

586
00:40:58,528 --> 00:41:00,945
I intend to secure them pardons.

587
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:04,532
A blanket amnesty for any
man who will accept it.

588
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:06,501
In exchange for his allegiance,

589
00:41:06,536 --> 00:41:09,871
his renunciation of violence and his labor.

590
00:41:14,427 --> 00:41:17,044
What a piece of work you are.

591
00:41:17,097 --> 00:41:19,380
You asked me to formulate a plan.

592
00:41:19,432 --> 00:41:21,099
That's what I've done.

593
00:41:22,552 --> 00:41:25,887
I asked you to formulate a plan

594
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:29,440
that would secure the support
of the navy in our efforts.

595
00:41:29,476 --> 00:41:32,393
Support without which
there is little chance

596
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:35,563
of reversing the catastrophic
downward trend in revenue

597
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:37,231
from the Bahama territories.

598
00:41:37,283 --> 00:41:40,451
Support that is almost
certain to disappear entirely

599
00:41:40,487 --> 00:41:44,071
and for good the moment they
hear they are to be associated

600
00:41:44,073 --> 00:41:47,742
with a plan to reward men who are
in open revolt against the Crown.

601
00:41:47,794 --> 00:41:51,129
This is the solution most likely
to lead to our desired result.

602
00:41:51,164 --> 00:41:53,164
It also has the virtue of
being the right thing to do.

603
00:41:53,216 --> 00:41:55,883
Oh, for God's sake.

604
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:58,419
Lieutenant, am I right to assume

605
00:41:58,421 --> 00:41:59,971
that a proposal such as this...

606
00:42:00,006 --> 00:42:01,422
Don't look at him. Talk to me.

607
00:42:07,096 --> 00:42:09,263
My son is impertinent, Lieutenant.

608
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,566
My son is indulged.

609
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:14,152
My son is self-righteous.

610
00:42:14,187 --> 00:42:16,938
But he's not stupid.

611
00:42:18,274 --> 00:42:20,241
Perhaps you could explain to me

612
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:22,610
how you intend to distract the queen

613
00:42:22,612 --> 00:42:25,246
from her war to issue these pardons.

614
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:26,914
I wouldn't need her to do anything.

615
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,583
A simple act would
accomplish the same thing.

616
00:42:28,618 --> 00:42:30,952
Of Parliament? There aren't four votes

617
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:32,537
among the lords for
something as absurd as this.

618
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:35,790
Sutton, Dunster, Lewis, Form, Philpott.
There's five.

619
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:38,125
They're easy. I haven't even opened
my mouth to make an argument.

620
00:42:38,178 --> 00:42:39,961
An argument to abet
sedition in times of war?

621
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:43,014
A war, sir, to ensure that a
Protestant sits on the throne of Spain.

622
00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:44,765
Thomas, if I were a rival of this family,

623
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:47,185
I would be shouting from
the rooftops that any man

624
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,971
who proposes to pardon a
traitor in times such as these

625
00:42:50,023 --> 00:42:51,305
is himself a traitor.

626
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:54,358
We are fighting a war in the
service of the son of God.

627
00:42:54,394 --> 00:42:57,144
And it is treason to offer forgiveness
to any man who would seek it?

628
00:42:57,197 --> 00:42:58,446
What in the hell is it you
think we're doing here?

629
00:42:58,481 --> 00:43:00,314
This isn't your goddamn salon, Thomas.

630
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:04,222
If you do not forgive men their sins,
your father will not forgive your sins.

631
00:43:04,237 --> 00:43:06,704
- I don't want to hear it!
- I know you don't.

632
00:43:18,134 --> 00:43:20,751
Lieutenant.

633
00:43:20,803 --> 00:43:23,471
I'll ask you once again,

634
00:43:23,506 --> 00:43:26,224
am I to assume by your silence

635
00:43:26,259 --> 00:43:29,393
that you are in agreement
with this proposal?

636
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:33,231
The lieutenant has dutifully
expressed his reservations...

637
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:36,017
Madam...

638
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:40,521
you have done enough to damage
the good name of this family.

639
00:43:40,523 --> 00:43:42,690
I would ask that you keep both your mouth

640
00:43:42,692 --> 00:43:44,692
and your legs firmly shut going forward...

641
00:43:44,744 --> 00:43:47,028
I support it.

642
00:43:52,035 --> 00:43:54,252
I found his argument persuasive.

643
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:57,338
I find his intent to be good and true.

644
00:43:57,373 --> 00:43:59,674
And I find yours wanting, sir.

645
00:44:01,628 --> 00:44:04,762
I will be relaying my findings to
Admiral Hennessey in short order.

646
00:44:04,797 --> 00:44:08,099
And now I think it's time you left, sir.

647
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,318
Gentlemen.

648
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,471
Did you just ask my father

649
00:44:47,507 --> 00:44:49,507
to leave his own house?

650
00:45:08,244 --> 00:45:11,445
Right now he will be dispatching
messages to the Sea Lords,

651
00:45:11,497 --> 00:45:13,948
the Southern Secretary,

652
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,282
his friends in the Privy Council.

653
00:45:15,335 --> 00:45:19,086
He will stop at nothing to ensure
that this plan never sees the light of day.

654
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:22,173
And now you're in the line of fire.

655
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:24,258
People can say what they like about you.

656
00:45:27,096 --> 00:45:29,180
But you're a good man.

657
00:45:32,218 --> 00:45:34,885
More people should say that.

658
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:38,272
And someone should be willing to defend it.

659
00:45:56,325 --> 00:45:58,075
Pastor.

660
00:45:58,127 --> 00:46:00,378
It's before dawn.

661
00:46:00,413 --> 00:46:03,080
I don't sleep anymore.

662
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,177
I've seen you at my service.

663
00:46:16,229 --> 00:46:20,014
I've kept my distance,
but I've seen you there.

664
00:46:20,066 --> 00:46:22,400
Heard of your efforts
to join our community.

665
00:46:22,435 --> 00:46:24,101
To make a fresh start.

666
00:46:24,153 --> 00:46:27,271
I've wanted to believe it to be true.

667
00:46:27,323 --> 00:46:29,573
After...

668
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:32,159
after what happened between you and I,

669
00:46:32,195 --> 00:46:35,329
I wanted to believe that
as vile as the act was,

670
00:46:35,364 --> 00:46:38,032
perhaps it was born of a misguided desire

671
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:40,084
on your part to change your ways.

672
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:41,952
To seek a more virtuous path.

673
00:46:44,123 --> 00:46:47,091
I do seek a more virtuous path.

674
00:46:47,126 --> 00:46:50,795
Then why am I also hearing that you've
been receiving Mr. Guthrie's daughter?

675
00:46:50,847 --> 00:46:54,048
Making requests
of Mr. Underhill on her behalf?

676
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,683
You don't understand.

677
00:46:55,718 --> 00:46:59,019
I understand more than you think, ma'am.

678
00:47:01,224 --> 00:47:03,057
I've been to town today.

679
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:05,860
I hear that one of the
thieves on the beach,

680
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:08,896
desirous of impressing her,
assaulted another.

681
00:47:08,948 --> 00:47:11,398
Killed him.

682
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,069
And in a display for all to see,
mounted his severed head on a pike.

683
00:47:15,071 --> 00:47:17,788
Were this not monstrous enough,

684
00:47:17,824 --> 00:47:20,324
talk is it was all in service
of stealing a young girl

685
00:47:20,376 --> 00:47:22,660
intended to be ransomed to her father.

686
00:47:22,712 --> 00:47:26,247
None other than the governor
of the Carolina colony.

687
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:28,299
An upstanding, God-fearing man

688
00:47:28,334 --> 00:47:31,135
hundreds of leagues from here
is unsafe from their brutality.

689
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:33,671
These are Miss Guthrie's associates.

690
00:47:33,723 --> 00:47:37,091
These are the men on whose behalf
you would act by doing her bidding.

691
00:47:37,143 --> 00:47:40,060
Men who seek profit
through the most boundless,

692
00:47:40,096 --> 00:47:42,429
wanton, unrepentant barbarism.

693
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:45,933
And I'm to believe that your
desire to repent is genuine?

694
00:47:45,985 --> 00:47:47,768
Lord Ashe?

695
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,820
What?

696
00:47:49,856 --> 00:47:51,739
The governor in Carolina,

697
00:47:51,774 --> 00:47:54,692
it is Lord Peter Ashe, it is not?

698
00:47:56,112 --> 00:47:57,862
I believe so, but...

699
00:47:59,115 --> 00:48:01,782
Lord Ashe's daughter, what was her name?

700
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:04,368
Mrs. Barlow,
what difference does her name make?

701
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,453
Abigail.

702
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:09,790
Her name is Abigail Ashe.

703
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:11,792
Absolution.

704
00:48:11,844 --> 00:48:14,461
A clean slate for all
those willing to accept it.

705
00:48:14,514 --> 00:48:16,463
A few hours ago, I informed my father

706
00:48:16,516 --> 00:48:20,050
that this was my intended solution for
the pirate issue on New Providence Island.

707
00:48:23,806 --> 00:48:26,307
We've talked in this room, you and I,

708
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:27,808
about reason.

709
00:48:29,111 --> 00:48:30,394
We've talked about justice.

710
00:48:30,446 --> 00:48:32,730
We've talked about virtue and the right.

711
00:48:32,782 --> 00:48:34,481
We've talked and talked.

712
00:48:34,483 --> 00:48:36,650
And now, perhaps, it is time to do that

713
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:39,320
which we've only spoken
about behind closed doors.

714
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:41,655
I am committed to this end.

715
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:45,409
But it is a long road and I will
need your help to see it through.

716
00:49:30,456 --> 00:49:32,289
How can I help?

717
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,543
I don't believe you've
been properly introduced.

718
00:49:36,596 --> 00:49:38,345
Lieutenant McGraw...

719
00:49:39,548 --> 00:49:42,433
my good friend Lord Peter Ashe.

720
00:50:20,473 --> 00:50:22,172
What the fuck is this?

721
00:50:27,263 --> 00:50:29,430
I heard the news today.

722
00:50:29,432 --> 00:50:32,733
I thought it a sign it was
time to come and see you.

723
00:50:34,437 --> 00:50:36,353
You're kidding me.

724
00:50:36,405 --> 00:50:38,105
Coming to gloat now?

725
00:50:39,408 --> 00:50:41,992
You don't see it, do you?

726
00:50:42,028 --> 00:50:45,329
You're so close to having
everything you've wanted.

727
00:50:45,364 --> 00:50:48,449
Everything I told you you'll never have.

728
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:50,417
It's within your reach.

729
00:50:50,453 --> 00:50:52,753
I came to help you get it.

730
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:06,767
I remember when I first saw it.

731
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:09,269
I'd never seen a structure like it.

732
00:51:09,305 --> 00:51:12,222
It seemed indestructible.

733
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:16,643
If you would have told me then
the decision you face today,

734
00:51:16,696 --> 00:51:20,481
I don't know if I would
have believed it possible.

735
00:51:23,486 --> 00:51:27,454
Richard Guthrie sat on the throne
of commerce when I arrived.

736
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:30,207
Made men rich, they said.

737
00:51:32,044 --> 00:51:35,462
Then his daughter took his place,
made Nassau strong.

738
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:39,166
Everyone knows this.

739
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,170
I wonder how many know
that there was one man

740
00:51:43,222 --> 00:51:46,173
standing behind them.

741
00:51:46,225 --> 00:51:48,892
Standing behind both thrones,

742
00:51:48,928 --> 00:51:50,844
keeping the world spinning.

743
00:51:54,517 --> 00:51:57,434
You're as invested in the
future of this place as any.

744
00:51:59,605 --> 00:52:01,071
What would you do?

745
00:52:06,195 --> 00:52:08,278
I know Eleanor's argument.

746
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,698
And I know why you think it is weak
and I do not disagree with you.

747
00:52:11,751 --> 00:52:15,252
Her judgment about
Captain Vane has never been right.

748
00:52:15,287 --> 00:52:17,538
But because she is compromised,

749
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:20,758
it does not necessarily
follow that she is wrong.

750
00:52:20,793 --> 00:52:22,876
I fear that to take that fort

751
00:52:22,878 --> 00:52:26,680
will be to divide this island
in a most dangerous way.

752
00:52:26,715 --> 00:52:29,383
To force men to take
sides against each other

753
00:52:29,435 --> 00:52:33,103
at a time when our very survival
demands the very opposite.

754
00:52:34,723 --> 00:52:36,440
I fear that if we go down that road,

755
00:52:36,475 --> 00:52:38,809
by the time Spain or England arrive,

756
00:52:38,861 --> 00:52:40,527
they will find their job done for them.

757
00:52:40,563 --> 00:52:44,114
They will find Nassau has destroyed itself.

758
00:52:46,202 --> 00:52:47,868
The world changes.

759
00:52:47,903 --> 00:52:49,903
It is inevitable.

760
00:52:49,955 --> 00:52:52,739
Perhaps the only thing that is inevitable.

761
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,960
If it were me facing this decision,

762
00:52:56,996 --> 00:52:59,246
I would make peace with that.

763
00:52:59,298 --> 00:53:03,333
I would teach myself to see Captain Vane

764
00:53:03,385 --> 00:53:07,087
as an unfortunate but unavoidable change

765
00:53:07,089 --> 00:53:08,755
in our landscape.

766
00:53:10,593 --> 00:53:15,596
And I would ensure that we all live
to see the sunrise again tomorrow.

767
00:53:15,598 --> 00:53:17,147
Were it me.

768
00:54:07,149 --> 00:54:09,116
What say you, Captain?

769
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,137
Fire.
