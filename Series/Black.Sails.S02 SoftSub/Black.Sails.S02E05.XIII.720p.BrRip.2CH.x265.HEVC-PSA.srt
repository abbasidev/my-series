1
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:15,310
When my father arrives,
I would like to propose to him

2
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:17,479
that we don't hang the pirates
but we pardon them.

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,565
Any man who proposes to pardon
a traitor is himself a traitor.

4
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:24,235
I find his argument persuasive
and I find yours wanting, sir.

5
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:26,538
You're so close to having
everything you've wanted.

6
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:27,956
I came to help you get it.

7
00:00:27,957 --> 00:00:30,325
I hear that one of the thieves
assaulted another.

8
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:32,577
It was all in service
of stealing a young girl

9
00:00:32,578 --> 00:00:34,295
intended to be ransomed to her father.

10
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:36,214
Her name was Abigail Ashe.

11
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:38,967
Lieutenant McGraw, my good
friend Lord Peter Ashe.

12
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:41,970
Mr. Featherstone will announce
to his shipmates tomorrow

13
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:45,390
that he has joined a new crew.
Your crew.

14
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:47,142
He can't be on the ship right now.

15
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:50,178
It could spoil whatever chances
we have to retrieve the Urca gold.

16
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:53,181
I am fully committed to the removal
of Captain Vane from that fort.

17
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,567
You are talking about rendering Nassau
completely unprotected.

18
00:00:55,568 --> 00:00:57,986
- I know.
- What say you, Captain?

19
00:00:57,987 --> 00:00:59,770
Fire.

20
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:29,535
It would appear we lost track of time.

21
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:50,973
- Fire!
- Fire!

22
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:56,812
Take cover!

23
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:11,683
Please.

24
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:14,331
Please, stop.

25
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:17,217
Surely you must realize
this is a fruitless errand.

26
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:19,552
The time for conciliation is well past.

27
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:21,504
I must try.

28
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,175
Why?

29
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:27,593
I'm the only one
who can stop him, Pastor.

30
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:31,981
I'm the only one who
knows why he's doing it.

31
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:04,456
__

32
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:17,777
Your father said he would never
let your proposal come to a vote.

33
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:19,312
I do believe he meant it.

34
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:21,898
Tell me what chance this has of success.
Be honest.

35
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:24,567
Ultimately there is tremendous support
for every part of the package.

36
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:27,287
This entire battle is being waged
over the pardon provision.

37
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:29,039
Without it, I could get this
passed in a matter of hours.

38
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,541
The rest of it is meaningless
without the pardons.

39
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,992
They're the only hope
for redeeming Nassau.

40
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:35,745
I know, which is why
we'll keep on fighting.

41
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:38,498
I know your father
is a formidable adversary.

42
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:39,882
So am I.

43
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:46,723
What is it?

44
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,140
A moment please?

45
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:56,599
I'm going to make arrangements
to leave for the country.

46
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,686
Leave? Leave when?

47
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,654
Now.

48
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:04,491
- Tonight.
- May I ask why?

49
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:07,110
This fight with your father.

50
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:10,080
The more public it gets,
the more visible it gets,

51
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:11,614
the greater the liability
I will be for you.

52
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:13,500
Liability? How could you possibly...

53
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:16,586
The lieutenant's ship
arrived this morning.

54
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:19,254
Returned from the Bahama Islands.

55
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,293
I received word not long ago.

56
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:25,795
The rumors about me and
my relationship with him

57
00:06:25,796 --> 00:06:27,847
have gone quiet the past
few months he's been away

58
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:30,266
and I'm concerned that when he returns

59
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:31,851
people will start whispering again.

60
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,303
Let them whisper.

61
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:36,022
It's not the rumors that concern me.

62
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:38,441
It's the scrutiny that follows that.

63
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:41,144
And what that scrutiny might unearth.

64
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:43,646
So someone might discover
you and he shared a bed.

65
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:46,699
I'm concerned they might dig past that

66
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,068
and discover something

67
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,871
far more damaging

68
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:53,539
than that.

69
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,502
I can assure you, Mr. Gates' death

70
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:07,470
is not one the captain took lightly.

71
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:09,672
When I arrived

72
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:13,226
just after the deed was done,

73
00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:15,478
I saw the look on his face.

74
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,648
The pain it caused him
to do what he did.

75
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:22,936
But in that moment,
he believed it necessary

76
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:25,070
to preserve the hunt
for the Urca and her gold.

77
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:30,359
Flint killed him?

78
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:35,948
Yes.

79
00:07:37,952 --> 00:07:40,369
And he's still captain?

80
00:07:42,256 --> 00:07:43,673
How?

81
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:45,425
After a brief interlude,

82
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:48,428
the men saw what I am hoping
you will see.

83
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:50,763
That with the gold still
sitting on that beach,

84
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:54,050
he represents our best, perhaps
our only chance of retrieving it.

85
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:56,269
Once this business with Vane
and the fort is over,

86
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,137
that is what the rest of us intend.

87
00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:00,222
Rest of us?

88
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,226
That's why I'm here.

89
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,195
You didn't want me with the men.

90
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:08,031
You're worried I'll challenge Flint.

91
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:10,783
Well, the thought crossed my mind.

92
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:13,069
But I'm hoping

93
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,206
that once you have a moment
to process all of this,

94
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:19,292
you'll remember that you are
the same man

95
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:23,162
who when handed a blank page pulled
from Mr. Singleton's corpse,

96
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:27,050
stood by the captain for the
sake of the bigger picture.

97
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:28,718
Then you'll realize you were right then.

98
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:31,170
And the same kind of perspective
is what's called for now.

99
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:32,221
Enough!

100
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:37,926
I'm going to see my brothers now.

101
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:50,073
Until I know what you're
going to say to the men,

102
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:52,774
I can't let you say anything to the men.

103
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:39,322
He returns at last. It's good
to have you back, Lieutenant.

104
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:41,657
- Sir.
- Welcome home.

105
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:47,879
Three months.

106
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,441
Feels like twice as long.

107
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:55,004
Our campaign against
my father and Whitehall

108
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:57,674
has reached a most critical stage.

109
00:09:57,675 --> 00:10:01,678
If you were able to secure the support
of the royal governor in Nassau,

110
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,230
it might just be the thing that
turns the tide in our favor.

111
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:06,014
There is no governor in Nassau.

112
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:09,017
What do you mean?

113
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:13,573
I understand the dispute
arose over a bribe.

114
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:16,192
Money that Governor
Thompson felt he was owed

115
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:18,411
by a particular pirate captain.

116
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:20,913
That captain recruited others.

117
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:24,867
They demanded the governor
leave the island at once.

118
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:27,920
Thompson refused, at which point

119
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:30,256
a dozen armed men broke into his home,

120
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:33,209
dragged his wife and nine-year-old
son out into the street

121
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,760
and slit their throats.

122
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:47,523
They let him live, so I'm told,

123
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:49,225
so he would tell the tale

124
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:51,728
and so that there would be
no misunderstanding

125
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:53,563
about who is running Nassau now.

126
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:56,449
Stupid fuckers.

127
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,736
By the time I left, men were
beginning to occupy the fort.

128
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,821
Had I stayed another day, I'm not sure

129
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:04,240
they would have let me
leave with my ship.

130
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:06,125
But what is clear is this,

131
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:09,378
right now, there's no law in Nassau.

132
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:19,088
I'm trying to imagine
standing up before the lords

133
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:21,507
and suggesting pardons
for these people.

134
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:25,261
I'm having a difficult time of it.

135
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:29,265
The men responsible for this
crime deserve to be punished.

136
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:31,484
But we cannot, we must not

137
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:35,071
allow their actions to condemn the rest.

138
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:38,274
As a matter of political reality,

139
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:39,859
our plan is dead.

140
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,411
Not necessarily.

141
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:42,829
Beg your pardon?

142
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,032
The navy hasn't made its case yet.

143
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,950
The navy isn't going to make a case.

144
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:51,120
The navy will do whatever
Parliament tells it to do.

145
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,623
We're in a time of war.
If the Sea Lords

146
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:56,042
were to recommend a change of
strategy, who would ignore them?

147
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:58,211
- The war has got nothing to do with it.
- Doesn't it?

148
00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:01,880
Isn't a lawless Nassau a weakness
that Spain could exploit?

149
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:07,519
How would you do it?

150
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:10,472
By offering our plan
directly to the Sea Lords.

151
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:12,324
Making our case to them.

152
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:15,110
- They'd hear you?
- Yes, I think they would.

153
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:17,569
Ahem, Lieutenant.

154
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:21,901
May I speak with you
in private, please?

155
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:23,735
Now.

156
00:12:34,498 --> 00:12:37,834
It's clear to me now that what
lies ahead is the road to ruin.

157
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:40,169
And I'm asking you
to stop this right now

158
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,754
before we've all gone
too far to turn back.

159
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:50,229
What do you see, lad?

160
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,565
Leeward tower just lost
another 10 foot of her wall.

161
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:55,017
The dust is still clearing.

162
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:08,331
- You don't like it?
- No. No, no, no.

163
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:11,367
It's quite good.

164
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:14,587
But here's the thing...

165
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:18,007
the crew's banner is a sacred thing.

166
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:20,927
It must simultaneously strike fear

167
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:23,296
in the hearts of hardened men

168
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:27,216
while inspiring and unifying
all those who sail under it.

169
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:31,103
It must be something
approaching perfection.

170
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:34,190
Any idea what direction that might be?

171
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:36,359
Darling, I think we'll
both know it when we see it.

172
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,559
Don't you?

173
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,401
Charlotte.

174
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:47,569
Oh.

175
00:13:50,908 --> 00:13:55,076
Never sailed with a captain
this particular before.

176
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:59,048
We all have the same swords out there.

177
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:00,666
We all have the same guns.

178
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,469
But great art...

179
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,388
has felled empires

180
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:07,256
and therein lies all the difference.

181
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:09,725
I don't understand what that means.

182
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:12,094
No, but I do. So not to worry.

183
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:14,981
While the rest of this island
sits about gawking

184
00:14:14,982 --> 00:14:17,900
at the chaos of the day
contemplating the end of the world,

185
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:19,685
we would do well to use
this time to prepare.

186
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:21,938
I'd like to be first men back in
the water when the smoke clears

187
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,823
with every detail accounted for.

188
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:27,159
Well, while we're on it,
we still got details to sort

189
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,111
of a much bigger size than all that.

190
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:31,647
Stores ain't procured,
articles ain't signed.

191
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:33,762
I've seen the draft articles.
I'm fine with them as is.

192
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:35,243
But the men ain't.

193
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:37,587
They got some changes
you and I ought to discuss.

194
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,538
Ooh, changes.

195
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:41,623
Yes.

196
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:44,343
You two making any progress?

197
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:46,044
Slowly but surely.

198
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:51,934
I'm sorry, you were saying
something about the articles.

199
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:54,053
It can wait.

200
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:56,104
That ain't letting up anytime soon.

201
00:14:58,141 --> 00:14:59,641
Excuse me.

202
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:05,147
Fucking nightmare it must be up there.

203
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:07,233
You think he's still in it?

204
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:08,818
Who, Charles?

205
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:10,820
He could get out of that
fort without being seen.

206
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:13,122
He's stubborn but he ain't stupid.

207
00:15:13,123 --> 00:15:16,075
No, I'd say he's terribly stupid
when it comes to being stubborn.

208
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:18,961
Given a choice between
capitulation and survival,

209
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:21,464
I don't image that to be much
of a choice for him at all.

210
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:22,665
He's in that fort, I assure you.

211
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,167
You think he'll make it?

212
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:27,920
I think Charles Vane
is something you and I survived.

213
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:30,672
What happens to him now
is no longer of any concern to me.

214
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:38,513
This morning, you and Max.

215
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:44,353
You know what? I ain't got no right.

216
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:46,822
We'll get through it.

217
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:49,357
Always do, don't we?

218
00:15:58,001 --> 00:16:00,953
Steady.

219
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:03,089
Stand.

220
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,175
Ma'am. Ma'am, are you hurt?

221
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:08,560
Help me.

222
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:28,079
Walk on. Walk on.

223
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:40,542
It's all right.
I see a way through this.

224
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:43,379
A way towards the end
which we have all been seeking.

225
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,016
Thomas, he sees only the principle.

226
00:16:47,017 --> 00:16:48,851
The right.

227
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:50,886
It's inspiring.

228
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:53,305
It can be intoxicating.

229
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:55,641
It's why I love him.

230
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:58,527
But you, you see the world as it is.

231
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:00,863
You see its truths
and how to navigate them.

232
00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:02,648
How to bend them to your will.

233
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:04,732
It's why I love you.

234
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:08,170
Men like Thomas need men like you.

235
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:09,839
To protect them from the world.

236
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,757
And that is what I am asking you to do.

237
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:13,926
The danger is simply too great.

238
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:15,678
Anything that has ever
been worth doing

239
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,347
has been worth doing in
the face of a little danger.

240
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:21,183
I have been the subject of
enough ridicule and innuendo

241
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:23,686
to know the difference between
a little danger and mortal danger,

242
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:26,022
and I'm telling you that
what you and Thomas and I

243
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:28,357
face right now is the latter.

244
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,926
What's been going on in this
house isn't just some affair.

245
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:33,696
No. No, it isn't.

246
00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:36,615
But since when did you care
what people think?

247
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:38,284
This isn't a question of scandal.

248
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:42,004
It isn't a state of mind.
They hang men for this.

249
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:43,049
Don't be naive.

250
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,340
When they have political motive,

251
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:47,209
they use it as a pretense to hang men.

252
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,212
Don't treat me like I'm someone else.
I know what London is, too.

253
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:54,550
Alfred Hamilton does not
want those pardons issued.

254
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:58,220
He has committed himself to doing
everything in his power to prevent it.

255
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:00,940
And when he finds out what's
been going on in this house,

256
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:02,224
he will use it to ruin us.

257
00:18:02,225 --> 00:18:05,277
Even if he were to find out,
he wouldn't use it against us.

258
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:06,812
Now who's being naive?

259
00:18:06,813 --> 00:18:08,337
It would be just as
embarrassing for the earl

260
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,482
as it would be for any of us.

261
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:12,735
Do you really think he wants that?

262
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:14,403
You are underestimating him.

263
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:17,073
He will find a way to exploit it.

264
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:20,126
Why take the risk?

265
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:22,128
For the sake of the pirates of Nassau?

266
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:24,829
Miranda, I saw it. I was there.

267
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,084
Thomas was right about its promise.

268
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:31,587
And once the pirate issue has abated,

269
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:34,422
it'll need help to rebuild.
Help from people like us.

270
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:40,262
You're suggesting we go there.

271
00:18:40,263 --> 00:18:42,932
A restored New Providence Island
will need a governor.

272
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,434
Who better qualified
to oversee the building

273
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:46,936
of the New World than Thomas?

274
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:50,239
With these pardons, we can accomplish
that and leave London behind.

275
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:03,618
I've known Admiral Hennessey
since I was a boy.

276
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:08,090
He's the closest thing
I have to a father.

277
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:09,875
Let me raise the plan with him.

278
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:12,377
Seek his counsel.
There's no risk in that.

279
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:18,967
This is too important not to try.

280
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:27,575
Fire!

281
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,701
- Reload the cannons.
- Reload! Reload!

282
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,870
Quickly, boys, quickly.

283
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:41,089
Let's go. Let's go.

284
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,625
Two-six, heave!

285
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:45,994
- Heave!
- Fire!

286
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:04,363
- Two-six!
- Heave!

287
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:05,830
Cease fire!

288
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:08,066
Cease fire!

289
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:11,035
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!

290
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:15,290
Prepare to move ashore.

291
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,459
Ready the longboats.

292
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:06,425
The courtyard wall's destroyed.

293
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:08,460
A breach in the northwestern corridor.

294
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:10,045
Seaward-facing batteries are gone

295
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:11,964
as are most of the westward guns.

296
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,549
How many did we lose?

297
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,601
Seven.

298
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:17,719
Another nine injured.

299
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,355
How long do you expect?

300
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:22,808
Before the men are massing
themselves on the beach

301
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,058
to begin their assault?

302
00:21:25,395 --> 00:21:26,759
Two hours.

303
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:30,611
Maybe less.

304
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,942
Larson.

305
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:43,278
Take her back to the cell.

306
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,242
Make sure she remains
safe while I'm gone.

307
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:50,869
No one is to touch her. Understood?

308
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,903
Aye.

309
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:57,326
While you're gone?
Where are you going?

310
00:21:57,327 --> 00:22:00,579
No matter how many of his men
we kill, he can find more.

311
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,082
Eventually they breach

312
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,468
and we die.

313
00:22:06,469 --> 00:22:08,003
So you're leaving?

314
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:09,972
It's too great of a force to defeat

315
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:12,141
if we attempt to fight the body of it.

316
00:22:12,142 --> 00:22:14,927
Only way to beat it

317
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:17,145
is to cut off its head.

318
00:22:23,486 --> 00:22:25,687
I had the misfortune
of being in his presence

319
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:28,524
when Mr. Underhill received
word of your proposal

320
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:31,360
to form a partnership to sell
his goods on your ships.

321
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:33,195
He said no.

322
00:22:33,196 --> 00:22:36,532
But it was the manner in which he
said no that is most promising.

323
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:38,834
I don't understand what it
is he hopes to achieve by...

324
00:22:38,835 --> 00:22:41,537
His anger, I believe,
was due to the fact

325
00:22:41,538 --> 00:22:43,372
that he wanted to say yes.

326
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:45,541
- Ma'am.
- What is it?

327
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,509
Ma'am, an errant shot from the warship

328
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,845
hit a set a stores outside the
southwest gates. Set it ablaze.

329
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:51,597
How close to the Intrepid's
storehouse there?

330
00:22:51,598 --> 00:22:53,215
A few hundred yards, ma'am.

331
00:22:53,216 --> 00:22:55,267
The problem is it's been
freshly stocked with...

332
00:22:55,268 --> 00:22:58,804
With powder, I know.
Inform Mr. Lawrence

333
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:01,307
he needs to move his powder stock
to my warehouse here immediately.

334
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:03,943
And ask Virgil to take five men
to help put out that fire.

335
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:07,113
- Any sign of capitulation?
- Ma'am?

336
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:10,783
Captain Vane, has he made
any signal to surrender?

337
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:12,785
No, ma'am.

338
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:15,037
You're dismissed.

339
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:17,873
What the fuck does that mean?
He wants to say yes.

340
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:20,743
You desire legitimacy
in the eyes of London.

341
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:22,995
But you cannot have it
until you find a way

342
00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:25,830
to ship something
other than stolen goods.

343
00:23:26,382 --> 00:23:29,585
The landowners want greater profits.

344
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:32,054
But they cannot have them
until they find a way

345
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:34,223
to ship their products
out of the port of Nassau

346
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:38,427
free from the danger of the pirates.

347
00:23:38,428 --> 00:23:40,012
There is a partnership to be had here.

348
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:41,980
I can broker it.

349
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:44,983
And there is only one thing
standing in the way.

350
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:47,736
If you were to appear
to divest yourself

351
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:49,938
of your association with
the crews on account...

352
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:51,857
You are unbelievable.

353
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:53,909
All I'd have to do is give up the fence

354
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,694
and you can make
all my dreams come true.

355
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:58,280
You're a smart girl, Eleanor.

356
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:00,749
And though I know
you're standing there,

357
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,751
parsing this, trying to identify

358
00:24:02,752 --> 00:24:05,704
how my interests
diverge from yours here,

359
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:07,706
I suspect you're not finding it.

360
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:10,124
And it's because
it isn't there to be found.

361
00:24:19,665 --> 00:24:23,343
You want me to prove to Underhill
that I can be his partner?

362
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,371
That I can be trustworthy?

363
00:24:26,643 --> 00:24:29,784
Then you have to prove the same to me.

364
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:33,365
I have spent a lifetime exposed
to your self-serving lies.

365
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:36,285
They're the manure
from which I sprouted.

366
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:40,489
And if I can identify
the specific motive or not,

367
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,659
I still come to expect that stench
anytime you darken my door.

368
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:06,765
Find Mr. Silver for me, if you please.

369
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:08,350
Captain.

370
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:11,570
You've explained to your men
their responsibilities here?

371
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:15,024
Aye, they know your plans to recover the
gold must be kept secret and silent.

372
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:16,525
If it were to be discovered
by another crew,

373
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:20,362
they could become competition
for its retrieval.

374
00:25:20,363 --> 00:25:22,865
You know how to keep a
secret between three men?

375
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:23,948
Shoot two of them.

376
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,019
What kind of fool tries to
keep a secret amongst 100?

377
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,838
The faster we retake the fort,

378
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,423
the faster you'll be back on the water

379
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:33,592
en route to the Urca
with my men in your service.

380
00:25:33,593 --> 00:25:35,510
Even if the information
were to be divulged

381
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:38,013
that the gold is still to be won,

382
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:40,098
even if another crew could
discern its specific location,

383
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:43,051
even if they could refit rapidly
enough to get out there ahead of you,

384
00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:45,887
they'd still be facing a warship
standing between them and their prize.

385
00:25:45,888 --> 00:25:49,307
Adhere to our plan,
you will have your gold

386
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:51,359
and I'll have my fort.

387
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:05,721
What are you doing here?

388
00:26:05,722 --> 00:26:08,390
I need to speak with you alone.

389
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:09,725
You need to leave here right now.

390
00:26:09,726 --> 00:26:11,009
I will see you when I am able.

391
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:13,915
I have come upon some information
which changes things for you.

392
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,084
You must not move against that fort.

393
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:18,553
Miranda, you don't
understand what's going on.

394
00:26:18,554 --> 00:26:21,757
I understand why you need that fort.

395
00:26:21,758 --> 00:26:23,809
I understand why you need that gold.

396
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,427
I understand why you need this island.

397
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:28,096
I understand it all because I was there

398
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:30,766
the day our lives ended
and all of this began.

399
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:34,853
But I have been devoted
to you since that day.

400
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:36,605
I have been loyal

401
00:26:36,606 --> 00:26:39,024
and protective and fucking
committed to you since that day,

402
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:41,610
and I am asking you to come with me

403
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:44,412
so that I can save your life.

404
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:53,622
There's an opportunity here today.

405
00:26:53,623 --> 00:26:56,174
An opportunity that may not
present itself again.

406
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:57,209
If we act right now,

407
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,346
we can prevent a catastrophic
loss to the Empire.

408
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:03,548
We can make England stronger
tomorrow than she is today.

409
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:05,383
We can save Nassau and all it takes

410
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:09,187
is for us to do
a very reasonable thing.

411
00:27:09,188 --> 00:27:10,472
Military pardons?

412
00:27:10,473 --> 00:27:11,890
I know how it will be perceived, sir.

413
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:16,228
I know how it looks for me to even
raise the subject with you here.

414
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:19,231
But this is too important to be
deterred by dangers imagined.

415
00:27:19,232 --> 00:27:21,316
And if I have learned
anything from you,

416
00:27:21,317 --> 00:27:22,868
it is that it is moments like these

417
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:25,987
that are the precise
measure of a man's courage.

418
00:27:25,988 --> 00:27:27,873
Good God.

419
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:31,659
You perceive the danger
about this to be imagined.

420
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:39,134
I told you when this began
to be careful of those people.

421
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:41,503
To be aware of just how
sharp and unexpected

422
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:44,555
the knife would be if you
discounted that danger.

423
00:27:46,776 --> 00:27:50,177
I'd thought you'd heard me, son.

424
00:27:55,768 --> 00:27:57,152
I heard you, sir.

425
00:27:57,153 --> 00:28:00,354
But I've come to see that you
and I were wrong about him.

426
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:03,325
Lord Hamilton isn't someone
we should be wary of,

427
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:06,327
he is exactly the kind of man
we should be listening to.

428
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:08,079
On the day I was made an officer,

429
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,999
you pulled me aside.

430
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,953
You told me how proud you were of me.

431
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:16,755
You told me that a measure of a man

432
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:19,508
is in the moment when he is
confronted by himself.

433
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:21,092
By opposing voices in his head,

434
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:22,827
both arguing that they are
right, but one has to be wrong.

435
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:26,131
To know the difference in that moment,
that is what makes an officer.

436
00:28:26,132 --> 00:28:28,300
What makes a man.

437
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:33,138
Well, I see the difference here, sir.

438
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:35,189
I know it.

439
00:28:51,457 --> 00:28:53,909
He arrived just before you did.

440
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,077
And he told me what you did.

441
00:28:56,078 --> 00:28:58,830
After he invited you into his home,

442
00:28:58,831 --> 00:29:02,000
trusted you to assist
his son and daughter,

443
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:04,818
and you flagrantly violated that trust.

444
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:06,421
Sir, I don't know
what he told you, but...

445
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:09,341
Yes, you do.

446
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:11,259
I would like to defend you.

447
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,679
I would like to remind myself
that every man has his flaws,

448
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,266
his weaknesses that torment him.

449
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:22,020
I would like to help you
recover from yours.

450
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:24,719
But not this. It is too profane.

451
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,973
It is too loathsome to be dismissed.

452
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:30,842
This is your end.

453
00:29:30,843 --> 00:29:32,260
Sir, please let me explain.

454
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:35,647
Be grateful it didn't happen
on the gallows.

455
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,349
You thought I wouldn't
hear what you'd done?

456
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,651
In my own house?

457
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:43,687
That not even the faintest
whisper of it would reach me?

458
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:48,759
Now, this ends quietly,

459
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,510
permanently,

460
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:53,346
and in the manner of my choosing.

461
00:29:54,522 --> 00:29:57,639
You are summarily
discharged from service.

462
00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:00,643
No charges will be drawn against you

463
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:03,146
provided you leave London quietly

464
00:30:03,147 --> 00:30:06,231
and are neither seen
nor heard from again.

465
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:09,798
If either the earl or I

466
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:12,706
feel that this bargain
has been breached,

467
00:30:12,707 --> 00:30:17,306
the charges brought against you
will be swift and unyielding.

468
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:31,353
Where's Thomas?

469
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:35,023
They came. The earl's men.

470
00:30:35,024 --> 00:30:37,525
It happened quickly before I
could do anything to stop it.

471
00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:40,577
- They took him.
- Took him? Took him where?

472
00:30:42,365 --> 00:30:45,700
Bethlem Royal Hospital.

473
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:47,869
He is to be committed there,

474
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,038
owing to his uncontrollable grief

475
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,041
over having learned
of my affair with you.

476
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:55,969
- Our affair?
- That is what the story will be.

477
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,595
I have been given until nightfall

478
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:01,725
to vacate this house.

479
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:04,847
And then you and I are to disappear.

480
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:09,593
I have friends in
Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels.

481
00:31:09,594 --> 00:31:11,428
I can get you set up comfortably.

482
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:14,931
Perhaps at some point, I can figure
out a way to get you back here.

483
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:17,017
- I'm not leaving.
- James.

484
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:18,768
- We're gonna get him out of there.
- We can't.

485
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:20,937
- You watch me.
- You think you're angry about this?

486
00:31:20,938 --> 00:31:23,989
- I'm beyond that.
- I am enraged!

487
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:30,327
He is my husband.

488
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:35,367
Before they took him away,
he made me promise him...

489
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:40,589
that no matter what happened
next, that you and I...

490
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:46,696
would take care of each other.

491
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:50,300
The danger here is real.

492
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:52,719
Thomas is gone.

493
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,771
And now you and I
must leave this place.

494
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,977
We need to get you moving.

495
00:32:00,978 --> 00:32:03,480
When we get to the harbor,
I'll arrange passage for you.

496
00:32:03,481 --> 00:32:06,232
Anything you need that you don't
have, I'll see sent to you.

497
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:08,351
In the meantime, my friends

498
00:32:08,352 --> 00:32:12,188
will ensure that you're taken care of.

499
00:32:12,189 --> 00:32:14,223
We won't be with your friends.

500
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:18,945
We're not going to Paris.

501
00:32:18,946 --> 00:32:22,032
Or Brussels or Amsterdam.

502
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:24,261
Then where are you going?

503
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,648
Open the crate.

504
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:33,492
Pass 'em down. Pass 'em down.

505
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:49,275
Idelle said you were looking for me?

506
00:32:49,276 --> 00:32:51,611
To your knowledge,
have any of Flint's crew

507
00:32:51,612 --> 00:32:55,315
made their way up to the
brothel since coming ashore?

508
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:57,349
Not that I'm aware of.

509
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:03,490
Back from a lengthy journey

510
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:07,927
and not one of them has
felt the need to have a go?

511
00:33:07,928 --> 00:33:09,512
Preparing for battle.

512
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:11,931
Perhaps they have set
pleasure aside for the moment.

513
00:33:11,932 --> 00:33:16,770
Mmm, or maybe they was told to
stay the fuck away from here.

514
00:33:16,771 --> 00:33:19,805
To prevent them
from divulging a secret.

515
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:30,600
- Charlotte.
- Don't.

516
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:33,053
- What?
- You're crowding me.

517
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:36,121
I understand this is very important
to you, but I can't work like this.

518
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,754
You have regular custom with the men
of Captain Flint's crew, yes?

519
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,377
It's all right.

520
00:33:57,378 --> 00:34:00,146
Just one.
He won't let the others near me.

521
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:03,066
Has he paid you a visit yet
since his recent arrival?

522
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:05,652
No, but he will.

523
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:07,587
Can't stay away for long, that one.

524
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:10,607
If or when he finally
decides to visit you,

525
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:13,843
I'd like to know what he has
to say about the Urca gold.

526
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,911
You haven't heard?

527
00:34:20,568 --> 00:34:22,769
Everyone's saying it wasn't there.

528
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,005
They ran into a man of war instead,
managed to nick that ship.

529
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:29,375
Yes, I know.
Just indulge me, will you?

530
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:31,294
- Mr. Rackham.
- Mm.

531
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:34,964
- A word.
- With me?

532
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:42,536
Thank you, love.

533
00:34:44,442 --> 00:34:46,572
"Thank you, love?"

534
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:51,798
- What's this?
- We need to talk about these articles.

535
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:54,134
And I thought it best if we
could have the conversation

536
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:56,185
just you and I.

537
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,981
All right. What's the
matter with the articles?

538
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:11,751
A few things.

539
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:13,820
- Max...
- Let me stop you there.

540
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:17,157
Yes, it's unorthodox to entitle a
woman to a share of the profits,

541
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:19,509
but this is clearly a special case.

542
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,394
That particular woman is a font

543
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:23,730
of prostitutional intelligence.

544
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:27,817
And believe me, if I could see
a way to replace her, I would.

545
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:30,603
But at the moment, she is worth
far, far more to this crew

546
00:35:30,604 --> 00:35:32,188
than the share it costs to have her.

547
00:35:32,189 --> 00:35:35,358
I understand,
but you must understand

548
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,411
that's not an easy thing
to sell men on a new ship

549
00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:40,163
used to a certain way of doing things.

550
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:41,664
Are you saying you can't sell it?

551
00:35:41,665 --> 00:35:46,202
No, I might be able to with
a great deal of cajoling.

552
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:48,421
The problem is Max's share

553
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:50,455
ain't the only item
the men took issue with.

554
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,990
Fuck's your problem?

555
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:25,825
The crew have elected to set sail.

556
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:26,910
Yeah?

557
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:28,745
Small prize nearby.

558
00:36:28,746 --> 00:36:30,163
Probably not much by way of profit,

559
00:36:30,164 --> 00:36:34,216
but an easy prize to consummate
our new arrangement.

560
00:36:37,137 --> 00:36:40,139
That's good news, then, yeah?

561
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:42,891
So again, fuck's your problem?

562
00:36:49,149 --> 00:36:50,600
There was a complication

563
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:53,019
in the finalizing of the articles.

564
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,271
Opposition from the men

565
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,323
on two particular issues.

566
00:36:57,324 --> 00:37:00,944
Shit. I knew this was gonna happen.

567
00:37:00,945 --> 00:37:02,946
- It's the whore's share, ain't it?
- It is.

568
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:06,115
Resistance to the idea of formalizing
her interest in writing.

569
00:37:06,116 --> 00:37:09,002
It's the second of the two
issues I find more troubling.

570
00:37:09,003 --> 00:37:11,955
- What's that?
- You.

571
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:14,624
It would appear that while the
crew seems able to forgive

572
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,426
or at least forget my part

573
00:37:16,427 --> 00:37:19,679
in the Mr. Hamund situation,

574
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,131
they are aware that you were
the prime mover behind it

575
00:37:22,132 --> 00:37:26,219
and they are less willing to forgive it
or forget it in your case.

576
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,272
They don't want me nor the whore?

577
00:37:29,273 --> 00:37:34,143
It was put to me that they will accept
one or the other, but not both.

578
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:36,062
Fucking hell.

579
00:37:36,063 --> 00:37:37,864
How are we gonna get her
to keep turning out those leads

580
00:37:37,865 --> 00:37:40,899
when she finds out she ain't
getting her own share?

581
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:48,897
What?

582
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:51,674
It's only temporary.
Till I gain their trust.

583
00:37:51,675 --> 00:37:54,664
Sooner than later, I'll be able to
make the case to them directly.

584
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:59,419
And you'll be back sailing with us
like this never happened.

585
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,304
You chose her.

586
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:03,172
They gave me a choice,
but it was no choice.

587
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:04,557
Had I gone the other way,

588
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:07,343
they'd be stewing about how I
value my relationship with you

589
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:08,845
over securing their leads.

590
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:11,514
It would have cost me their
trust and then the captaincy.

591
00:38:11,515 --> 00:38:13,650
Most assuredly soon there after.

592
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:16,402
This is what is best for both
of us in the final analysis.

593
00:38:16,403 --> 00:38:18,521
We will sail at the head of this crew,

594
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:21,908
it just requires this sacrifice
in the short term to ensure it.

595
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:24,943
Anne? Anne?

596
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:36,122
Perhaps it would help
if we went back to the beginning?

597
00:38:36,123 --> 00:38:37,707
You said you were
captured by the navy.

598
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:39,876
You said you escaped their
custody, made your way back here,

599
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:42,378
but you didn't mention the means
by which you managed that escape.

600
00:38:42,379 --> 00:38:44,547
- Why are you here?
- I beg your pardon?

601
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:47,467
Why are you the one
here defending him?

602
00:38:47,468 --> 00:38:50,053
Oh, yes. I suppose it must
come as some surprise

603
00:38:50,054 --> 00:38:53,222
given the state of things
when last we saw each other.

604
00:38:53,223 --> 00:38:56,559
But it's become clear to me that a
crew requires two men to function.

605
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,897
One to tell them what to do and another
to tell them why they should want to do it.

606
00:39:00,898 --> 00:39:04,734
In Mr. Gates' absence,
the latter role was unfilled.

607
00:39:04,735 --> 00:39:06,903
And I thought I could fill it.

608
00:39:06,904 --> 00:39:08,738
How the fuck did you manage that?

609
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:12,625
I tried to tell you once,
I'm a hard man not to like.

610
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:14,744
And at the end of the day,
and all else being equal,

611
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:17,147
liked is just as good as feared.

612
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:21,666
We like him.

613
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:28,224
You thought Flint
killed both me and Gates

614
00:39:28,225 --> 00:39:31,144
and then you queued up to be
the next to fill the post.

615
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:34,597
I don't know if you're either
very dangerous or very stupid.

616
00:39:34,598 --> 00:39:36,566
Possibly a bit of both.

617
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:40,520
But I am certain I will avoid
the mistake you both made.

618
00:39:40,521 --> 00:39:43,689
I don't believe in him.

619
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,410
To me, he is a means of
securing a very valuable prize.

620
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:49,946
No more, no less.

621
00:39:49,947 --> 00:39:52,628
Which is why I need to know...

622
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,953
when asked by the men,

623
00:39:56,954 --> 00:40:00,757
what will you tell them happened on
the bow of the Walrus that night?

624
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:03,292
How did you end up in the water?

625
00:40:03,293 --> 00:40:06,344
You keep focusing on how I went in.

626
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:12,517
Perhaps you should be more worried
about the thing that took me out.

627
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:17,974
I can see how the men could've
been taken in by you...

628
00:40:17,975 --> 00:40:20,893
with what they've been through.

629
00:40:20,894 --> 00:40:22,695
But know this...

630
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:24,897
had I been here,

631
00:40:24,898 --> 00:40:29,068
I doubt it would have been
this easy for you.

632
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:33,322
Sooner or later, you need to release me.

633
00:40:33,323 --> 00:40:35,992
You have no choice.

634
00:40:35,993 --> 00:40:37,727
And the longer you delay,

635
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:40,329
the more likely I might choose

636
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,199
to take it personally.

637
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,251
I would say I have some choice.

638
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,760
Not while he's here you don't.

639
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:56,795
We like him, too.

640
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:48,764
You must understand, though
you perceive my actions in recent weeks

641
00:41:48,765 --> 00:41:51,434
to have been taken with little
regard for your welfare,

642
00:41:51,435 --> 00:41:53,686
the truth is exactly the opposite.

643
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:56,973
All of my attempts to regain
control of this place

644
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:58,774
have been with an eye
towards protecting you.

645
00:41:58,775 --> 00:42:01,110
You really have no idea
what this is about, do you?

646
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:03,353
- Eleanor.
- You left me.

647
00:42:04,748 --> 00:42:07,716
After mother was killed in the
Rosario raid, you left me here.

648
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,088
What kind of a reprehensible shit

649
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:14,907
does something like that
to a little girl

650
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:18,728
and then asks her to trust him again?

651
00:42:18,729 --> 00:42:20,596
Your mother's loss

652
00:42:20,597 --> 00:42:23,516
was almost unbearable to me.

653
00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:25,101
I must confess that in that moment,

654
00:42:25,102 --> 00:42:27,486
the only way I could think to carry on

655
00:42:27,487 --> 00:42:29,355
was to immerse myself in business.

656
00:42:29,356 --> 00:42:31,774
And to remove myself from this place.

657
00:42:31,775 --> 00:42:33,496
From her memory.

658
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,398
And for that, I am sorry.

659
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:41,135
Bullshit.

660
00:42:42,235 --> 00:42:44,213
It wasn't about Mother.

661
00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:47,058
It wasn't about an oversight.

662
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:51,493
You left me here
because I wasn't your son.

663
00:42:58,802 --> 00:43:00,965
Yes.

664
00:43:03,473 --> 00:43:05,391
I was focused on the work

665
00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:07,860
and I saw no future in which a daughter

666
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:10,895
would have a meaningful part in that.

667
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,152
But, Eleanor,

668
00:43:16,153 --> 00:43:18,442
look how wrong I was.

669
00:43:19,623 --> 00:43:22,458
Look at what you've accomplished here.

670
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:23,709
Pirate crews...

671
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,413
repurposed as merchant
shippers and showing profits.

672
00:43:27,414 --> 00:43:30,049
You have proved the conceit possible.

673
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,834
You are making real

674
00:43:31,835 --> 00:43:34,637
what was for decades a fantasy.

675
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:37,423
The idea that this place
can be transformed,

676
00:43:37,424 --> 00:43:41,427
made profitable, redeemed from
within and on its own terms?

677
00:43:41,428 --> 00:43:45,398
You are doing this
without any help from me,

678
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:48,851
nor from Whitehall, nor from
anyone in London at all.

679
00:43:48,852 --> 00:43:53,489
It is entirely of your own making.

680
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,908
And it is miraculous.

681
00:43:55,909 --> 00:43:57,660
One day, years from now,

682
00:43:57,661 --> 00:43:59,578
someone in London will sit down,

683
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:01,697
light his pipe and tell his children

684
00:44:01,698 --> 00:44:06,452
of the unlikely success story
that was Nassau.

685
00:44:06,453 --> 00:44:09,005
And he will say
it all began with a woman

686
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:12,274
who decided to make it so.

687
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:16,846
You have proven me so very wrong.

688
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:20,077
And I could not be
prouder of you for it.

689
00:44:21,802 --> 00:44:24,720
Miss Guthrie? Miss Guthrie?

690
00:44:31,395 --> 00:44:34,446
I have Flint here. It would
be best if we could be alone.

691
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,950
You can use the parlor upstairs.

692
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:52,465
Everyone out.

693
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:53,916
Now!

694
00:45:19,443 --> 00:45:21,193
While you were gone,

695
00:45:21,194 --> 00:45:22,645
Captain Vane and his men

696
00:45:22,646 --> 00:45:26,148
slaughtered another
pirate crew in the bay.

697
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:28,951
There are whispers it was to avenge
an offense against Eleanor Guthrie.

698
00:45:28,952 --> 00:45:30,820
There are also whispers

699
00:45:30,821 --> 00:45:33,522
that it was to steal a hostage
being held by that crew.

700
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:36,275
A girl who is now held in that fort.

701
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,944
A girl who would be in harm's way
if you were to launch your attack.

702
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,781
You pulled me away from my men
out of concern for a girl?

703
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:44,783
The girl's name is Abigail Ashe.

704
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,258
Peter's daughter?

705
00:45:52,259 --> 00:45:54,543
You need to obtain her
from Captain Vane.

706
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:56,345
Alive and unharmed.

707
00:45:56,346 --> 00:45:58,848
And you need to return her
to Carolina, to her father.

708
00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:01,300
I understand you have feelings
over the girl's welfare, however...

709
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,686
And when you return her,

710
00:46:03,687 --> 00:46:06,105
you're going to explain to Peter

711
00:46:06,106 --> 00:46:09,441
what it is you are trying to
accomplish here.

712
00:46:09,442 --> 00:46:12,194
A Nassau that can self-govern,

713
00:46:12,195 --> 00:46:13,896
pardons for your men, and a
stake in their own future.

714
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:16,949
What you want. What Thomas wanted.

715
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,568
What we all wanted.

716
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:20,820
And he is going to help you achieve it.

717
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:23,038
- He's gonna help me?
- Yes.

718
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,324
And how exactly is he gonna do that?

719
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:27,993
Thomas knew no one more
skilled or effective

720
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:31,046
at maneuvering an agenda
through Parliament than Peter.

721
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:32,348
If he wanted to convince them

722
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:34,850
to support your vision for
this place, he could do that.

723
00:46:34,851 --> 00:46:36,852
You know he could do that.

724
00:46:36,853 --> 00:46:38,354
We tried it before, it didn't work.

725
00:46:38,355 --> 00:46:41,357
It was a different time.

726
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:43,692
There's no Alfred Hamilton now.

727
00:46:43,693 --> 00:46:45,694
There's no war with Spain now.

728
00:46:45,695 --> 00:46:48,480
Peter was faced with both those
things and almost succeeded.

729
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:50,866
Without them,
it is well within his reach.

730
00:46:50,867 --> 00:46:53,519
Miranda, Peter Ashe isn't
the man that you remember.

731
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,373
Six months ago, he hanged
four men in his harbor

732
00:46:57,374 --> 00:47:00,025
for possession of pirated goods.

733
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,111
This is not a man
that we can negotiate with...

734
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:05,197
- that I can negotiate with.
- Of course you can.

735
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:08,367
Because you will have just presented
him with his only daughter.

736
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:12,004
Safe and unharmed
and without conditions.

737
00:47:12,005 --> 00:47:14,540
And you will have reminded him
that you are still the man

738
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:16,809
who sat in Thomas' salon and spoke of

739
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:18,843
virtue and reason and forgiveness.

740
00:47:24,067 --> 00:47:26,117
That found inspiration in him.

741
00:47:36,046 --> 00:47:39,665
And you will remind Peter
that somewhere in his heart,

742
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:41,217
so is he.

743
00:47:41,218 --> 00:47:42,468
This is too important

744
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:44,920
to put all our fates
in the hands of one man.

745
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:46,422
Especially a man so committed

746
00:47:46,423 --> 00:47:49,842
to seeing me and everyone else
I know hanged in his harbor.

747
00:47:49,843 --> 00:47:51,410
There is no other way to achieve
what you want to achieve...

748
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,128
Yes there is!

749
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:55,347
It is sitting on a beach
filled with Spanish soldiers,

750
00:47:55,348 --> 00:47:57,349
- and I'm through delaying.
- There is no other way

751
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:02,354
once you're willing to tell the
truth about your intentions here.

752
00:48:02,355 --> 00:48:04,990
I think that I've made
my intentions very clear.

753
00:48:04,991 --> 00:48:06,525
No.

754
00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:11,280
You've been anything but clear.

755
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:14,450
You say you fight for the sake of
Nassau, for the sake of your men,

756
00:48:14,451 --> 00:48:18,420
for the sake of Thomas and his memory.

757
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:21,123
But the truth of the matter is,
it isn't for any of those things.

758
00:48:21,124 --> 00:48:23,042
What the fuck do you think
I am fighting for?

759
00:48:23,043 --> 00:48:26,795
I think you are fighting
for the sake of fighting.

760
00:48:26,796 --> 00:48:29,548
Because it's the only state
in which you can function.

761
00:48:29,549 --> 00:48:32,184
The only way to keep
that voice in your head

762
00:48:32,185 --> 00:48:33,519
from driving you mad.

763
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,554
What are you talking about?
What voice?

764
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:43,429
The one telling you
to be ashamed of yourself...

765
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,463
for having loved him.

766
00:49:30,276 --> 00:49:32,864
You were told that it was shameful.

767
00:49:33,863 --> 00:49:35,826
And part of you believed it.

768
00:49:37,592 --> 00:49:39,602
Thomas was my husband.

769
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:42,588
I loved him and he loved me.

770
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:45,674
But what he shared with you...

771
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:49,678
it was entirely something else.

772
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,114
It's time you allowed
yourself to accept that.

773
00:49:58,555 --> 00:50:00,555
The only thing I am ashamed of...

774
00:50:03,727 --> 00:50:07,446
is that I didn't do
something to save him

775
00:50:07,447 --> 00:50:09,480
when we had the chance.

776
00:50:14,287 --> 00:50:17,321
That instead I listened to you.
