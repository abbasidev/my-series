1
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:14,015
I have committed men and resources

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,506
to aid you in retrieving the Urca gold

3
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,091
in exchange for which you assured me

4
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:20,927
expelling Captain Vane from that fort.

5
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:22,429
Back from a lengthy journey,

6
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:24,714
and not one of them has
felt the need to have a go.

7
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:27,050
Maybe they was told
to stay away from it.

8
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:29,469
To prevent them from divulging a secret.

9
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:32,472
Max's share ain't the only
item the men took issue with.

10
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:33,940
You chose her.

11
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:35,558
They gave me a choice,
but it was no choice.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,977
Anne? Anne!

13
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,230
Until I know what
you're going to say to the men,

14
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:42,282
I can't let you say anything to the men.

15
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:44,284
The girl's name is Abigail Ashe.

16
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:45,985
You need to obtain
her from Captain Vane.

17
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:47,871
And when you return her to her father,

18
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:50,573
you're going to explain what it is
you're trying to accomplish here...

19
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:52,792
a Nassau that can self-govern.

20
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:54,228
It's too great of a force to defeat.

21
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:55,912
We attempt to fight the body of it.

22
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:58,476
The only way to beat it
is to cut off its head.

23
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:31,901
Had I two rounds left,

24
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:34,404
I would shoot both of you
and be done with all of this.

25
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,789
Can't avoid it any longer.
It's time you made a choice.

26
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:38,408
Enough.

27
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,076
You two will resolve this.

28
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:41,578
This isn't going to end
the way you want it to.

29
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,247
This ends in this room right now.

30
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:47,083
He can't let it, and neither can I.

31
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:51,588
Sit down.

32
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,340
Why the fuck should I sit?

33
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:59,429
There is a girl in your possession.

34
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:02,649
Her name is Abigail.

35
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,651
Give her to me and I
will stand down my men.

36
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:06,069
You can have the fort.

37
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:12,025
You'd give all this up
for a little money?

38
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,162
She's worth more to me than money.

39
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:21,534
She's the future of this place.

40
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,793
Send word for your father.

41
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:32,879
He should hear this as well.

42
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:57,870
We're through the Twin Pass and
well into the zone on schedule.

43
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,459
- Captain?
- Listen.

44
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:07,330
Do you hear it?

45
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:11,634
No women.

46
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:16,089
Yes, well...

47
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:18,007
in any event, according to the whore,

48
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,759
the True North should be here.

49
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:21,761
According to the whore,
the ship is insured

50
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:23,429
up, down, and sideways,

51
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:26,015
so they should surrender the
moment they see the black,

52
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,317
netting the men a quick
and painless score,

53
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:30,770
and you an auspicious debut.

54
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:32,438
Now it's just a matter of whether or not

55
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,574
the whore's information proves accurate.

56
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:41,831
And if there's anything you
need assistance with today,

57
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,584
please don't hesitate to ask me.

58
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:47,754
- Such as?
- Well, I've heard things.

59
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:49,539
Heard the role you played on the Ranger

60
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,708
was almost entirely a political one.

61
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,262
Heard Captain Vane was
the sailor among you.

62
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:58,765
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

63
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,600
You certainly would not be the first man

64
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:02,185
to learn how to captain a ship

65
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,020
after being named captain of a ship.

66
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:07,106
- I see.
- Look, Jack.

67
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:09,308
I vouched for you.

68
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,862
We are both invested in this...

69
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:15,732
experiment working out.

70
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:18,618
Sails!

71
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,287
Sails!

72
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:23,372
West, northwest!

73
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:25,376
It's the True North!

74
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,044
Right where she's supposed to be.

75
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,913
- All right, gents! Let's go get her!
- Come to starboard.

76
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:34,083
Make a heading west,
nor-west to intercept her.

77
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:37,587
Chop it off on the braces and
strike the mainsail and foresail.

78
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,143
Today!

79
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:58,135
Bit of a surprise to them,
that one, wasn't it?

80
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,443
Not to blame them,

81
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:02,578
seeing as that you just opened a pursuit

82
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:04,831
where speed will be of the essence

83
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:09,952
by releasing the sails and
steering us in the wrong direction.

84
00:07:10,004 --> 00:07:12,789
Though I suppose there's a chance

85
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,458
you struck the sails to make us nimbler.

86
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,679
Tack hard to starboard to
alter our angle of approach.

87
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:22,799
Come up right behind
her and steal her wind.

88
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:29,939
Sails!

89
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:31,357
Heard you the first time!

90
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:33,609
Second set!

91
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:35,611
West, south-west!

92
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:40,983
Two prizes.

93
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:42,985
Not likely.

94
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:52,078
It's pursuing ours.

95
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,247
Another hunter.

96
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,716
We have competition it would seem.

97
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:24,360
Fuck this.

98
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:26,946
Where are you going?

99
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:29,282
I'll be back in an hour.

100
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:30,583
Anyone asks, I'm taking a shit.

101
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:31,751
Who shits for an hour?

102
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:33,753
I do.

103
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:35,755
Captain says anyone walks
away from this beach

104
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,424
with this fight looming
don't need to ever come back.

105
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:39,739
Shut the fuck up.

106
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,240
And what's worse, you're going to go

107
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:43,960
to the one place on the island
he said we're not allowed to go.

108
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:45,544
He said the whores there work too hard

109
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,296
taking secrets from men's heads.

110
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,966
Mate, I'm so close, I can smell her.

111
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:52,969
So either I'm going up
there and fucking Charlotte,

112
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:54,804
or I'm fucking you down here

113
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,589
imagining I'm fucking
Charlotte up there.

114
00:08:58,226 --> 00:08:59,675
Tell her I said hello.

115
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:01,594
Right.

116
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:03,679
Fuck.

117
00:09:03,731 --> 00:09:05,681
Men cannot be kept in this state.

118
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,233
Sooner or later, they must fight

119
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:08,935
or they must know
there will be no fight.

120
00:09:08,937 --> 00:09:11,771
And now he's nowhere to be found.

121
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:13,439
Much can be said about Captain,

122
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:15,942
but shying away from a fight
isn't one of them.

123
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:18,527
Whatever he's doing up
there in that tavern,

124
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:22,114
I'm certain it's towards the
end of prevailing in this fight.

125
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,533
At a certain point I'll cease
to care what his ends are

126
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:27,119
and lead these men up that hill myself.

127
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,292
I don't think that's going
to be an option anytime soon.

128
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:35,094
What are you talking about?

129
00:10:57,345 --> 00:10:59,628
It will likely start with three ships,

130
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,381
maybe four.

131
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:05,351
A tactical assault to retake the bay.

132
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:08,888
Once England decides she
wants this place back,

133
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,943
the resources that she will
commit towards that end

134
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:16,112
are inexhaustible.

135
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:19,115
Sooner or later, we'll be driven inland,

136
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,951
forced to fight as
rebels from the interior

137
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:24,954
hoping to inflict enough damage

138
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:27,289
and expense to compel the new governor

139
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:30,326
to negotiate with what's left of us.

140
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:33,913
For years I prepared for that fight.

141
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:37,716
Now it would appear that
there is another way,

142
00:11:37,752 --> 00:11:42,338
a way in which we can control
our futures without that fight.

143
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:45,891
And as fate would have it,

144
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:50,096
you are holding the key
to make that possible.

145
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:53,816
The girl.

146
00:11:53,851 --> 00:11:56,435
Her father is a very powerful,

147
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,604
very influential man.

148
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:01,407
If I return her to him unharmed,

149
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:04,693
I believe that I can win him as an ally,

150
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:06,278
an advocate in London

151
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,416
to argue for a
reconciliation with England

152
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:14,787
where we keep our assets,
maintain control,

153
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:17,456
and name a governor of our own choosing.

154
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,793
I believe that there is
an opportunity at hand,

155
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:25,431
an opportunity where we
control our own futures.

156
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:30,970
We just all need to agree to take it.

157
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:32,888
Peter Ashe.

158
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,308
Returning his daughter
might gain his ear,

159
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,144
but there is no man in the Americas

160
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:41,113
with a more strident
contempt for piracy than he.

161
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:45,151
No amount of appreciation is
going to make him forget that.

162
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:48,571
A long time ago, he and I were friends.

163
00:12:48,623 --> 00:12:50,623
Good friends.

164
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:54,326
We fought alongside each
other towards this very end...

165
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:59,381
a stable and prosperous Nassau.

166
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,667
We're talking about a man

167
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:04,336
who took a struggling Carolina colony

168
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:06,839
and turned it into a commercial success.

169
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:10,309
And from what I'm told
by friends in London,

170
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:12,311
is unparalleled in his ability

171
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:15,598
to maneuver the avenues
of power in Parliament.

172
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,685
If that man could be persuaded,
as you say,

173
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:23,772
if that man chose to be our advocate,

174
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:26,108
that would certainly argue
well for our prospects.

175
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,028
What do I get?

176
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,031
If this, if that.

177
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:34,700
Yet it all relies on an
asset you do not possess.

178
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:37,503
What do you get?
You get what we all get... a future.

179
00:13:37,538 --> 00:13:39,038
Show it to me.

180
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,873
Hand me my future here in this room.

181
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:46,378
What? It isn't just your words, is it?

182
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,515
The promise of a thing hard to
define and impossible to deliver...

183
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,384
that is what you're suggesting I get

184
00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:53,886
in exchange for surrendering an asset

185
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,354
worth what that girl is worth?

186
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:56,972
If you're looking for
something more immediate,

187
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:59,441
then how about your own survival?

188
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:02,194
If we cannot agree to do this together,
then I walk out of here

189
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,613
and I lead my men in cutting down

190
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,115
what remains of yours.

191
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,784
This girl is so valuable to you,

192
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:11,537
and you would risk her death
just to punish me?

193
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:13,989
You want her? You have two choices.

194
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,742
Try and take her and hope
she survives the fight

195
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:20,579
or pay me what she's worth.

196
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:23,215
And what exactly do you
estimate that to be?

197
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:27,303
One Spanish Man of War.

198
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:32,258
He can't do that even if he wanted to.

199
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,642
That ship belongs to his men.

200
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:35,427
Says the woman who managed

201
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:37,179
to separate me from my last ship

202
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:38,764
with just a few choice words.

203
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:41,066
You want to see that girl alive,

204
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:43,602
I suggest you not try and stop me.

205
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:45,654
Among the men she is
surrounded by right now,

206
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,858
I am quite certainly
the most reasonable one.

207
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:53,279
I believe my terms are clear.

208
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,285
You know where to find me
to deliver your response.

209
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:16,435
Stop.

210
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,270
You can't walk away from this.

211
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,226
Were it anyone else in the world,

212
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:27,112
you would see right through this.

213
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:31,533
But that man starts talking
and you'll believe anything.

214
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:33,235
You have a choice to make.

215
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:35,738
It's long past due.

216
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:39,992
Until then, there's nothing
for you and I to say.

217
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,556
What are you doing?

218
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:57,726
Parsing leads from the girls.

219
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,678
Why? Should I be doing something else?

220
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,598
You're telling me you
haven't heard what happened?

221
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:07,569
The crew of the Eagle was
recruiting by the beach.

222
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:10,689
Anne Bonny showed up looking to join.

223
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:16,195
Quartermaster tells
her if Jack Rackham's

224
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:17,696
got no appetite for her on his crew,

225
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:20,032
they for fucking certain don't either.

226
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:25,371
What did she do?

227
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:28,674
She grabbed a marling spike
and plunged it in his jaw.

228
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,342
Took out three teeth.

229
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:33,512
Which brings me to my original question.

230
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:35,931
What the hell are you doing here?

231
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:37,883
Why aren't there men at your door?

232
00:16:37,885 --> 00:16:39,385
You are afraid she will come here

233
00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:41,553
and attempt to harm me.

234
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:44,056
Everyone's heard what happened.

235
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:47,443
Jack had a choice, pay you or keep her.

236
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:48,944
He chose you.

237
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:51,447
She's gone fucking mad over it.

238
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:53,899
Idelle, how would you feel

239
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:57,152
if the one man you thought
would never betray you did?

240
00:16:57,204 --> 00:17:00,572
If he purchased for himself a
future through that betrayal?

241
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:03,292
If you were told by a world full of men

242
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:05,627
that that betrayal confirmed for them

243
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:09,581
that they were right to see
you as a monster to be shunned?

244
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:13,585
She's not mad.

245
00:17:13,587 --> 00:17:15,053
She is adrift.

246
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,974
Alone in the most terrifying way.

247
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:22,010
What she will do next, I do not know.

248
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:24,646
But I refuse to proclaim myself

249
00:17:24,682 --> 00:17:26,348
to be yet another one of her enemies

250
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,601
by acting like I have
something to fear from her.

251
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:34,573
If she returns, if the girls see her,

252
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:37,242
tell them to allow her a wide berth

253
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:39,745
and tell me at once.

254
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:47,035
Logan's come up from the beach.

255
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,875
Mr. Rackham was right.

256
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:56,712
Flint forbade any of the
Walrus men from coming here.

257
00:17:56,764 --> 00:17:59,548
If the secret they are
hiding is that important,

258
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,134
perhaps this is something
we should let alone.

259
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:05,304
He has already brought
you into his confidence.

260
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:08,390
Just show him you are calm.

261
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:12,561
Let him talk and
everything will be fine.

262
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,196
Hmm?

263
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:33,499
I assume you're the one
who fetched Eleanor?

264
00:18:38,255 --> 00:18:39,755
Why didn't you just leave me there?

265
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:45,344
I couldn't.

266
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:50,015
Thank you.

267
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:55,404
What happens in London?

268
00:18:55,439 --> 00:19:00,359
Assume your appeal to
Lord Ashe is persuasive.

269
00:19:00,411 --> 00:19:02,110
Assume you bring him here,

270
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:03,912
show him that everything necessary

271
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:07,199
to make Nassau a viable,
permanent colony

272
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:09,535
is already in place and functioning.

273
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:13,372
Then he has to make the
case to Parliament, yes?

274
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:15,207
Yes.

275
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,875
But while he's trying to persuade them

276
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:20,546
that there are reasonable men
among the pirates of Nassau,

277
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:24,550
men ready to govern themselves
responsibly and peacefully,

278
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:26,051
no one will be listening,

279
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:28,220
because in the next room

280
00:19:28,222 --> 00:19:31,390
the ambassador to the court
of King Philip of Spain

281
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:34,526
will be shaking his fists with rage,

282
00:19:34,562 --> 00:19:38,397
screaming about how
these same reasonable men

283
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:42,401
just stole five million Spanish
dollars from the king's treasury.

284
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:45,404
He'll be demanding
Whitehall denounce the act

285
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:50,409
or risk losing the hard-won
peace between both nations.

286
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:54,746
If Lord Ashe is to have
any prayer of succeeding

287
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:57,249
in what you are asking of him,

288
00:19:57,251 --> 00:20:00,586
not only can you not
retrieve the Urca gold,

289
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:03,221
no one else here can retrieve it either.

290
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:04,923
They saw it with their own eyes.

291
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:08,260
In their minds,
half of it is spent already.

292
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:13,482
To persuade them to let it go at
this point is an impossibility.

293
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:15,901
I don't dispute that.

294
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:20,405
But I would argue it is also
indisputable that these two plans,

295
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:23,742
courting Lord Ashe and
retrieving the Urca gold,

296
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:26,078
are working against each other.

297
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:28,747
Perhaps even mutually
exclude each other.

298
00:20:28,782 --> 00:20:31,416
- I will make it work.
- How could you possibly?

299
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:34,086
I don't know...

300
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:35,121
yet.

301
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:41,593
He agreed.

302
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:43,795
He agreed?

303
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:45,297
Abigail Ashe will be surrendered to you

304
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,882
in exchange for which you will agree

305
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:50,185
to make no further move
against him or the fort.

306
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,554
He lives.

307
00:20:52,606 --> 00:20:54,640
I'm sorry,
but I'm having a difficult time

308
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:56,141
believing that he agreed.

309
00:20:56,143 --> 00:20:57,726
He agreed, he didn't agree.

310
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:59,394
What difference does it make?

311
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:01,196
I am guaranteeing that the exchange

312
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,814
you offered will be honored.

313
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:04,783
Do you understand?

314
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:06,735
You want me to go to my men

315
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,320
and deny them a fight

316
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:10,455
that I have led them
to believe is critical

317
00:21:10,491 --> 00:21:11,957
for the future of this place

318
00:21:11,992 --> 00:21:13,992
and do so based upon your word

319
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:17,546
that Charles Vane will
compensate them for it?

320
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:20,499
That is exactly what
I'm asking you to do.

321
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:22,801
I'll say it again.

322
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:25,671
I am guaranteeing the
terms of this deal.

323
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:29,891
If you deliver on your promise,

324
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:32,344
if you prevent any further
attack on the fort,

325
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:34,596
I will bring the girl down from the hill

326
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:36,181
and deliver her to you.

327
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:40,686
Will you fulfill your
end of this bargain?

328
00:21:44,074 --> 00:21:45,691
Yes or no?

329
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:20,308
- Do you recognize it?
- No.

330
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,860
Not a Nassau crew.

331
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,880
Let's get this underway, shall we?

332
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:48,003
Captain Jack Rackham
of the Colonial Dawn.

333
00:22:49,256 --> 00:22:51,306
Never heard of you.

334
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:53,091
Well, perhaps you should get out more.

335
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:07,674
Good one.

336
00:23:08,692 --> 00:23:11,193
Captain Linus Harcourt of the Goliath.

337
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,282
Your ship is named after the greatest
disappointment in the history of warfare?

338
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:22,587
I like how it sounds.

339
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:24,956
Pleasure to meet you.

340
00:23:27,594 --> 00:23:29,344
Have you ever done one of these before?

341
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:33,048
Split a baby? No. No, I haven't.

342
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,217
We've had a few.

343
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:37,719
One of three outcomes, in my experience.

344
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:40,722
One, crews fight it out.

345
00:23:40,774 --> 00:23:45,143
Seeing our obvious advantage
in strength of numbers,

346
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:48,563
you're wise enough to forgo that option.

347
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:51,533
Two, captains fight it out.

348
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:53,568
Don't know about you,

349
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,371
but this doesn't seem like a
haul worth dying over to me.

350
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:57,489
Yeah, what's three?

351
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:01,493
Reasonable men agree.

352
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:07,676
The first thing I remember
is being in the hold

353
00:24:07,704 --> 00:24:10,254
of that ship, shackled.

354
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,709
Then, um, a man came in.

355
00:24:16,462 --> 00:24:18,713
The Scarborough's captain.

356
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:21,933
And he just said one thing.

357
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:24,218
He said,

358
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,189
"Yesterday, you were a free man.

359
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:32,526
Today you are a thief
condemned to die."

360
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,397
I saw a garrison on Harbour Island.

361
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:39,066
200 men.

362
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:43,571
I saw an armory, some barracks.

363
00:24:43,623 --> 00:24:47,408
They weren't passing through.

364
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,544
The navy is, this moment,

365
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,248
fully encamped 40 miles
away from where you stand.

366
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:03,808
Eventually, the man
who guarded me got careless,

367
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:05,476
let me get too close...

368
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:10,598
Billy, we're all relieved
beyond words that you're here,

369
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,935
but the question on all of
our minds in this moment

370
00:25:13,937 --> 00:25:17,905
is how did you end up in the
water in the first place?

371
00:25:19,943 --> 00:25:22,777
Mr. Gates assumed,
I assumed, we all assumed,

372
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:25,446
the captain had a hand in your fall

373
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:28,032
to silence your opposition to him.

374
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,621
Do you remember what happened
on the bow of the Walrus that night?

375
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:44,382
You ought to go.

376
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:46,934
It'll take me a while to
straighten things out down there,

377
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:51,055
but when I do, I'll be home...

378
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:54,275
if you'll have me.

379
00:25:55,812 --> 00:25:58,029
I'm not going anywhere.

380
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:00,731
What?

381
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:03,451
Abigail doesn't know you.

382
00:26:03,486 --> 00:26:06,620
She doesn't know Miss Guthrie.

383
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:08,823
She did know me once.

384
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:12,243
There's a good chance she
might even recognize me.

385
00:26:12,295 --> 00:26:14,078
I would assume your plan would work best

386
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,415
if she were cooperative in it,
if she felt safe.

387
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:18,916
There's no better way to ensure that

388
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,751
than having me be a part of it.

389
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:23,170
Part of it? For how long?

390
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:25,890
I don't know.

391
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:28,893
Aren't we all just
figuring this out as we go?

392
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:33,431
You and Peter weren't the only ones

393
00:26:33,483 --> 00:26:35,516
committed to seeing Nassau set aright.

394
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:39,653
You weren't the only one who paid
a heavy toll towards that end.

395
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:42,189
I stood aside too long.

396
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:46,944
If you and I are to be partners...

397
00:26:49,115 --> 00:26:51,248
then we ought to be partners.

398
00:26:53,286 --> 00:26:55,169
Very well.

399
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:58,372
Captain.

400
00:27:06,382 --> 00:27:08,432
There's been a development.

401
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:11,268
I'm on my way down to the
beach to inform the men.

402
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:13,270
Before you do that,

403
00:27:13,306 --> 00:27:16,057
there is something you need to know.

404
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:18,726
There's been a development
down there, too.

405
00:27:58,601 --> 00:28:01,102
Where the fuck are you going?

406
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,491
You got Flint's man up there,
is what I hear.

407
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:08,943
I'm looking for Max.

408
00:28:08,945 --> 00:28:11,745
- I'm really not supposed to...
- Get him to talk?

409
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,784
Are you fucking serious?

410
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:18,786
You going to play games with me?

411
00:28:18,788 --> 00:28:20,955
What did he say to you?

412
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:24,008
He said the gold is still out there.

413
00:28:25,628 --> 00:28:28,212
He said that Flint still
plans to go get it.

414
00:28:28,264 --> 00:28:32,183
Out there? Where the fuck is it?

415
00:28:32,218 --> 00:28:33,968
He wouldn't say.

416
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,437
But he's coming back later tonight.

417
00:28:36,472 --> 00:28:37,938
Tonight.

418
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:39,190
They cut me loose.

419
00:28:39,225 --> 00:28:41,192
But something this
important needs doing,

420
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:43,444
leave a fucking whore to do it.

421
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:45,946
I can go get it. I'm just being careful.

422
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:47,231
Wait!

423
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:52,403
Charlotte, I can't find my belt anywhere.

424
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:53,871
You know who I am?

425
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:56,157
I sure as shit know who you are.

426
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,658
Fuck's the gold?

427
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,826
Please don't.

428
00:28:58,878 --> 00:29:00,327
God damn it, Charlotte.

429
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:01,662
Where the fuck is the gold?

430
00:29:01,664 --> 00:29:02,913
I'm getting Max.

431
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:06,417
Don't move. I won't say it again.

432
00:29:06,469 --> 00:29:08,552
You want me to believe
you won't betray your men?

433
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:10,304
Your friends?

434
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:12,806
All men betray when it suits them.

435
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:15,226
And right now I'd say
it'd fucking suit you.

436
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:17,228
Fuck you.

437
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:22,816
You won't fucking touch me.

438
00:29:22,852 --> 00:29:26,687
You know who my captain is?
Who my brothers are?

439
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:28,155
Who the fuck are you?

440
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:31,408
Some skinny little cunt without a crew.

441
00:29:32,578 --> 00:29:34,111
Not a fucking soul...

442
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:40,618
What did you do?

443
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,119
You fucking lunatic!

444
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:43,587
What the fuck is wrong with you?

445
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:12,066
First day as captain, is it?

446
00:30:12,118 --> 00:30:14,118
What makes you say that?

447
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:15,953
Little things.

448
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,655
A few looks from your men.

449
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:20,574
They're curious how you'll handle this.

450
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,994
Your banner.

451
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:26,831
Something in the way
your men reacted to...

452
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,466
The banner?
What's the matter with the banner?

453
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:32,636
Well, it's new. Lightly traveled.

454
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:43,346
Why? What do you think is wrong with it?

455
00:30:44,817 --> 00:30:46,850
It's fine.

456
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:51,272
There. What do you think?

457
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:11,792
Is this supposed to be a joke?

458
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:12,876
What do you mean?

459
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:15,296
This isn't remotely an even split.

460
00:31:15,348 --> 00:31:17,931
You get almost half the total tonnage.

461
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:19,550
Yeah.

462
00:31:19,602 --> 00:31:21,302
The shit half.

463
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:23,721
You get the tobacco and
sugar and I get what?

464
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:27,141
Blankets, pots and pans.

465
00:31:27,143 --> 00:31:29,310
Your half of the tonnage

466
00:31:29,312 --> 00:31:32,229
is worth nine-tenths the value.

467
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:35,482
It's closer to four-fifths.

468
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:39,153
We agreed we would reach a
reasonable settlement here.

469
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:41,655
As in an equitable result.

470
00:31:41,657 --> 00:31:45,042
As in a result based on reason.

471
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:48,962
Had we come to blows over this prize,

472
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:52,466
there's no doubt my men
would have won it whole.

473
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:54,551
I'm offering you a meaningful share

474
00:31:54,587 --> 00:31:57,471
just for having got here first.

475
00:31:57,506 --> 00:31:58,972
It's the most I can spare

476
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:01,508
without losing my men's faith in me.

477
00:32:04,397 --> 00:32:06,847
I know we have the advantage here.

478
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:10,401
I can see your numbers.
I can see you.

479
00:32:13,856 --> 00:32:15,606
Did Billy say what happened?

480
00:32:15,658 --> 00:32:17,941
He was fished from the
water by the Scarborough,

481
00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:20,160
tortured, escaped.

482
00:32:20,196 --> 00:32:22,112
Did he say how he went into the water?

483
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:25,449
Said he lost his footing. Said he fell.

484
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:28,118
He said you tried to save him.

485
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,504
And how did the crew
react to hearing that?

486
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:32,339
Stunned surprise, I would say.

487
00:32:34,877 --> 00:32:37,211
Before the captain gets here,
there are some things

488
00:32:37,263 --> 00:32:39,096
I would like to discuss in private.

489
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:22,953
It's good to have you back again.

490
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:28,459
Captain!

491
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:41,555
107 men have been standing on
this beach awaiting your return,

492
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:44,725
waiting to complete the task to
which we've all bound ourselves.

493
00:33:44,777 --> 00:33:45,777
Waiting.

494
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:47,478
Perhaps now that you are here,

495
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,147
we might at long last reclaim my fort.

496
00:33:56,489 --> 00:33:59,156
Farad, take this to Hassan.

497
00:34:34,243 --> 00:34:36,159
I should go get the doorman.

498
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:39,279
No. Stay there until I come out.

499
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:41,949
You can't be in there alone.

500
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:11,778
I think you know who that is.

501
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:18,285
And who his friends are,
who his captain is.

502
00:35:21,123 --> 00:35:24,041
I think you know what this will provoke.

503
00:35:24,076 --> 00:35:25,742
I think you know how dangerous

504
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:27,794
the consequences promise to be,

505
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,582
and I think you knew that
before you took up the knife.

506
00:35:31,634 --> 00:35:33,800
I think I know why you did it,

507
00:35:33,836 --> 00:35:35,419
and I don't think it had anything to do

508
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:40,057
with him or with her or with gold.

509
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:43,427
I think it had to do with
something entirely different...

510
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:47,764
and I understand.

511
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:51,602
So I will not let those
consequences touch you.

512
00:35:55,774 --> 00:35:59,826
I will stand in between you and them,

513
00:35:59,862 --> 00:36:01,828
and I will protect you.

514
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:08,869
So Vane stays in the fort.

515
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:10,454
A fort with no ability

516
00:36:10,456 --> 00:36:13,290
to threaten the bay for weeks,
if not months.

517
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:14,791
And therefore no ability

518
00:36:14,843 --> 00:36:17,628
to stop us bringing back
the Urca gold safely.

519
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,632
As for Vane, I don't like leaving
him up there any more than you do.

520
00:36:21,684 --> 00:36:23,767
It's an awful compromise to be sure,

521
00:36:23,802 --> 00:36:27,638
but one well worth making given
what is being offered in return

522
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,806
and what it promises for
the future of this place.

523
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:33,110
How unsurprising that you
cast aside our arrangement

524
00:36:33,145 --> 00:36:34,778
the first moment it suited your whim.

525
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:38,281
My priority has always
been and will always be

526
00:36:38,317 --> 00:36:41,068
the welfare of my men.

527
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,154
And your good word being no
priority at all it would seem.

528
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:45,822
A hard choice, sir,

529
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:48,158
but one that any responsible
captain must make

530
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,494
given the changing circumstances.

531
00:36:50,496 --> 00:36:53,664
I'm only sorry that you cannot see
past your own pride to join me.

532
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:54,998
My pride?

533
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,335
I've been a captain of men at sea
going on three decades,

534
00:36:58,337 --> 00:36:59,836
survived a war with Spain,

535
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:02,389
an insurrection against a queen,

536
00:37:02,424 --> 00:37:04,057
a decade as an outlaw in a place

537
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:06,259
where the weak and the
dead are one and the same.

538
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:09,012
So the idea that you could choose
to discard our arrangement,

539
00:37:09,014 --> 00:37:10,814
that I would demur in the face

540
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:13,350
of your unassailable rhetoric,

541
00:37:13,352 --> 00:37:15,736
either you've overestimated
yourself, sir,

542
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:17,354
or you've underestimated me.

543
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:18,989
Mr. Dufresne,

544
00:37:19,024 --> 00:37:21,491
as quartermaster of the
surviving Walrus crew,

545
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:24,361
consider this notice and
relay to whom you must.

546
00:37:24,413 --> 00:37:26,329
Tonight I will call counsel

547
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:29,166
and submit myself as captain
of this combined crew.

548
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:30,917
My argument will be plain.

549
00:37:30,953 --> 00:37:34,671
I intend to lead the men in
retaking the fort as promised.

550
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:37,340
I intend to hold Charles Vane
to account as promised.

551
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:41,011
And then I intend
to sail for the Urca gold

552
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:44,214
having ended your tyranny
over this place for good.

553
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,534
Don't say a fucking word.
Just sit there and listen.

554
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:10,657
You're right about me,

555
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,993
about what I am.

556
00:38:13,045 --> 00:38:15,495
I am like you,

557
00:38:15,547 --> 00:38:20,000
so I know what you're feeling right now,

558
00:38:20,052 --> 00:38:23,386
that I'm asking you to weaken
yourself for someone else,

559
00:38:23,422 --> 00:38:27,224
for the island's sake, for my sake.

560
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:28,809
But you're wrong.

561
00:38:28,844 --> 00:38:32,979
We control something so valuable,

562
00:38:33,015 --> 00:38:34,981
the whole of England wants it.

563
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:39,019
We control Nassau,

564
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:41,154
and the ransom we are
going to demand for her

565
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,825
is going to be fucking enormous.

566
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,612
More than money. More than land.

567
00:38:53,202 --> 00:38:55,118
Legitimacy.

568
00:38:58,173 --> 00:38:59,623
Legitimacy?

569
00:39:02,795 --> 00:39:06,046
England is going to give that to you?

570
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:09,299
When they realize it is the only
outcome that makes any sense,

571
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:11,468
they'll have to.

572
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,971
And the moment they ratify
our control over this place,

573
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:17,808
no more fighting, no more leads,

574
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,976
no more chasing our fucking meals.

575
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:23,814
I'm talking about making money
the way London makes money...

576
00:39:23,816 --> 00:39:27,117
collecting it, not hunting it,

577
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:29,619
and in amounts that mean something.

578
00:39:35,828 --> 00:39:38,495
Give up the girl.

579
00:39:38,497 --> 00:39:41,665
Make this deal.

580
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:44,167
Do this with me and we can
have a future here together.

581
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:48,171
Eleanor, when I take
something from a man,

582
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:52,175
his ship, his money, his life,

583
00:39:52,177 --> 00:39:54,344
I don't hide behind a clerk.

584
00:39:54,346 --> 00:39:56,513
I don't hide behind the law.

585
00:39:56,515 --> 00:39:59,516
I don't hide behind anything.

586
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:02,152
I look him in his eye

587
00:40:02,187 --> 00:40:04,654
and I give him every chance to deny me.

588
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,741
That is legitimate.

589
00:40:07,776 --> 00:40:09,860
I know what he wants you to believe,
but he's wrong.

590
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:12,112
England's return isn't inevitable.

591
00:40:12,164 --> 00:40:13,613
England has no more appetite

592
00:40:13,665 --> 00:40:15,916
for taking this place back
today than it did yesterday,

593
00:40:15,951 --> 00:40:18,251
or last month, or last year,

594
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:22,455
because they know it is inhabited
by too many men like me,

595
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:26,960
men who would die before being
another man's slave again.

596
00:40:28,964 --> 00:40:30,931
Side with Flint,

597
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:33,550
beg them to let you keep
what is already yours,

598
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:35,719
show them that weakness,

599
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:38,855
and you'll invite the very
outcome you wish to avoid.

600
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:41,224
Side with me and we will show England

601
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:43,526
that this place has never been stronger,

602
00:40:43,562 --> 00:40:46,062
and we'll keep our
freedom for another day,

603
00:40:46,114 --> 00:40:49,866
another month, another year, a lifetime.

604
00:40:49,902 --> 00:40:51,818
Hey.

605
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,457
Do you believe me?

606
00:41:22,768 --> 00:41:24,768
You're right.

607
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,403
It's nowhere near an even split.

608
00:41:28,273 --> 00:41:31,608
My God, this is...

609
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,361
really quite disappointing.

610
00:41:37,616 --> 00:41:40,000
I say we take it.

611
00:41:40,035 --> 00:41:41,252
What?

612
00:41:41,954 --> 00:41:43,486
What?

613
00:41:43,622 --> 00:41:46,172
You're not concerned how
the men will receive this?

614
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:49,292
What other choice do we have?

615
00:41:49,294 --> 00:41:53,847
Start a fight that gets
our whole crew slaughtered?

616
00:41:53,882 --> 00:41:56,433
I suppose you could challenge
him to fight you man to man,

617
00:41:56,468 --> 00:41:58,601
but I think we can both agree

618
00:41:58,637 --> 00:42:00,437
that's not going to end well for anyone.

619
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:06,142
At the end of the day,
our men can count.

620
00:42:06,194 --> 00:42:08,278
Most of them can count.

621
00:42:08,313 --> 00:42:10,480
They can all see that we're
simply outmatched here.

622
00:42:10,532 --> 00:42:15,201
And they know that... well, you know...

623
00:42:16,538 --> 00:42:18,738
They know what?

624
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:22,075
That they chose you as a captain
to get access to the whore's leads.

625
00:42:22,127 --> 00:42:23,827
If they're honest with themselves,

626
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:27,047
they can't really expect you to
be able to do anything about this.

627
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:29,416
Leads or no, if I accept these terms,

628
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:32,886
they'll vote me off before
we return to Nassau.

629
00:42:32,921 --> 00:42:33,921
Hmm?

630
00:42:39,978 --> 00:42:42,679
You cannot imagine what I've
sacrificed to gain this captaincy.

631
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:44,180
I may have lost the only person

632
00:42:44,232 --> 00:42:48,985
in the world I cared for
to gain this captaincy.

633
00:42:49,021 --> 00:42:51,021
I cannot lose it.

634
00:42:53,775 --> 00:42:55,692
Not so soon. Not like this.

635
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:47,410
You're right.

636
00:43:47,462 --> 00:43:50,497
This is likely the most
reasonable distribution

637
00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:51,965
given our relative strengths.

638
00:43:53,552 --> 00:43:57,837
Then can we consider ourselves
in agreement about our terms?

639
00:43:57,889 --> 00:44:01,257
With one or two small adjustments,

640
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:02,809
if you wouldn't mind hearing me out.

641
00:44:02,844 --> 00:44:04,094
Of course.

642
00:44:04,146 --> 00:44:07,430
For what little comfort
it may provide right now,

643
00:44:07,432 --> 00:44:09,682
I believe you've made
the right decision.

644
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:12,185
Your men will see the wisdom...

645
00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:38,261
Thank you for offering us a way forward.

646
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,145
Wait!

647
00:45:29,181 --> 00:45:31,147
Wait, wait, wait.

648
00:45:31,183 --> 00:45:32,565
Wait!

649
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,519
Wait!

650
00:45:37,772 --> 00:45:40,573
I'm sorry, friends.

651
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:43,993
I had hoped to find an outcome
amenable to both crews.

652
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:50,033
But it seems that this man

653
00:45:50,085 --> 00:45:54,537
was unable to see any outcome

654
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:59,375
that saw a single member of
this prize crew to survive.

655
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:06,599
And that was an outcome that
I could simply not abide.

656
00:46:06,635 --> 00:46:10,553
I can only hope our new
brothers will join us

657
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:12,138
in the fight for their own survival.

658
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,390
Mr. Haines,
remove their restraints, please.

659
00:46:14,442 --> 00:46:17,193
Remove their restraints now!

660
00:46:17,229 --> 00:46:19,729
Every man from that prize crew.

661
00:46:24,236 --> 00:46:29,072
Unless there is a man amongst this crew

662
00:46:29,074 --> 00:46:32,625
who can sit down with me at
this table and speak reasonably,

663
00:46:32,661 --> 00:46:34,794
honorably,

664
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:37,497
to reach a resolution more favorable...

665
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:41,918
in light, of course, of the
overwhelming odds now in our favor...

666
00:46:49,177 --> 00:46:50,760
Anybody?

667
00:46:52,097 --> 00:46:53,563
Come on!

668
00:46:57,602 --> 00:46:59,402
Anyone?

669
00:47:34,472 --> 00:47:38,641
You have heard I'm
supporting Captain Flint

670
00:47:38,693 --> 00:47:41,611
against Captain Hornigold tonight, yeah?

671
00:47:41,646 --> 00:47:43,279
I've heard.

672
00:47:43,315 --> 00:47:46,149
I'm not sure I understand after
everything that's transpired,

673
00:47:46,201 --> 00:47:48,034
but I've heard.

674
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:54,991
Flint was right.

675
00:47:57,212 --> 00:47:59,912
England is coming.

676
00:47:59,964 --> 00:48:02,332
I've seen them.

677
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:04,000
I've seen how they see us.

678
00:48:04,052 --> 00:48:06,586
We aren't criminals to them.

679
00:48:06,638 --> 00:48:08,671
We aren't even men.

680
00:48:08,673 --> 00:48:10,840
We're animals.

681
00:48:10,842 --> 00:48:14,594
If Flint can do as he's promised,

682
00:48:14,646 --> 00:48:16,729
protect this place,

683
00:48:16,765 --> 00:48:20,183
protect us from ever
having to face that day,

684
00:48:20,185 --> 00:48:23,186
how can we do anything but support him?

685
00:48:23,238 --> 00:48:26,189
And if he cannot?

686
00:48:26,241 --> 00:48:29,192
Are you suggesting
there's an alternative?

687
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:43,256
I didn't escape.

688
00:48:46,044 --> 00:48:48,461
From the navy.

689
00:48:48,513 --> 00:48:50,680
I didn't escape.

690
00:48:54,853 --> 00:48:57,520
The captain of the Scarborough

691
00:48:57,555 --> 00:49:00,056
made me an offer.

692
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:03,226
He offered me and nine men

693
00:49:03,228 --> 00:49:05,561
of my choosing full pardons.

694
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:08,648
He placed them on the table
right in front of my eyes.

695
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,985
Said I could have them if, in exchange,

696
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:15,571
I would aid him

697
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:17,740
in the capture of a
fugitive from justice.

698
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:24,046
One particular fugitive.

699
00:49:28,837 --> 00:49:31,921
If we doubt

700
00:49:31,923 --> 00:49:34,640
Flint's ability to do as he's promised,

701
00:49:34,676 --> 00:49:38,478
if we doubt he's the man to save us,

702
00:49:38,513 --> 00:49:42,565
then you and I and eight other men

703
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,600
have another option.

704
00:49:44,602 --> 00:49:47,937
We subdue Flint

705
00:49:47,939 --> 00:49:49,856
and we deliver him to Harbour Island.

706
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:55,077
And then...

707
00:49:55,113 --> 00:49:58,915
we put this whole
fucking mess behind us.

708
00:50:13,965 --> 00:50:16,265
You seem unconcerned.

709
00:50:18,136 --> 00:50:19,602
If I understand correctly,

710
00:50:19,637 --> 00:50:22,472
the stakes of the upcoming
vote are significant.

711
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:23,773
What exactly are you doing?

712
00:50:23,808 --> 00:50:27,143
I'm seeming unconcerned.

713
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:30,446
I cannot think of a better way
to aid Captain Hornigold's cause

714
00:50:30,482 --> 00:50:32,482
than to appear panicked about it.

715
00:50:32,484 --> 00:50:36,235
No, that would be my job, I suppose.

716
00:50:38,656 --> 00:50:40,373
What were the numbers of the last count?

717
00:50:40,408 --> 00:50:42,825
I'd say you have at
least a half dozen votes

718
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:45,495
over Captain Hornigold at the moment.

719
00:50:45,497 --> 00:50:47,046
That isn't nearly enough.

720
00:50:47,081 --> 00:50:50,216
He's a desperate man.
Even with a minority faction,

721
00:50:50,251 --> 00:50:55,087
he might still move on Vane,
in which case the girl dies.

722
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:57,507
I need him to lose so convincingly

723
00:50:57,509 --> 00:51:00,343
that no sane man would follow
him two yards up that beach.

724
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:04,680
A margin of 20 would help matters.

725
00:51:06,017 --> 00:51:07,850
Don't stop moving until you have it.

726
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:19,078
There is one particular vote

727
00:51:19,113 --> 00:51:21,697
I'm having some trouble with.

728
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:23,833
Perhaps you could help me with it.

729
00:51:23,868 --> 00:51:26,369
Whose vote is that?

730
00:51:27,455 --> 00:51:29,238
Mine.

731
00:51:29,507 --> 00:51:31,624
When we returned here,
you said it would be a week,

732
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:34,176
maybe two,
before Spanish reinforcements arrived

733
00:51:34,212 --> 00:51:35,595
and that gold was as good as gone.

734
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,463
Yes.

735
00:51:37,515 --> 00:51:39,307
So what happens if we win the vote

736
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:41,803
and the gold isn't delivered
in a timely fashion?

737
00:51:41,804 --> 00:51:43,692
Vane reneges.

738
00:51:43,693 --> 00:51:46,042
Delays to achieve better terms.
Certainly these are plausible outcomes.

739
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:48,774
How long do we wait for the
situation to resolve itself?

740
00:51:48,826 --> 00:51:50,659
The gold is still a priority.

741
00:51:50,695 --> 00:51:52,862
There's been no change in that.

742
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:56,916
You have my word.

743
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:08,711
That's all I needed to hear.

744
00:52:10,382 --> 00:52:12,882
I should get to work.

745
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:14,550
I'll keep you apprised of the numbers.

746
00:52:14,602 --> 00:52:15,685
You do that.

747
00:52:26,865 --> 00:52:29,615
Mr. Silver, a moment.

748
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:31,067
How can I help?

749
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:33,486
You're doing a nose count
for the captain, yes?

750
00:52:33,538 --> 00:52:35,738
I am.

751
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:38,124
You're gonna find your
tally a man short.

752
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:40,460
Why?

753
00:52:40,495 --> 00:52:42,545
Who isn't here?

754
00:52:50,088 --> 00:52:51,838
Where's the madam?

755
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,759
Excuse me,
but I'm going to need your help.

756
00:52:56,761 --> 00:52:58,928
Hello.

757
00:53:00,348 --> 00:53:02,098
Sorry, I was looking for the madam.

758
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,683
You found her.

759
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,521
Somehow, I'm not surprised.

760
00:53:08,573 --> 00:53:11,858
Seems quite a bit has transpired since
last we were in business together.

761
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,493
And I would love to hear all about it,

762
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:15,411
but at the moment I'm
a bit pressed for time.

763
00:53:15,447 --> 00:53:17,413
So if you could do me a
favor and send Mr. Logan

764
00:53:17,449 --> 00:53:19,449
back to camp, that would be a huge help.

765
00:53:20,952 --> 00:53:24,287
Mr. Logan? I don't believe he's here.

766
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:26,706
Oh, he's here. And he's not in trouble.

767
00:53:26,758 --> 00:53:29,459
But that could change
quickly if certain people

768
00:53:29,461 --> 00:53:31,761
were to learn he's here.

769
00:53:31,796 --> 00:53:34,347
So please, send him down.

770
00:53:43,892 --> 00:53:46,476
What the fuck happened here?

771
00:53:46,478 --> 00:53:47,977
Does it matter?

772
00:53:47,979 --> 00:53:50,446
A man dies under this roof,
it is my responsibility

773
00:53:50,482 --> 00:53:52,281
whatever the circumstances.

774
00:53:52,317 --> 00:53:53,816
You've lost a valued crew member

775
00:53:53,868 --> 00:53:56,319
and restitution will be made.
I will see to it.

776
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:58,955
My crewmates were expressly
forbidden from entering this place.

777
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,490
I imagine you noticed.

778
00:54:00,542 --> 00:54:02,492
And I imagine you can guess

779
00:54:02,544 --> 00:54:04,744
it's because there's information
those men are privy to

780
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:06,996
that we'd just as soon not have
plied out of them by your girls.

781
00:54:06,998 --> 00:54:09,332
Now my armorer is dead on your floor

782
00:54:09,384 --> 00:54:12,335
and I'm forced to wonder if
those two things aren't related.

783
00:54:12,387 --> 00:54:14,420
How exactly did you plan
on covering this up?

784
00:54:14,472 --> 00:54:17,390
I told you, I have every intention
of seeing this made right.

785
00:54:17,425 --> 00:54:18,891
Time is not our friend here.

786
00:54:18,927 --> 00:54:20,843
Please, something resembling the truth.

787
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,230
I don't know.

788
00:54:24,265 --> 00:54:26,148
Something about them falling in love,

789
00:54:26,184 --> 00:54:27,817
running away together.

790
00:54:27,852 --> 00:54:29,819
That's as far as I had got.

791
00:54:33,074 --> 00:54:35,024
He went to Providence.

792
00:54:35,076 --> 00:54:36,526
I'm sorry?

793
00:54:38,196 --> 00:54:41,531
Logan was among a number of
men who deserted this morning.

794
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:44,534
Unwilling to risk dying in a
bloody fight to retake the fort,

795
00:54:44,536 --> 00:54:46,452
he and his love fled together.

796
00:54:46,504 --> 00:54:48,037
I heard he has a brother in Providence.

797
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:49,455
Not surprised that's where he went.
Are you following?

798
00:54:49,507 --> 00:54:51,040
- Yes.
- Good.

799
00:54:54,712 --> 00:54:56,596
Clean this up.

800
00:54:56,631 --> 00:54:59,382
If anyone asks if I saw this up here,
I don't intend to lie.

801
00:55:00,602 --> 00:55:03,686
Why would you do that? Help me?

802
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:08,224
The last thing I need right now
is Flint in the middle of this.

803
00:55:08,276 --> 00:55:11,360
If he or any of the men in his
crew were to learn about it,

804
00:55:11,396 --> 00:55:14,030
my life would get
significantly more complicated.

805
00:55:14,065 --> 00:55:16,566
Any of the men?

806
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,067
Aren't you one of the men on his crew?

807
00:55:21,271 --> 00:55:23,938
Clean this up, please.

808
00:56:25,669 --> 00:56:27,885
Abigail.

809
00:56:27,921 --> 00:56:30,054
My name is Eleanor.

810
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:32,674
You are no longer a hostage.

811
00:56:36,279 --> 00:56:38,412
I'm gonna get you out of here.
