1
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:14,667
There is no life here.
There is no joy here.

2
00:00:14,668 --> 00:00:17,119
- There is no love here.
- What are you talking about?!

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,038
What do you think
I'm out there fighting for

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,957
if not to make all
those things possible here?

5
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,343
The fort controls the bay,
I control the fort.

6
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:26,095
So I will be your partner.

7
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:30,683
I'm afraid I'm simply enjoying myself

8
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:33,102
way too much to consider
leaving this place.

9
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:35,688
I know his crew hold an asset
from their last prize

10
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:37,106
that they deem of great value.

11
00:00:37,107 --> 00:00:38,808
- What asset?
- I don't know.

12
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:40,693
We'll procure a ship,
we'll recruit men

13
00:00:40,694 --> 00:00:43,145
and we'll create
from nothing a new crew.

14
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:45,197
You asked for better captains,

15
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:47,233
I give you Captain Jack Rackham.

16
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:50,453
In less than two days, I
intend to be a captain again.

17
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:52,571
Fire!

18
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:56,625
You orchestrated it all.
The deaths, the destruction.

19
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:59,210
Is it possible a man
could do such a thing?

20
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,327
Herein lies the problem we face

21
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:40,863
if we are to secure Nassau's future.

22
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:45,635
It is a problem that has festered
for more than a generation.

23
00:02:45,636 --> 00:02:48,436
And it's a problem most insidious.

24
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,974
Illiteracy?

25
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:53,643
Her husband.

26
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:55,561
Governor Robert Thompson,

27
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:58,030
the one accepting bribes
from pirate captains

28
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:01,734
as fast as they can pay them in exchange
for catering to their every need.

29
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:05,454
Meanwhile, he's sending word back to
his pamphleteer friends in London

30
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:07,957
about the scourge
of the pirate menace,

31
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,493
which garners him
sympathy and support,

32
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:11,911
which solidifies his position,

33
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:13,796
and which only fuels
the underlying problem.

34
00:03:13,797 --> 00:03:16,382
That's true, but I don't see how
we can do anything about it.

35
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:19,468
We can't get an honest man
appointed governor in the Bahamas?

36
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,337
We can get him appointed.
The problem seems to be

37
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:22,722
keeping him honest thereafter.

38
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:24,423
Well, what stands in the way of it?

39
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:26,008
Well, the Atlantic Ocean.

40
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,977
Put a man on an island,

41
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:29,262
give him power over other men,

42
00:03:29,263 --> 00:03:30,846
and it won't be long before he realizes

43
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:32,848
that the limits of that power
are nowhere to be seen.

44
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:36,352
And no man given that kind of influence
will remain honest for very long.

45
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:38,270
Yes?

46
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:41,357
Came to make sure
you two were still alive.

47
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:43,993
No one's heard from you in hours.

48
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:46,579
The lieutenant was
just recounting to me

49
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,283
his belief that the only thing that
stands between us and a prosperous Nassau

50
00:03:50,284 --> 00:03:54,587
is an ocean, 100 years of
history, and human nature.

51
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:56,756
Has he been like this all day?

52
00:03:56,757 --> 00:03:58,257
More or less, ma'am, yes.

53
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:06,766
A gift. One of my favorites.

54
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:09,051
And you might find it helpful

55
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:11,687
in dealing with
my husband going forward.

56
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:13,139
Thank you, dear. Well played.

57
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,558
Although that edition is in Spanish.

58
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,226
I don't think
the lieutenant speaks it.

59
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:18,978
Perhaps he should learn.

60
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:22,897
In his profession, you never
know when it might be useful.

61
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:42,885
Stop jacking off on the figurehead.

62
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:44,753
Joji!

63
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:50,426
Last item.

64
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:53,396
The powers that be have chosen
a spot for our anchorage.

65
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:56,732
One mile north-northeast of
the western tip of the Hog

66
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,818
well beyond the view of Nassau town.

67
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:01,103
Watches will continue on schedule

68
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:03,272
while provisions
are secured via longboat.

69
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:05,073
Well, why ain't there been a vote?

70
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:07,610
I beg your pardon?

71
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:09,829
Well, I want to go home.
Back in the bay.

72
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,164
Ain't no one ask
what I think about it.

73
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:15,418
We vote that fuck of a captain
back into his station

74
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,119
and he's already skirting
the fucking rules.

75
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:22,624
We're sailing a Spanish warship.

76
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:28,129
Captain Hornigold's fort protects
the bay from Spanish warships.

77
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:33,436
I imagine the captain
and quartermaster

78
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:36,772
thought it self-evident that
someone must go ahead and explain

79
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:38,974
so as to avoid a reactionary
attack from the fort.

80
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:42,310
We're flying the black.
Doesn't it identify us?

81
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:47,650
You mean behind the giant
red crosses on the sails?

82
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,156
I want to vote.

83
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:58,660
Hey, don't worry. We'll sort it out.

84
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:01,747
Land ho!

85
00:06:57,687 --> 00:06:59,939
Almost took my fucking head off.

86
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:21,460
I've made camp at Port Royal,

87
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:23,579
Tortuga, Kingston.

88
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,748
No matter where I've been,
one thing is true.

89
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:30,085
There's always one.

90
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:31,971
The one you don't cross.

91
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:34,306
It would seem readily
apparent that in this place,

92
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:36,425
that would be you.

93
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:38,593
Thank you for noticing.

94
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:42,398
What the fuck are you doing here?

95
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,351
I think it's no secret
that since my arrival

96
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:47,853
I've been repeatedly provoked and
harassed by the Guthrie woman.

97
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:51,240
And, as her aggression
seems to be escalating,

98
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:53,576
I thought it wise to speak
of this in the open.

99
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:55,494
Her aggression towards you?

100
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:58,697
Conspiracy with my
quartermaster to depose me.

101
00:07:58,698 --> 00:08:01,417
And a provocation by her man-at-arms.

102
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:02,898
I think you and I
have both seen enough

103
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,620
of these things to know
they never end well.

104
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:06,005
What are you telling me for?

105
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:09,925
I saw you that day in the tavern.

106
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:13,929
I hear you and she have a connection.

107
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,216
And if things were to deteriorate
even further between us,

108
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:20,936
I'd just like to know whether
I'll have you to deal with, too.

109
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:24,273
I can't imagine what we'd have
to gain by taking an interest

110
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:27,142
in the affairs of the Guthrie woman.

111
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:29,143
Would you, Captain?

112
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:34,366
- Not that I can see.
- You certain?

113
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:37,152
I only ask again
in that I know myself,

114
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:39,989
and I know when confronting
threats like these,

115
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,790
I tend to be a bit
of a blunt instrument.

116
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,993
Try as I may to be rational,

117
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:45,661
there's an instinct
towards the extreme

118
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:47,496
that always gets the better of me.

119
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:49,582
So that we're clear,

120
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,968
no matter how bloody this
feud gets between she and I,

121
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:56,721
I can rest soundly knowing
you'll take no part in it?

122
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:00,758
None whatsoever.

123
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:04,513
However...

124
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:06,849
commerce here relies upon her.

125
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,151
Should you move against her,

126
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:12,488
you may find no shortage of
new enemies on the street.

127
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:14,405
Perhaps.

128
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:19,194
Although, from what I understand,

129
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:21,580
confidence in her new venture

130
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:24,667
is tepid at best.

131
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:27,919
Who knows how much she'll
be missed if at all?

132
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:37,429
What's that?

133
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,214
Tribute.

134
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:41,467
And the respect of my crew.

135
00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:44,302
10% of our most recent haul.

136
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,856
Would have been a little heavier,

137
00:09:47,857 --> 00:09:51,059
only she taxed us over the
state of the containers.

138
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:37,565
Are they still in there?

139
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:40,100
Far as I know. Door hasn't
opened all morning.

140
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,237
When she finally emerges,
tell her I've left.

141
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:45,333
I'll make contact
with Captain Hornigold,

142
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:48,336
inform him of our arrival, and
arrange safe passage into harbor.

143
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:50,838
I'll then attempt to persuade him

144
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:53,174
to assign the bulk
of his crew and his ship

145
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:54,725
to sail in consort with us.

146
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:58,980
With a little luck,
we'll be on our way back

147
00:11:58,981 --> 00:12:02,517
to the Urca wreck
within a matter of days.

148
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:05,353
And how do you plan
to answer the question?

149
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:06,988
What question is that?

150
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:11,075
Why is this request coming
from you, Captain Flint,

151
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:13,076
and not from Mr. Gates?

152
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:20,417
When in doubt, the truth
is a good place to start.

153
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:23,838
Oh, matter of ship business.

154
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,874
I've noticed the berths for the
vanguard are less than ideal.

155
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,509
I'd like to have them set in here.

156
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,094
Give the men a little
more space to breathe.

157
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:33,514
You want the vanguard to quarter
in the captain's cabin?

158
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:35,550
I'm not a tyrant, Mr. Dufresne.

159
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:37,468
The ship belongs to all of us.

160
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:40,021
This seems a way to ensure that
we all benefit from it equally.

161
00:12:40,022 --> 00:12:42,940
It also seems a way to
ensure that the next time

162
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:45,142
someone raises a pistol towards you,

163
00:12:45,143 --> 00:12:48,028
well, the vanguard
has a rooting interest.

164
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:51,532
After my departure,
please ensure that mine

165
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:54,118
is the only longboat that ferries
anyone to and from the island.

166
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,988
- The men will resist.
- Then you resist them right back.

167
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:59,540
They all know that we're headed
back for the Urca's gold.

168
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,875
They all know where it is.

169
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:03,661
They all know that its
defenses are weakened.

170
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:07,080
We simply cannot allow that information
leaking out onto the beach.

171
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:10,501
Or let them go if you like.

172
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:12,420
To whatever extent
you're comfortable competing

173
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:15,006
with a dozen other crews
to retrieve that gold.

174
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:19,093
Mr. Silver should be back aboard
with provisions within a few hours.

175
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:21,261
That ought to keep tempers in check.

176
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:30,021
Are these the ones?

177
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:31,771
Handpicked.

178
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:35,026
You understand what
I'm asking you to do?

179
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:36,277
Go back and watch the gold.

180
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:38,112
Keep watch on the Spanish soldiers

181
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:39,664
who are watching the gold.

182
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:42,917
You'll depart as soon as a
longboat can be made ready.

183
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:45,836
Return to Division Bay.
Approach from the south.

184
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:47,338
Stay inland and out of sight.

185
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,624
Keep constant watch on that
beach until we arrive.

186
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,376
I should be no more
than two days behind you.

187
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:53,961
At which point I'll need
to know everything

188
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:56,847
about their routines,
schedule, watch strength.

189
00:13:56,848 --> 00:14:00,217
Then we'll reconnoiter,
plan our final assault,

190
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:02,603
secure the gold. Is that clear?

191
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:04,304
Go.

192
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:08,609
You certain they're the men for this?

193
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,278
They're the only ones who didn't
ask for more than I offered.

194
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,780
So they had that in their favor.

195
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:14,649
Jesus.

196
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,402
I thought we needed to get back to
the ship as quickly as possible.

197
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:20,705
You're bringing something to read?

198
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:23,156
It isn't for me.

199
00:14:56,825 --> 00:14:58,576
Strange.

200
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:00,945
You and I have never shared
more than a few words,

201
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:04,165
and yet I feel like we're old friends.

202
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,700
Do you?

203
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:07,451
Of course.

204
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:09,869
James talks about you all the time.

205
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:14,624
Captain Flint.

206
00:15:16,261 --> 00:15:18,512
He's told me what you've
accomplished in this place.

207
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:21,381
With those men. In spite of them.

208
00:15:23,468 --> 00:15:26,137
It's no small feat.

209
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:27,888
And I admire it.

210
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:30,474
Do you know what
he told me about you?

211
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:31,725
What's that?

212
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:36,063
Nothing.

213
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:38,816
When I ask him, all I get
is a shrug or a laugh

214
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:42,570
or an innocent suggestion that
he has a longtime companion.

215
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,905
Her name is Barlow
and nothing more.

216
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:46,824
Is that possible?

217
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:48,793
Is it possible that
you're so unremarkable

218
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:50,910
as to resist any further
description than that?

219
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:54,381
Certainly possible.

220
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:57,334
You conspire with my father
to sabotage our plans.

221
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:59,170
You betray our trust.

222
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:01,555
You cause almost irreparable
damage as a result.

223
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:03,924
And when Flint, the most feared
captain in all creation,

224
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:06,010
comes to confront you about it,

225
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:07,927
you destroy him.

226
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:11,766
Now I hear in the wind
that in his absence

227
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:15,436
you've begun to forge new
alliances with his enemies.

228
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:17,488
With the farmers of the interior.

229
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:20,074
With Mr. Underhill,
the man sheltering

230
00:16:20,075 --> 00:16:21,775
my shit of a father as we speak.

231
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:27,114
It's true I've joined Pastor
Lambrick's congregation

232
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:29,450
and that Mr. Underhill is a member.

233
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:33,036
Yet here you sit, brewing tea
as if none of it ever happened.

234
00:16:34,422 --> 00:16:36,257
And I'm forced to wonder
exactly what it is

235
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:38,958
you hold over Flint that makes
everything I've seen possible.

236
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:42,429
You don't know what you've seen.

237
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,298
You didn't betray him?

238
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:46,767
I don't believe I did, no.

239
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:49,303
And if he's being honest,
neither does he.

240
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:51,472
I'm sorry.
I saw the look on his face

241
00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:53,593
the last night he left this
place and I beg to differ.

242
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:59,897
Every man has his torments.

243
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:02,316
Demons born of past wrongs

244
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:04,485
that hound and harass him.

245
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:07,822
You perceive the effects
of Captain Flint's demons.

246
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:10,157
Echoes of their voices.

247
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:12,493
But I know their names.

248
00:17:12,494 --> 00:17:15,162
I was there when they were born.

249
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:17,164
I know the things

250
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,500
they whisper to him at night.

251
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:22,303
So you can believe me when I tell you

252
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:25,972
that within his chorus of torments...

253
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:30,226
none of them look or sound like me.

254
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:35,099
I don't know what it is
that you owe Flint

255
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,101
or that he owes you.

256
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,686
But after the damage you've caused,

257
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:41,605
I know what you owe me and
I've come here to collect.

258
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,824
I need to speak with Underhill.

259
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:47,077
As a result of your actions, my
business interests are now vulnerable.

260
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:50,531
Acquiring the partnership of a
plantation the size of Mr. Underhill's

261
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:52,616
could help bolster commerce
on my side of the island.

262
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:55,753
My attempts to reach him by
letter have gone unanswered.

263
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:57,755
And considering your new friendship,

264
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:00,040
I would like for you
to help arrange a meeting.

265
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,376
I thought he was an enemy of yours.

266
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:05,462
Perhaps I'm willing to see
things in a different light.

267
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:07,630
Will you do it?

268
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,384
I'll try.

269
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:29,787
This isn't enough.

270
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:31,488
It's all there are funds for.

271
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:33,040
Then less flour and more rum.

272
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,909
Mr. Dufresne was right.

273
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,711
The men will expect some time
in town before we depart.

274
00:18:37,712 --> 00:18:41,332
I want them as contented as possible
when I inform them otherwise.

275
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,168
The Spanish soldiers
guarding the Hulk

276
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,254
are four days removed by
longboat from St. Augustine.

277
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:48,672
By my reckoning, we got a week,

278
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:51,508
two at the most, before
King Philip takes his gold back.

279
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,559
There's no time for delay.

280
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,982
Get those supplies as quickly as
you can and meet me back here.

281
00:18:57,983 --> 00:18:59,984
I'll engage Captain Hornigold

282
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,268
and make way for the ship
to enter the bay.

283
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:06,490
At least you won't have a
hard time finding him.

284
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:08,858
Isn't that Hornigold's flag?

285
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:16,916
Why isn't he in his fort?

286
00:19:26,094 --> 00:19:28,294
What the fuck happened here?

287
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:10,004
I hear this is once again a place

288
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,805
where men come with coins
in their pockets

289
00:20:11,806 --> 00:20:14,174
and secrets in their heads

290
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:16,176
and leave with less of both.

291
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:18,478
And I hear you're the one
doing the collecting.

292
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:22,850
You can relax.

293
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:24,685
I'm not here to stop it.

294
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:26,686
Your place, do as you like.

295
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,658
But there is a secret you
wish my help in obtaining?

296
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:33,777
New crew on the island,

297
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,662
captained by a man named Low.

298
00:20:35,663 --> 00:20:38,782
They're hiding something.
A piece from their last prize.

299
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,835
Something unique.
Something of great value.

300
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:45,289
Seeing as his crew makes
frequent use of your girls,

301
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,174
I'd like you to find out what it is.

302
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:55,132
The other day I had
a moment with Eleanor.

303
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:59,219
Told her all the things I wanted
to say to her for so long.

304
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,855
That I was unbroken by her.

305
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:04,892
And I saw that it shook her.

306
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:07,361
And I felt happy.

307
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:11,064
And the moment she turned to walk away
from me, do you know what I felt?

308
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:16,120
The urge to go after her
and hold her again.

309
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:19,540
It's amazing, isn't it,
the spell she casts on us.

310
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,241
What are you talking about?

311
00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:22,793
You're right.

312
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:25,746
Captain Low's men
are familiar faces here.

313
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:28,582
Just today I heard all the
captain was talking about

314
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,501
were the awful things he'd like
to visit upon Eleanor Guthrie.

315
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:35,089
Given the timing of your request,

316
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,590
I assume you've heard the same thing.

317
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:43,230
Jack and Anne have no idea what
they're up against with you, do they?

318
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:44,932
The only question that remains

319
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:49,186
is what difference does it
make what his cargo is worth?

320
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:52,106
Though I suppose if the
value is great enough,

321
00:21:52,107 --> 00:21:54,992
it would give you pretense to move
against him and call it business

322
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:57,743
instead of calling it
what it actually is.

323
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:03,249
I'm going to assume
we have an agreement.

324
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,791
It's not enough.

325
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:14,962
The money is generous,

326
00:22:14,963 --> 00:22:17,548
but I'd rather have
something else from you.

327
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,550
Such as?

328
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,969
Your former shipmates,

329
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,222
they wish to sail again
under their own banner.

330
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:28,475
But so long as they bear the
black mark you put upon them,

331
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:30,276
their prospects will remain dim.

332
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,813
I'd like you to remove it.

333
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:49,830
I found a way
to stop caring about her.

334
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:51,882
Would you like to know how?

335
00:22:51,883 --> 00:22:53,583
No.

336
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,128
You understand
the job I'm looking to fill?

337
00:22:57,129 --> 00:22:58,506
Yes, ma'am.

338
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:00,641
And you understand what happened
to the last man who held that job?

339
00:23:00,642 --> 00:23:03,177
- Yes, ma'am.
- What happened to him?

340
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:10,016
He said the captain
put a sword in his mouth.

341
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,487
You should know that captain
is still a threat to me.

342
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:15,822
You're not concerned about
stepping into the way of that?

343
00:23:15,823 --> 00:23:17,357
No, ma'am.

344
00:23:17,358 --> 00:23:18,942
I know him, ma'am.

345
00:23:18,943 --> 00:23:21,527
I knew his sister before
they put us on the ship.

346
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:26,416
You asked me to bring one
I would trust with my life.

347
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:28,334
This is him.

348
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:56,562
I didn't get it.

349
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:11,411
I led myself to believe that I
would either never see you again

350
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:14,248
or that all our problems
would be solved.

351
00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:17,416
I never made space in my mind
for something in between.

352
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,339
But I'm so very glad you're alive.

353
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,924
You were missed.

354
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:26,009
What do we do now?

355
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,761
Now?

356
00:24:27,762 --> 00:24:30,264
Bloody go back and retrieve the gold.

357
00:24:30,265 --> 00:24:32,766
Refit, hire a consort, finish the job.

358
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,401
Is that possible?

359
00:24:34,402 --> 00:24:36,903
Well, it might have been possible

360
00:24:36,904 --> 00:24:39,356
when I had someplace to
bring it all back home to.

361
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:42,025
Before the bay fell
into the hands of a madman.

362
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:43,994
Fucking Hornigold.

363
00:24:43,995 --> 00:24:46,413
He told me Vane killed 30 of his men.

364
00:24:46,414 --> 00:24:48,081
That he was prepared
to take back the fort,

365
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:50,033
but that you sabotaged his efforts.

366
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:51,535
I told him he must be mistaken.

367
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:53,920
Eleanor Guthrie would never
be so wantonly reckless

368
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:55,372
with the security of this place.

369
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:57,040
- I understand your concern, but...
- Do you?

370
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,010
Because what I find most
troubling about all of this

371
00:25:00,011 --> 00:25:02,763
is the sense that you don't share it.

372
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:04,881
He came through the interior.

373
00:25:04,882 --> 00:25:06,850
There was no warning.

374
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:09,936
Before I or Hornigold or
anyone knew what was going on,

375
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:12,272
he and his men were firmly
positioned up there

376
00:25:12,273 --> 00:25:13,724
and threatening to sink
every ship in the bay

377
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:15,225
the moment we made
any move against him.

378
00:25:15,226 --> 00:25:17,611
- So you did nothing?
- What would you have had me do?

379
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:19,646
Something! Anything!

380
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:22,282
Surprise him at night.
Use the tunnels.

381
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:23,617
He'd have sunk every ship in the bay.

382
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:24,985
He'd have sunk a few ships in the bay

383
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:26,737
and it would have been
a price worth paying.

384
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:30,707
You weren't here. And he isn't
the problem you think he is.

385
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:33,827
He has no interest in
disrupting the flow of trade.

386
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:36,830
You look me in the eye and
tell me that you're certain

387
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:39,049
that if I brought the Urca gold
back here past those guns,

388
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:43,085
he wouldn't use his position to
rob me of every last ounce of it.

389
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:48,809
I had to make a quick judgment.

390
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,478
And in the moment it was clear that
the sacrifice it would have taken

391
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:54,013
to get him out of that fort
was simply too great.

392
00:26:09,197 --> 00:26:12,499
A Spanish warship fell upon us

393
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,201
before we'd found our way to the Urca.

394
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:22,758
At that point, Mr. Gates'
faith in our mission...

395
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,764
his faith in me was lost.

396
00:26:30,218 --> 00:26:32,686
I had to use my judgment

397
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:35,997
whether to let him abort
our entire endeavor

398
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:39,025
and see my plans,
your plans, evaporate

399
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:42,645
or to stop him.

400
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:46,365
I stopped him.

401
00:26:48,403 --> 00:26:49,985
What did you do?

402
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:54,207
What was necessary.

403
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:58,044
Because I knew that the future
of this place is everything.

404
00:26:58,045 --> 00:27:00,747
And that there is no sacrifice

405
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:03,583
too great to secure that future.

406
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:06,969
I thought you and I were
in agreement about that.

407
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:16,430
I'm sorry you were put to that choice.

408
00:27:16,431 --> 00:27:19,349
I know what he meant to you.

409
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,819
So we are in agreement, then?

410
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,438
He must be removed from that fort.

411
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:31,862
You've been through hell.

412
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:35,365
There's nothing about any of this
that can't wait till tomorrow.

413
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:39,168
Get some rest and we can discuss
this further in the morning.

414
00:27:49,464 --> 00:27:50,796
I saw her today.

415
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,885
Mrs. Barlow.

416
00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:57,803
She seemed concerned for your welfare.

417
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,975
I know you and her

418
00:28:01,976 --> 00:28:03,860
didn't part on pleasant terms.

419
00:28:03,861 --> 00:28:06,221
And perhaps
if you went to see her today...

420
00:28:09,817 --> 00:28:11,201
Lady Hamilton.

421
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:14,036
I asked the carriage
driver for your address.

422
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:19,542
Lieutenant, it's rather cold out here.

423
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:23,245
I beg your pardon. Please, come in.

424
00:28:30,838 --> 00:28:33,889
It's... tidy.

425
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,098
Lady Hamilton, it's very generous
of you to come visit me,

426
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:44,851
but perhaps I could now escort
you back to your carriage.

427
00:28:44,852 --> 00:28:48,521
Are you familiar with Jonathan
and Margaret Grey, Lieutenant?

428
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,525
The Duke and Duchess of Surrey?

429
00:28:51,526 --> 00:28:53,994
As you may or may not be aware,

430
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:55,579
they hold one of
the largest collections

431
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,864
of Egyptian artifacts
in all of Europe.

432
00:28:57,865 --> 00:29:01,701
I thought perhaps today you'd join
me in viewing them as my guest.

433
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:04,621
You mean yours and your husband's?

434
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:06,373
Thomas is otherwise engaged.

435
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:08,874
It would just be you and I.

436
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:12,429
I don't think that's a very good idea.

437
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,981
Why wouldn't it be a good idea?
Would you not enjoy my company?

438
00:29:18,886 --> 00:29:21,688
That would seem
to be beside the point.

439
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,356
- The point is...
- How it would look.

440
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:25,392
Yes, ma'am. Exactly.

441
00:29:25,393 --> 00:29:28,311
Are you happy, Lieutenant?

442
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:31,398
Happy? In what regard?

443
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:34,651
In my experience, there is
an inverse relationship

444
00:29:34,652 --> 00:29:36,653
between the degree
of one's happiness

445
00:29:36,654 --> 00:29:39,155
and the concern one suffers
for what the neighbors think.

446
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:41,374
This isn't an abstraction, ma'am.

447
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:44,744
- Were your husband to hear...
- I love my husband.

448
00:29:44,745 --> 00:29:47,080
I know what's said
about me behind my back.

449
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:50,333
Whispers of infidelities.
My husband's heard them.

450
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:52,335
And I suspect, given
the look on your face,

451
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:54,921
you've heard them, too.

452
00:29:54,922 --> 00:29:58,090
Thomas and I are not
bothered by them.

453
00:30:00,261 --> 00:30:02,344
The only question that remains is...

454
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:06,482
are you?

455
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:16,610
It doesn't concern you?

456
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:17,777
Pardon?

457
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:20,447
When you set sail,
my friend had his ear

458
00:30:20,448 --> 00:30:22,949
and you were ballast.

459
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,119
Then he calls my friend a
mutineer and puts him in the sea.

460
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,672
Now he's giving you his ear.

461
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:32,509
How can you stand so close to him
knowing what he's capable of

462
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,260
and that sooner
or later you'll be next?

463
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,884
Five million pieces of eight.

464
00:30:40,885 --> 00:30:44,353
Why? How do you do it?

465
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:50,477
You were right.

466
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:52,529
I don't know where her loyalties lie.

467
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,481
Told you as much.

468
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:56,449
Either we act now to
remove him or no one will.

469
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,485
We don't have time for this.

470
00:30:58,486 --> 00:31:02,122
Every day wasted dealing with this
is a day closer to losing that gold.

471
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:04,206
Then I suggest we act quickly.

472
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,087
...and as many prizes
as I can capture.

473
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:19,973
And as for captain, well,
you're looking at him.

474
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:35,522
Who were they?

475
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:38,024
Men wise enough to know
that on this island

476
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:39,442
three things are known to be true.

477
00:31:39,443 --> 00:31:42,278
Number two is Jack Rackham
is a crew killer.

478
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,114
It'll turn.

479
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:46,116
I admire your optimism.

480
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:49,119
- Why didn't you wait for me?
- You were preoccupied.

481
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,871
If you're angry about the whore
and me, just fucking say so.

482
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:54,541
You have an itch that needs scratching.
Go with God.

483
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,376
My trouble isn't that she
knows how to play the thing

484
00:31:56,377 --> 00:31:59,379
between your legs better than I,
but the one between your ears.

485
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,431
Do you honestly not see it?

486
00:32:01,432 --> 00:32:04,017
That your judgment with
her is clouded at best.

487
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:05,719
That she knows it
and intends to use it

488
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,471
to drive a wedge between us, because
it is painfully obvious to me.

489
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:11,191
And there's nothing
I can do to counter it

490
00:32:11,192 --> 00:32:13,809
when I'm on the wrong
side of that door.

491
00:32:16,864 --> 00:32:18,732
Of course I can see it.

492
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:21,366
Then why don't you stop it?

493
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,956
I can't.

494
00:32:40,588 --> 00:32:42,254
Join me.

495
00:32:43,474 --> 00:32:45,224
Won't you?

496
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,490
Sit down.

497
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:08,081
What's happening exactly?

498
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:11,117
I'm repairing your reputations.

499
00:33:11,118 --> 00:33:13,703
Public display of reconciliation.

500
00:33:13,704 --> 00:33:16,039
So just sit there,

501
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,625
smile,

502
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:19,925
and let it happen.

503
00:33:24,181 --> 00:33:25,597
To Mr. Hamund.

504
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:29,351
We hardly knew ye.

505
00:33:36,811 --> 00:33:38,444
Look at the two of you.

506
00:33:38,445 --> 00:33:41,481
Every reason to run
screaming from each other.

507
00:33:41,482 --> 00:33:43,983
And yet you're still as thick
as the moment I first found you

508
00:33:43,984 --> 00:33:46,035
fucking behind the galley.

509
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:47,987
You'll either be
the death of each other

510
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:50,323
or we'll all end up
working for you someday.

511
00:33:50,324 --> 00:33:52,991
Doubt there's any third outcome.

512
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,498
Why? Why now?

513
00:34:09,643 --> 00:34:12,094
I know what Low's cargo is.

514
00:34:19,353 --> 00:34:21,436
No shit?

515
00:34:28,245 --> 00:34:29,695
Stand up.

516
00:35:04,448 --> 00:35:06,482
Will that do?

517
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:07,866
I believe so.

518
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,371
Congratulations, Jack.

519
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:14,039
Now you know what it's like
to rise from the grave.

520
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,053
Well, it's not exactly a feast,

521
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:29,222
but the food I've procured
should be waiting by the jetty.

522
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:31,841
Get rid of it. Dump it. Sell it.
I don't care.

523
00:35:31,842 --> 00:35:34,260
- What about the crew?
- Tell them the truth.

524
00:35:34,261 --> 00:35:36,179
It was stolen from them
by Charles Vane

525
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,314
and the horde of barbarians
he now commands.

526
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:40,733
They've run amok on the island
and no one's been spared.

527
00:35:40,734 --> 00:35:42,151
Didn't you notice?

528
00:35:42,152 --> 00:35:44,654
I want them boiling over
by the time I return.

529
00:35:44,655 --> 00:35:46,939
Where are you going?

530
00:35:48,108 --> 00:35:49,908
I see.

531
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:58,034
Where are we going?

532
00:35:58,035 --> 00:36:00,753
I'm quite certain this isn't the
way to the Greys' residence.

533
00:36:00,754 --> 00:36:03,872
I quietly instructed the
driver to take you home.

534
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:08,294
Propriety.

535
00:36:08,295 --> 00:36:10,346
Lady Hamilton, do you know
what would happen in my world

536
00:36:10,347 --> 00:36:13,599
if people just did as they please
with no regard for convention?

537
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,686
Columbus would still be sailing in
circles off the coast of Spain.

538
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:24,944
I imagine there are two kinds of
men who make their life at sea.

539
00:36:24,945 --> 00:36:28,114
Those whose sense of duty forces them

540
00:36:28,115 --> 00:36:32,035
to leave any sense of permanence
or identity behind them

541
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:34,653
and those for whom
that is the attraction.

542
00:36:35,873 --> 00:36:37,407
Which do you think I am?

543
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:40,543
I think you're someone
who's very good

544
00:36:40,544 --> 00:36:42,412
at managing how you're perceived.

545
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:44,964
And perhaps getting
what you want

546
00:36:44,965 --> 00:36:47,500
without anyone ever
knowing how you did it

547
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,635
or perhaps if it ever happened at all.

548
00:36:49,636 --> 00:36:51,803
Perhaps...

549
00:36:57,678 --> 00:37:01,513
Don't tell me propriety has worked
its evils on you, too, now.

550
00:37:03,517 --> 00:37:05,684
I was going to say...

551
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:09,772
that perhaps you're more
concerned with whether or not

552
00:37:09,773 --> 00:37:13,692
people talk about what you and I do
may be doing behind closed doors...

553
00:37:15,112 --> 00:37:17,329
than with what we actually are doing.

554
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:16,255
All right, start again

555
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:17,756
at the beginning of the measure.

556
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:58,047
State your name!

557
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,798
What's going on?

558
00:39:28,328 --> 00:39:29,794
May I?

559
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:45,928
I admire you for coming
to see me earlier.

560
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:48,514
Showed you were a man
who knows his place.

561
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:51,234
That quality alone puts you ahead

562
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:53,401
of practically every other
captain on this island.

563
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,522
So I'd like to make you an offer.

564
00:39:56,523 --> 00:39:58,357
An offer?

565
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:01,993
Partnership between
your crew and mine.

566
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:07,083
I'm not interested.

567
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:08,867
But you haven't heard the deal yet.

568
00:40:12,122 --> 00:40:14,457
I took the fort to control the bay,

569
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:17,677
but I have no desire
to waste away in it.

570
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:19,545
My place is at sea.

571
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:21,430
But as I'm certain you've heard,

572
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:23,382
I was recently deprived of my ship.

573
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:25,801
Which means I need a new one.

574
00:40:25,802 --> 00:40:28,437
Were she to come with a
strong crew, all the better.

575
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:30,690
Let me stop you there.

576
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:34,810
Before I came to see you this morning,
I will admit I was concerned.

577
00:40:34,811 --> 00:40:38,397
It's painfully clear you've got
feelings for the Guthrie woman.

578
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:41,200
If you could bring all your
men to bear to protect her,

579
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:43,236
to retaliate against anyone
who would move against her,

580
00:40:43,237 --> 00:40:46,454
that might be reason enough
to let this whole matter go.

581
00:40:47,624 --> 00:40:49,325
But do you know what I think now?

582
00:40:49,326 --> 00:40:52,245
I think your men couldn't care
less about Eleanor Guthrie.

583
00:40:52,246 --> 00:40:55,748
I think they find your feelings
for her to be pathetic.

584
00:40:55,749 --> 00:40:58,417
I think you're powerless
to do anything about this.

585
00:40:58,418 --> 00:41:00,586
And for all these reasons,
I think my feelings

586
00:41:00,587 --> 00:41:02,922
about Eleanor scare you to death.

587
00:41:02,923 --> 00:41:07,560
And I must say, coming out
here alone like this,

588
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:10,679
it only serves to confirm my suspicions.

589
00:41:12,816 --> 00:41:15,100
Do your men even know you're here?

590
00:41:43,597 --> 00:41:47,350
I recommend you get up
and get off my ship.

591
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:50,303
Don't you want to hear
the rest of my terms first?

592
00:41:50,304 --> 00:41:52,888
By all means.

593
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:55,474
I get your ship.

594
00:41:55,475 --> 00:41:57,225
I get your cargo.

595
00:41:58,945 --> 00:42:00,563
I get your weapons.

596
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:05,650
I get it all.

597
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:08,904
And what exactly

598
00:42:08,905 --> 00:42:11,623
would I get in exchange for all that?

599
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,377
A head start.

600
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:19,714
Mr. Holmes.

601
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,673
Mr. Holmes doesn't work here anymore.

602
00:43:57,481 --> 00:43:59,815
Found the prize they was hiding.

603
00:43:59,816 --> 00:44:02,233
Just where the whore said she'd be.

604
00:44:10,444 --> 00:44:12,445
Tobacco?

605
00:44:12,446 --> 00:44:14,612
Tobacco, sir?

606
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:18,617
Tobacco?

607
00:44:18,618 --> 00:44:20,618
Sir?

608
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,540
No, thank you.

609
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:30,462
Mr. Scott.

610
00:44:55,322 --> 00:44:57,122
I apologize.

611
00:44:57,123 --> 00:44:58,624
Didn't imagine your new crewmates

612
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,209
would appreciate you
and I speaking directly.

613
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,162
No, I don't imagine they would.

614
00:45:03,163 --> 00:45:05,714
How have they taken to you?
Any better?

615
00:45:05,715 --> 00:45:08,666
Hmm, small moves.

616
00:45:11,171 --> 00:45:12,638
Flint came to see me today.

617
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:15,558
- I know he and Hornigold spoke.
- Eleanor.

618
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:18,844
And I have to believe that he went
to see him after he left my office.

619
00:45:18,845 --> 00:45:20,479
- Were you there when...
- Eleanor.

620
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,399
I would ask you not to
put me in this position.

621
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,652
I swore an oath. I have an obligation
to Captain Hornigold's crew.

622
00:45:26,653 --> 00:45:30,021
You don't have to respond.
Just listen.

623
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:34,326
I know Flint wants
Vane out of the fort.

624
00:45:34,327 --> 00:45:35,995
I know Hornigold wants it, too.

625
00:45:35,996 --> 00:45:37,663
Ordinarily, it would be bad enough

626
00:45:37,664 --> 00:45:39,748
having them spinning
each other up about it.

627
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:42,700
But something was different today.

628
00:45:44,204 --> 00:45:46,371
When I saw Flint, something
was different about him.

629
00:45:48,124 --> 00:45:50,425
You know what happened
out there, don't you?

630
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:55,047
What happened to Mr. Gates.

631
00:45:55,048 --> 00:45:57,883
I've never been under any illusions
of what he's capable of,

632
00:45:57,884 --> 00:45:59,802
- but this is just too...
- Eleanor.

633
00:45:59,803 --> 00:46:01,769
Where are you?

634
00:46:02,973 --> 00:46:04,640
What?

635
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:05,891
For as long as I can remember,

636
00:46:05,892 --> 00:46:07,860
you have told me how
important Captain Flint is

637
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:10,896
to the future of this
place, to your future.

638
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:12,281
You have put money behind him.

639
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:14,567
You have put your
credibility behind him.

640
00:46:14,568 --> 00:46:16,569
And now you would resist him?

641
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,904
Join with Captain Vane against him?

642
00:46:18,905 --> 00:46:20,623
This isn't about taking sides.

643
00:46:20,624 --> 00:46:22,074
It's about protecting
the fort, protecting Nassau.

644
00:46:22,075 --> 00:46:25,294
Eleanor, you need to ask yourself

645
00:46:25,295 --> 00:46:28,130
what you want,

646
00:46:28,131 --> 00:46:30,164
where your loyalties are...

647
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:33,251
and whom do you trust?

648
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:01,095
__

649
00:47:31,311 --> 00:47:32,810
I didn't do it for you.

650
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,425
Six men. Maybe seven.

651
00:48:36,426 --> 00:48:39,178
That should be achievable now.

652
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:41,547
And with just this week's till,

653
00:48:41,548 --> 00:48:43,766
we can most likely acquire a piragua.

654
00:48:45,552 --> 00:48:47,635
It'll be a small start.

655
00:48:50,023 --> 00:48:51,773
We're gonna sail again.

656
00:49:03,286 --> 00:49:04,902
What the fuck are you waiting for?

657
00:49:35,985 --> 00:49:38,019
Did he see you come up?

658
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,583
What is it?

659
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,837
There's something I need to show you.

660
00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:13,832
That is the crown jewel

661
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,918
taken from the Good Fortune prize.

662
00:51:15,919 --> 00:51:18,704
Her father is Lord Peter Ashe,

663
00:51:18,705 --> 00:51:21,540
governor of the Carolina colony.

664
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:24,927
Low recorded in his log the ransom
amount he intended to demand.

665
00:51:24,928 --> 00:51:27,712
£250,000.

666
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:30,515
They sedated her.

667
00:51:30,516 --> 00:51:32,718
Soon as she wakes,
I'll get her particulars

668
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:34,186
and go ransom her myself.

669
00:51:34,187 --> 00:51:36,388
Lord Ashe won't be trifled with.

670
00:51:36,389 --> 00:51:38,640
I have no intentions
of trifling with him.

671
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:42,194
He's hanged men for merely
suspecting them of piracy.

672
00:51:42,195 --> 00:51:45,397
He's fanatical about
exterminating men like you.

673
00:51:45,398 --> 00:51:48,317
Eleanor, I wasn't asking permission.

674
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:50,902
I know what I'm doing.

675
00:52:03,082 --> 00:52:05,250
I told the men what you asked.

676
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:07,301
They're not pleased.

677
00:52:13,593 --> 00:52:15,310
Good.

678
00:52:15,311 --> 00:52:17,095
Is it?

679
00:52:17,096 --> 00:52:19,014
Once you go down this road,

680
00:52:19,015 --> 00:52:21,482
what if there's no turning back?

681
00:52:40,286 --> 00:52:42,586
I know how you all must feel.

682
00:52:44,457 --> 00:52:46,875
How desperate you must be to go home

683
00:52:46,876 --> 00:52:51,380
and be embraced by Nassau again.

684
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:54,549
But I'm here to tell you,

685
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:57,719
that place no longer exists.

686
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,807
It has been taken from us by a madman.

687
00:53:01,808 --> 00:53:04,977
Held hostage by threat of force

688
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:07,695
that no one on the island
seems able to resist.

689
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:11,984
Now I would like to say

690
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:14,403
that the Urca beckons us.

691
00:53:14,404 --> 00:53:16,955
That we should look the other way.

692
00:53:16,956 --> 00:53:20,659
That the affairs of the beach
should never take precedence

693
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,744
over those of the purse.

694
00:53:22,745 --> 00:53:27,498
But in this case, these issues
would seem to be one and the same.

695
00:53:29,135 --> 00:53:32,004
Even if we could
make it ashore safely,

696
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:35,924
even if we could refit amidst
the chaos that has been sown,

697
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:38,010
even if we could ignore all of this

698
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:40,761
and go on to win the Urca's
gold, what then?

699
00:53:42,348 --> 00:53:46,351
We return home only to have
Vane extort from us

700
00:53:46,352 --> 00:53:50,104
the very prize that we have
sacrificed so much to win?

701
00:53:51,824 --> 00:53:56,111
Nassau was unable to resist him.

702
00:53:56,112 --> 00:53:58,246
But we have yet to have our say.

703
00:53:58,247 --> 00:54:02,200
So at sunrise tomorrow,

704
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:05,454
we make our terms clear with no room

705
00:54:05,455 --> 00:54:07,205
for bargain or compromise.

706
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:10,592
Charles Vane
and the animals he commands

707
00:54:10,593 --> 00:54:14,963
have until sunrise tomorrow
to vacate that fort

708
00:54:14,964 --> 00:54:17,348
or so help me God...

709
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:22,137
I will rain holy hell down upon him.
