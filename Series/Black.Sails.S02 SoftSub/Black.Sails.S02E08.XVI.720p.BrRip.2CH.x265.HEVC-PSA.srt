1
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:13,988
<i>When you return, are
you going to explain to Peter</i>

2
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:15,706
what it is you're trying
to accomplish here?

3
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:17,792
A Nassau
that can self-govern.

4
00:00:17,827 --> 00:00:19,587
This is not a man
that we can negotiate with,

5
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:21,245
- that I can negotiate with.
- Of course you can.

6
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:24,382
Because you will have just presented
him with his only daughter.

7
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:26,667
I can only scavenge
leads for so long.

8
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,170
I have an appetite for
something larger than that.

9
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:31,422
<i>For this, I need
a partner I can trust.</i>

10
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:33,758
<i>A launch landed on
the beach a short while ago.</i>

11
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:36,227
They told Flint the gold was gone.
What did they tell you?

12
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:38,396
The Urca gold
is on that beach.

13
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:41,015
<i>It is almost
entirely undefended.</i>

14
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:44,318
Do you know of a crew who might be
willing to aid in this endeavor?

15
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:46,154
<i>Abigail, you are
no longer a hostage.</i>

16
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:47,469
<i>I'm going to
get you out of here.</i>

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,689
<i>So, what's the plan?</i>

18
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:50,108
Leave me to answer
for this among the men?

19
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:54,745
My death sentence.
You will hear from me again.

20
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:57,582
<i>- You're Captain Flint?
-  My name is James.</i>

21
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,083
James McGraw.

22
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,151
<i>It's all right.
You're all right.</i>

23
00:02:57,237 --> 00:02:59,453
<i>I'm here.</i>

24
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:07,128
Shh, shh.

25
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:14,669
Shh.

26
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:41,662
No! No!

27
00:03:41,698 --> 00:03:44,081
No! No!

28
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:49,203
Shh, it's all right.
I'm here.

29
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:51,956
Shh, you're all right.

30
00:03:57,513 --> 00:04:02,216
<i>Last night was
the first of my journey home.</i>

31
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:06,220
<i>Still, my dreams are haunted
by the faces of those pirates</i>

32
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,888
<i>that first captured me.</i>

33
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:16,981
<i>Now I
find myself in the custody</i>

34
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:19,650
<i>of another band
of pirates.</i>

35
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:21,869
<i>I'm told
they're different,</i>

36
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:24,739
<i>and I will say
that so far these men</i>

37
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,576
<i>have treated me civilly,
even courteously.</i>

38
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:33,080
<i>They've even afforded me the
tools to keep this journal.</i>

39
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,999
<i>And though they will
almost certainly</i>

40
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:37,918
<i>destroy these pages
before we disembark,</i>

41
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:39,887
<i>eliminating any record</i>

42
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:43,090
<i>of their activities
or their identities...</i>

43
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:47,561
<i>just the act of putting
my thoughts to paper</i>

44
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:50,731
<i>has helped me
feel myself again.</i>

45
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,684
<i>To construct for myself
an illusion</i>

46
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,270
<i>that I'm still
on the Good Fortune</i>

47
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:59,490
<i>nearing the end
of a long voyage,</i>

48
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:03,444
<i>recent events were themselves
the nightmare,</i>

49
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:06,113
<i>and that these men
are simply sailors</i>

50
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,416
<i>tasked with
delivering me home.</i>

51
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,203
Get off me, I tell you!
I'll kill you!

52
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:14,422
Hey, hey, come on!
Stop, you!

53
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:16,207
<i>I said cut it out.</i>

54
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:18,376
<i>I don't know who started it,
but it stops right now.</i>

55
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:20,594
<i>Take him away!
Get back to work!</i>

56
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,630
<i>But it is only an illusion.</i>

57
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:28,519
<i>And a fragile one at that.</i>

58
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:36,143
<i>My father
told me about these men,</i>

59
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:39,280
<i>about their natures,</i>

60
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:42,817
<i>so I know that any appearance
of civility from them</i>

61
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:45,786
<i>is but a glimpse
of the men they once were.</i>

62
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:49,957
<i>A ghost that shows itself
only while the darker things</i>

63
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:54,078
<i>that now govern
their souls lay dormant.</i>

64
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:56,046
<i>Though I'm forced to wonder</i>

65
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:59,166
<i>if this illusion
is no accident at all,</i>

66
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:01,419
<i>but theater
for my benefit,</i>

67
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:04,422
<i>orchestrated
by someone so awful,</i>

68
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:07,341
<i>even monsters such as these
have no choice</i>

69
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:10,644
<i>but to dance to the tune
he plays for them.</i>

70
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:14,899
<i>Which leads me
to the one thought</i>

71
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:16,984
<i>I find most frightening</i>

72
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:19,570
<i>and most difficult
to dismiss.</i>

73
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:23,240
<i>What happens if that man
decides the theater</i>

74
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:26,360
<i>no longer
serves his purposes</i>

75
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:28,579
<i>and he lets
the monsters loose?</i>

76
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:39,757
Everything all right?

77
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:44,128
Yes.

78
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:45,846
I'm all right.

79
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:58,476
She was
writing about me.

80
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,561
Do you think?

81
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:03,230
I suppose
I can't blame her.

82
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:05,866
A girl her age with what
she's been through.

83
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:08,536
It's a credit to her that
she can function at all.

84
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:12,740
Look at her.

85
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:14,792
<i>When I first learned
she was on the island,</i>

86
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:18,212
<i>I saw in my mind
a five-year-old child</i>

87
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,381
<i>hiding behind
her mother's dress.</i>

88
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,383
Then I saw her.

89
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,388
I realized
she's a woman.

90
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:29,757
<i>It's like she's
some sort of clock</i>

91
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:31,759
<i>that's finally
struck its chime</i>

92
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:35,596
<i>and woken me from this
dream we've been living,</i>

93
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:39,934
<i>reminded me how many
years separate me</i>

94
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:42,152
from a world
I still think of as home.

95
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:47,658
How unrecognizable
the woman I am now

96
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:50,945
would be to the woman
I was then.

97
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:03,007
I recognize you.

98
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:05,426
You recognize me?

99
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:07,795
Yes.

100
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:10,180
So that's in our favor.

101
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:18,772
The question is...

102
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:21,642
will Peter recognize
either one of us?

103
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,650
Five million pieces.

104
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:33,120
Five million
fucking pieces.

105
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:35,289
Five million pieces.

106
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,993
Jesus Christ.

107
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:04,518
How in the fuck

108
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,604
am I supposed
to prepare to carry

109
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:09,023
five million pieces
of eight across an ocean

110
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:10,908
without anybody
knowing I'm doing it?!

111
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:12,943
I don't know, but perhaps if
you asked a little louder,

112
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:16,363
there might be someone on
the moon who could help you.

113
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:19,617
Why don't we lower our
voices and begin again?

114
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:22,036
Have you begun the men
clearing the ship's hold?

115
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:23,704
Everything that
isn't bolted down

116
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:25,422
is being moved
onto the sand.

117
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:27,708
I told him
I needed to refigure

118
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:29,376
how she was
carrying her weight.

119
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:31,595
- Is that something one does?
- No.

120
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:34,882
It's all I could think of given
that there's no good reason

121
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,051
to empty a ship
while she's in the bay

122
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:40,137
unless you're making room to fill
that space with something else.

123
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:42,262
"Oi, Featherstone, what is
it we're making space for

124
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:43,607
by emptying
all this stuff?"

125
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:45,213
"Oh, nothing, gents.
I just want to..."

126
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:46,727
Try to refigure how she's
carrying her weight?

127
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:49,229
"...refigure how she's
carrying her weight," exactly.

128
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:51,565
Fuck!

129
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:54,068
Even if somehow
we can set sail

130
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:56,737
<i>to retrieve this gold
without anyone knowing it,</i>

131
00:09:56,822 --> 00:09:59,990
even if the intelligence is correct
and the gold is retrievable,

132
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:02,826
we haven't even begun
to address the issue

133
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:04,244
of where we'll put
all that gold,

134
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:06,547
much less defend it.

135
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:08,582
I mean...

136
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:11,335
is this really something
we're capable of doing?

137
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,421
- Yes.
- Yes?

138
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:19,093
Yes, we are capable
of doing this and more.

139
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:22,563
We will have that prize,
Mr. Featherstone.

140
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:26,817
We've all come too far to let an
opportunity like this pass us by.

141
00:10:26,902 --> 00:10:28,485
Would you not agree?

142
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:30,487
I humbly suggest

143
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,489
you continue
unloading the hold.

144
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,442
By the time anyone
expects to reload it,

145
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:39,246
you will be close enough to departure
to tell them the truth, yes?

146
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:55,462
Is it possible
for two men

147
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:57,381
days removed
from unending wealth

148
00:10:57,466 --> 00:10:59,049
to be any less happy?

149
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,106
All right, I can see
that you are angry.

150
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:09,693
But are you angry
with Anne for leaving

151
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:13,030
or are you angry with me for
offering her the opportunity?

152
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:15,649
It would help me to understand
with which I am dealing.

153
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:26,160
For so many years,
I knew her.

154
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:28,545
Perhaps the only one
who truly knew her.

155
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,834
But for weeks, with everything
we've been through,

156
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,753
everything she's done...

157
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:41,008
she's a fucking
mystery to me.

158
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,119
So now I realize
two things are possible--

159
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:47,514
One, something
has changed within her,

160
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,400
something so significant that she's
turned into someone I barely recognize,

161
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:52,069
or, two...

162
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:56,240
it was a fantasy that
I ever knew her at all.

163
00:11:58,027 --> 00:11:59,276
And the most disturbing
thing about it is,

164
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:01,111
because it's Anne...

165
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:07,034
I will likely
never know which it is.

166
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,037
Am I angry
that she's gone?

167
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,375
Maybe with everything that lies ahead
of us, perhaps it's for the best.

168
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:53,330
I'm here to see
the lady of the house.

169
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:54,798
She's occupied.

170
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:56,383
Tell her
it's news from home.

171
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:58,252
Use those words,
please.

172
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,566
<i>Good morning, dear.</i>

173
00:13:14,403 --> 00:13:16,820
What do you have for me?

174
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:19,072
The quartermaster,
Featherstone,

175
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:21,525
met with Max and Rackham
behind closed doors again.

176
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,160
Entered in a huff,
left in a huff.

177
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:25,329
Could you make out
their words?

178
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:29,416
No, and I fear if I pressed any
closer, they'd have found me out.

179
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:31,952
Ma'am, you know I am
eternally in your debt

180
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:33,787
for how you treated me
when you oversaw the inn,

181
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:37,124
but please don't ask me to
delve into this any further.

182
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:42,930
It's all for a good cause,
rest assured.

183
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:45,299
You haven't even told me what
this is all in service of.

184
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:48,302
Who the information's
being purchased for.

185
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:05,319
When last we spoke, you
said you were still undecided

186
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:07,821
as to who would assume control
ostensibly of the operation.

187
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:10,207
I was just wondering
if you'd reached a decision.

188
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:13,744
Not yet.
Shortly.

189
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:16,663
- Is that all?
- Yes, ma'am.

190
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:21,585
No news from the fort?

191
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,004
The doors are still shut.
No word from inside.

192
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:25,672
Either they're plotting
some sort of reprisal

193
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:28,425
against us over the
disappearance of Miss Ashe or--

194
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,677
Or they're still
choosing a new captain.

195
00:14:32,014 --> 00:14:33,764
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:44,858
Ma'am, the lady is here.

197
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:46,693
She's here right now?

198
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:49,363
Yes, ma'am.
Said it was urgent.

199
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:51,615
All right.

200
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:58,505
Were we scheduled
to see each other today?

201
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,375
No, ma'am.

202
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:04,795
But I have news I think you'll
want to hear without delay.

203
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,381
<i>May I sit?</i>

204
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:15,555
When you engaged me to monitor
the goings on across the way,

205
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:19,226
for a generous stipend,
I might add,

206
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,397
I must confess, I thought you'd
overestimated our young friend Max,

207
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:27,034
<i>worrying that she was clever enough
to create any real trouble--</i>

208
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:28,735
I'm sorry, is there a point
you are trying to make?

209
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:31,405
I was wrong.

210
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:34,574
There is something
afoot at the inn.

211
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,743
I believe
I know what it is.

212
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:39,079
<i>And I believe you'll
want to know it, too.</i>

213
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:47,671
Next item!

214
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:54,094
I know my role here is to
recount information to you.

215
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:56,813
But with what lies ahead,

216
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,567
I'm hoping you'll indulge me
in a personal account.

217
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:04,855
About five years ago,
I served on a merchant vessel

218
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,774
<i>running slaves in and out
of Charles Town.</i>

219
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,579
I remember the first time
I saw those walls,

220
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:15,365
those patrol ships,

221
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:18,502
and those fucking guns.

222
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:20,287
The first mate leans in

223
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:23,457
as he sees that look
on my face.

224
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:27,260
He says,
"That, son,

225
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:31,431
is a town resolved
never to be fucked with."

226
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:34,468
<i>And as we're
unloading our cargo,</i>

227
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:38,638
we watch a gathering
in the square-- a gallows.

228
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,942
<i>And we watch
as they haul up a man</i>

229
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,644
named Solomon Little.

230
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:47,981
And they announced
to the crowd that this man...

231
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:50,317
When Captain Flint first
arrived on this island,

232
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:53,453
he gained influence faster
than any man I'd seen before.

233
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:55,455
Or since.

234
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:57,791
I heard men say it was
because of the violence.

235
00:16:57,826 --> 00:17:00,577
I heard them say
it was his charm.

236
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:02,412
But it was clear
to me the reason why

237
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:04,664
he was so good at bending
men towards his will

238
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:07,167
was he knew
the power of a story

239
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:10,053
<i>and how to harness it
to his own ends.</i>

240
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:12,472
That man there,
I would argue,

241
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:14,508
may very well
be his equal.

242
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:18,228
...as they put the rope
around his neck.

243
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,430
And I listened
to that excited talk...

244
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:22,349
You know it
isn't even his.

245
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,518
What do you mean?

246
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,487
The pirate story
is Bernard's.

247
00:17:27,523 --> 00:17:29,022
I've heard him
tell it before.

248
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,525
This man was no more
than an animal...

249
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,860
Jeffries, I think.
Can't remember.

250
00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:38,665
Can't trust a fucking
thing out of his mouth.

251
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,035
Yeah, the story's his,
the story isn't his.

252
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:45,088
But the power
of the telling...

253
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:47,591
that is clearly his.

254
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:51,928
At the moment, he's using
it to help the captain.

255
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:53,513
But God help us
if he ever realizes

256
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,882
what else he could
use it to accomplish.

257
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:58,852
<i>And as he swung,</i>

258
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:00,971
I watched the crowd
jeer at him.

259
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:05,892
I watched them laugh
and celebrate.

260
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:08,478
Women, children,
all of them.

261
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:12,115
I tell you, friends,

262
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:15,035
what lies ahead
isn't just the governor

263
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,238
nor his lieutenants
or his soldiers or their guns.

264
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,491
The people
of Charles Town

265
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:25,245
are eager
to see you and me dead.

266
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:30,667
If Captain Flint is
to come through this alive,

267
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:33,587
we will need to be focused
and at our best.

268
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:45,065
What the hell was that?

269
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:48,318
What?

270
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:50,737
When you two returned and the
three of us stood on that beach,

271
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:52,572
what did I say to you?

272
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:56,776
You said if we told Flint
the gold was gone,

273
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:58,612
you'd get another crew
to go back and get it

274
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:01,281
and we could have
a bigger share.

275
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:06,836
Well, there we go.

276
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:09,039
There's the problem.

277
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:12,125
It seems you only heard half
of what I said that night.

278
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:15,212
I also said
that if anyone,

279
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:19,132
anyone even remotely suspected
something was off about our story,

280
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:21,351
if they even detected
the faintest whiff of it,

281
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:23,637
we would all
be dead men.

282
00:19:23,722 --> 00:19:26,223
That sounds familiar,
does it not?

283
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:28,225
<i> All right.</i>

284
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:31,478
- I understand.
- Do you?

285
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,315
The men on this ship
face grave danger ahead.

286
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:39,486
So when you sit behind them
grinning like a fucking child,

287
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:42,489
you can see how
that presents a problem.

288
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,491
How it might elicit
the very questions

289
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:47,711
we came on this fucking trip to
avoid in the fucking first place.

290
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:49,963
I said I understand.

291
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:51,381
No one's asking questions.

292
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:54,834
No one knows shit, so
leave me alone about it.

293
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:05,428
That man has the potential
to be a very real problem

294
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:06,813
for the two of us.

295
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:14,437
The other day, I received
word from one of Max's girls

296
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:17,857
that Charlotte
had left the island,

297
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:19,859
ran off with a man
in the middle of the night.

298
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:22,862
So in love, they say,
with a man from Flint's crew,

299
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:24,581
a man named Logan,

300
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,618
that they started a life
together in Providence.

301
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,926
What is that?

302
00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:39,095
Charlotte's savings.

303
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:43,800
Charlotte didn't trust
the other girls,

304
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:46,136
didn't trust the turns.

305
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:49,556
So she entrusted it
to me to watch it for her.

306
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:52,108
She and this man
leave the island

307
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:55,228
on the eve of securing
an unprecedented prize

308
00:20:55,314 --> 00:20:59,199
with no warning,
no witnesses, and no money.

309
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:01,318
I'm sorry,
I'm not following.

310
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:03,737
Why did you engage
my services, ma'am?

311
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:06,740
To monitor a brothel madam

312
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,875
intent on stealing
information

313
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,744
to use for her benefit.

314
00:21:10,796 --> 00:21:13,463
A member of Flint's crew,

315
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:16,416
with knowledge of the
whereabouts of the Urca gold,

316
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:18,418
walks into her inn.

317
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,921
He promptly disappears under
suspicious circumstances,

318
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:24,090
and less than a day later,

319
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:28,061
news arrives that the Urca
gold is no longer to be won,

320
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:31,314
but is safely
on its way back to Spain.

321
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:37,821
You're asking
me to believe

322
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:39,689
that Max somehow
got the information

323
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:41,608
about the Urca
out of this man's head,

324
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:44,911
murdered him and then
one of her own girls,

325
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:48,248
and then somehow managed to convince
Captain Flint and the rest of his crew

326
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:51,334
that the Urca gold
had disappeared?

327
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,036
How the fuck
would she do that?

328
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:55,372
I don't know.

329
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:00,460
But this morning,
Captain Rackham's ship

330
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:04,130
emptied the entire contents
of its hold onto the island,

331
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:06,766
<i>started loading up
with fresh water,</i>

332
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:08,885
<i>preparing to set sail.</i>

333
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,804
<i>Wherever he's going,</i>

334
00:22:10,856 --> 00:22:13,773
<i>he anticipates bringing
something very large back.</i>

335
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,644
I believe Max
learned about the prize.

336
00:22:17,696 --> 00:22:19,813
I believe somehow
she managed

337
00:22:19,865 --> 00:22:21,948
to convince the island
it had disappeared.

338
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:25,368
<i>I believe that right now
she and her partners</i>

339
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:27,654
<i>are preparing
to retrieve it</i>

340
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:29,572
<i>and bring it back
to this place.</i>

341
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:33,960
<i>Were that to happen, the thieves
and their like would flourish here</i>

342
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:37,297
<i>and your plans for this place
would be doomed to failure.</i>

343
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:45,722
I want the Nassau
you are trying to build.

344
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:49,008
But if that Nassau
is ever to be,

345
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,561
you have to stop her.

346
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:05,825
Captain?

347
00:23:09,364 --> 00:23:11,865
Winds are more favorable
than we anticipated.

348
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:14,367
De Groot wants to tack earlier
through the wind than you suggested.

349
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:17,036
Might take some maneuvering. He'd
prefer not to do it in the dark,

350
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:18,362
but he thinks
the men are, um...

351
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,675
up to it.

352
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:26,796
So, as long as you're in agreement,
he'll make preparations.

353
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:28,214
Tell him
I'm in agreement.

354
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
The sooner we get her
home, the better.

355
00:23:42,197 --> 00:23:46,032
His name is Billy,
in case you were wondering.

356
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:48,318
I beg your pardon.

357
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:50,453
He just...

358
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:52,572
seems so
out of place here.

359
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:55,158
Like someone I might have
known back home in London.

360
00:23:55,243 --> 00:23:56,793
He may easily have been.

361
00:23:57,963 --> 00:24:01,080
His parents were
Levelers in Kensington.

362
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:04,751
Spoke out against
impressment, kidnappings.

363
00:24:04,803 --> 00:24:07,921
Printed pamphlets
from their home.

364
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:10,306
Insisted that Billy
was lettered

365
00:24:10,392 --> 00:24:13,226
so that he could understand
the cause and contribute.

366
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:18,765
That winter, when the press
gangs came through town,

367
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,769
they found Billy distributing
those pamphlets in the street.

368
00:24:22,854 --> 00:24:26,406
I suppose they found
it funny, snatching him

369
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:29,108
and leaving only the pamphlets
for his parents to find.

370
00:24:31,496 --> 00:24:33,079
Did he ever
see them again,

371
00:24:33,114 --> 00:24:35,031
his mother and father?

372
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:38,334
When we found Billy,
we freed him,

373
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,920
and when given the opportunity
to confront the man

374
00:24:40,956 --> 00:24:44,007
that had taken him
from his family,

375
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:46,292
held him in bondage
for three years

376
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:49,345
without wages
or reprieve,

377
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:51,631
he slew that man.

378
00:24:53,468 --> 00:24:56,803
<i>After that, he said he couldn't
face his father again.</i>

379
00:24:56,855 --> 00:25:00,473
Didn't think he'd be able to
accept a murderer for a son.

380
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:08,147
Coming through
the wind again, gents.

381
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,365
This one's
gonna be tight.

382
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:10,984
Watch yourselves, eh?

383
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:13,820
Tyson, foremast,
Howard, mizzen,

384
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:16,539
Irving, main.

385
00:25:40,515 --> 00:25:44,317
What lies ahead, I'm afraid I
might be wholly unprepared for.

386
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:47,570
I always thought this journey
would end in battle.

387
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:51,524
A fight to preserve
the things we held dear.

388
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:56,195
I understood that.
I was ready for that.

389
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:58,364
Now, as it turns out,

390
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,783
something else lies
at the end of this road.

391
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:03,870
Judgment.

392
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:07,040
Not of Nassau,
but of me

393
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:09,008
and the man
that I've become.

394
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:11,294
And this entire endeavor

395
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:13,963
hangs in the balance
of that judgment.

396
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:17,016
You can defend that man.

397
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:19,886
There are good arguments
in defense of him.

398
00:26:19,938 --> 00:26:23,640
For some of his deeds,
perhaps for most of them.

399
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:26,275
But there are some things
that Captain Flint has done

400
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,561
that cannot be defended.

401
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:31,280
<i>I will make my argument</i>

402
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:34,283
<i>having no sense
of my footing with him.</i>

403
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:37,370
<i>No sense of the things
he knows about me,</i>

404
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:40,540
<i>the lower things.
The darker things.</i>

405
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:45,244
<i>And the moment he reveals
that he knows these things</i>

406
00:26:45,296 --> 00:26:48,081
<i>may be the moment that this
all comes crashing down.</i>

407
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:52,335
He is going
to render judgment.

408
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,756
And it all depends on what he
sees standing before him--

409
00:26:56,808 --> 00:27:00,560
Me or my name.

410
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,574
I just want you to know,

411
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:16,325
I appreciate the
opportunity you gave us.

412
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:21,414
It's all right.
I'm not stupid.

413
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:23,750
Neither is he, honestly.

414
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:25,868
<i>He's torn up inside.</i>

415
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:29,122
Betraying the other men,
it's making him act foolish.

416
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:32,208
Like you've seen.

417
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:34,594
That may very well be.

418
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:36,713
But he won't matter for much if
he gets the three of us killed.

419
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:38,047
I know.

420
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:42,018
I know.

421
00:27:42,103 --> 00:27:45,138
Sometimes he's just
so fucking stubborn.

422
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,941
Always been like that, long
as we've sailed together.

423
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:52,812
It's a goddamn
shame, truly.

424
00:27:52,864 --> 00:27:54,897
I wish it
were otherwise.

425
00:27:54,983 --> 00:27:57,734
Well, if you can think of something to
say to him to get him to fall in line,

426
00:27:57,819 --> 00:27:59,869
now would be a good time.

427
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:03,156
Say to him?

428
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:05,374
Ain't we past that now?

429
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:08,494
Past it?

430
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:09,829
What you asked me to do,

431
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,998
wasn't the point to solve
the problem for good?

432
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,837
What the hell
are you talking about?

433
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:20,506
Nicholas was scheduled
for duty on the mainmast.

434
00:28:20,592 --> 00:28:23,032
It seemed the perfect chance to
make it look like an accident.

435
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:38,858
- Clear out!
- Who is it?

436
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,694
Who is it?

437
00:28:49,204 --> 00:28:51,704
What about this?
Ahem.

438
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:55,374
Upon our return, we anchor the
ship off the southern coast.

439
00:28:55,455 --> 00:28:58,240
A team of men excavate
a trench inland.

440
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:03,461
We leave the bulk of
the coin in the trench,

441
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:05,247
keep the location secret,

442
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:08,416
and rotate men in watches
to keep it under guard?

443
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:12,554
Your answer as where to secure
five million pieces of eight

444
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:14,172
is to dig a hole?

445
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:19,644
All right,
how about this?

446
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,764
It is astonishing
how much damage

447
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,817
a woman can do once you
let her in the door.

448
00:29:27,187 --> 00:29:28,687
Is he talking about you?

449
00:29:28,772 --> 00:29:29,938
He's talking
about Miss Bonny.

450
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,323
I'm talking about
Miss Guthrie.

451
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:33,108
We all know what happened
up at that fort.

452
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,826
He lets her in,
she walks off

453
00:29:34,912 --> 00:29:37,112
with a prize
worth a fortune,

454
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:38,747
leaving him to swing
in the wind for it.

455
00:29:38,782 --> 00:29:42,367
Right now Charles is either
fighting to preserve his captaincy

456
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:44,612
and looking for any good
argument to win them a fortune,

457
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:48,039
and quickly, or he's dead
and some new captain

458
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,925
is wrestling with
the same question.

459
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,459
What are you saying?

460
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:54,679
Where does one store
a fortune in gold coins?

461
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:56,798
In a goddamn fort.

462
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,685
What, you're just gonna walk
up there, knock on the door,

463
00:30:00,771 --> 00:30:03,438
and ask whoever answers
if they'll let us use

464
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:05,941
your half-demolished fort
as a treasury?

465
00:30:09,146 --> 00:30:11,897
Please go with him
so he doesn't get killed.

466
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:14,482
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

467
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,540
Ma'am.

468
00:30:27,331 --> 00:30:30,832
It's been a day since Mrs. Mapleton
told us of the plot next door.

469
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:32,884
For the past day,
I have watched the crew

470
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,136
of the Colonial Dawn
loading supplies.

471
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:39,140
They are now nearly through and likely
less than a day away from setting sail.

472
00:30:39,176 --> 00:30:42,344
I've wanted to give you the
time you needed to deliberate,

473
00:30:42,396 --> 00:30:44,679
but now I'm concerned
you may not appreciate

474
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:46,348
how precarious
things will be here

475
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:48,600
should that gold
reach our shores.

476
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:53,655
Ma'am, pirates flush with Spanish
gold will be encouraged.

477
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,156
They will be empowered.

478
00:30:55,192 --> 00:30:57,075
But what they will never be,
under any circumstances,

479
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,829
<i>is partners in a plan
to reconcile with England.</i>

480
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,331
<i>From where I sit,
I think it is clear</i>

481
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:04,950
that we must act
to prevent--

482
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:06,668
We?

483
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:11,706
<i>I'm fairly certain that you aren't
suggesting that we do anything.</i>

484
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:14,009
The only way
to truly ensure

485
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:15,627
that the Urca gold
doesn't return here

486
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,046
is to eliminate everyone
with the knowledge

487
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:20,048
of where it is
and how to retrieve it.

488
00:31:22,052 --> 00:31:25,353
You are suggesting that I have
all of these people killed.

489
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:27,305
Captain Rackham,
his leadership,

490
00:31:27,391 --> 00:31:29,557
any of his men who've
been made aware of it.

491
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:34,145
Max.

492
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:37,565
With all due
respect, ma'am,

493
00:31:37,651 --> 00:31:40,235
it's not as if
you haven't done it before.

494
00:31:43,156 --> 00:31:46,741
I have done what I have done
to arrive at this point.

495
00:31:46,793 --> 00:31:48,910
I have done what I've done
and I will live with it.

496
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:51,329
But do not for a moment
believe that that defines me.

497
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:54,082
<i>I will not be that person.</i>

498
00:32:20,777 --> 00:32:23,194
<i>God rest his soul.</i>

499
00:32:49,473 --> 00:32:50,889
Why?

500
00:32:50,974 --> 00:32:52,891
I thought you'd made it
clear what I was to do.

501
00:32:52,976 --> 00:32:54,943
How the fuck could
you have thought that?

502
00:32:54,978 --> 00:32:56,861
You said he could sink us.

503
00:32:56,947 --> 00:32:58,480
Then you gave me a look.

504
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:03,568
Let me see
if I have this.

505
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:06,121
Flint gives an order, but to
get you men to follow it,

506
00:33:06,156 --> 00:33:09,356
<i>I need to come down here, put on a show,
and convince you it's in your interests.</i>

507
00:33:10,994 --> 00:33:14,295
But I give you a look

508
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:16,331
and you're willing to
murder a man over it?

509
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:20,668
I listen to Flint because you
tell me it's in my interests.

510
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:24,472
I listen to you because I know you
give a shit about my interests

511
00:33:24,508 --> 00:33:26,808
and I ain't the only one
thinks that way.

512
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:38,186
<i>...be turned into corruption,</i>

513
00:33:38,238 --> 00:33:41,406
<i>looking for the
resurrection of the body</i>

514
00:33:41,491 --> 00:33:44,993
<i>,</i>

515
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:47,445
<i>and the life
of the world to come</i>

516
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:49,581
<i>through our Lord
Jesus Christ.</i>

517
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,449
<i>Amen.</i>

518
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:53,368
Amen.

519
00:33:57,874 --> 00:34:01,292
<i>We therefore commit
his body to the deep.</i>

520
00:34:01,378 --> 00:34:03,761
Nicholas Irving.

521
00:34:10,387 --> 00:34:11,719
<i>From across an ocean,</i>

522
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:14,439
<i>it is hard to know
what the New World is.</i>

523
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:21,029
<i>All I knew
were the stories I was told</i>

524
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:24,949
<i>of monsters and valiant men
sworn to slay them.</i>

525
00:34:26,736 --> 00:34:29,204
<i>But now that I've nearly
traversed the ocean</i>

526
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,906
<i>that separates
New World from old,</i>

527
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:35,376
<i>I fear that the stories
I've heard</i>

528
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:39,247
<i>may have clouded the truth
more than clarified it.</i>

529
00:34:40,634 --> 00:34:44,219
<i>It would seem
these monsters are men--</i>

530
00:34:44,254 --> 00:34:47,422
<i>Sons, brothers,</i>

531
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:49,424
<i>fathers.</i>

532
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:54,762
<i>And it would
seem these men</i>

533
00:34:54,814 --> 00:34:57,932
<i>fear their own monsters--</i>

534
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:01,819
<i>An empire...</i>

535
00:35:01,905 --> 00:35:04,072
<i>a navy...</i>

536
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:05,607
<i>a king.</i>

537
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,277
<i>My father.</i>

538
00:35:15,585 --> 00:35:18,419
<i>So much
I've left behind me--</i>

539
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:20,872
<i>London, my youth,</i>

540
00:35:20,957 --> 00:35:24,092
<i>and comfortable stories.</i>

541
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:26,544
<i>So much lies ahead
in Charles Town--</i>

542
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,298
<i>A future
and harder truths.</i>

543
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:35,937
<i>I feel I must
face it honestly, bravely.</i>

544
00:35:35,972 --> 00:35:40,558
<i>I must face it
as my father's daughter,</i>

545
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:43,978
<i>and I believe that
in order to do that,</i>

546
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,982
<i>I have to tell these people
that which I've kept from them.</i>

547
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:51,035
<i>I have to tell them
what I know.</i>

548
00:35:53,707 --> 00:35:57,075
I've told you my father
is a reasonable man,

549
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,411
and that is true
about most things.

550
00:36:00,497 --> 00:36:04,632
At one point,
he was even reasonable

551
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:07,635
about the issue
of quelling piracy.

552
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:10,588
Until I received
a letter from him

553
00:36:10,674 --> 00:36:12,557
years ago

554
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:15,560
in which he recounted to me
the story of a ship...

555
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:19,347
headed for Charles Town

556
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:22,100
attacked by pirates.

557
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:26,187
<i>The ship which was attacked
was named the Maria Aleyne.</i>

558
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:34,028
<i>The ship was set upon
by Captain Flint and his men.</i>

559
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,534
And in the midst
of the bloody assault,

560
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:42,587
there was one
particular victim,

561
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:44,872
a very important man

562
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,541
traveling under
an assumed name.

563
00:36:48,178 --> 00:36:51,212
His name
was Alfred Hamilton.

564
00:36:56,636 --> 00:36:59,187
<i>Given the lengths
to which this man had gone</i>

565
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:01,556
to protect himself,

566
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:05,193
the fact that he fell under
Captain Flint's sword...

567
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,197
suggested
he'd been hunted,

568
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:12,784
<i>pursued, and then
executed in cold blood</i>

569
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:15,069
<i>and with great
malice aforethought.</i>

570
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:23,378
<i>The motive unclear,</i>

571
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:27,882
<i>but the intent apparently
dark and awful,</i>

572
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:30,752
<i>monstrous.</i>

573
00:37:30,837 --> 00:37:34,889
<i>He said the act was completely
incompatible with civilized society.</i>

574
00:37:34,924 --> 00:37:37,475
<i>That he would dedicate
his life to eradicating it.</i>

575
00:37:40,063 --> 00:37:42,480
And that there would be law
in the Americas...

576
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:47,318
the day Captain Flint
swung over Charles Town.

577
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:52,774
I appreciate
what you've done for me.

578
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,109
I respect what you hope
to accomplish,

579
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:57,195
so I ask you,

580
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,997
when you return me
to Charles Town,

581
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:03,368
turn around
and sail away.

582
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:27,308
Do you think those patrol
ships have clearance to fire?

583
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:30,778
Not while we're out
of range of that fort.

584
00:38:30,814 --> 00:38:33,981
As long as we don't come any
further, they know we're no threat.

585
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,654
I don't want to see a single
one of our gun ports open.

586
00:38:39,706 --> 00:38:43,157
I don't want to see a single man
on deck with a weapon in his hand.

587
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:44,959
This only works
if we can make it clear

588
00:38:44,994 --> 00:38:49,213
that we have absolutely no intention
of shooting at anyone today.

589
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:51,165
What if they
start shooting at us?

590
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:53,418
Duck.

591
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:57,755
<i>Prepare to drop anchor!</i>

592
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:02,844
I've made arrangements.

593
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,289
You'll be safe here
until I return.

594
00:39:04,314 --> 00:39:06,154
What are you talking about?
I'm going with you.

595
00:39:06,182 --> 00:39:08,099
You heard what she said.
It's too dangerous.

596
00:39:08,184 --> 00:39:11,185
If I'm standing next to you, he's far more
likely to see you as the man you were.

597
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:13,354
He's more likely
to see you as a woman

598
00:39:13,406 --> 00:39:15,940
abetting a known pirate
and hang you alongside me.

599
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:18,276
- I see no reason for you to take that risk.
- Of course there is reason.

600
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:20,401
- None that I am willing to take.
- It was my fault.

601
00:39:22,415 --> 00:39:25,867
I'm the one who learned Alfred
Hamilton was a passenger on that ship.

602
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,203
I knew the moment I told you
what it would drive you to do.

603
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:31,255
I knew the danger
it would put you in,

604
00:39:31,341 --> 00:39:32,874
knew the horrors
it would incite.

605
00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:36,461
I told myself to remain
silent and spare him,

606
00:39:36,546 --> 00:39:40,431
spare you those horrors,

607
00:39:40,517 --> 00:39:43,100
and yet I told you anyway.

608
00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:46,270
If you're going to face
judgment behind those walls,

609
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:47,889
then so should I,

610
00:39:47,941 --> 00:39:50,975
for if anyone is responsible
for what happened that day,

611
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,360
it's me.

612
00:39:52,395 --> 00:39:55,780
<i>Captain Vane!</i>

613
00:40:09,746 --> 00:40:12,246
Captain Vane!

614
00:40:17,136 --> 00:40:19,337
Are you Captain Vane?

615
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:23,257
<i>We received your letter
and your demands.</i>

616
00:40:23,343 --> 00:40:26,177
We are prepared to pay
the sum you requested

617
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:28,262
for Abigail Ashe.

618
00:40:28,314 --> 00:40:30,932
I am not Charles Vane.

619
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:33,100
I have no demands.

620
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:36,771
But I do have a request.

621
00:41:19,532 --> 00:41:21,566
Captain James Flint.

622
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:28,155
You're Captain Flint?

623
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,459
I am.

624
00:41:31,494 --> 00:41:34,495
And you wish an audience
with Lord Ashe?

625
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:37,999
I do.

626
00:41:41,137 --> 00:41:43,170
This was a different place
before the governor arrived.

627
00:41:43,222 --> 00:41:45,756
Raiders routinely
hit our shipping.

628
00:41:45,842 --> 00:41:48,142
All up and down
the coast

629
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:49,644
as far north
as Mt. Pleasant,

630
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,013
as far south as
the Cumberland Sound.

631
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:54,815
It took him a short while to
learn how to deal with it.

632
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:58,069
<i>But once he committed to fighting
the problem, things changed.</i>

633
00:41:58,186 --> 00:42:01,187
<i>You see, he made these
people unafraid.</i>

634
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:04,691
<i>Everyone realized, like just about
anything else in this life...</i>

635
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:08,394
the moment
you stop fearing it,

636
00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:10,229
it loses all its power.

637
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:14,450
No!

638
00:42:14,536 --> 00:42:16,069
<i>The governor is a friend!</i>

639
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:17,904
<i>The governor gave
very specific instructions.</i>

640
00:42:17,956 --> 00:42:21,240
- No, don't!
- If we were able to get our hands on Captain Vane,

641
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:22,742
he never leaves
this place again.

642
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:25,078
Stop.

643
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,247
<i> I don't see any reason those
instructions don't apply to you, too.</i>

644
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:29,999
<i>-  If anything--
- Stop!</i>

645
00:42:33,388 --> 00:42:34,754
They're telling the truth.

646
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:36,389
He's an old friend
of my father's.

647
00:42:36,424 --> 00:42:38,558
<i>I remember him.
I know him.</i>

648
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:43,646
And if you strike him again,
my father will know

649
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:46,516
you did so after I made
this clear to you.

650
00:44:13,688 --> 00:44:16,022
Welcome to Charles Town.

651
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:26,373
Charles Vane corralled 40 of the
hardest men in the New World,

652
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:29,794
brought them in line, brought
them across an ocean to this fort

653
00:44:29,879 --> 00:44:32,429
and conquered it

654
00:44:32,515 --> 00:44:35,049
with no support
from the water,

655
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:37,685
no siege engineering,
just the will to take it,

656
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,720
and throughout
all that time,

657
00:44:39,806 --> 00:44:42,022
through danger
and peril and blood,

658
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:44,275
the greatest
threat he faced,

659
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,894
the one enemy who may ultimately
have been his undoing,

660
00:44:46,946 --> 00:44:50,731
was, you know, someone
I once heard him

661
00:44:50,783 --> 00:44:52,733
refer to as Lady Honeypot.

662
00:44:55,071 --> 00:44:58,239
Beware the women, Mr. Featherstone.
They bite.

663
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,574
I'm in love
with a good woman, sir.

664
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:01,909
I'm not concerned.

665
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:04,962
Idelle?

666
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:08,249
Yes.

667
00:45:14,974 --> 00:45:17,675
It stands to reason
that if those 40 men

668
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,262
were mean enough to take this
fort under Vane's leadership,

669
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:23,097
were they
to ever turn on him,

670
00:45:23,149 --> 00:45:25,316
it would be
an ugly sight.

671
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:29,403
May I suggest that whatever is going
on in the bowels of this fort,

672
00:45:29,438 --> 00:45:31,939
perhaps it's best
left alone for now.

673
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:34,441
Perhaps.

674
00:45:34,527 --> 00:45:37,087
- What are you doing?
- I'm wondering why it's so quiet in there.

675
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:40,114
Because they're occupied
plotting some sort of awfulness.

676
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:43,367
That is one possibility. The other
is that they're no longer in there.

677
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:45,286
What are you talking about?
Their ship is still in the bay.

678
00:45:45,371 --> 00:45:47,838
It is, but I'm less intrigued
by what's in the bay

679
00:45:47,924 --> 00:45:49,673
than what's up there.

680
00:47:44,457 --> 00:47:47,207
This was found
pinned onto him.

681
00:47:53,883 --> 00:47:55,666
<i>I was once a slave.</i>

682
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:58,752
<i>I know too well the pain of
the yoke on my shoulders</i>

683
00:47:58,804 --> 00:48:02,089
<i>and of the freedom
of having cast it off.</i>

684
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:05,009
<i>So I'm resolved,
I will be no slave again.</i>

685
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:11,015
<i>And as I am free, I hereby
claim the same for Nassau.</i>

686
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,649
<i>She is free today,</i>

687
00:48:12,735 --> 00:48:16,603
<i>and so long as I draw breath,
she shall remain free.</i>

688
00:48:18,274 --> 00:48:20,074
<i>Richard Guthrie
was engaged in an effort</i>

689
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:22,693
<i>to see her return
to the rule of a king,</i>

690
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:24,778
<i>to see the yoke returned.</i>

691
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:27,865
<i>He betrayed Nassau,
and thus,</i>

692
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,367
<i>as always,
to traitors.</i>

693
00:48:30,453 --> 00:48:33,871
<i>As far as you and I,
I was warned about you,</i>

694
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:36,457
<i>warned you would
betray me.</i>

695
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:38,459
<i>I'd hoped
you and I shared a love</i>

696
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:40,461
<i>to make such a thing
unthinkable.</i>

697
00:48:40,513 --> 00:48:43,180
<i>I'd hoped those warnings
were wrong.</i>

698
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:45,516
<i>But I know you too well,</i>

699
00:48:45,601 --> 00:48:49,219
<i>so I prepared
in case they were right.</i>

700
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:55,609
<i>You removed the girl
from my possession,</i>

701
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:58,145
<i>but in turn,
the man-of-war</i>

702
00:48:58,197 --> 00:48:59,980
<i>moved on from the bay,</i>

703
00:49:00,066 --> 00:49:04,785
<i>moved on from a position
of heightened security.</i>

704
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,037
<i>Moved on to a place
where its attention,</i>

705
00:49:07,123 --> 00:49:09,156
<i>Captain Flint's attention,</i>

706
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:12,126
<i>will be so very occupied</i>

707
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:14,495
<i>on the danger
that is Charles Town</i>

708
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,580
<i>and in the state
of apprehension</i>

709
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:20,334
<i>in which the last thing
any of them will be watching</i>

710
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:22,636
<i>is the water.</i>

711
00:49:24,723 --> 00:49:27,674
<i>I made clear
the price for the girl.</i>

712
00:49:27,726 --> 00:49:30,511
<i>You should have known me
well enough to know,</i>

713
00:49:30,596 --> 00:49:33,564
<i>one way or another,
I was going to claim it.</i>

714
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:38,936
<i>And once I do,
I'll be returning to Nassau</i>

715
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:41,772
<i>to settle the rest
of my accounts.</i>
