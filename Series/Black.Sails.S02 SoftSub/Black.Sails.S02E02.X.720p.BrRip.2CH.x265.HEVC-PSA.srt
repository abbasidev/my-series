1
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:14,157
Are you the liaison
sent by the Admiralty?

2
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:15,264
I am, my lord.

3
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,244
I intend to save Nassau
before she's lost forever.

4
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,696
Hornigold provided security for
the consortium's operations.

5
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:22,581
You'd like me to fill
that role for you now?

6
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:24,667
If your friends aren't capable
of protecting themselves,

7
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:25,862
they aren't worth protecting.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,119
- What's your name?
- Ned Low.

9
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:28,955
It would be a shame
to make enemies of each other

10
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:31,624
- over such a small amount of money.
- Get out of my place.

11
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:34,627
Hell of a prize, Mr. Meeks.
Hell of a prize.

12
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:36,440
Perhaps it is in
everyone's best interest

13
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:38,714
that you and I find a way
past all of this.

14
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:41,100
There's simply no way
of stealing their gold.

15
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:43,519
But there might be something else
you can steal... their war ship.

16
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:45,688
You will both be
transported back to Nassau

17
00:00:45,723 --> 00:00:48,691
at which point you will be removed
from this ship permanently.

18
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:51,394
I think you intend to
take control of this ship.

19
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:53,946
And then I think you intend
to return to that beach

20
00:00:53,982 --> 00:00:56,449
and seize every last ounce
of gold off of it.

21
00:00:56,484 --> 00:00:59,068
And I think you're going
to need my help to do it.

22
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,538
I learned of this technique
from a Spanish bishop.

23
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,673
Six days, they claim,

24
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,176
before the sun shrinks
the leather so tight

25
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:23,546
that the ribs collapse,
piercing vital organs within.

26
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:27,466
And on the seventh day,
you'll rest.

27
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:31,220
Who knew?
They have a sense of humor.

28
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:38,477
When my men first
pulled you out of the sea

29
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:40,362
and brought you back
to this garrison,

30
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:44,567
I knew right away you were going
to be of great value to me.

31
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:47,403
You were ill-disposed
to acknowledge as much then,

32
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:49,405
but five days later,

33
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,407
I believe I have your attention.

34
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,743
You see, I believe
I may have an opportunity

35
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:56,745
to be liberated from this place.

36
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:59,999
And you are going to help me.

37
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:15,097
And God said,
"Let there be light,"

38
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,516
and then there was light.

39
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:20,436
And He saw that it was good,

40
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:23,522
and He separated the land
from the water,

41
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:26,275
and He called the water the Seas.

42
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:32,498
And He said, "Let the sea
bring forth life abundantly."

43
00:04:34,118 --> 00:04:35,784
And He blessed it,

44
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:37,453
and He said that it was good.

45
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:50,349
And He formed man
of the dust of the ground

46
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:53,102
and breathed life into his nostrils

47
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,938
and man became a living soul.

48
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:58,641
And He beheld all He had created,

49
00:04:58,643 --> 00:05:00,776
and He said it was very good.

50
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:08,284
But the Lord beheld the man
made in his likeness

51
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,286
and He beheld his solitude...

52
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:13,405
and He said,

53
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:16,158
"It is not good that he is alone."

54
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:21,130
And the moral of the story...

55
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:26,135
everybody needs a partner.

56
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:29,171
You are the partner assigned to me

57
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:32,308
in response to my father's request by
the Admiralty, but it would appear

58
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:36,011
that even you believe this
endeavor is doomed to fail.

59
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,480
Beg pardon, my lord,
but I didn't say that.

60
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:41,684
I merely said that it would be wise
for us to manage our expectations

61
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,602
as to what's achievable.

62
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:45,904
And what is it that
you think is achievable?

63
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,407
Well, sir, the pirate
issue is a thorny one,

64
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:50,776
but I believe that
there are ways to...

65
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:53,579
- Aside from the pirates.
- I'm sorry?

66
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:56,665
I don't believe the pirates are
the cause of Nassau's problem.

67
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:59,535
I believe they are a symptom.

68
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:02,705
The root causes are the ones that
I would like to address first.

69
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:04,540
Root causes?

70
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,592
The graft of its governor.

71
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,043
The incompetence of its managers.

72
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:10,679
The neglect of its lords.

73
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,715
The instability caused by these things

74
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:15,267
is what draws the pirates to
Nassau, not the other way around.

75
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:17,186
So let's begin there.

76
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:19,722
What is it that you believe
would truly return Nassau

77
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:21,223
to stable profitability?

78
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:23,892
You mean aside from
removing the pirates?

79
00:06:23,944 --> 00:06:26,862
Let's leave them out for now, yes.

80
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:29,231
What would it take?

81
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:35,237
Farmers, men skilled in the
cultivation of sugar and tobacco.

82
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,457
Magistrates to maintain order.
Carpenters to raise buildings.

83
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,409
Clergy to raise spirits.

84
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:43,912
Foodstuffs to sustain them all
for six months, perhaps a year.

85
00:06:43,914 --> 00:06:47,249
Three ships to transport it
all, sailors to sail them.

86
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:49,134
And an honest governor,

87
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,254
the first in recent memory,
to oversee it all.

88
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:54,807
In short, you'd be
assembling a colony,

89
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:57,676
boarding it onto ships, transporting
it across the Atlantic,

90
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:00,396
and hoping that when it arrives,
it takes to an environment

91
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:02,765
that has resisted every
attempt at stable commerce

92
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,100
for the past 50 years.

93
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:08,437
Oh, and then there are the pirates
that we've agreed not to discuss.

94
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:13,442
Are you sure three ships
would be enough?

95
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:18,831
My lord, I feel I have
to be honest with you.

96
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:22,918
I have grave doubts about whether
something like this is realistic.

97
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:25,204
- Yes, I've gathered that.
- If you wish to request

98
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:28,624
a liaison more sympathetic
to your views,

99
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:30,926
I'm sure Admiral Hennessey
would be happy to oblige.

100
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:34,797
The New World is a gift, Lieutenant,

101
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:39,435
a sacred opportunity to right
our wrongs and begin anew.

102
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,187
And I do not want
my family's plot in it

103
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:44,139
to be the reason for its fall.

104
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:51,397
I'm not looking for
someone to hold my hand.

105
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:53,482
I need someone who can help me

106
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:56,151
ensure that Nassau survives.

107
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:58,070
The stakes are too great
for anything else.

108
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:00,906
And you suspect that I'm that person

109
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,436
despite the fact that it's clear that
we both view the world very differently?

110
00:08:04,437 --> 00:08:06,067
Because of it.

111
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,964
Strange pairs, Lieutenant.

112
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:12,501
They can achieve
the most unexpected things.

113
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:27,683
You can walk away
from all this if you wanted.

114
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:30,569
The moment we arrive at Nassau,

115
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:33,155
you're free to go anywhere you want.

116
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,659
And yet you've offered
to help me regain control of this crew.

117
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:41,079
Why would you do that?

118
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:46,034
You mean aside from the share
of gold I'd get out of it?

119
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:51,874
There are other ways of
earning money, other crews.

120
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:54,960
I don't want to earn money.

121
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:56,879
I don't want to join another crew.

122
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:59,681
If we're being honest, I don't
really want to be on this crew

123
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:02,217
a day longer than
is absolutely necessary.

124
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:03,435
Why not?

125
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:05,888
Because I don't want to be a pirate.

126
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,223
I'm not interested in the life.

127
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:10,142
Not interested in the fighting,

128
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:12,277
not interested in the ships.

129
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:15,564
I don't care much for the sea
while we're on the subject.

130
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:17,316
But being a pirate on this crew

131
00:09:17,368 --> 00:09:19,067
for a little while longer,

132
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:20,869
it offers me an opportunity

133
00:09:20,905 --> 00:09:24,573
I don't believe I can find
anywhere else on Earth...

134
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:27,242
one big prize.

135
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:29,378
And with it, freedom.

136
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:31,914
From water, from Randall,

137
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:35,384
from hunger, from wages...

138
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:38,220
from you.

139
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:45,894
Just one question.

140
00:09:47,898 --> 00:09:49,932
In approximately two days' time,

141
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:52,017
when we arrive back at Nassau,

142
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:55,153
you and I will both be unceremoniously
expelled from this ship.

143
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:57,940
That would seem to be
an impediment to your plan.

144
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:03,662
In less than two days,

145
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:07,165
I intend to be a captain again.

146
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:10,786
I suggest you find a way of earning
your way back onto this crew as well.

147
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:27,185
Captain, a word, please.

148
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:31,223
Mr. Meeks, how can I help you?

149
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:38,897
What happened at the tavern
last night, Captain?

150
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:40,699
I don't know.
Did something happen?

151
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:43,785
I've heard word you
confronted the Guthrie woman.

152
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:46,204
- Threatened her?
- And?

153
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,290
And I wish you hadn't done that.

154
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:50,045
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Are we through?

155
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:51,827
No, we're not.

156
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,829
The crew's relationship with her

157
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:55,747
is worth far more than
the amount she withheld

158
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,583
from the Good Fortune prize.

159
00:10:57,635 --> 00:11:00,335
You're recklessly jeopardizing
that relationship,

160
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:02,504
their relationship.

161
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:04,139
Mr. Meeks, would you like to know

162
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:05,974
what the men were laughing at
just now when you arrived?

163
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,345
I was recounting to them
my conversation at the tavern last night

164
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:12,347
and wondering aloud

165
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:14,349
if I were to fuck the lady Guthrie

166
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:16,818
to within an inch of her young
life while they watched,

167
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:19,905
would the crew consider her
debt to them repaid in full?

168
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:24,026
And will they feel the same

169
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:26,495
when their next haul
is rejected by her outright?

170
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,246
When we return from Carolina,

171
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:30,866
every man on this ship will
have his hat filled with gold.

172
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:33,085
What happens after that?

173
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,203
It's an uncertain world, Mr. Meeks.

174
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:36,588
Best to live in the now.

175
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,784
He took me in

176
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:09,237
when I didn't have shit.

177
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,872
Made a place for me.

178
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:13,909
Taught me things.

179
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:17,963
Without him, I wouldn't
have fucking made it.

180
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:23,635
When someone gives you a life,

181
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:25,554
it ain't truly your own.

182
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:31,059
You owe some part of it back.

183
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:37,432
What happened last night...

184
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:39,234
Jesus.

185
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:45,323
I understand.

186
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:48,076
Something so different
from what you know.

187
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:50,445
I know how frightening it can be.

188
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:57,119
I will respect your wishes

189
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:59,705
and we can make last night
the last time.

190
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:18,523
Oh, fuck. There must be a way.

191
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,475
A way to make me essential.

192
00:13:20,527 --> 00:13:23,612
They can hate me,
they just need to need me.

193
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:25,947
Randall, hurry the fuck up.

194
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:27,616
We're waiting.

195
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:33,038
And don't you dare fucking
spit in my bowl, Randall.

196
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,623
We all know you do it
when you're ornery,

197
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:37,325
but I'm warning you, I'll know.

198
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:43,081
Curs.

199
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:48,670
You're gonna do it
anyway, aren't you?

200
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:56,511
Randall, that is truly disgusting.

201
00:13:56,513 --> 00:14:00,015
Imbecile or no, you really
ought to know better.

202
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:02,601
I don't like him.

203
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:05,737
Be that as it may, it hardly justifies...

204
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:09,024
What did you say?

205
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:11,526
I don't like him.

206
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,032
Yes.

207
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:19,201
Perhaps the better question is,

208
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:21,753
who else doesn't like him?

209
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:27,709
Yes?

210
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:32,547
A moment, if I may?

211
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:36,051
Of course.

212
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:39,187
Have you read any of these?

213
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:42,190
Excuse me?

214
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:47,612
A shelf of books,
so many lives unled...

215
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:51,650
so many possibilities.

216
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:54,653
I glanced, but nothing rang familiar.

217
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:57,489
Nor for me.

218
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:02,410
You know the irony of all this?

219
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:05,247
When we first found you,

220
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:08,416
I was the one who saw
the promise in acquiring you

221
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:10,752
and Mr. Gates was the one
who opposed it.

222
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:13,138
Is that so?

223
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:14,756
He didn't trust lettered men.

224
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:17,509
Found them harder to keep in line,

225
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:20,395
more resistant to persuasion.

226
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,931
I prevailed.

227
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:24,516
What was your argument?

228
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:29,771
That I was tired of being the only one
he had a hard time keeping in line.

229
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:39,581
Mr. Flint, I'm sorry, but I have a
tremendous amount of preparations...

230
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:41,416
It's killing me...

231
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:42,918
what happened.

232
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:46,371
What I did to Mr. Gates.

233
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:49,925
I keep on replaying it in my mind

234
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,927
every waking moment,

235
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:54,296
trying to see another way.

236
00:15:57,301 --> 00:16:00,268
I don't expect you to understand,

237
00:16:00,304 --> 00:16:03,972
but I need you to know
that no one on this ship

238
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:07,726
feels his loss more keenly than I do.

239
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:11,980
I know he developed
a great affection for you.

240
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:16,318
Perhaps if I can support you
in this moment,

241
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,988
it will be some small
penance for what I've done.

242
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,291
How exactly do you propose
to support me?

243
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:25,327
By giving you good counsel.

244
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,584
We're losing our favorable wind.

245
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,920
Been losing it for hours.

246
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:37,973
Now, sooner or later,
someone will suggest

247
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:41,393
tacking east around the
coast, get ahead of the wind.

248
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:44,012
Maneuvered properly, that would
be the fastest way home,

249
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:46,648
but I suggest that you resist
that plan at all costs.

250
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:48,934
Why?

251
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:52,771
Because that route runs right through
the common passage out of Kingston.

252
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:56,074
And the men will press to take
the first prize they sight.

253
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:04,616
We're in possession of a war ship.

254
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:06,918
Why would we shy away
from taking a prize?

255
00:17:06,954 --> 00:17:09,421
Because the men aren't ready.

256
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:11,206
Not with the numbers they've lost.

257
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:14,793
They're far too depleted to
fully man this ship in battle.

258
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:16,628
You get them home safely,

259
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,881
get them rested,
reinforce their numbers,

260
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:23,301
and then take this ship
and do with it what you will.

261
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:47,042
"A sacred opportunity
to right our wrongs."

262
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:51,413
My God, do you know anyone in
the world who talks that way?

263
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:53,248
I do now, sir.

264
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,917
Is it possible he's fully mad?

265
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,719
Half of Whitehall whispers it.

266
00:17:57,754 --> 00:18:00,839
He isn't mad. He's just...

267
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:03,641
bright, determined, wealthy,

268
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:05,143
all at the same time.

269
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:06,594
Jesus. That's worse.

270
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:15,820
You might like him, sir.

271
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:20,608
Actually, I went to one
of those salons of his,

272
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,329
the ones that half the Royal
Society attend but most deny.

273
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,865
Most of those men are pretenders, sir,

274
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:29,951
attracted to his ideas because
they make them feel like radicals.

275
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:31,953
But Thomas...

276
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:34,839
when he talks about
the need to rethink things,

277
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,674
systemic things,

278
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,260
I think he truly believes
what he's saying.

279
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:42,430
And what's more, I'm afraid I might
believe a good deal of it as well.

280
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:43,965
Thomas?

281
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,634
I'm sorry, sir.

282
00:18:46,636 --> 00:18:50,722
He refuses to stand on ceremony,
insists on the familiar.

283
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,359
I know what you're thinking,
but I assure you, sir,

284
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:57,145
my judgment, as it relates
to this assignment,

285
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:58,730
is still intact.

286
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:04,319
Ship's business.

287
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:06,738
I shall return. No, no.

288
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,729
Is there a problem?

289
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:34,566
No problem. None whatsoever.

290
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:37,235
Apologies.

291
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,904
Perhaps it's my jealousy showing.

292
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,023
Liaison to the Hamilton family,

293
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:44,492
that's quite an appointment.

294
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:46,528
Congratulations, sir.

295
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:49,364
Thank you.

296
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,416
I must say, I thought
myself quite qualified,

297
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:53,535
but then I suppose perhaps

298
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:57,205
for this particular assignment,
you were the better man.

299
00:20:05,215 --> 00:20:06,714
Of course, I can understand

300
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:09,100
how it would be
of such importance to you.

301
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:13,054
Someone of your station...
son of a carpenter's mate

302
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:15,390
given a chance
to socialize with a lord.

303
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:17,475
Hold that position for long enough

304
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:20,778
and you might convince everyone you're
something more than you actually are.

305
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,899
A gentleman, most civilized.

306
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,988
I imagine there is
no end to the benefits

307
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,323
Thomas Hamilton's favor
could bestow upon you.

308
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,577
Future employment, status...

309
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:39,664
hell, I understand
if he likes you well enough,

310
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:42,050
he may even let you fuck his wife.

311
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,228
Enough!

312
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:02,153
If you are an officer in my fleet,

313
00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:04,739
I suggest you leave this place.

314
00:21:05,825 --> 00:21:07,442
Now!

315
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,846
You can't blame the men.

316
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:31,099
They'd suffered under
an awful stretch of captains.

317
00:21:31,134 --> 00:21:33,935
Weaklings, frauds, liars.

318
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,222
Ned Low, whatever he is,
he's none of those things.

319
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:39,057
The men saw him as an answer.

320
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:42,310
But now I fear they cannot
see that by supporting him,

321
00:21:42,362 --> 00:21:44,312
they may be sowing the seeds
of their own destruction.

322
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:47,198
Mr. Meeks, your men can't
possibly be that stupid.

323
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:49,784
Are they unaware of the profits he
cost them with the Good Fortune prize?

324
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:51,569
Or the future profits
he's costing them with me?

325
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:55,657
Ma'am, I'm uncertain of my
footing on this subject.

326
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:57,158
Suffice it to say,

327
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,046
the Good Fortune yielded up
a unique item of great value.

328
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:04,549
The men know where their next
distribution is coming from

329
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:07,085
and it isn't you.

330
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:08,720
Item? What kind of item?

331
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:10,505
I really cannot say.

332
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,841
Well, Mr. Meeks, I'm not exactly sure

333
00:22:13,893 --> 00:22:15,373
what it is you think I can do for you,

334
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:18,179
- but I've got business...
- I hear you depose captains.

335
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:21,349
- Excuse me?
- I'm told you have that power.

336
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:23,318
I'm told you've done it before.

337
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:25,236
That was a special case

338
00:22:25,272 --> 00:22:27,689
and something I nearly paid for
at the cost of my livelihood.

339
00:22:27,741 --> 00:22:30,191
Simply incompatible
with the role I play here now.

340
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:32,910
He is a mad man.

341
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:35,830
And he's fixed on you
as an object of his ire.

342
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:38,783
I need your help.
My men need your help.

343
00:22:38,835 --> 00:22:43,288
But you have an interest in
seeing this resolved as well.

344
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,874
Ma'am.

345
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:50,044
I'm on my way.

346
00:22:50,096 --> 00:22:51,512
Wait for me in the bar.

347
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:53,514
We'll continue this conversation.

348
00:22:57,387 --> 00:22:59,387
Apologies, gentlemen,
for keeping you waiting.

349
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:07,979
I'm most eager to hear the results
of Captain Lawrence's journey.

350
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,288
- Thanks, love.
- Treating yourself, I see.

351
00:23:18,408 --> 00:23:20,241
I'd say you're entitled.

352
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:22,410
The work you've done
for my inn is commendable.

353
00:23:22,462 --> 00:23:26,297
And what good are the efforts
if they yield no spoils?

354
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,250
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't ya?

355
00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:32,720
Mademoiselle, what exactly is
happening between you and Anne?

356
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:35,556
She wanted me out of the inn,
out on the streets.

357
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:37,058
What would you have had me do?

358
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:41,346
I couldn't say, but seducing
her was certainly...

359
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:43,398
an interesting approach.

360
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:45,099
Call it what you like,

361
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:46,818
but yesterday she was enraged.

362
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:48,986
And today she is not.

363
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:50,438
That is not seduction,

364
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,491
that is simply removing the
cause of her frustration.

365
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:55,109
Please.

366
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:58,496
She was frustrated because
you crossed Eleanor Guthrie.

367
00:23:58,531 --> 00:24:00,281
Do you really believe that?

368
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:03,000
Has she not been behaving strangely

369
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:04,952
for far longer than any of that?

370
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:09,374
Were Mr. Hamund here, perhaps he
could testify on the subject.

371
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:12,844
I beg your pardon,
but are you asking me

372
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:15,380
to believe that Anne
killed eight men,

373
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:17,849
risked her life, utterly
destroyed both our reputations,

374
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:20,324
to say nothing of the damage done
to her relationship with me,

375
00:24:20,353 --> 00:24:22,770
to remove you from that tent,
and that she did it all

376
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:25,640
because she secretly wants to fuck you?

377
00:24:30,196 --> 00:24:32,363
I see.

378
00:24:34,617 --> 00:24:36,701
I'll tell you what
that sounds like to me.

379
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:39,904
It sounds like a crass attempt to drive
a wedge between my partner and I

380
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:42,657
to achieve for yourself
a controlling influence

381
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,242
over our little triumvirate.

382
00:24:44,294 --> 00:24:46,244
Perhaps I'll share
that feeling with Anne

383
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:49,330
and let's just see how quickly she
turns that anger in your direction.

384
00:24:49,382 --> 00:24:52,495
- It won't work.
- No? Why?

385
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:54,335
Because I believe
that somewhere, somehow,

386
00:24:54,387 --> 00:24:55,920
you have known she has wanted this...

387
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:58,306
needed this for a very long time.

388
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:00,391
I'm giving it to her.

389
00:25:00,427 --> 00:25:02,009
And now that she has it,

390
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:04,846
it would be exceedingly
difficult for her to let it go.

391
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:07,899
This upsets you.
This threatens you.

392
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:09,817
I am sorry.

393
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:12,103
There is nothing you can do about it.

394
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:28,453
Hoist up the sails!

395
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:34,091
- No luck?
- Ugly stretch.

396
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:37,428
Goddamn wind just won't cooperate.

397
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:41,382
If I were to suggest rather
than trying to tack southwest

398
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:45,436
that we head east, hug the coast
to navigate around the weather,

399
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,221
what would you say?

400
00:25:49,526 --> 00:25:52,977
I would say either
somebody gave you that idea,

401
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,313
somebody who's a hell of a sailor,

402
00:25:55,365 --> 00:25:56,781
or you've been holding back on me.

403
00:25:58,318 --> 00:25:59,901
Flint said to avoid it.

404
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:01,702
Said when it was raised

405
00:26:01,738 --> 00:26:03,988
that we should resist
the temptation at all costs.

406
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,574
Avoid the common passage
it would take us through

407
00:26:06,576 --> 00:26:08,409
and the temptation to hunt a prize.

408
00:26:08,411 --> 00:26:10,211
You spoke to Flint?

409
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:13,297
He approached me.

410
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,082
Why would he do that?

411
00:26:15,134 --> 00:26:18,386
Why attempt to scuttle the idea before
any of us have even arrived at it?

412
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:20,922
Is it possible he still believes
he can take back his command?

413
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:22,507
How?

414
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,509
There isn't a man on the crew
that will even speak to him,

415
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:26,727
much less support him.

416
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:29,931
I don't know, but had he that notion,

417
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:33,985
I imagine the idea of this crew
taking a prize under your command

418
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,771
would be a terrifying prospect.

419
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:38,990
I suppose the only question is,

420
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:41,275
are you prepared to lead them?

421
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:46,781
Set the course.

422
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:54,589
It's better than nothing, isn't it?

423
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:05,383
An account of goings-on.

424
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:09,053
Volume the first
on this 13th day in June,

425
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:13,307
1715, in the year of our Lord.

426
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:15,560
The weather is fair.

427
00:27:15,612 --> 00:27:18,446
Fresh topsail gale,
north by northeast.

428
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:22,483
First item...

429
00:27:25,154 --> 00:27:29,206
a certain member of this crew,
who shall remain nameless,

430
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:32,293
was seen dozing
during the night watch.

431
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:34,328
Another member of the same watch

432
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,299
took the opportunity to take
three pieces from his pocket...

433
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:41,802
Shut the fuck up.

434
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:43,554
We're eating.

435
00:27:56,903 --> 00:27:58,519
What was that?

436
00:27:58,521 --> 00:28:00,905
I am convincing the crew

437
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,857
to allow me to remain with them.

438
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:04,525
As we discussed.

439
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:05,993
Is that what you're doing?

440
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,949
I spent three years at the
St. John's Home for Poor Orphan Boys.

441
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:14,669
During that time, I knew a
boy named Solomon Little.

442
00:28:14,704 --> 00:28:16,370
Cleft palette, spotted face,

443
00:28:16,422 --> 00:28:20,424
and the most unfortunate set of ears
I have, to this day, ever seen.

444
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,044
He should have been beaten to within
an inch of his life on a daily basis

445
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:25,546
if the laws of nature applied.

446
00:28:25,548 --> 00:28:28,099
Yet no one ever laid a finger on him

447
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:32,019
because even at that tender age,

448
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:34,689
he knew...

449
00:28:34,724 --> 00:28:37,775
it isn't about getting them to like you,

450
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,312
it's about reminding them how
much they dislike each other.

451
00:28:42,565 --> 00:28:45,900
He got up every morning,
made his address,

452
00:28:45,902 --> 00:28:48,369
and I'll be God damned if
there was a boy in that home

453
00:28:48,404 --> 00:28:50,154
who could've lasted a day without it.

454
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:57,578
You do realize that those are
grown men out there, not boys.

455
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,246
In my experience,

456
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:02,416
when it comes to the thrill
of ridiculing one's peers,

457
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:04,135
there's little difference.

458
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:15,646
No one pays him any attention,

459
00:29:15,682 --> 00:29:18,566
so he sees everything.

460
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:20,434
And he knows his fate and mine

461
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:22,903
are more closely linked
than he'd care to admit.

462
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:25,856
So he reports it all back to me.

463
00:29:25,908 --> 00:29:27,942
And there's plenty more
gossip in the well.

464
00:29:31,581 --> 00:29:34,498
Good luck with...

465
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:36,250
whatever this is.

466
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:45,126
80 barrels of molasses,

467
00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:47,211
65 units of rum.

468
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:51,189
I can't believe this is
all we got for it.

469
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:53,434
If I may, ma'am,
I consider it a triumph

470
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:54,969
I made it back here at all.

471
00:29:55,021 --> 00:29:58,639
I was met with great
skepticism at every turn,

472
00:29:58,641 --> 00:30:01,108
from the merchant buyers
to the customs house...

473
00:30:01,144 --> 00:30:02,610
Your papers were
properly arranged.

474
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:04,111
Your payoffs were
in the proper amounts.

475
00:30:04,147 --> 00:30:05,646
It was all in good order.

476
00:30:05,698 --> 00:30:07,231
All but your family's name, ma'am.

477
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:10,284
It is no longer in good order,

478
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,902
and everyone
in that harbor knew it.

479
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:14,655
I was questioned for nigh
on three hours

480
00:30:14,657 --> 00:30:17,491
the minute the customs man
realized I was your agent.

481
00:30:17,543 --> 00:30:20,745
At a certain point, I had to
frighten him into believing

482
00:30:20,797 --> 00:30:24,548
there would be reprisals
against him personally

483
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:26,634
if he were to arrest me.

484
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:29,336
- By whom?
- I beg your pardon?

485
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:34,308
By whom did you suggest there
would be reprisals against him?

486
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:37,228
Did you use Mr. Frasier's name?

487
00:30:37,263 --> 00:30:39,680
Captain Naft's, then?

488
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:43,400
I can understand how that would
strike fear in the heart of any man.

489
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:46,437
- Charles, enough.
- Or did you use mine?

490
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:51,742
You're welcome.

491
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:12,179
How awkward this is.

492
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:15,049
Mr. Holmes here informed me

493
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:17,384
that he observed you in this place

494
00:31:17,436 --> 00:31:19,470
nervously entering
Eleanor Guthrie's office.

495
00:31:19,522 --> 00:31:24,225
I told myself, "What on Earth could
Mr. Meeks have to say to her?"

496
00:31:24,277 --> 00:31:28,112
Now forced to wonder if it stems
from your concerns about my fitness.

497
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:31,649
Seeking an ally, perhaps, to
threaten my position as captain.

498
00:31:33,903 --> 00:31:36,537
I swore an oath to those men.

499
00:31:36,572 --> 00:31:39,540
To protect them from their captain.

500
00:31:40,793 --> 00:31:43,377
From themselves when called for.

501
00:31:44,497 --> 00:31:46,580
I see.

502
00:31:46,582 --> 00:31:48,966
But perhaps you're right.

503
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:52,803
Perhaps you serve their interests
best by betraying me in this moment.

504
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:56,507
Although, perhaps this is just
the act of a spineless traitor,

505
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,592
in which case...

506
00:31:58,644 --> 00:32:01,512
well, in which case...

507
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,100
I have a duty to do
something about it.

508
00:32:11,607 --> 00:32:15,109
- You need to walk away from this.
- Walk away?

509
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:16,694
This venture is on shaky footing.

510
00:32:16,746 --> 00:32:19,363
How long before
the street realizes this?

511
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:21,615
How long before the mob
is outside your door again?

512
00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:24,451
What happens if this time
it won't go away?

513
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:26,954
Since when have you been
concerned with my operation?

514
00:32:27,006 --> 00:32:29,123
My concern is for you.

515
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,880
I believe this is going to work.

516
00:32:35,932 --> 00:32:38,766
I believe you have motive
to see it fail.

517
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:40,718
I believe you're angry with me.

518
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,553
I believe you resent me.

519
00:32:42,605 --> 00:32:44,688
What I do not believe...

520
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:46,891
not at all, not for an instant...

521
00:32:46,943 --> 00:32:48,525
is that you have any concern for me.

522
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:50,144
I can't protect you from this.

523
00:32:51,614 --> 00:32:54,448
My men follow me because
I serve their interests first.

524
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:57,034
To ask them to protect a tyrant

525
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:59,119
too weak to enforce
her own tyranny...

526
00:32:59,155 --> 00:33:01,655
I will have a very hard
time convincing them

527
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:04,158
that that is in their interests.

528
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,711
If you are not strong enough
to protect yourself, Eleanor,

529
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:11,165
then I am urging you to cease
behaving as if you are.

530
00:33:57,463 --> 00:33:59,430
I don't want to see you
in my place again.

531
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:01,598
I don't want to see
you on my island again.

532
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:04,551
Take your men, take your shit,

533
00:34:04,603 --> 00:34:06,353
and seek life elsewhere.

534
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:21,402
I'd appreciate it if you'd remove
that from my face, friend.

535
00:34:21,454 --> 00:34:24,822
Did you not hear the lady, friend?

536
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,208
All right.

537
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,758
Don't.

538
00:35:45,654 --> 00:35:49,323
I'm sorry we've had such a
rough go of it, you and I...

539
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:52,743
but I'm afraid I'm simply
enjoying myself

540
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:55,212
way too much to consider
leaving this place.

541
00:36:02,088 --> 00:36:04,471
I'm sure we'll be seeing
each other soon.

542
00:36:29,832 --> 00:36:31,915
If you're trying to impress me,

543
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:33,867
it isn't working.

544
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:46,346
Goings-on, volume the fourth.

545
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:51,051
Light breeze, west-southwest.

546
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:54,221
Sunset in roughly three hours.

547
00:36:54,223 --> 00:36:56,557
First item...

548
00:36:58,194 --> 00:37:00,360
a certain member
of the rigging crew,

549
00:37:00,396 --> 00:37:02,396
who shall remain nameless,

550
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:05,399
was moving his bowels
over the side.

551
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:07,734
He was spotted considering the stick

552
00:37:07,736 --> 00:37:10,237
and its unacceptable state of being,

553
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:12,789
and instead, chose to wipe

554
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:15,242
with the bare palm of his hand.

555
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:35,929
Next item...

556
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:40,817
Oh...

557
00:37:40,853 --> 00:37:43,237
A member of the third watch,

558
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:45,906
who shall remain nameless,

559
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:47,941
entered the pen late last night

560
00:37:47,993 --> 00:37:50,110
sometime after three bells.

561
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:53,497
Though no one actually
saw him enter or exit,

562
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:56,333
evidence of his presence was clear,

563
00:37:56,368 --> 00:37:58,452
as upon inspection,

564
00:37:58,454 --> 00:38:02,789
the dairy goat's anus
was irritated from overuse.

565
00:38:10,216 --> 00:38:11,965
You fucked the dairy goat?

566
00:38:20,726 --> 00:38:23,193
The dairy goat?

567
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:26,280
They know who fucked the dairy goat.

568
00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:31,652
There you go, Joshua!

569
00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:36,907
- Sail!
- Starboard bow!

570
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:41,878
- Sail!
- Starboard bow!

571
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:43,630
There!

572
00:38:47,336 --> 00:38:49,002
Steady.

573
00:38:49,004 --> 00:38:51,588
Steer steady, keep your course.

574
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,508
- What is she?
- English colors.

575
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,811
Inbound from Kingston.
Sugar merchants, most likely.

576
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:07,104
How do you presume an English
merchantmen will react

577
00:39:07,156 --> 00:39:08,989
when being hailed
by a Spanish warship?

578
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:12,159
Only one way to find out.

579
00:39:15,864 --> 00:39:17,698
Anyone up for a little hunting?

580
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:53,233
I'm sorry, you were saying something

581
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:56,703
about your judgment on this matter

582
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:58,322
remaining intact.

583
00:39:59,908 --> 00:40:02,376
I apologize, sir.

584
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:04,911
Good sense escaped me for a moment.

585
00:40:04,913 --> 00:40:08,165
An insult to the man's wife
that had to be answered.

586
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:11,385
It reflects not upon my fitness

587
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,004
to continue handling Lord Hamilton.

588
00:40:14,056 --> 00:40:16,340
I know how important this posting is.

589
00:40:16,392 --> 00:40:18,558
I know you know.

590
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:21,311
My concern with you

591
00:40:21,347 --> 00:40:25,098
is over that which cannot be known.

592
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,518
That thing which arises in you

593
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,238
when passions are aroused...

594
00:40:31,273 --> 00:40:33,607
good sense escapes you.

595
00:40:35,277 --> 00:40:37,194
All men have it.

596
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:41,198
But yours... yours is different.

597
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,334
Darker. Wilder.

598
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:48,171
I imagine it's what makes you
so effective as an officer.

599
00:40:48,207 --> 00:40:50,791
But when exposed to extremes,

600
00:40:50,843 --> 00:40:54,428
I could not imagine
what it is capable of.

601
00:40:54,463 --> 00:40:57,881
And of greater concern,

602
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:00,050
I'm not sure you do either.

603
00:41:10,446 --> 00:41:12,062
Lift!

604
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:17,484
Raise the lateen.

605
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:19,453
Pull away!

606
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:24,991
Heave!

607
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:26,493
Pull away, God damn it!

608
00:41:26,545 --> 00:41:29,913
Pull away, you lubbers!

609
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,498
Heave!

610
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,717
- Come down.
- Aye, sir.

611
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:37,671
Harnin' the port sheets.

612
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:40,307
Harnin' the port sheets!

613
00:41:43,244 --> 00:41:44,845
Take your pistols.

614
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:49,483
- Ready the grappling.
- Keep it dry.

615
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:53,987
Stand to, lads!

616
00:41:56,658 --> 00:41:59,359
I don't need to explain to you
the stakes of what happens

617
00:41:59,411 --> 00:42:02,662
if Mr. Dufresne is successful
in taking this prize.

618
00:42:02,698 --> 00:42:05,198
Keep the mainsail tight!

619
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:08,201
Took me a while to get
a feel for this part of it.

620
00:42:08,203 --> 00:42:11,037
Raise the black too soon
and the prize will run.

621
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,039
Raise it too late

622
00:42:13,091 --> 00:42:16,626
and you'll induce panic and a
greater chance of resistance.

623
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:19,846
You ought to show your colors
at just the right moment

624
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:21,465
to get them to strike theirs.

625
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:36,229
Raise the black.

626
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:38,732
Raise the black!

627
00:42:38,734 --> 00:42:41,318
Raise the black!

628
00:42:57,503 --> 00:42:59,386
Gun crews at the ready.

629
00:43:04,977 --> 00:43:07,394
Hold your breath, lads.

630
00:43:15,404 --> 00:43:16,903
They struck their colors.

631
00:43:20,776 --> 00:43:22,859
See? I told you.

632
00:43:26,615 --> 00:43:29,082
- Prepare to board.
- Aye.

633
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:11,324
You're in command here, yes?

634
00:44:11,376 --> 00:44:13,994
I am.

635
00:44:13,996 --> 00:44:16,212
You were wise not to fight.

636
00:44:16,248 --> 00:44:18,665
Are there any men
lying in wait below?

637
00:44:19,751 --> 00:44:21,134
Answer truthfully

638
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:24,304
or the consequences will be severe.

639
00:44:26,975 --> 00:44:29,175
It is as you see it.

640
00:44:32,347 --> 00:44:35,098
Sweep the hold.
Start at the bow.

641
00:44:41,023 --> 00:44:43,273
This is the most dangerous part.

642
00:44:44,993 --> 00:44:47,110
Look at him.

643
00:44:47,162 --> 00:44:49,863
His mind is drowning in questions.

644
00:44:49,915 --> 00:44:52,699
Did I make the right decision?

645
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:54,868
How am I going to explain
to my proprietors

646
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,087
that I gave up their goods
without a fight?

647
00:44:57,122 --> 00:44:58,955
What kind of man am I?

648
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:02,542
You hope he has answers
to those questions.

649
00:45:02,544 --> 00:45:07,714
You hope that he can reassure himself
that he made the right decision.

650
00:45:07,766 --> 00:45:09,849
You hope that he doesn't realize

651
00:45:09,885 --> 00:45:12,435
that the thing that he thought
he was surrendering to...

652
00:45:12,471 --> 00:45:15,438
the thing that drove fear
into his heart

653
00:45:15,474 --> 00:45:18,525
the moment he saw the black...

654
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,728
that that thing
is nowhere to be found.

655
00:45:28,236 --> 00:45:30,403
Are you him?

656
00:45:36,328 --> 00:45:40,330
- Beg your pardon?
- I said are you him? Are you Captain Flint?

657
00:45:49,758 --> 00:45:51,841
I assure you, sir,

658
00:45:51,893 --> 00:45:53,810
you do not want to test us.

659
00:45:57,399 --> 00:46:00,183
Men in these waters are hard men.

660
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:03,770
They don't fear ships.
They don't fear guns.

661
00:46:03,822 --> 00:46:05,689
They don't fear swords.

662
00:46:07,442 --> 00:46:09,275
Then what do they fear?

663
00:46:40,475 --> 00:46:43,276
- Retreat!
- Back to the ship!

664
00:46:52,821 --> 00:46:55,141
I want muskets in the rigging
to suppress their front line.

665
00:46:55,157 --> 00:46:56,656
Mr. Dufresne, we have lost the day.

666
00:46:59,211 --> 00:47:00,493
Muskets!

667
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:03,630
We must disengage.

668
00:47:03,665 --> 00:47:05,248
What are we waiting for?
Why aren't we moving?

669
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,167
Give the order, Mr. Dufresne.

670
00:47:07,169 --> 00:47:09,385
We do not have the manpower
to retake that ship.

671
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:11,721
- We must get underway.
- Why the fuck are we waiting for him?

672
00:47:11,757 --> 00:47:14,224
- Because he's in charge here.
- No one is in fucking charge here!

673
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:16,342
You have to sink her.

674
00:47:16,394 --> 00:47:19,979
You cannot just escape,
you have to sink that ship.

675
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:22,182
For if a single one of those
men lives to tell the tale,

676
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:25,852
no one will ever surrender
before that flag again.

677
00:47:32,744 --> 00:47:34,527
Cut us loose. Get us underway.

678
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:37,914
Cut us loose! Get us underway!

679
00:47:37,949 --> 00:47:41,701
- Set sail.
- Cut the line! Cut the line!

680
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,374
Gun crews at the ready.

681
00:47:52,547 --> 00:47:54,547
Gun crews at the ready.

682
00:47:57,219 --> 00:48:01,387
- Two-six! Two-six!
- Heave! Heave!

683
00:48:04,226 --> 00:48:08,778
- Two-six! Two-six!
- Heave! Heave!

684
00:48:08,814 --> 00:48:10,480
- Two-six!
- Heave!

685
00:48:10,532 --> 00:48:12,615
Fire!

686
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:14,901
- Fire!
- Fire!

687
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,673
I don't see a move
I can make from here.

688
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:12,792
If I move against him directly,

689
00:49:12,794 --> 00:49:15,378
his men retaliate and I don't
have the muscle to withstand it.

690
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,181
And even if I could muster up
that kind of support,

691
00:49:18,216 --> 00:49:20,633
I couldn't get away with it.

692
00:49:24,356 --> 00:49:27,223
Not after such a public
display of loss as today.

693
00:49:29,311 --> 00:49:31,694
Not so brazenly.

694
00:49:31,795 --> 00:49:35,096
The consortium is fragile.
It would be toppled.

695
00:49:35,131 --> 00:49:38,016
And I'm simply not willing
to allow that to happen.

696
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:40,969
And I suspect it's only a matter of time

697
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:43,021
before he makes a move against me.

698
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:54,532
You want me to believe that
you have some concern for me?

699
00:49:55,902 --> 00:49:57,235
Then show it.

700
00:50:00,457 --> 00:50:03,992
If you need something
to induce your men into action,

701
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:06,961
I know his crew hold an asset
from their last prize

702
00:50:06,997 --> 00:50:09,330
that they deem of great value.

703
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,216
- What asset?
- I don't know.

704
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:19,557
I don't know.

705
00:51:38,671 --> 00:51:40,838
What I have found in my experience

706
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,224
is the more elusive the puzzle,

707
00:51:43,259 --> 00:51:46,727
the more painfully obvious
its ultimate solution.

708
00:51:46,763 --> 00:51:49,013
One just has to be willing to see it.

709
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:53,935
Take our predicament, for example.

710
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:55,853
You have a wealth of leads,

711
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:58,856
but no means of exploiting them
for anything other than a fee

712
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:02,360
and risking retaliation from
Ms. Guthrie in the process.

713
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:04,278
I, on the other hand,

714
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,448
have an unparalleled aptitude
for the management of a crew,

715
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,918
but am denied any and every
opportunity to exploit the skill.

716
00:52:10,954 --> 00:52:14,338
And there it is...
the solution, so obvious.

717
00:52:14,374 --> 00:52:17,291
You will provide all leads

718
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:18,876
derived from this place
directly to me.

719
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,878
I will judge which to prosecute

720
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,631
and which too likely to rouse
Ms. Guthrie's ire.

721
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:25,883
Anne and I will then
take those chosen leads,

722
00:52:25,885 --> 00:52:27,718
we'll procure a ship,
we'll recruit men,

723
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,388
and we'll create,
from nothing, a new crew

724
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:33,307
from which we three
will each hold a share.

725
00:52:39,315 --> 00:52:41,649
You asked for better captains...

726
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:43,734
I give you Captain Jack Rackham.

727
00:52:49,075 --> 00:52:51,626
And one more thing...

728
00:52:51,661 --> 00:52:55,379
darling, I can understand why you
wouldn't want to tell me about this,

729
00:52:55,415 --> 00:52:59,383
but please know that all I have
ever wanted for you is to be happy.

730
00:53:03,256 --> 00:53:05,256
Come to bed when you're through.

731
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:27,445
Was it close?

732
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:28,946
The vote.

733
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,500
It was.

734
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:37,622
I suppose you warned me...

735
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:41,626
didn't you?

736
00:53:43,213 --> 00:53:45,880
To avoid that course
through the shipping lanes.

737
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:52,019
Perhaps it was my hubris
that drove me to it.

738
00:53:52,055 --> 00:53:55,973
To show you I had it in me to lead.

739
00:53:58,144 --> 00:54:01,646
But as I sit here,

740
00:54:01,648 --> 00:54:05,066
I'm forced to consider
another possibility.

741
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:09,203
That course we charted...

742
00:54:11,658 --> 00:54:16,827
perhaps none of us would
have thought of it at all

743
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:19,664
had you not raised it
in the first place.

744
00:54:21,584 --> 00:54:23,501
That you orchestrated it all.

745
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:29,056
The deaths,

746
00:54:29,092 --> 00:54:32,560
the destruction,

747
00:54:32,595 --> 00:54:34,178
the loss.

748
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:40,017
All to achieve this very moment.

749
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:45,773
Is it possible a man
could do such a thing?

750
00:55:10,883 --> 00:55:12,800
Congratulations, Captain.
