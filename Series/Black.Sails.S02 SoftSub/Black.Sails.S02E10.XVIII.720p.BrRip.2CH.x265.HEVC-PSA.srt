1
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:14,069
I discovered a plan to reclaim a prize

2
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:16,293
so large that it would
upset our world here.

3
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,762
Go get us our prize.

4
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:20,464
- Are you Underhill?
- I am.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,267
We've no quarrel with you.
We will be taking the girl.

6
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:25,853
This is Eleanor Guthrie,
the trade boss in Nassau.

7
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:29,807
Imagine, sir, how London would react
to the arrival of the queen of thieves.

8
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:31,976
Flint stole from me and
I'm making it right.

9
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:35,312
You hate Flint. I hate Flint.

10
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:38,399
Right now,
Flint's plan is the only plan.

11
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:40,901
- You destroyed our lives!
- Miranda.

12
00:00:40,987 --> 00:00:44,321
I want to see that noose around your
neck and I want to pull the lever

13
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:46,907
with my own two ha...

14
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:51,161
Pirate vessel, what follows
is a message from the lord governor.

15
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:53,047
I have placed Captain Flint
under arrest.

16
00:00:53,132 --> 00:00:55,833
His trial will be swift and final.

17
00:00:55,918 --> 00:00:59,336
I suggest we get him
the hell out of there.

18
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:04,753
Abigail.

19
00:03:18,602 --> 00:03:20,568
Abigail, I've made arrangements

20
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:24,322
for you to be shuttled
to Savannah today.

21
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,165
What?

22
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:35,867
You'll be taken to Mr. Ashford's house.

23
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:38,536
I'd like you to stay there
for a few days.

24
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:42,006
Why would you want me to stay there?

25
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,846
You know what's going
to happen in the square.

26
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:52,183
Yes, you're going to kill Mr. McGraw.

27
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:57,305
When these trials take place,

28
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,808
they arouse a great deal of passion.

29
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:01,810
It is natural.

30
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:06,364
But it's also something
I'm not comfortable exposing you to.

31
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:09,400
Is it for my welfare
that you want me to leave

32
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:10,985
or your own?

33
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:13,121
What?

34
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:17,242
You raised me to respect the truth.

35
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:19,961
To know it is the root of all virtue.

36
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:24,966
I'm asking if you're sending me away

37
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:27,836
because you're afraid
someone might ask me

38
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:31,005
what happened in this house last night
and that I would tell them.

39
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:33,675
Abigail, I understand that you're upset.

40
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,677
Why aren't you?

41
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,765
A man and a woman rescued me,

42
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:43,935
cared for me, delivered me home.

43
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,355
Now one of them is dead.
The other is about to be.

44
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,490
And the only man, it seems to me,

45
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:51,609
to have committed a crime in all this...

46
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,580
still works for you.

47
00:04:58,285 --> 00:05:00,335
Is that not the truth?

48
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:13,264
What does it matter whether
they hang him or not?

49
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,017
We came here to retrieve this ship.

50
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:17,352
We've done so.

51
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:20,104
Ought that not to be the
end of the conversation?

52
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,940
We can say what we will about Flint,

53
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:24,609
and I've said my share,

54
00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:27,528
but the world knows his name,
they know him.

55
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:30,982
And his body swinging over
the harbor of this place

56
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,650
sends a powerful message.

57
00:05:32,702 --> 00:05:35,320
No one surrenders to a dying thing.

58
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:38,373
And that's exactly what
we'll be if we don't act.

59
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:43,244
Where are the men about it?

60
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,964
Well, those who think
saving Flint's a good idea,

61
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:47,632
you're taking ashore with you.

62
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:48,947
Well, it wouldn't make much sense

63
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:50,668
to take the ones who
think it's a bad idea.

64
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,671
No, you're leaving them with me.

65
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:56,925
And what exactly do you expect
me to say to them, do you think,

66
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,844
when they ask me why we
don't just turn around,

67
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:01,679
leave you here

68
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:04,983
rather than attempt to fight a fight
we are far from certain to win?

69
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:07,685
Tell them that this endeavor
is in their best interests.

70
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,906
Whether they can see that or not.

71
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:15,026
And then when they're
through having their laugh,

72
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:17,862
then what do you expect me to say?

73
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:23,117
Tell them that if this ship
tries to run on a skeleton crew,

74
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:25,536
they're going to get chased,
they're going to get caught,

75
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:27,038
and they're going to get killed.

76
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:28,790
See if that convinces them.

77
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:44,605
They're resolved to rescue our captain.

78
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:46,724
Yet, from the look of things,
they seem as likely

79
00:06:46,776 --> 00:06:48,893
to slaughter us
as the Charles Town militia.

80
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:52,563
If not more so.

81
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:54,782
Who said anything about rescuing anyone?

82
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:58,236
Didn't Captain Vane?

83
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,741
There's a significant difference
between preventing Ashe

84
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:08,046
from making a trophy of Flint
and saving Flint's life.

85
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:10,581
Who's to say Vane doesn't
help Flint escape from shore

86
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:14,419
and then slit his throat the
moment we're in open water?

87
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,587
Along with all of ours?

88
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:19,924
That was dark.

89
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:40,945
You and your men are going
to remain under guard

90
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:42,830
while I go ashore.

91
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,249
You know,
we could help if you let us go.

92
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:48,119
You can also try and take back
this ship if I let you go.

93
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:51,756
We share an interest in
seeing Flint rescued,

94
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,710
but make no mistake,
this ship belongs to my men now.

95
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:58,513
It was bargained to us.
We claimed it and we intend to keep it.

96
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:00,965
What the fuck do you want from me?
Why are you here?

97
00:08:02,602 --> 00:08:05,770
You could make this
difficult if you wanted.

98
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:07,555
Riling up your crew,

99
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,808
forcing me to divert
more men to guard you.

100
00:08:10,894 --> 00:08:14,479
But if you meant what you said,

101
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:17,065
then we all face a war

102
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,818
that we must somehow face together.

103
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:23,404
And causing trouble wouldn't
make much sense, would it?

104
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,626
You want me to help you keep
my men under guard here?

105
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:32,163
So that, what,
you can kill us without having to hurry?

106
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:38,920
In a few hours,
when I leave that square with Flint,

107
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:42,390
it will be to a different
world than when I entered it.

108
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:44,342
And in that world,

109
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:47,345
killing 50 strong men of Nassau

110
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,347
able to stand up and defend her...

111
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,683
what kind of sense does that make?

112
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:55,736
What about your men?

113
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:01,609
'Cause I'm not sure they
share that assessment.

114
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:04,912
Some of them are,
understandably, displeased,

115
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:07,865
but there aren't enough
of them to sail the ship.

116
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:11,002
If you can keep your
men from provoking them,

117
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:14,755
I am confident things
will stand until I return.

118
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:23,431
Wait.

119
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:34,892
It isn't gonna work.

120
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:39,780
Your plan to rescue
Flint isn't gonna work.

121
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:45,820
But there may be
something I can give you

122
00:09:45,905 --> 00:09:47,822
to make it work.

123
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,913
And of all the villains on the sea

124
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:58,299
to which we have become
accustomed to fearing,

125
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:01,552
is there a name spoken more frequently

126
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:04,422
or with more revulsion than Flint?

127
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:14,065
Until today
and then potentially never again.

128
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,316
Burn in hell!

129
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:21,155
Now cast your gaze upon
this once fearsome animal,

130
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:24,108
brought down by his
own hubris and folly.

131
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:26,994
The villain Flint who perverts the law,

132
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,199
kidnaps our women,
and slays our blessed sons.

133
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:34,418
I meant what I said earlier.

134
00:10:34,454 --> 00:10:37,955
This outcome, it's not at all
what I would have wanted.

135
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:45,296
Vice Admiral Lord Kensington.

136
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:48,015
I don't need to explain to
you his interest in achieving

137
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:50,635
the greatest possible
exposure for this proceeding.

138
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:52,470
String him up!

139
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:54,855
He's going to put on a show.

140
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:59,527
And once it begins, I fear I will
not be able to control where it goes.

141
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:03,564
Unless you give me
what I need to stop it.

142
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:07,485
Sign a confession

143
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:11,989
for crimes that you have already
tacitly admitted to me anyway.

144
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:13,908
I'll see this process stopped.

145
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:15,993
The sentence will be
carried out quietly,

146
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,746
privately tomorrow.

147
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:21,582
Spare yourself the humiliation.

148
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:24,252
Spare her.

149
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:32,426
I'll see she's interred
with proper respect,

150
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:35,680
her name clear.

151
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,598
Let her go to her rest peacefully.

152
00:11:37,684 --> 00:11:40,318
You cannot tell me that isn't
what she would have wanted.

153
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:45,856
She was clear about what she wanted

154
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:47,825
and I don't think it had anything to do

155
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,860
with begging your forgiveness.

156
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:54,615
What she wanted was
the truth to be known.

157
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:59,036
What was the truth of it, my lord?

158
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:03,674
Why did you betray those closest
to you all those years ago?

159
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,712
Was it really so small
and vile as a bribe?

160
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:11,048
The promise of lording over
other men in this place?

161
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,055
Or were you simply too weak to say no?

162
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:20,975
Too cowardly to do the harder thing

163
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,478
and preserve your decency?

164
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:26,564
Tell me it was the latter.

165
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:29,867
Tell me this is all happening
because of your cowardice.

166
00:12:31,788 --> 00:12:34,488
I could accept that.

167
00:12:34,574 --> 00:12:36,957
I might forgive that.

168
00:12:38,328 --> 00:12:41,212
We want justice. Hang him now!

169
00:12:42,665 --> 00:12:44,749
And from this day...

170
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,751
I suppose there's my answer.

171
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:49,720
Even in this moment,

172
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:52,556
alone with a condemned man,

173
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:55,593
you are unable to speak the truth.

174
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,481
...one we must put down
to teach a lesson

175
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:02,983
to all those who brazenly follow

176
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:05,770
his villainous desires.

177
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:09,690
And lest you thought you knew
just how evil and devious he was,

178
00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:14,111
you will hear of schemes
almost impossible to believe.

179
00:13:14,163 --> 00:13:18,032
Employing his minions to dastardly ends.

180
00:13:18,117 --> 00:13:21,252
Including a woman he conspired with

181
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:23,754
to murder our lord governor

182
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,456
in his own home

183
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,292
- and in front of his own daughter's eyes.
- Burn him!

184
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:31,512
Behold his minion...

185
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:34,882
who tried and failed
to help Captain Flint

186
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:38,302
spread his evil deeds
here in Charles Town.

187
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:56,704
Go on.

188
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:59,824
I say I have the
situation completely under control.

189
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,410
- I doubt that.
- Enough, we must not act in haste.

190
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,078
And most importantly, we must not panic.

191
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:05,579
Nothing here is under control, sir.

192
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:07,415
That much is painfully clear.

193
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,301
How is it you are the only
one of us that cannot see it?

194
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,422
I'm sorry, sir.

195
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:16,947
Miss Guthrie did not tell me
there was a meeting this morning.

196
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:18,676
I would have set up...

197
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:23,514
Where is Miss Guthrie?

198
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:27,568
She's gone?

199
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:30,571
Started spreading on
the street a few hours ago.

200
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:32,523
Word is Hornigold arrested her,

201
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:35,025
handed her over to the navy.

202
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:37,695
And what do they think of this news?

203
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,914
Depends which "they"
we're talking about.

204
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:42,032
The beach is drinking in celebration.

205
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:44,952
The queen is dead, so on and so forth.

206
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,620
And the merchants?

207
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:48,622
You know how they get.

208
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:52,042
A little unrest among the crews and
they sleep with one eye open for a week.

209
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:55,379
I think this is more than a
little unrest, wouldn't you say?

210
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,017
Yes, I'd say so.

211
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:06,106
Are you all right?

212
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,809
I'm wondering if they
will try her for piracy.

213
00:15:10,646 --> 00:15:13,781
Do you think they would
do that to a woman?

214
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,566
Hang her in front of a mob

215
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:17,818
the same as they do to a man?

216
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:22,907
I know this must be difficult for you.

217
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:26,660
Less than you think.

218
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:32,583
How much coin do we have on reserve?

219
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:35,085
Reserve?

220
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:37,922
How much money can I have
on hand if I needed it?

221
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:40,391
The kitchen's funds, today's receipts,

222
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:42,760
the girls' stashes that we know about?

223
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:44,428
How would I know that?

224
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
Find out for me, please.

225
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:49,099
And have it made ready
for me immediately.

226
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:51,268
To buy what?

227
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:01,996
This journey
will be a strange one, gents.

228
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:05,115
Unlike any we've taken before.

229
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:08,953
Because of that,
I have been coy with certain details.

230
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:12,840
Namely what it is
exactly we'll be hunting.

231
00:16:12,925 --> 00:16:14,458
That ends now.

232
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,179
Brace yourselves, gents,

233
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:21,632
and let me tell you a story

234
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:24,385
about a Spaniard named Vazquez.

235
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,470
Intelligence man...

236
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:37,314
But...

237
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,317
What?

238
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:44,655
Last night you said you'd
thought about not returning...

239
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:47,908
but...

240
00:16:52,298 --> 00:16:55,549
Standing there on the
jetty in Port Royal...

241
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,670
I realized that was the
first time you and I

242
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:02,973
had been separated by that much
water since we was fucking kids.

243
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:05,009
Huh.

244
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:07,928
Being that far away,
you see things differently.

245
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:12,316
Helped me see what we are.

246
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,654
Maybe what we ain't.

247
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,911
You saved me from something awful, Jack.

248
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:26,530
And I owe you my life for it.

249
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:30,784
Maybe there's some part of
that you just can't owe.

250
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,675
But you can owe it to Max?

251
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:42,796
I don't feel that way with her.

252
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:49,269
I was at every tavern in that town

253
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:51,388
trying to find us spies,

254
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:54,058
build out this thing we started.

255
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:58,696
And every time I said my name,

256
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:00,481
they knew my name.

257
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:04,201
The first thing they said every time

258
00:18:04,236 --> 00:18:07,404
was your name.

259
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,957
Like we was two halves
of the same thing.

260
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:15,045
I can't be your wife, Jack.

261
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,474
But you and I are gonna be partners
till they put us in the fucking ground.

262
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:32,146
As long as you feel the same.

263
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:51,615
If we run and they chase us,

264
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,950
what are our prospects?

265
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:56,336
Against two of them and shorthanded?

266
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:59,123
I'd call our chances roughly even.

267
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:01,125
Against three trained hunters,

268
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:04,795
if they have any idea
what they're doing,

269
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:07,181
I'd say we're about a
dozen skilled men short

270
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:10,134
of having any fucking
prayer of surviving that.

271
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,886
The captain says we wait, trust him.

272
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:14,888
Says this is all in our interests.

273
00:19:14,974 --> 00:19:18,559
But the only thing he gives
a shit about is his own ends.

274
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:22,362
And there's not a goddamn
thing we can do about it.

275
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,995
Hey. Hey.

276
00:19:43,335 --> 00:19:45,552
I think I can help you
get out of this place.

277
00:19:50,726 --> 00:19:52,676
You've got about eight votes.

278
00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:56,230
What?

279
00:19:56,315 --> 00:20:00,017
Eight votes for quartermaster.

280
00:20:01,904 --> 00:20:03,821
What the hell are you talking about?

281
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:06,273
If you hadn't have cut that forestay,

282
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:09,910
there's an argument to be made that Vane
would have set sail right away

283
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:12,112
and probably killed us all.

284
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:15,032
They know it

285
00:20:15,084 --> 00:20:17,367
and it's having an effect.

286
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:22,589
I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong.

287
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:24,925
They all seem quite
content with Mr. Scott.

288
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:30,714
Two kinds of quartermasters
on a crew like this.

289
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,884
The one you feel you're
supposed to vote for,

290
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:36,220
and the one you want to vote for.

291
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:38,806
And the former always
gives way to the latter.

292
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:41,725
And you're comfortable with this?

293
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:44,194
Not remotely.

294
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:08,919
This one. Get him up.

295
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:12,450
What the fuck is this about?
What are you doing with him?

296
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:13,807
Shut up.

297
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:33,110
Hey, that's our brother you got there.

298
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:35,495
Put him down.

299
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,884
Move, you fuckin' die!

300
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:07,277
Affidavits given by sailors
on ships you attacked.

301
00:22:07,313 --> 00:22:11,732
Testimonials of widows and orphans

302
00:22:11,817 --> 00:22:15,319
rendered into that
state by your actions.

303
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:18,822
And these are insurance petitions

304
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:22,826
for the loss or destruction of property,

305
00:22:22,878 --> 00:22:25,829
again caused by your hand.

306
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:30,217
You stand before this court

307
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:33,053
accused of wreaking untold havoc

308
00:22:33,138 --> 00:22:35,472
throughout the New World,

309
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:39,977
of clawing at the very fabric

310
00:22:40,012 --> 00:22:43,513
of civilization that holds us together

311
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,017
with malice

312
00:22:47,102 --> 00:22:49,603
and without regret.

313
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:52,356
Do you dispute this?

314
00:22:55,444 --> 00:23:00,080
Do you have any response to
these allegations at all?

315
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:06,203
This forum is your
opportunity to be heard.

316
00:23:07,506 --> 00:23:09,539
And the world is listening.

317
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,710
Deny.

318
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:15,379
Repent.

319
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,384
No one else is going to
speak on your behalf.

320
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:24,054
Will you say nothing
in your own defense?

321
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:31,361
You see? These crimes are so vile

322
00:23:31,397 --> 00:23:33,480
that even their perpetrator

323
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:36,900
is struck dumb when
given a chance to speak.

324
00:23:36,986 --> 00:23:38,952
I have one regret.

325
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:43,407
I regret ever coming to this place

326
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:47,577
with the assumption that a
reconciliation could be found.

327
00:23:47,663 --> 00:23:51,915
That reason could be
a bridge between us.

328
00:23:53,168 --> 00:23:56,470
Everyone is a monster to someone.

329
00:23:56,555 --> 00:24:00,924
Since you are so
convinced that I am yours,

330
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,093
I will be it.

331
00:24:05,597 --> 00:24:07,514
Sir! Sir!

332
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:14,321
What's going on?

333
00:24:16,158 --> 00:24:17,455
Who is this man?

334
00:24:17,512 --> 00:24:20,046
He says his name is Charles Vane,
my lord.

335
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:22,446
Charles Vane?

336
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:29,086
What, and you captured him?

337
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,954
He turned himself over, my lord.

338
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:33,757
I came to offer testimony

339
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,926
in defense of Captain Flint.

340
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:39,763
It is his right, is it not?

341
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:45,685
He was carrying this.

342
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:56,146
If you are who you say you are,

343
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:58,198
why would anybody

344
00:24:58,283 --> 00:25:01,118
consider you a credible
character witness?

345
00:25:01,153 --> 00:25:04,571
It isn't my testimony I came to offer.

346
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:09,493
It's your daughter's.

347
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:21,638
"I fear the stories I have heard

348
00:25:21,673 --> 00:25:24,424
may have clouded the truth
more than clarified it.

349
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,476
As so many of the stories

350
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:28,762
were relayed to me by my father,

351
00:25:28,847 --> 00:25:32,015
I am forced to wonder
if he is simply mistaken

352
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:35,902
or if his motives are something
more deliberate than that."

353
00:25:47,082 --> 00:25:49,833
There's no way of keeping
that out of the record?

354
00:25:49,868 --> 00:25:51,835
Could you?

355
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,420
Of course you could.

356
00:25:53,505 --> 00:25:55,956
You could just throw it into the fire.

357
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,707
But should you?

358
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:03,046
It was produced in front of
your entire constituency.

359
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:07,217
You are the protector
of the law in this place

360
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:10,470
and you brazenly disregard
that at your own peril.

361
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:17,227
All it takes is one juror
to be taken in by this,

362
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,981
one juror to be seduced by
the scandal of it all...

363
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:25,318
and Flint goes free.

364
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:28,155
Flint isn't going anywhere.

365
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,908
That book might engender a couple
of unpleasant months for you here,

366
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,127
raise a couple of
uncomfortable questions,

367
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:35,962
but what it will not do

368
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:38,415
is affect the outcome of Flint's trial.

369
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,667
Not with the jury we have empaneled.

370
00:26:42,588 --> 00:26:46,506
The situation is well in hand,

371
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:48,225
I assure you.

372
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,843
And once Flint is swinging,

373
00:26:49,928 --> 00:26:52,145
we'll turn our attention
to his associate

374
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:55,315
and have him installed right beside him.

375
00:27:22,344 --> 00:27:23,543
A moment's peace?

376
00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:25,629
Far from it.

377
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:31,468
I heard the Guthrie shipping
concern was officially disbanded.

378
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,689
Captains Naft and Lawrence's
crews scattered to the wind.

379
00:27:35,774 --> 00:27:40,360
And Mr. Frasier left to
preside over its remains,

380
00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:43,313
empty warehouses, and this tavern.

381
00:27:46,368 --> 00:27:48,118
Were I in your situation,
I might be willing

382
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:50,487
to consider selling whatever
interests I had left here

383
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:53,990
and moving on to a more civilized place.

384
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:56,459
I've heard I ought to expect this visit.

385
00:27:56,495 --> 00:27:58,545
Heard that the madame from the inn

386
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,964
has been taking advantage
of the panic in the street,

387
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,466
offering the merchants
pennies for their interests.

388
00:28:03,502 --> 00:28:06,586
For a few whose faith in
this place was truly waning,

389
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:10,340
the chance to leave with anything to
show for their interests was a blessing.

390
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:14,511
You'll find me less eager
to sell than the others,

391
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:16,813
for I know that your faith in this place

392
00:28:16,848 --> 00:28:18,682
is derived from the secret knowledge

393
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:21,651
that it is soon to be
awash with Spanish gold.

394
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:23,436
Even if the gold does return,

395
00:28:23,522 --> 00:28:26,823
it does not alter the reality
of what this place is becoming.

396
00:28:26,858 --> 00:28:28,858
If anything, it will aggravate it,

397
00:28:28,944 --> 00:28:30,994
especially for you.

398
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:32,746
Is that so?

399
00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:34,781
The pirates of New Providence Island

400
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:38,451
are about to become more powerful
than they have ever been before

401
00:28:38,537 --> 00:28:41,087
at a time when they
would be less restrained

402
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:43,256
than they have ever been before.

403
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:47,010
And this tavern will
still be the crossroads

404
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:49,546
where their world connects to ours.

405
00:28:49,598 --> 00:28:51,765
Where their disputes are aired.

406
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,185
Where their business is conducted.

407
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,638
Where their passions are expressed.

408
00:28:58,724 --> 00:29:02,225
Is that truly something you want
the responsibility of managing?

409
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:04,861
So that's it.

410
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,064
You believe you can leap
into Miss Guthrie's shoes

411
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,734
and lord over what remains
of their family's enterprise.

412
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:14,321
I have no interest in making
the same mistakes Eleanor did.

413
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:16,790
No interest in fencing their plunder.

414
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:19,909
No interest in lording
over them in any way.

415
00:29:19,995 --> 00:29:22,962
For people like us, power in this place

416
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:27,250
is most effective when
it is least perceived.

417
00:29:27,336 --> 00:29:31,087
That is my offer to purchase your
inherited interest in this tavern.

418
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:34,808
It is more generous than any of the
others received by your colleagues.

419
00:29:34,893 --> 00:29:38,094
I will expect your
response by nightfall.

420
00:29:43,268 --> 00:29:46,936
Why is this so important to you?

421
00:29:46,988 --> 00:29:49,689
Why offer more for this
place than the others?

422
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,797
Sit.

423
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:24,307
The conflict ahead
promises much risk for us

424
00:30:24,393 --> 00:30:27,110
and very little reward
to compensate for it.

425
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:30,647
And so we would like
to leave this place.

426
00:30:30,732 --> 00:30:32,449
Now, your friend over here

427
00:30:32,484 --> 00:30:35,735
says you're just the
man to help us do it.

428
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:38,238
My problem is a shortage of manpower.

429
00:30:38,323 --> 00:30:41,658
I need more men than I have
to fully crew this ship.

430
00:30:41,743 --> 00:30:45,328
And I can't simply release your
crewmates indiscriminately.

431
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,131
I'd be inviting a counterattack
to reclaim the ship.

432
00:30:49,968 --> 00:30:51,634
So I want names.

433
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,670
Names?

434
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:57,340
One list, 10 men.

435
00:30:57,426 --> 00:31:00,844
Those most likely to
consent to join my crew,

436
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:03,229
help me sail this ship away from here.

437
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:08,401
And the men whose names
aren't on that list?

438
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,194
I told them we ain't got no
real connection to this crew.

439
00:31:18,246 --> 00:31:21,831
You help him, we both get
safe passage back to Nassau.

440
00:31:32,844 --> 00:31:34,961
No.

441
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:37,046
No?

442
00:31:37,098 --> 00:31:38,548
I won't do it.

443
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:44,637
No!

444
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:55,982
Do not doubt my seriousness.

445
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:59,903
In a short while,
escaping from this place

446
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:03,289
will be far harder than it is right now.

447
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:06,659
Right now,
the only thing preventing a clean escape

448
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:08,545
is the men to make it work.

449
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,630
And you're gonna give me those men.

450
00:32:10,715 --> 00:32:14,584
Now, if you kill me,
what good will that do you?

451
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:16,970
None whatsoever.

452
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:20,173
No.

453
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:31,768
You'll let me know when
I might have those names.

454
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:33,520
Wait, wait! Stop! Stop!

455
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,944
"I am forced to wonder
if he is simply mistaken

456
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:42,495
or if his motives

457
00:32:42,581 --> 00:32:45,782
are something more deliberate than that.

458
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:48,618
I fear the stories I carry with me

459
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,954
are my sole comfort.

460
00:32:51,006 --> 00:32:53,923
From across an ocean, it is hard to know

461
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,925
what the New World is.

462
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:59,546
All I knew were the stories I was told

463
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:01,464
of monsters and valiant men..."

464
00:33:01,516 --> 00:33:04,384
What the fuck are you doing here?

465
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:06,970
Came to take your ship.

466
00:33:07,055 --> 00:33:10,306
Stayed to get you out of all this.

467
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:13,142
Figured if anyone was going
to make a trophy of you,

468
00:33:13,194 --> 00:33:15,194
it really ought to be me.

469
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,530
So this is your plan?

470
00:33:17,616 --> 00:33:19,949
Walk in here and read a girl's diary?

471
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:22,151
More or less.

472
00:33:23,288 --> 00:33:24,704
I see.

473
00:33:26,825 --> 00:33:29,742
So now you have everyone's
eyes where you want them,

474
00:33:29,828 --> 00:33:33,746
on the two of us, what happens next?

475
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:03,159
"So much lies ahead
in Charles Town, a future..."

476
00:34:03,194 --> 00:34:05,194
When it happens,

477
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,197
once I'm free, whenever it is,

478
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:10,199
you won't want to get in my way.

479
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:13,870
When it happens,
we will be moving to the jetty

480
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:15,838
and out of this place.

481
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:19,342
Didn't come all this way to have
them kill you steps from the gallows.

482
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:26,049
They're all trying so
hard to convince themselves

483
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:29,102
that they have nothing to be afraid of.

484
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:31,054
How is running gonna change that?

485
00:34:32,357 --> 00:34:33,556
What do you suggest?

486
00:34:33,642 --> 00:34:36,693
That we remind them

487
00:34:36,728 --> 00:34:39,195
that they were right to be afraid.

488
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,233
"I have to tell you what I know.

489
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:47,570
The ship was set upon by Captain Flint."

490
00:34:47,622 --> 00:34:48,738
What are you doing?

491
00:34:48,823 --> 00:34:53,292
I wish to speak on
behalf of the defendant.

492
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:55,418
You have not been recognized.
Sit back and you'll...

493
00:34:55,463 --> 00:34:57,997
These men convinced you
that they speak for you.

494
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,216
- How dare you?
- That the power you've given them

495
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:01,968
is used in your interests.

496
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:04,837
I will not have the order in my
court usurped by your foul desires.

497
00:35:04,923 --> 00:35:08,341
That the prisoner before you is
your enemy and they your friends.

498
00:35:08,426 --> 00:35:10,893
For those of you who
live to see tomorrow...

499
00:35:13,982 --> 00:35:17,767
know that you had a
choice to see the truth

500
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:20,820
and you let yourselves
be convinced otherwise.

501
00:35:20,905 --> 00:35:22,188
That's enough!

502
00:35:22,273 --> 00:35:24,323
Bailiffs, remove him.

503
00:35:25,944 --> 00:35:28,611
I said remove him from the dais.

504
00:35:49,184 --> 00:35:52,435
- Stay down!
- Fire!

505
00:36:19,581 --> 00:36:22,665
Wait! James!

506
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:39,098
Her word will be the
last word for this place.

507
00:36:44,522 --> 00:36:46,072
Move!

508
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:02,872
Give me the names!

509
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,708
What?!

510
00:37:05,794 --> 00:37:08,010
They've engaged the blockade.

511
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:10,713
The patrol ships are scrambling.

512
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:12,598
Weigh the anchor.

513
00:37:12,684 --> 00:37:15,017
I'll take my chances sailing
over taking on those ships.

514
00:37:22,227 --> 00:37:24,610
What?!

515
00:37:24,696 --> 00:37:27,146
I gave you an order.
What is your fucking problem?

516
00:37:27,232 --> 00:37:29,315
The question you should be asking is

517
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,117
where are his keys...

518
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:37,290
and has he seen them since
he took me away from my men?

519
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:04,817
- Get down.
- Stay where you are.

520
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:06,652
Get canvas out quickly.

521
00:38:07,822 --> 00:38:08,905
Set the full sail.

522
00:38:11,492 --> 00:38:12,775
Take him to Howell.

523
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,612
Help me.

524
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:21,751
If those ships flank us,
they'll have us.

525
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:24,203
Then let's make sure they
don't get that chance.

526
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:26,038
Gun crews at the ready.

527
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:28,040
Gun crews at the ready!

528
00:38:30,428 --> 00:38:31,794
Fire at will.

529
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:42,471
Incoming!

530
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:46,193
Ah!

531
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,167
There they are!

532
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:13,219
They're over there!

533
00:39:13,304 --> 00:39:15,221
Ah!

534
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:33,189
- The buildings on the right!
- Every building!

535
00:39:34,776 --> 00:39:36,409
Look down there.

536
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:39,495
Quickly.

537
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,550
- Open the door!
- Set us free!

538
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:04,053
Let's go!

539
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:06,555
There they are!

540
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:10,476
- Move!
- Ah!

541
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:35,968
Come on!

542
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:40,089
Target that launch. Go! Go!

543
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:46,178
Hurry, lads. Hurry.

544
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
- Fire!
- Get them both!

545
00:40:54,355 --> 00:40:55,771
Men!

546
00:40:55,857 --> 00:40:58,107
- Take aim.
- Behind them.

547
00:41:26,471 --> 00:41:28,304
Bring him. Bring him, quickly.

548
00:41:30,808 --> 00:41:32,808
Gently. Gently. Easy.

549
00:41:32,894 --> 00:41:34,215
It'll be all right.

550
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:39,198
That's it. Someone give him some rum.

551
00:41:45,373 --> 00:41:46,956
Come on.

552
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,666
Oh, come on.

553
00:41:57,718 --> 00:42:00,052
I'm sure we've all seen worse.

554
00:42:03,224 --> 00:42:05,391
I'll do what I can.

555
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:09,212
What does that mean?

556
00:42:09,847 --> 00:42:11,680
What does that mean?

557
00:42:14,185 --> 00:42:15,185
God.

558
00:42:23,077 --> 00:42:25,027
A bit of turmoil since you left.

559
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,663
But it's under control now.

560
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:32,751
Release those men.

561
00:42:32,837 --> 00:42:34,286
What?

562
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:36,455
Captain.

563
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:38,924
I know what happened and I don't care.

564
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:41,093
I'll not hold pirates
prisoner on this ship,

565
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:42,461
not after today.

566
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,216
Keep your men in line.

567
00:42:48,603 --> 00:42:50,219
Take us back towards the sandbar.

568
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:51,687
Southwest corner of the bay.

569
00:42:51,722 --> 00:42:54,056
We'll start from there.

570
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:56,559
Ready the guns! Full complement.

571
00:42:58,396 --> 00:43:00,896
What's the target, Captain?

572
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:03,232
Whatever's left.

573
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:07,119
Heave!

574
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:16,579
Would you like me to clear the room?

575
00:43:16,631 --> 00:43:19,165
Why would I want you to clear the room?

576
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,921
When the shock sets in,
you may lose faculties.

577
00:43:25,973 --> 00:43:27,590
Some men lose their bowels.

578
00:43:27,642 --> 00:43:29,508
I can do it with as few
as three or four men.

579
00:43:29,594 --> 00:43:31,677
We're not going anywhere.

580
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:36,815
I don't want this.

581
00:43:36,901 --> 00:43:38,934
If it doesn't come off quickly,
you won't make it three days.

582
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:41,737
Did you not fucking hear me?!
I said I do not want this!

583
00:43:41,772 --> 00:43:44,406
You'll die.

584
00:43:44,442 --> 00:43:46,575
This way, there's a very good chance
to prevent it.

585
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:49,745
The crew will look after you.
Don't worry about that.

586
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,784
Hold him down.

587
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:57,336
It'll be all right, mate. Come on.

588
00:43:57,421 --> 00:43:58,871
Cannonballs!

589
00:44:00,124 --> 00:44:02,458
- Three, six!
- Heave!

590
00:44:02,543 --> 00:44:05,127
- No! No!
- Steady.

591
00:44:06,764 --> 00:44:08,297
No!

592
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:10,132
Why don't you move it?!

593
00:44:16,357 --> 00:44:18,807
- Ready?
- No! No!

594
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:47,089
Where are we?

595
00:46:47,175 --> 00:46:50,226
Just south of Inagua.

596
00:46:50,261 --> 00:46:53,062
Winds blew us east.

597
00:46:53,097 --> 00:46:56,098
We stopped off in Tortuga to refit

598
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:59,435
and garner news,
of which there was plenty.

599
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:05,441
Eleanor Guthrie's been arrested.

600
00:47:07,612 --> 00:47:10,029
Currently on her way back to London

601
00:47:10,114 --> 00:47:13,332
in the custody of Her
Majesty's Navy to stand trial.

602
00:47:15,953 --> 00:47:18,003
For the first time since I've known it,

603
00:47:18,089 --> 00:47:20,539
there is no Guthrie in Nassau.

604
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:26,345
One gets used to a state of
affairs for such a long time,

605
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,181
it's easy to forget that
they're all just transitions.

606
00:47:30,718 --> 00:47:32,801
Specks of dust suspended in the air

607
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:36,105
until a strong enough gust comes
along and rearranges everything.

608
00:47:37,892 --> 00:47:40,142
A strong gust has come to this place.

609
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:42,311
The men can feel it.

610
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:44,813
Know it will upset everything
they thought they understood

611
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:46,815
just a few days ago.

612
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:49,485
They'll need to lean on something solid.

613
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:53,322
On the men who can reassure them

614
00:47:53,407 --> 00:47:55,324
that in times like these,

615
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:57,660
there are some things
that can be counted on.

616
00:47:57,745 --> 00:48:00,546
They'll look to me for that.

617
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,718
But they'll also look to
their new quartermaster.

618
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:11,173
They voted?

619
00:48:11,259 --> 00:48:13,008
A few days ago.

620
00:48:14,395 --> 00:48:16,512
I...

621
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:18,764
I think the men wanted to
tell you when you awoke,

622
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:21,517
so try and act surprised.

623
00:48:25,273 --> 00:48:26,855
It's a funny thing.

624
00:48:26,941 --> 00:48:31,277
The more those men need you,
the more you need them.

625
00:48:31,362 --> 00:48:34,496
And it drives us to do the
most unexpected things.

626
00:48:43,341 --> 00:48:46,675
There's something you ought to
know before we reach Nassau.

627
00:48:50,214 --> 00:48:52,631
About what we'll likely face there.

628
00:48:55,803 --> 00:48:58,437
Before my misfortune

629
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:01,106
at the hands of Vane's lieutenant,

630
00:49:01,192 --> 00:49:04,526
our friend, the scout you sent
to oversee the Urca beach,

631
00:49:04,562 --> 00:49:06,111
confessed something to me.

632
00:49:06,197 --> 00:49:09,064
He told me that the news he brought us

633
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:11,567
about the gold having been recovered...

634
00:49:12,653 --> 00:49:14,069
was a lie.

635
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:18,540
A falsehood he perpetuated himself

636
00:49:18,576 --> 00:49:21,493
so that he could sell the
gold's location to another crew

637
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:24,413
in exchange for a larger
share of the prize.

638
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:29,301
He told you this?

639
00:49:37,595 --> 00:49:40,179
I'm sorry, I'm...

640
00:49:40,264 --> 00:49:42,348
I'm having a hard time...

641
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:49,822
He lied to us all?

642
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:54,610
And then he sold the
information to another crew

643
00:49:54,695 --> 00:49:57,279
so that they could retrieve the gold?

644
00:49:58,616 --> 00:50:00,249
Yes.

645
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:05,003
Who the fuck did he sell it to?

646
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:37,119
Where have you been?
What took you so long?

647
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,125
The information we were given was...

648
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,377
incomplete at best.

649
00:50:45,463 --> 00:50:48,497
There were still healthy
Spanish soldiers on that beach

650
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:50,082
and they fought...

651
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:51,417
like hell.

652
00:50:57,174 --> 00:50:58,924
Is that the Walrus?

653
00:50:59,009 --> 00:51:01,093
It is. We found her there.

654
00:51:01,178 --> 00:51:03,846
Needed to get her seaworthy
before we could depart.

655
00:51:03,931 --> 00:51:07,015
You needed to?
Why would you need a second ship?

656
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,818
We needed the hold space.

657
00:51:12,189 --> 00:51:14,857
Would you like to see something shiny?
