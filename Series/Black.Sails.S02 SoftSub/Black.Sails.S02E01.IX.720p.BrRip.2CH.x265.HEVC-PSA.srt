1
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:13,475
Is this english soil?

2
00:00:13,477 --> 00:00:15,410
It was once.

3
00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:17,279
Now it ain't.

4
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:20,215
- Whose is it?
- Ours!

5
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:22,884
When the king
brands us pirates,

6
00:00:22,886 --> 00:00:24,553
He means
to make us monsters,

7
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:26,555
For that's the only way
his god-fearing,

8
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:28,857
Tax-paying subjects
can make sense of men

9
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,426
Who keep what is theirs
and fear no one.

10
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:32,995
I'm not just going to
make you rich.

11
00:00:32,997 --> 00:00:34,796
I'm not just going to
make your strong.

12
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:37,766
I'm going to make you
the princes of the new world!

13
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:41,503
Urca de Lima,

14
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:44,740
The largest spanish treasure
galleon in the americas.

15
00:00:44,742 --> 00:00:49,111
Total cargo of 5 million
Spanish dollars.

16
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:50,579
A page was torn
from the log

17
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,914
With the Urca's course
and schedule.

18
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,916
- Where's the page?
- You're looking at it.

19
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:58,320
I took drastic measures.
Your schedule is up here.

20
00:00:58,322 --> 00:01:01,923
Our mutual friend
tried to protect you.

21
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:03,392
You left anyway. Why?

22
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:06,128
How did you feel
when she threw you aside?

23
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,730
Eleanor, wait.

24
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:12,467
I'm so sorry
he did this to you.

25
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:15,837
He didn't do this to me.
You did.

26
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:20,208
You betrayed your brothers
for a woman,

27
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,810
So the street
will know what you did,

28
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:23,845
And you'll never sail
beneath the black again.

29
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:26,114
Thank you for what
you did for me.

30
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:28,316
I didn't do it for you.

31
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:33,021
My husband and I
were happy.

32
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:35,557
Captain Flint was Thomas'
closest friend.

33
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:37,626
And after his death,
he saw fit

34
00:01:37,628 --> 00:01:40,729
To spirit me here
for my own safety.

35
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:43,632
Thomas' wife had begun
a torrid affair

36
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:45,267
With her husband's
closest friend.

37
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:47,269
And upon discovering
the affair,

38
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:48,637
Thomas went mad with grief.

39
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:50,205
Given the facts at hand,

40
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:54,443
The lover is none other
than our friend Captain Flint.

41
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:55,644
Found it in
Bryce's cabinets.

42
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:57,179
It's from
the Barlow woman.

43
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:58,480
There was a pardon
for Flint in Boston.

44
00:01:58,482 --> 00:01:59,748
She says we're
going to kill him

45
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,716
When we learn
of his betrayal.

46
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:03,552
Earlier when you and Mr. Gates
were having words,

47
00:02:03,554 --> 00:02:04,986
You mentioned a letter!

48
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:06,054
What was in it, Billy?

49
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:08,023
I think you know
what was in it!

50
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:13,028
- To starboard!
- Man overboard!

51
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,365
- It's Billy! He fell!
- We can't turn back.

52
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:21,403
We're going to recreate
my father's system here

53
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:22,804
Without my father.

54
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:25,273
A consortium with all of you
sharing in the profits.

55
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:26,808
There is a place
not far from here

56
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,879
Where you could be feared
and respected once again.

57
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:32,914
I went out there, surprised
Captain Hornigold's men.

58
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,517
We took his fort.
Fort controls the bay.

59
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,952
The bay controls the commerce.

60
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:39,387
I control the fort,
so I will be your partner.

61
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,422
You lied to them!

62
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:42,324
If no one knows,
everyone wins.

63
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:43,892
I believe in this place.

64
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,627
If there's anyone
who can do what's necessary

65
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:47,796
To make it something better,
it's you.

66
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:50,232
- Sails!
- Is it the Urca?

67
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:53,735
- She's a man o' war!
- Spanish banners!

68
00:02:53,737 --> 00:02:55,971
That ship is an escort.
It's the only explanation.

69
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:58,006
I'm taking the ranger
and I'm leaving.

70
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:10,452
I think it will be awhile
before she sails again.

71
00:03:10,454 --> 00:03:12,454
In the meantime,
you and I have been charged

72
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:14,356
With provoking
this whole mess.

73
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:16,691
Told you I was certain about my
information regarding the Urca.

74
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:19,094
Unfortunately, you and I failed
to take into account the weather.

75
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:21,396
The Urca de Lima
wrecked at sea last night,

76
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:23,832
Dashed by the storm.

77
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,906
Are you certain this is wise, sir?

78
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,795
Stories I hear about the
raiders in these waters,

79
00:04:51,797 --> 00:04:53,463
their brutality...

80
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:56,249
Cui bono, Mr. Fogg.

81
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:58,251
These men profit nothing from blood.

82
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:00,754
They profit from cargo.
And they profit most

83
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:03,473
when that cargo is
least costly to win.

84
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:06,259
Those stories you've heard...

85
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:07,978
tools of the trade,

86
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,480
self-applied
by the pirates themselves,

87
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:13,150
intended to separate us
from our cargo

88
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:15,318
by surrender rather than sword.

89
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,822
These are men, Mr. Fogg,
not monsters.

90
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:24,528
If we behave rationally and civilly,

91
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,279
so will they.

92
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:48,468
Down to the well, move!

93
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,886
The ship is yours, sir.

94
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:52,138
Our manifest.

95
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,974
Everything that would be
of value to you

96
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:56,276
is accounted for, and its
location in the hold.

97
00:05:57,863 --> 00:06:00,363
Eight barrels, marked "JP,"

98
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:03,283
forward hold, port side.
Mr. Neustadt, step to it.

99
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:05,318
Pardon me, Captain.
May I ask,

100
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,205
are you one of the pirates that
calls the port of Nassau home?

101
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:09,906
Three barrels, tea...

102
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:12,075
I'm a recent arrival to Nassau.

103
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:16,329
I only ask inasmuch as it's become
something of a fascination of mine.

104
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:18,381
They say the reality of the place

105
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:20,333
is far more interesting
than the myth.

106
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:23,503
The business there is so
efficient, so enlightened,

107
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:27,257
that all trade is managed
by a teenaged girl.

108
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,142
Tell me, is that true?

109
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:35,815
What is it?

110
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:41,021
Ashe.

111
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:43,323
As in Lord Ashe.

112
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,363
Then let's get on with it.

113
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:01,291
Everyone up!

114
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:17,891
Oh, no, please.

115
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:26,399
Go ahead!

116
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:36,242
Mercy! Merc...

117
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:44,834
I'd like to thank you for the
orderly surrender of your ship.

118
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:47,804
It's truly amazing to me how
many men in your position

119
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:49,306
lack the sense to do the same.

120
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:53,393
Ordinarily I would
return the courtesy,

121
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:56,980
relieve you of your cargo
and be on my way.

122
00:07:56,982 --> 00:07:58,815
But your ship is about
to yield a prize

123
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:02,402
of far, far greater value
than our wildest expectation,

124
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:05,355
a far greater prize

125
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:09,075
for which I'd rather not
leave witnesses to the taking.

126
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:11,745
Please, please, sir.
I have a wife and a son.

127
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,050
Hell of a prize, Mr. Meeks.

128
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:36,970
Hell of a prize.

129
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:54,023
Captain.

130
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:03,833
Captain.

131
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:13,126
Captain, before we're seen...

132
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:16,930
Don't call him that.

133
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:20,850
Well?

134
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:24,354
Well what?

135
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:28,391
The crimes you've committed
against your crew are undisputed.

136
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:31,311
The only reason the sentence
hasn't been carried out

137
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:33,646
is that I've been delaying the vote

138
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:36,950
in hopes that you might help me
find a way to get that gold,

139
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:40,069
or as much of it as
possible, off that beach.

140
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:43,873
Why would I do that?

141
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,375
Because if you do,

142
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:48,828
I'll personally guarantee
your sentences are commuted.

143
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:53,082
You'll guarantee that, will you?

144
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:56,002
You underestimate
your men yet again.

145
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:57,921
They will hear reason,

146
00:11:57,923 --> 00:12:01,007
especially when it comes
from a voice they can trust.

147
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:05,094
The men feel they're entitled
to leave this ordeal

148
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:07,263
- with something to show for...
- Fuck those men.

149
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:12,235
Fuck them for their shortsightedness.

150
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:14,487
Fuck them for their ingratitude.

151
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:17,407
And fuck them for siding
with a cowardly,

152
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:19,943
sniveling shit of a mutineer.

153
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:23,246
There are over 100
soldiers on that beach,

154
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:26,249
sworn upon their lives
to protect that gold.

155
00:12:26,251 --> 00:12:28,418
In a matter of hours,

156
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,870
they'll dispatch teams
to search for threats.

157
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:32,755
In a matter of days,

158
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:36,042
they'll locate our wreck
and our camp,

159
00:12:36,044 --> 00:12:41,014
and they will kill every
last member of your crew.

160
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:44,100
And they'll deserve it,

161
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:46,219
none more so than you.

162
00:12:52,894 --> 00:12:55,895
Bring them back.

163
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:58,231
We'll ready the nooses.

164
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,746
Wait.

165
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:23,089
The Urca's gold is secure.

166
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:25,058
A full complement of soldiers,

167
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,978
reinforced batteries...
18-pounders, all of them...

168
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,930
and men who know how to use them.

169
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:34,267
There's no way of approaching
that beach from the land.

170
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:36,152
Why the fuck are we
listening to him?

171
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:37,570
Yeah, why?

172
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:39,405
We should be cutting
your goddamn tongue out

173
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:41,274
for all the lies you've told us.

174
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:43,159
Gentlemen!

175
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:46,279
No one is angrier about
Mr. Flint's crimes than I.

176
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,997
Which is why you must trust me

177
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,283
when I ask you to hear
what he has to say.

178
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:55,455
And even if it weren't
for the soldiers,

179
00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:58,007
even if it weren't for the guns,

180
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:01,377
there's a fucking warship watching
over every inch of the bay...

181
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:05,431
a fucking warship that has
already killed half your number,

182
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:08,468
a fucking warship that
would prevent any approach

183
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,270
to that beach via the sea.

184
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:14,474
There's simply no way
of stealing that gold.

185
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:19,862
But there might be something
else you can steal.

186
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:24,317
The fucking warship.

187
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:28,321
What?

188
00:14:30,492 --> 00:14:33,409
Too many soldiers
on the beach, which means

189
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:36,212
that the watch on the ship is spare.

190
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:39,132
Two men approach quietly,

191
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:41,384
evade a handful of sentries

192
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:44,337
and eliminate the watch
on the mainmast.

193
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,055
Now at this point,

194
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:48,307
while the sun is failing

195
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:50,309
but before the night watch arrives,

196
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:52,478
an assault could be made.

197
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:56,816
That ship

198
00:14:56,818 --> 00:14:59,018
is your only means of escape.

199
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,521
And that ship is your only means

200
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:03,906
of taking anything of value

201
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:06,192
out of this ordeal.

202
00:15:06,194 --> 00:15:08,327
And once it is in your possession...

203
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:10,196
- Enough of this.
- Once that ship is in your possession...

204
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:12,198
- Do none of you remember his crimes?
- Mr. De Groot!

205
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,284
Once that ship is in your
possession, you will be invincible!

206
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,214
Now the risk

207
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:31,184
falls almost entirely
on the first two men out.

208
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:35,054
I would volunteer

209
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:37,023
in exchange for your pardon.

210
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,359
That leaves one man to go.

211
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:45,948
One volunteer...

212
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,283
I'll do it.

213
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:54,207
I'll... I'll go.

214
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:04,083
Then let's put
Mr. Flint's plan to a vote.

215
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:05,468
All in favor?

216
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:13,476
Aye! Aye! Aye!

217
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:17,096
The ayes have it.

218
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:21,318
__

219
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:27,656
Whoa.

220
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:43,255
Lord Thomas Hamilton?

221
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:45,807
Ah.

222
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:47,809
Are you the liaison
sent by the Admiralty?

223
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:51,013
I am, my lord.

224
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:54,266
They say it started with
a man named Henry Avery.

225
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:57,269
Sailed into the port of Nassau,

226
00:16:57,271 --> 00:17:00,105
bribed the colonial governor
to look past his sins,

227
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,240
encamped his crew upon the beach,

228
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:05,744
and thus began the pirate issue
on New Providence Island.

229
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:08,580
Where and when will it all end?

230
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:11,616
I suppose that's where you
and I come into the story.

231
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:14,252
As I'm sure you're aware, my
father the earl holds great sway

232
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:15,954
amongst his peers in Whitehall.

233
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:18,790
He has asked for the assistance
of Her Majesty's Navy

234
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,793
in pacifying the island
to which he holds title.

235
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:23,762
He was assured that this
request would be considered

236
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:26,348
- a matter of the utmost importance.
- Undoubtedly, my lord.

237
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,302
Then perhaps you can tell me
why they decided to send you.

238
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:31,937
Beg pardon, my lord?

239
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,975
A number of your superiors are
former schoolmates of mine.

240
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:39,945
I canvassed them
about your reputation...

241
00:17:39,947 --> 00:17:42,064
the son of a carpenter,

242
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:43,815
no record of any formal schooling,

243
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:48,203
and yet more literate than any
three boys I knew at Eton.

244
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:50,489
You are a rising star

245
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:52,708
with a bright future
in the Admiralty.

246
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,209
You can understand my concern.

247
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,211
Not really.

248
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:57,996
Perhaps my lack of
education is showing.

249
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:03,668
I intend to accomplish
something here, Lieutenant.

250
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,506
I intend to save Nassau
before she's lost forever.

251
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:09,508
And I cannot do that with a partner

252
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,560
who might be more concerned
about advancing his career

253
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:14,179
than he is about realizing this goal.

254
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:21,236
- You want to save Nassau, my lord?
- Very much so.

255
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:25,023
Then perhaps my job is to make certain
you know what you're getting into.

256
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:12,204
You can go in now.

257
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:33,008
I'll go get us some rum.

258
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:37,929
Where the fuck were you today?

259
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:40,982
Here.

260
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:43,235
You wanted to be a partner to
the consortium, did you not?

261
00:19:43,237 --> 00:19:45,570
You wanted to take Hornigold's
seat at the table?

262
00:19:45,572 --> 00:19:47,906
Then that means you assume
Hornigold's responsibilities,

263
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:50,158
first among them... turning
up for the fucking meetings.

264
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,777
Is this really what
you came up here for...

265
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:54,996
scold me for truancy?

266
00:19:54,998 --> 00:19:56,865
This morning somebody
killed two watchmen

267
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:59,918
and stole 500 pounds' worth
of cargo from the warehouse.

268
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,203
Sorry to hear that.

269
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:03,505
Don't be sorry.
Do your fucking job.

270
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:05,924
And what job is that exactly?

271
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:08,960
Hornigold provided security for
the consortium's operations.

272
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:12,597
And you'd like me to fill
that role for you now?

273
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:15,433
If your friends aren't capable
of protecting themselves,

274
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:18,203
then I argue they aren't
worth protecting.

275
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:20,205
What the fuck
are you talking about?

276
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:22,708
You were the one who decided you
wanted to be a part of this.

277
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,543
To protect the bay.

278
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:26,595
But to play the role of constable

279
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:30,549
for the benefit of Captains
Naft and Lawrence?

280
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:32,968
Your problem isn't with me.

281
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,055
Your problem... you need
stronger partners.

282
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:38,223
I had stronger partners, you shit.

283
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:40,025
What are you doing
down there, Eleanor?

284
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:42,561
Corporate charters?
Mandatory meetings?

285
00:20:42,563 --> 00:20:44,029
The woman who stole ship and
crew out from underneath me

286
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:46,198
has no appetite for any of that.

287
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,117
I think that's why you're
so frustrated with me...

288
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,536
because you know all this,
because you know I know this,

289
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:53,072
and because you know
you are so much more like me

290
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:54,901
than anyone you've ever met
in your entire life.

291
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:57,710
Jesus Christ, enough. Stop telling me
what it is you think I think.

292
00:20:57,712 --> 00:21:00,079
You sound fucking ridiculous.

293
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:02,081
Do you know what it is I want?

294
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,583
I want to figure out a way of
selling everyone's shit here

295
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:06,802
for more tomorrow
than I did yesterday.

296
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:09,588
I want to establish a future here
that isn't measured in months.

297
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,559
And I want you to show up for a
meeting when you're fucking told.

298
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:15,761
- Can't leave yet.
- Watch me.

299
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:17,896
You haven't asked me
the question yet.

300
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:20,265
You haven't asked me if
I'm gonna let him in...

301
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:22,768
Flint.

302
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,739
Am I going to permit him to enter
the bay with his Spanish treasure?

303
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:29,775
Assuming, that is,
he returns with it at all.

304
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,917
Be very careful, Charles,

305
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,253
because at a certain point

306
00:21:41,255 --> 00:21:44,206
I will remove you from this place,
no matter what the consequences.

307
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,842
You'd do that? For him?

308
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,047
How is it you see such a partner
in him and such a villain in me?

309
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,549
He wants what I want.

310
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:55,601
Are you quite certain about that?

311
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:58,270
Let's put it to a test.

312
00:21:58,272 --> 00:22:01,140
Let's say I do separate
Flint from his gold

313
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:02,608
when he returns.

314
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,228
And let's say you and I split it.

315
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:09,064
What?

316
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,533
Mm, see?

317
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:13,485
Not so easy.

318
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:15,988
Think about it... I kill Flint,

319
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,207
give you half a fortune,
and then no more Naft,

320
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:20,209
no more Lawrence,
no more compromises.

321
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:22,578
You could do whatever you like.

322
00:22:23,881 --> 00:22:25,964
We could do whatever we like.

323
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:29,885
How important is Flint to you now?

324
00:22:33,174 --> 00:22:35,591
Fuck you.

325
00:22:35,593 --> 00:22:37,559
Fuck you, too.

326
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:47,569
Once the mainmast watch
has been eliminated,

327
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:49,104
hoist your signal.

328
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:51,073
If there is no signal
before the reinforcements

329
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:52,858
for the night's watch
depart the beach,

330
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,195
I'll assume failure and begin
our escape down the coast.

331
00:22:57,865 --> 00:22:59,581
What if the signal is in time?

332
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,834
Then we'll launch our assault.

333
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:07,589
There is something about which
I want to be very clear...

334
00:23:07,591 --> 00:23:09,541
even in success

335
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:12,544
you will be expelled from the crew,

336
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:14,012
cast out.

337
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:18,967
Are we understood?

338
00:23:43,627 --> 00:23:44,743
You shit.

339
00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:48,213
Um, beg pardon?

340
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:50,966
I needed a fighter,

341
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:54,753
someone I could count on to
make a difference on that ship.

342
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:56,755
What the fuck were you doing
volunteering?

343
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,342
I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.

344
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:03,312
Why wouldn't I volunteer?
If we're to try and...

345
00:24:04,732 --> 00:24:07,099
Hang on.

346
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,268
You're serious
about taking the ship?

347
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,903
What the fuck did you think?

348
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:12,688
I thought this was how
you intended to escape.

349
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:17,609
Sure, it would be a few days of
walking or so to St. Augustine,

350
00:24:17,611 --> 00:24:19,278
but at least we'd have a chance.

351
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:24,783
You really mean to board that ship.
Jesus Christ.

352
00:24:24,785 --> 00:24:26,952
I'm not doing it.

353
00:24:26,954 --> 00:24:28,620
I don't need to return to Nassau.

354
00:24:28,622 --> 00:24:31,623
I am happy to find some
other place to survive.

355
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,926
St. Augustine is that way.

356
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:39,681
It's at least a week on foot,

357
00:24:39,683 --> 00:24:43,018
Tequesta tribes in between.

358
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,637
I doubt you'll survive
to see sunrise tomorrow.

359
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:49,858
How are you even gonna get
out there with one arm?

360
00:25:26,096 --> 00:25:29,565
What is this exercise
intended to prove, Lieutenant?

361
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:31,850
You want to understand
why piracy flourishes

362
00:25:31,852 --> 00:25:33,268
in the West Indies.

363
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,571
I'm about to show you.

364
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:37,856
Have you seen one of these before?

365
00:25:37,858 --> 00:25:39,358
I'm afraid I haven't, no.

366
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,943
Who is he?

367
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:42,578
Davey someone-or-other.

368
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,280
High seas piracy, treason,
so on and so forth,

369
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:47,282
same as the last, same as the next.

370
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,835
He's being asked
if he wants to confess,

371
00:25:49,837 --> 00:25:53,171
beg forgiveness in the eyes
of God and Queen Anne.

372
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:56,124
Suck my cock!

373
00:25:56,126 --> 00:25:57,593
I assume that was a "no."

374
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:01,546
So this is the lesson...

375
00:26:01,548 --> 00:26:04,216
the pirates of New Providence Island

376
00:26:04,218 --> 00:26:06,551
are incorrigible,
dedicated to mayhem.

377
00:26:06,553 --> 00:26:09,888
To attempt to address this subject
is doomed to defeat from the outset.

378
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,224
It's not him I wanted you to see.

379
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:16,778
No mercy!

380
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:21,700
Go all the way to hell!

381
00:26:21,702 --> 00:26:23,619
It's them.

382
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:27,706
Civilization needs its monsters.

383
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:30,292
You think Whitehall wants piracy
to flourish in the Bahamas?

384
00:26:30,294 --> 00:26:32,544
No, I don't think they want
it, but I think they're aware

385
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:35,247
of the cost associated
with trying to fight it.

386
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:37,666
And I think that that sound

387
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:40,636
travels.

388
00:26:40,638 --> 00:26:43,672
You're an educated man, my lord,
but I think it worth reminding you

389
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:46,341
that in most cases a man trying
to change the world fails

390
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:49,761
for one simple
and unavoidable reason...

391
00:26:49,763 --> 00:26:51,263
everyone else.

392
00:27:28,217 --> 00:27:30,301
Do as I say when I say,

393
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:32,553
or I'll kill you myself.

394
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:10,674
Well, that was easy.

395
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,123
Hurry up!

396
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,542
I will fucking kill you.
Shut up.

397
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:51,715
For crying out loud!

398
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,137
10 minutes I've been waiting.

399
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:58,189
A moment's peace, my friend.

400
00:28:58,191 --> 00:29:00,558
Surely you can empathize.

401
00:29:07,116 --> 00:29:09,617
Jack Rackham.

402
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:13,237
The crew killer.

403
00:29:32,592 --> 00:29:36,093
That's right.

404
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:02,036
Jesus.

405
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:03,787
What happened?

406
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:05,623
Same as yesterday,

407
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,708
though it would appear
things have escalated.

408
00:30:09,629 --> 00:30:12,380
When I came here, I had nothing

409
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:14,599
but my name and my wits.

410
00:30:14,601 --> 00:30:16,601
A man in a place like this

411
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:19,303
surviving on those
two things alone...

412
00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:21,305
he suffers indignities,

413
00:30:21,307 --> 00:30:24,308
slights, ridicule.

414
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,227
But I overcame it.

415
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:28,279
I used the wits to build the name.

416
00:30:28,281 --> 00:30:31,733
I became quartermaster to a crew

417
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:33,651
that struck fear into the hearts

418
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:36,738
of many, many men.

419
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,823
Jesus Christ,

420
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:40,992
what's become of my name?

421
00:30:45,382 --> 00:30:47,415
They pissed on me.

422
00:30:50,387 --> 00:30:52,220
Tell me who did this.

423
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:56,841
So you can murder them all?

424
00:30:56,843 --> 00:30:58,843
What a wonderful idea.
Why didn't I think of that?

425
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:00,762
Tell me, though,
how many men do you think

426
00:31:00,764 --> 00:31:03,681
you can safely lure into the
wrecks to their deaths?

427
00:31:03,683 --> 00:31:05,850
Unfortunately, I'm afraid
eight won't cut it,

428
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:09,153
as I am pariah to just about
every able-bodied man

429
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:11,856
on this fucking island!

430
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:20,364
They pissed on me.

431
00:31:42,772 --> 00:31:45,723
I will send someone
upstairs to tend to him.

432
00:31:45,725 --> 00:31:47,892
He is angry, but this will pass.

433
00:31:47,894 --> 00:31:49,861
Stay the fuck away from me.

434
00:33:20,987 --> 00:33:23,237
- Wait.
- You almost got us killed.

435
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:26,407
- Almost. Almost.
- For a fucking bauble.

436
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:27,992
It's a boatswain's whistle.

437
00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:30,161
Look.

438
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:32,496
Doesn't it make more sense for us
to prompt the lookout to come down,

439
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:36,083
than for us to go
up there after him?

440
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:38,169
You are truly amazing,
you know that?

441
00:33:38,171 --> 00:33:40,888
We're both better off now
than we were two minutes ago,

442
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,841
yet you're angry about it because
it didn't happen your way.

443
00:33:43,843 --> 00:33:46,260
Might you consider
for a fucking moment

444
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:49,480
that your distrust of me
is completely unwarranted?

445
00:33:49,482 --> 00:33:52,433
I warned you about Billy.
Was I right?

446
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:54,402
I found you over Mr. Gates's body,

447
00:33:54,404 --> 00:33:57,321
and did I do anything
but defend you?

448
00:33:57,323 --> 00:33:59,941
When you were sinking
to the bottom of the sea,

449
00:33:59,943 --> 00:34:02,443
who do you imagine it was who
dragged you onto that beach?

450
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,830
Brace yourself,

451
00:34:05,832 --> 00:34:08,866
but I'm the only person within
a hundred miles of here

452
00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:11,348
who doesn't want to see you dead.

453
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:16,961
But this is the rate I can
offer you for this material.

454
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:19,547
If it's unsatisfactory,
feel free to go elsewhere.

455
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:23,334
This is absurd. There's absolutely
nothing wrong with the cargo itself.

456
00:36:23,336 --> 00:36:25,052
What's going on here?

457
00:36:25,054 --> 00:36:28,172
Ma'am, these goods were
presented for consignment,

458
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:30,508
but your man here refuses
to pay full freight for it,

459
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,176
owing to the condition
of the barrels they're in.

460
00:36:32,178 --> 00:36:34,061
Put up a fight, did they?

461
00:36:34,063 --> 00:36:37,014
Once we were on board, the crew
turned, gave us no choice.

462
00:36:37,016 --> 00:36:38,816
There was no malice in it.

463
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:40,351
Mister...

464
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:42,520
Meeks, ma'am. Quartermaster
of the Fancy.

465
00:36:42,522 --> 00:36:46,073
Mr. Meeks, do you have
any idea what happens

466
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:49,076
when a marginally reputable cargo
ship enters a civilized port

467
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:52,530
and attempts to unload 50 barrels
full of cargo covered in blood?

468
00:36:52,532 --> 00:36:54,832
This material all must be unboxed

469
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:58,869
and reboxed into clean containers before
I can even think about shipping it out.

470
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:01,839
Between you and I, which of us
should bear the cost of that?

471
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:06,460
Whatever happened on that ship,
it was a costly fuck-up.

472
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:09,046
But it wasn't my fuck-up, and
I'm not about to pay for it.

473
00:37:09,048 --> 00:37:12,800
Ma'am, I must beg your understanding.

474
00:37:12,802 --> 00:37:15,052
My crew is new to this place.

475
00:37:15,054 --> 00:37:17,438
Going forward, we'll certainly
keep this issue in mind.

476
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,890
Mr. Meeks, who is
the captain of the Fancy?

477
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:21,809
Ned Low.

478
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:25,062
Please relay to Captain Low

479
00:37:25,064 --> 00:37:27,448
that it is his responsibility
to manage the taking of prizes

480
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,567
to avoid situations like
this in the future.

481
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:31,902
If there are any savings in
the repacking of these goods,

482
00:37:31,904 --> 00:37:33,404
I'll be sure to pass them on to you.

483
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:35,206
Good afternoon.

484
00:37:47,753 --> 00:37:49,336
Madam Guthrie.

485
00:37:50,756 --> 00:37:52,089
You wished to speak with me?

486
00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:54,809
Sit.

487
00:38:04,437 --> 00:38:06,770
Do you know Captain Hallendale
of the Straight Arrow?

488
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:08,439
Yes.

489
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:10,691
Not terribly strong or daring,

490
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:13,077
but knows how to manage a
prize, reliable in that way.

491
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,079
Sorry, what has this
got to do with me?

492
00:38:15,081 --> 00:38:16,697
The Good Fortune
was captured yesterday

493
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:19,116
but by a different captain
who found her first,

494
00:38:19,118 --> 00:38:21,452
beat Hallendale to her,

495
00:38:21,454 --> 00:38:23,754
and then, instead of
managing her surrender,

496
00:38:23,756 --> 00:38:26,457
he put her entire crew
to the sword.

497
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:27,958
I give Hallendale a lead.

498
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,878
Hallendale spends all his time in here.

499
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,881
And somehow that lead ends up in
the hands of a fucking maniac.

500
00:38:33,883 --> 00:38:36,100
Madam Guthrie,
isn't it just as possible

501
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:38,302
this is a rather unfortunate but not
at all implausible coincidence?

502
00:38:38,304 --> 00:38:39,803
I sold it.

503
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,858
To Captain Low.
He paid 90 pieces for it.

504
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,812
- Why would you do...?
- Why wouldn't I?

505
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:54,318
Valuable information walks in the
door, I should let it walk out?

506
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,655
Why? Because it bothers you?

507
00:39:03,462 --> 00:39:05,796
Stay out of my fucking business.

508
00:39:05,798 --> 00:39:08,716
Consider this the only warning
you're ever gonna get.

509
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:14,805
- You fucking ingrate.
- Now that's not helpful.

510
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:16,924
You mewed and whimpered
in that fucking tent

511
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:18,842
till you had me all turned around.

512
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:21,762
Got me thinking you were some
helpless thing they was beatin' on.

513
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:23,814
I get you out, and you pull this shit.

514
00:39:23,816 --> 00:39:26,767
- Starting shit without telling us.
- Let me explain.

515
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:29,403
- Don't you fucking talk back to me.
- All right.

516
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:32,106
Either she's on her back,
or she's out on the streets.

517
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:34,775
But if it ain't one of
the two come tomorrow,

518
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:36,827
I'm gonna deal with it my way.

519
00:39:47,707 --> 00:39:51,292
I will be very honest with you.

520
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:54,261
I could torture the two of you
to find out who you are,

521
00:39:54,263 --> 00:39:55,930
how many more of you there are

522
00:39:55,932 --> 00:39:57,932
and what you're hoping
to accomplish here.

523
00:39:57,934 --> 00:40:01,719
I could find it out
and you would both suffer.

524
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:06,023
But today is your lucky day,
at least for one of you.

525
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:07,891
My commander arrives

526
00:40:07,893 --> 00:40:10,027
to relieve the watch
in less than an hour.

527
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:12,730
I need this matter
resolved before then.

528
00:40:12,732 --> 00:40:15,482
So neither of you will
be here when he arrives.

529
00:40:15,484 --> 00:40:18,068
One of you will tell me
what I want to know,

530
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,486
receive this gold as reward,

531
00:40:19,488 --> 00:40:21,455
be escorted to the beach
for your escape.

532
00:40:21,457 --> 00:40:22,957
And the other will be quite dead.

533
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,908
My name is John Silver.
His name is James Flint.

534
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,211
We came here to steal the gold
from the treasure galleon,

535
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:30,080
but he was deposed from his
captaincy by a man named Dufresne,

536
00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:32,166
who is now waiting with the
rest of our crew in longboats.

537
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:34,084
You'll likely find them behind
the promontory to the south.

538
00:40:34,086 --> 00:40:36,920
I believe there are 32 of them.

539
00:40:36,922 --> 00:40:38,422
You fucking...!

540
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:48,232
Suéltalo.

541
00:40:59,745 --> 00:41:00,778
Sorry.

542
00:41:15,795 --> 00:41:17,795
Huh-uh.

543
00:41:22,468 --> 00:41:24,218
Shoot this one.

544
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,636
He'll get to the pistol.

545
00:41:25,638 --> 00:41:27,631
This one has more scars...
more fights.

546
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:29,227
You've got a better chance
against this one.

547
00:41:29,228 --> 00:41:31,890
- Not if he shoots me first.
- Then beat him to it. Do it, quickly.

548
00:41:31,895 --> 00:41:33,694
So I actually have to fight him?

549
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,863
Well, what the fuck did you
think was gonna happen?

550
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:38,232
Do it! Do it!

551
00:42:24,614 --> 00:42:26,581
Bolt the door.

552
00:42:33,706 --> 00:42:37,792
Busquen algo para derrimbar
la puerta, apúrense!

553
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:39,260
Table.

554
00:42:46,853 --> 00:42:48,803
So what now?

555
00:42:48,805 --> 00:42:51,272
They'll have to converge through
the door, roughly a dozen of them,

556
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:53,391
and three pistols at our disposal.

557
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:55,226
And then what?

558
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,557
Hold your fire.

559
00:43:43,276 --> 00:43:45,359
Mr. Logan, weigh the anchor!

560
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:48,529
We must get underway before they
loose those cannons on the beach.

561
00:43:48,531 --> 00:43:52,283
Up the braces! Up the braces!
Unfold the canvas!

562
00:43:53,953 --> 00:43:55,870
Come on!

563
00:44:04,547 --> 00:44:07,965
- Return fire!
- Return fire!

564
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:17,358
Cannons are loaded!

565
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,644
Get us underway! Get us underway!

566
00:44:25,535 --> 00:44:27,485
Prepare to take fire!

567
00:44:32,325 --> 00:44:33,624
Incoming!

568
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:08,859
...the fucking island.

569
00:45:08,861 --> 00:45:12,279
...that Guthrie cunt...

570
00:45:12,281 --> 00:45:13,781
Now get the fuck out.

571
00:45:13,783 --> 00:45:16,367
All right. Fuck!

572
00:45:27,046 --> 00:45:30,047
You have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

573
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:32,716
Though I would recommend
avoiding her for a while.

574
00:45:54,407 --> 00:45:55,990
Get the fuck out.

575
00:46:07,553 --> 00:46:11,338
If we are all going to make
something of this place,

576
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,341
perhaps it is in
everyone's best interest

577
00:46:14,343 --> 00:46:17,728
that you and I find a way
past all of this,

578
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,763
past your anger towards me.

579
00:46:19,765 --> 00:46:22,399
I'm not gonna warn you again.

580
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:27,688
Your anger... it is understandable.

581
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,824
You killed your own crew
to free me.

582
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:33,744
You suffered indignity
in my defense.

583
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:36,664
Perhaps that is enough
to warrant your feelings.

584
00:46:40,419 --> 00:46:43,671
But perhaps there is something
else underlying it,

585
00:46:43,673 --> 00:46:47,341
something hiding in a place
not even you can see.

586
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:52,429
Perhaps...

587
00:46:52,431 --> 00:46:55,299
we would do well to...

588
00:46:55,301 --> 00:46:57,268
bring it into the light.

589
00:46:59,243 --> 00:47:00,804
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

590
00:47:00,806 --> 00:47:03,224
Huh?

591
00:47:38,311 --> 00:47:39,843
Ma'am.

592
00:47:43,482 --> 00:47:45,182
May I buy that for you, miss?

593
00:47:45,184 --> 00:47:48,519
My bar. Thank you anyway.

594
00:47:49,855 --> 00:47:52,239
I confess,

595
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:54,358
I knew it was your bar.

596
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,827
Just a gesture for a pretty lady.

597
00:47:56,829 --> 00:47:58,612
You must be new here.

598
00:47:58,614 --> 00:48:00,247
I am, in fact. How could you tell?

599
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:03,918
I don't fuck customers.

600
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,921
Everybody here knows it.
Now you do, too.

601
00:48:06,923 --> 00:48:08,923
A sound rule.

602
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:11,759
Unfortunate for me,
but sound nonetheless.

603
00:48:11,761 --> 00:48:14,878
Still, it is unthinkable to me

604
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,215
that someone this beautiful is
forced to spend her nights alone.

605
00:48:18,217 --> 00:48:20,384
What's your name?

606
00:48:20,386 --> 00:48:21,435
Ned Low.

607
00:48:23,222 --> 00:48:25,556
You met my quartermaster
Meeks this morning.

608
00:48:25,558 --> 00:48:27,474
From what I understand,
we were shortchanged

609
00:48:27,476 --> 00:48:29,226
a fair amount on a prize haul

610
00:48:29,228 --> 00:48:31,362
owing to the condition
of its containers.

611
00:48:31,364 --> 00:48:33,280
I understand
Mr. Meeks told you

612
00:48:33,282 --> 00:48:35,399
the episode on the Good Fortune
was a case of self-defense.

613
00:48:35,401 --> 00:48:37,234
I apologize for that.

614
00:48:37,236 --> 00:48:38,986
When I heard he told you
that, I knew instantly

615
00:48:38,988 --> 00:48:41,705
that a woman of your stature
would see right through it.

616
00:48:41,707 --> 00:48:45,409
And if you're anything like me,
you simply cannot abide a liar.

617
00:48:45,411 --> 00:48:48,412
So I thought if I came
here to tell the truth,

618
00:48:48,414 --> 00:48:53,467
perhaps we might reach
a more favorable outcome.

619
00:48:54,086 --> 00:48:55,969
The truth is,

620
00:48:55,971 --> 00:48:59,256
I'm not a particularly
skilled captain.

621
00:48:59,258 --> 00:49:00,924
Navigation is foreign to me.

622
00:49:00,926 --> 00:49:02,926
I have no gift for politics.

623
00:49:02,928 --> 00:49:05,095
So what am I good at?

624
00:49:05,097 --> 00:49:08,348
This is going to sound
absurd, but...

625
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:11,268
I make the men feel better
about themselves.

626
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,270
See, every man here
has served under a captain

627
00:49:13,272 --> 00:49:15,105
who uses violence
to achieve an end...

628
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:18,441
to terrorize, to advertise.

629
00:49:18,443 --> 00:49:21,077
When the men see that,
they can spot the lie.

630
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:24,364
They know that that captain
is, in some part of his soul,

631
00:49:24,366 --> 00:49:27,701
sickened by his own actions.

632
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:30,287
And the lie infects
everyone who sees it.

633
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:32,289
But with me,

634
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:34,791
when the men see me slaughter
the crew of the Good Fortune,

635
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:37,961
when they see me cut out a man's
tongue from his mouth for lying,

636
00:49:37,963 --> 00:49:40,213
when they see me burn a boy alive
in front of his father's eyes,

637
00:49:40,215 --> 00:49:43,967
they know, they can
see it in my eyes...

638
00:49:43,969 --> 00:49:46,102
there's no lie there.

639
00:49:46,104 --> 00:49:48,889
There's no secret remorse there.

640
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,810
I simply don't have it in me.

641
00:49:56,815 --> 00:50:00,784
At any rate, I hope
that clarifies things

642
00:50:00,786 --> 00:50:02,953
and illustrates why it is only fair

643
00:50:02,955 --> 00:50:06,873
to compensate my men fully
for their latest haul,

644
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:11,044
as it was an honest haul
taken by an honest captain.

645
00:50:11,046 --> 00:50:13,163
I intend to be here some time.

646
00:50:13,165 --> 00:50:15,916
It would be a shame to
make enemies of each other

647
00:50:15,918 --> 00:50:18,051
over such a small amount of money.

648
00:50:19,972 --> 00:50:22,088
Get out of my place.

649
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:52,869
I say get rid of him.

650
00:51:09,855 --> 00:51:11,855
It's very lucky.

651
00:51:14,943 --> 00:51:17,694
I rather envy you.

652
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:29,572
I remember what it was like
the first time I met him.

653
00:51:29,574 --> 00:51:31,908
There's a feeling one gets
when in the presence

654
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:34,494
of the truly great men.

655
00:51:34,496 --> 00:51:38,081
It's something quite indescribable.

656
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:41,134
I imagine you're
having it as we speak.

657
00:51:41,136 --> 00:51:43,503
"Indescribable" is a good word.

658
00:51:43,505 --> 00:51:45,422
You question my husband's motives?

659
00:51:45,424 --> 00:51:47,424
Not on the least, ma'am,

660
00:51:47,426 --> 00:51:49,643
though I may question the
outcome he's likely to achieve.

661
00:51:49,645 --> 00:51:51,678
The game he is entering into

662
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,180
is a brutal and unforgiving one.

663
00:51:54,182 --> 00:51:56,983
- Piracy?
- Politics.

664
00:51:56,985 --> 00:52:00,437
What's your name, Lieutenant?

665
00:52:00,439 --> 00:52:03,490
McGraw... James McGraw.

666
00:52:03,492 --> 00:52:06,993
Great men aren't made great by
politics, Lieutenant McGraw.

667
00:52:06,995 --> 00:52:10,613
They aren't made great
by prudence or propriety.

668
00:52:10,615 --> 00:52:12,615
They are, every last one of them,

669
00:52:12,617 --> 00:52:16,536
made great by one thing
and one thing only...

670
00:52:16,538 --> 00:52:20,340
the relentless pursuit
of a better world.

671
00:52:20,342 --> 00:52:22,625
The great men don't
give up that pursuit.

672
00:52:22,627 --> 00:52:24,627
They don't know how.

673
00:52:24,629 --> 00:52:27,597
And that is what makes
them invincible.

674
00:52:47,285 --> 00:52:50,286
17 yea votes against 15 nays.

675
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:54,407
The crew has commuted your sentences

676
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:57,994
by the narrowest of margins.

677
00:52:57,996 --> 00:53:01,498
You will both be
transported back to Nassau,

678
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,584
at which point you will be removed
from this ship permanently

679
00:53:04,586 --> 00:53:06,669
and without severance.

680
00:53:08,557 --> 00:53:11,641
There'll be no further
negotiation on the matter.

681
00:53:23,105 --> 00:53:26,656
You were right, for what it's worth.

682
00:53:26,658 --> 00:53:28,408
Beg pardon?

683
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:32,612
If your interests and mine
were adverse to each other,

684
00:53:32,614 --> 00:53:36,199
there's a good chance I'd
cross you to save myself.

685
00:53:36,201 --> 00:53:38,701
Then why didn't you?

686
00:53:38,703 --> 00:53:41,087
Because at the moment

687
00:53:41,089 --> 00:53:43,456
I don't believe our interests
are adverse to each other.

688
00:53:49,714 --> 00:53:52,549
I don't believe you did
any of this for a pardon,

689
00:53:52,551 --> 00:53:55,385
or a passage to Nassau,

690
00:53:55,387 --> 00:53:58,721
or to be able to walk away
from anything.

691
00:53:58,723 --> 00:54:02,725
I think you intend
to reclaim your captaincy.

692
00:54:02,727 --> 00:54:07,363
I think you intend to take
control of this ship.

693
00:54:07,365 --> 00:54:09,115
And then I think you intend

694
00:54:09,117 --> 00:54:11,734
to return to that beach,
armed to the teeth,

695
00:54:11,736 --> 00:54:14,737
and seize every last
ounce of gold off of it.

696
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:19,325
And I think you're going
to need my help to do it.

697
00:54:27,552 --> 00:54:29,502
Tell me I'm wrong.

698
00:54:35,794 --> 00:54:38,495
