1
00:00:01,928 --> 00:00:04,226
I'm Chuck.
Here are things you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,397 --> 00:00:07,025
I had a fiancée. Now she thinks I'm dead.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,690
I don't want you lying to your mother.

4
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:12,031
Me neither, but lying to her
kind of goes with our territory.

5
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:15,231
Chuck, I'd like you to meet my dad,
Jack Burton.

6
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:16,932
Not interested in your stolen money.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,670
Stolen? That's what you think of
your old man? Some thief?

8
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:22,747
Darling, a thief has to run out of town
as fast as he can.

9
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,110
But a good con man...

10
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:28,345
A good con man can leave
whenever he wants. I remember, Dad.

11
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:34,927
- Hello, miss.
- Hi.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,091
It's that time of year again. Cookies.

13
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:38,394
- Oh.
- We're having a special.

14
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:40,898
If you get
a box of each flavor right now...

15
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:43,233
you get 20 percent off
your whole order.

16
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:45,103
- Well, okay.
- Great.

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,576
So I'll put you down for the Skinny
Mints, Palominos and Butter Cookies.

18
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:54,543
Plus the Plippers, Zigaroos
and Sugar-Go-Rounds.

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,880
- You will not be sorry about this.
- Oh. I don't...

20
00:00:57,055 --> 00:01:00,889
Our entire new line of nougat-filled
bonbons and the five original wafers.

21
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:05,223
With the 20-percent discount,
you're looking at a grand total of $84.

22
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:11,225
Well, that's exact what I have.

23
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:17,098
Thanks, miss.
Your cookies should arrive next month.

24
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,571
Okay.

25
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,784
- How'd it go, darling?
- Well, not great, but not bad.

26
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:40,292
- Eighty-four dollars.
- Oh. Not bad at all.

27
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,365
We made over 2 grand today.

28
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:46,533
You're getting better at this.
Remember, once you know all the cons...

29
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:48,433
I'll never be a sucker.

30
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:50,801
That's right.

31
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:53,774
There's your cut.

32
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,640
You earned it.

33
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:57,907
What you gonna do with all that?

34
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,141
I don't know.

35
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:02,650
Well, if you could have anything
in the whole world, what would it be?

36
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:08,984
An adventure somewhere.
Just you and me.

37
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,028
Well, I tell you what, you save up
and maybe we can do just that.

38
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,666
Home, sweet home.

39
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:25,366
- Wanna come in?
- I probably shouldn't, kiddo.

40
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,841
Your grandma is not too happy
with me right now.

41
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:36,318
- See you later, alligator.
- In a while, crocodile.

42
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,232
Oh, uh...

43
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:53,097
No. That won't be necessary.

44
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,196
My father doesn't know.

45
00:02:56,374 --> 00:02:58,239
Sarah and her dad
have a complicated...

46
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,400
The invite list looks great. Thank you.

47
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:03,272
All right, then.
It looks like everything is in place.

48
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:07,714
We've got the location,
the flowers, the food.

49
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:11,954
So are you two finally ready
to pull the trigger on this?

50
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:17,894
Trust me, I know that making decisions
like this can be...

51
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:19,154
Overwhelming.

52
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,957
- And exhausting.
- Exactly.

53
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:24,226
So if you two need a little more time
to think things over...

54
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:26,996
we don't have to move forward
just yet.

55
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:30,233
No, we're ready.

56
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,167
No more changes.

57
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:45,818
Here's the wedding plan. Pretty cool, huh?

58
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,959
For you. I made copies for everybody.
And they're laminated.

59
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:52,591
- That saves me the trouble of doing it.
- Well...

60
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:56,461
Um, can I ask you something? You went
with, uh, Helvetica for the invitations.

61
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:58,499
Your wedding colors
are red and black.

62
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,830
- Yeah?
- Ooh.

63
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:02,438
It's just, together,
they kind of scream socialism.

64
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:05,872
- Casey's gonna decline.
- Well, Sarah and I thought they were nice.

65
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:08,842
I bet. So did Chairman Mao, hmm?

66
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:11,205
- I could talk to Sarah about it.
- I would.

67
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:15,113
I have a big day planned at the Buy More
for Casey, I'm gonna get out of here.

68
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:16,878
Good luck.

69
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:19,689
Hey. You have a lot to talk about.
Have fun.

70
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,758
Hey.

71
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:27,990
Silly, quick, little question, do our
wedding colors remind you of socialism?

72
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,026
- In a good way?
- Is there a good way?

73
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:33,693
Uh, I don't wanna make a thing out of it,
so let's call Daphne.

74
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:36,339
Yeah, get her on speakerphone.
I love that gal.

75
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:41,311
We're sorry.

76
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,242
The number
you have reached is not in service.

77
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,678
Please check the number
or try your call again.

78
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,045
You sure you dialed the right number?

79
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:51,354
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.
We've been conned.

80
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:53,989
We've been conned.
She's already cashed our check.

81
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:56,285
And our account
has been emptied out.

82
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:58,793
I just don't understand.

83
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:02,558
She came so highly recommended
by the Internet.

84
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:04,224
I should have seen this coming.

85
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:08,361
She asked for our money up front,
she gave us a 40-percent discount.

86
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:12,634
You know, if there is one thing I am not,
Chuck, it's a sucker.

87
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,904
Me neither. We're not a couple
of sappy, helpless lovebirds.

88
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,139
Yeah, that's right. We're CIA agents.

89
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:21,910
Daphne Peralta,
she chose the wrong couple to con.

90
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,084
- That's us, right, honey?
- Of course I mean us.

91
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:28,089
I thought there was another couple...
Getting in the car.

92
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:35,177
Chuck 4x21 - Versus the Wedding Planner

93
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:15,267
You know, for an amateur con,
Daphne Peralta sure is hard to find.

94
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:18,031
I don't get it.
We've traced every cell phone...

95
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:22,099
every bank account and nothing.
She must have hundreds of aliases.

96
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:23,972
She's a ghost. Not literally.

97
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:27,979
She's not an apparition we're dealing with,
but in the sense she's hard to find.

98
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:30,811
I have used every available resource
to find her.

99
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:34,444
- We could ask General Beckman for help.
- To locate our wedding planner?

100
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:37,820
- I don't think that's gonna go down well.
- She stole from us...

101
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:39,483
but you're taking this hard.

102
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:42,858
Well, of course I am. I was raised
by a con man and I got taken.

103
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:48,264
We've done everything to make it right.
We've left no stone unturned.

104
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:51,639
Not every stone.

105
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,574
Here is where you see
your new shopping center.

106
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,545
The Nagamichi Complex 2011.

107
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,641
I got chills just thinking about it.

108
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:06,411
Do we have a deal?

109
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:09,653
Jack Burton.

110
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:18,529
Uh, give me one minute, gentlemen.
Old business associate of mine.

111
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,134
Oh, my daughter, conned?

112
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,264
I know. Chuck and I
were throwing this party and...

113
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,535
Wow, you're still in Burbank
with the, uh, schnook? How's that?

114
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,234
Fine.

115
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:33,547
Anyway, the party planner,
she ran off with all of our money.

116
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:36,115
Know Daphne Peralta?
Have you worked with her?

117
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:39,919
No, I'm sorry, darling,
I've never heard that name before.

118
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:47,559
Why don't you, uh, use some
of your vast CIA resources to find her?

119
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:49,628
How did you find out?

120
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:53,796
I took a peek at your wallet.

121
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:55,436
Fancy federal ID there.

122
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:59,904
I'm a little surprised you turned out
to be such an upstanding citizen.

123
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:02,566
And a little proud too.

124
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:07,406
I've used all of my available resources.

125
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:09,743
I don't have the authority
to go any further.

126
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,820
Why let that stop you?
Con means confidence, you know that.

127
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:17,015
You remember that summer
that we spent in Savannah?

128
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:20,190
Where we lived
in the governor's mansion?

129
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:23,763
If you don't have the authority,
pretend you do.

130
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:27,764
That's right. Fake it till you make it.

131
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,299
Okay. Thanks for your help, Dad.

132
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:34,340
That's it? You're not gonna explain to me
what happened in the last two years...

133
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:37,103
to make you go from con to mark?

134
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,372
In a while, crocodile.

135
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,318
- Hey, Dad. Funny meeting you here.
- Hey.

136
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:49,116
Ha, ha. Hello.

137
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,191
- Why do I feel like this is an ambush?
- Today is the day.

138
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,760
- What? You move out?
- Who's gonna do your laundry?

139
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:59,389
- Today is the day you speak to Kathleen.
- And tell her that you're still alive.

140
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:00,693
- Yay.
- Yay.

141
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:01,961
Not gonna happen.

142
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:05,368
Okay, Dad, you have been putting this
off for a week.

143
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,476
It's gonna be hard, but you have to.
You said we're gonna do this together.

144
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:13,011
I'm not avoiding anything.
Your mother believes that I'm dead.

145
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:16,947
If she walks into the Buy More,
she'll think I left her for some crappy job?

146
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:18,949
She deserves better than that.

147
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:23,146
- So much for that great idea.
- Yeah.

148
00:09:23,324 --> 00:09:25,952
It's not such a great plan after all,
was it?

149
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:32,263
Okay. Be cool, be cool.

150
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:34,994
You guys find that new iPad case
you were looking for?

151
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,832
No, no. We're actually completely sold
out of them.

152
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:40,497
I'm very disappointed about it.
We're just gonna go.

153
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:43,208
- They don't have it.
- There's all these cases.

154
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:45,471
No, no. That's the wrong generation.

155
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,213
- You want me to what?
- Just fake a flash. A little one.

156
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:55,914
On Daphne Peralta? I question your
dad's influence because that is crazy.

157
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:58,355
We've gone as far as we can
without Beckman.

158
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:02,053
And all we need to do is access
the FBI's Echelon satellites.

159
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,757
She can either help us
or we lose Daphne and our wedding.

160
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:09,334
Okay, okay. Fine.
I'll just give her one of these:

161
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,174
And voilá, access granted.

162
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:17,903
Uh, it doesn't look like that.

163
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:20,513
No? What does it look like, exactly?

164
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:24,118
Well, it kind of looks like you saw
something really bright...

165
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:26,685
and tasted something sour
at the same time.

166
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:30,018
I don't know, I mean, if I had to do it,
it would kind of be like:

167
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:36,761
Like that.

168
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:39,764
Oh.

169
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:44,871
What? Well, I thought it was good.
Wait, you don't like my flash?

170
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,405
- It's not that I don't like it.
- But then tell me.

171
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:05,256
Hmm. She lives with the schnook.

172
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:09,987
Yo, bro.

173
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:13,066
You're in Neighborhood Watch territory,
go ahead, try and run.

174
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:15,668
I will be faster
because I have superior form.

175
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:19,068
Ha-ha-ha. Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no.
My daughter lives here.

176
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:21,767
Sarah Walker. I'm Jack.

177
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:26,836
Oh. That's a grip you got there.
Do you rock climb?

178
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:31,348
- Just a couple times a week.
- Oh, well, I actually did El Capitan in '79.

179
00:11:31,553 --> 00:11:33,851
- Whoa, dude, that's awesome.
- Yeah.

180
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:36,853
- I'm Devon. I'm Chuck's brother-in-law.
- Oh, right, right.

181
00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:39,925
Yeah, man. Sorry about all
the Neighborhood Watch talk.

182
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:41,857
Just protecting the fam, you know?

183
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,591
Of course,
what's more important than family, hmm?

184
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:49,294
Well, I was, uh, gonna surprise Sarah,
but obviously, she's not home.

185
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,406
The problem is,
I got nowhere else to go.

186
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:58,071
Oh, well, I'm, uh, on baby duty, so...

187
00:11:58,246 --> 00:11:59,941
Oh, of course. Sure.

188
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:02,412
I'd be happy to help out.

189
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:04,809
Is that your place right there?

190
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:08,613
I've been following somebody.

191
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,590
A woman that I think may be
more dangerous than we expect.

192
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:17,264
- Who is she?
- Daphne Peralta.

193
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,195
Chuck, did you just flash?

194
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:25,805
That I did, partner.

195
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:30,343
And you are right, this Daphne Peralta
is a very dangerous woman.

196
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:33,373
- What did you see?
- Connections.

197
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:38,247
Specifically connections between
her and other dangerous people.

198
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:39,579
Who specifically?

199
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,079
Anan Magoro.

200
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:45,624
But we just took down
the entire Magoro terrorist cell.

201
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:47,286
Was there anyone else?

202
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:49,185
Yeah.

203
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:50,922
Yeah. Who was that?

204
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:55,097
Artur Novokov?

205
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:57,298
Artur Novokov?

206
00:12:57,472 --> 00:13:00,270
He blew up three U.S. Embassies
in Africa last week.

207
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:04,036
I'm putting out an interdepartmental call
to CIA, NSA and FBI.

208
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:07,375
This could be the most important piece
of U.S. Intelligence work.

209
00:13:07,548 --> 00:13:11,040
Uh, general, before you do that,
you should actually know that...

210
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:15,815
I want every resource we have
redirected towards one singular goal:

211
00:13:16,157 --> 00:13:20,821
The location and apprehension
of this woman, Daphne Peralta.

212
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:30,401
I want her captured, dead or alive.

213
00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:40,844
What...? How am I supposed to know
who Artur Novokov is?

214
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:42,812
Because you work for the CIA.

215
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:46,351
It's not my fault. We've been planning
a wedding, I've been busy.

216
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:50,082
And besides, who puts a story
this important on page 13?

217
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:52,920
Oh, one of the Kardashian girls
just got her GED.

218
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:54,185
Allegedly.

219
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:58,696
All branches of U.S. Military are about
to launch an attack on our planner.

220
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:01,699
It's not gonna take them long
to figure out the connection.

221
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:07,205
But the good news is, now we have
access to all of the agencies' databases.

222
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:11,870
Daphne Peralta, we're coming for you.

223
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:14,173
Keep your eye on it, kid.

224
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,414
Ready?

225
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:22,583
- What do you think?
- So you here for the big day?

226
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:24,554
What big day?

227
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:25,750
Um...

228
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,193
Oh, today.

229
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:35,268
Every day's a big day to me.
I'm a go-getter. Carpe diem.

230
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:38,595
Hey. I got you a toy.

231
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:40,798
Yeah, your favorite toy.

232
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:42,374
You're good with her.

233
00:14:43,745 --> 00:14:46,373
Yeah, you know, at first it was tough.
I mean, really tough.

234
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:51,484
- Then I started to learn Clara's signals.
- Signals?

235
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:55,088
Yeah, like when she wants her pacifier,
she puts her hands to her face.

236
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:58,783
- Like a tell in poker, right?
- Sure.

237
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,622
My daughter, ooh.
She's a tough one to read.

238
00:15:01,796 --> 00:15:03,457
I taught her to keep things close.

239
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:07,465
I said, the second you let
your guard down, you get hurt.

240
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:09,603
- There.
- She did. She let her guard down.

241
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:11,733
And now I wanna know why.

242
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:19,672
You don't mind if I stick around a bit,
do you?

243
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:21,838
You get HBO, right?

244
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:30,021
Sarah, would it surprise you that
your father is at Ellie and Devon's?

245
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:31,958
What?

246
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:37,689
Of course.

247
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:41,198
Baby, at this point, maybe we should
just tell him about the wedding.

248
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:43,929
It'll make everything easier,
he'd love to be there.

249
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:46,665
Dad hasn't been there
for an important day in my life.

250
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:48,331
So let's just focus on Daphne.

251
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,273
I think I found her
on one of these FBI Echelon satellites.

252
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:55,974
This was taken five minutes ago.

253
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,985
So, what is a SuperShuttle?

254
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:04,725
Reliable transport
at a reasonable price.

255
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:06,883
Leaving Pasadena on the 134.

256
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:08,892
I got an idea.

257
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:11,827
SuperShuttle? Hi.
Yes, I'd like to organize a pickup.

258
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:13,557
Yes, I do have a AAA card.

259
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:24,667
Okay, I managed to shut off
Castle's satellite feed.

260
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:27,337
You have five minutes
to get Daphne off that shuttle.

261
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:30,348
Beckman's already got Casey
in the field with a SWAT team.

262
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:36,216
General, do we have a location
on the target?

263
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,417
Not yet. Our satellites are still dark,
but we're getting them back up now.

264
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:41,922
I'll be ready.

265
00:16:45,032 --> 00:16:49,025
Oh, my God, Rosa, I met
this super hot guy at the Winston...

266
00:16:49,203 --> 00:16:51,330
Daphne Peralta?

267
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,105
Surprise.

268
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:01,406
Chuck Bartowski.
I work for the United States government.

269
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:05,211
And you, ma'am, are under arrest.

270
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:07,377
Sarah, I got her.

271
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:09,113
We'll get her off
the van at the next stop.

272
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:12,221
Watch this.

273
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:16,427
What are you doing?
Get away from me.

274
00:17:16,597 --> 00:17:18,565
Oh, my God, somebody please
do something.

275
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,758
- What's going on back there?
- Nothing.

276
00:17:20,935 --> 00:17:23,403
- I work for the U.S. Government.
- He does not.

277
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:25,061
This weirdo is my ex-boyfriend.

278
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,433
He's been stalking me.

279
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:27,767
There's a stalker.

280
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:29,637
Oh, my God, he just exposed himself.

281
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,744
- No, I didn't.
- Aah!

282
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:35,474
This guy just totally exposed himself
to this woman on the SuperShuttle.

283
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,742
Please do something.

284
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:40,046
Okay, everyone just calm down.
I didn't expose myself.

285
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:44,055
- What is going on in there?
- Nothing. Everything's under control.

286
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:45,317
I'm fine. How are you?

287
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:48,656
I told you, we should've taken a taxi.
What's it, $15 more?

288
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:53,459
Quiet down, all of you, okay?
We're already late!

289
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:55,067
Now, who's flying Southwest?

290
00:17:56,837 --> 00:17:57,963
You? Okay.

291
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:02,542
Colonel, I was able to get a trace
on our target. Sending it to you now.

292
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,735
Hmm. SuperShuttle.

293
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:07,278
Good cover.
No one would give it a second look.

294
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:10,611
Listen up, men.
Daphne Peralta is smart and dangerous.

295
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:14,482
I don't wanna lose anyone today so keep
your eyes peeled and your guns ready.

296
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:16,688
You heard her. We're going in hot.

297
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:18,085
Hoo-ah.

298
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:21,285
Listen, you have got to get Daphne off
that shuttle right now.

299
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:25,091
I'm working on it. Right. I'm talking
through an earpiece to an agent...

300
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:27,598
who wears an earpiece
because we're agents.

301
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:29,633
No more messing around. Stop this.

302
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:33,968
No way, man. I'll lose my job if I don't
get everybody to the airport on time.

303
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:35,733
- I am extremely unstable.
- Aah!

304
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,346
- What are you talking about?
- If you don't pull over this van...

305
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:43,711
I will expose myself to you
and everyone else in this vehicle.

306
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:46,717
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

307
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:50,281
Oh.

308
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:54,824
- Blondie's here, too, huh?
- This is already spiraling out of control.

309
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:57,464
The CIA's gonna be here any minute,
get in the car.

310
00:18:57,632 --> 00:19:00,396
Listen, ha, ha,
I get it that you're angry, okay?

311
00:19:00,568 --> 00:19:02,866
But there's not a damn thing
you can do.

312
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:04,971
Your little government con? It failed.

313
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,031
I'm calling your bluff.

314
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,882
- We are in really big trouble.
- Yeah.

315
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:23,679
She's your wedding planner?

316
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:26,884
Do you two have any idea
what you have done?

317
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:28,187
An inkling, yeah.

318
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:30,193
I'm to blame, general. It was my idea.

319
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:34,198
We all have personal lives.
It shouldn't interfere with the mission.

320
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:35,494
You're both to blame.

321
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,696
I just thank God that Miss Peralta
isn't going to press charges.

322
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:44,004
Press charges? She's a thief, general.
She stole $26,230 from us.

323
00:19:44,178 --> 00:19:46,612
For the foreseeable future,
you're both suspended.

324
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:51,749
General, this is Daphne's client book.
It has all the people she's conned in it.

325
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,218
The Bartholomews, they were promised
a horse-drawn carriage.

326
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:57,687
Over here...
Oh, look at that, the Gerlichs.

327
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:02,625
Look at all the family they have flying
in from Hungary. The airfare alone...

328
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,229
Oh. General, the bride's brothers
are Hungarian scientists.

329
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:16,604
- Let me guess, you flashed.
- Yeah. Yes, I did. I did, I did, yes.

330
00:20:16,777 --> 00:20:20,873
Bruno, Franz and Paulie Klüg, they've
been working for the Iranian government.

331
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:26,315
They have all of Iran's nuclear research
on a portable device called the Zephyr.

332
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:29,786
The face was more convincing this time,
but I'm still not buying.

333
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:31,948
You're not to pursue anyone
or anything...

334
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:34,754
until you earned back
the trust of the government.

335
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,989
And if history is any indication,
then that might take a while.

336
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:52,504
Okay, now where's the ball?

337
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:57,481
This one? Really?

338
00:20:58,219 --> 00:20:59,743
You sure?

339
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,650
Okay. Nope.

340
00:21:02,823 --> 00:21:08,386
You see, the secret to the shell game
is the ball's not in any of these.

341
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:11,793
It's right here in my pocket.

342
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:15,834
Once you know all the cons,
you'll never be a sucker.

343
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:18,528
- Your daughter needs a father.
- She can count on me.

344
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:20,833
Is that why you're asking for money again?

345
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:23,704
Whatever you can spare,
I'll double in a month.

346
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:24,970
I'm good for it.

347
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:27,944
- You're not welcome here anymore.
- Okay, okay, I get it.

348
00:21:28,115 --> 00:21:29,605
- Let me say goodbye first.
- No.

349
00:21:29,784 --> 00:21:34,278
I can't imagine what it must be like for that
girl to constantly say goodbye to her father.

350
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:36,650
She deserves better.

351
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:58,072
I don't wanna live with Grandma.
I'm coming with you.

352
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:01,078
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.
- But I brought this.

353
00:22:01,248 --> 00:22:02,510
You need it, right?

354
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,812
I can't, sweetie. This is your money.

355
00:22:07,988 --> 00:22:10,047
But I know you're good for it.

356
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:14,694
Plus, we don't need that money
to have an adventure together.

357
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:18,956
You're right.

358
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,395
All we need is you and me.

359
00:22:30,077 --> 00:22:32,204
You want some ice cream?

360
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:34,742
No.

361
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,914
I'm sorry my advice didn't pan out.

362
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,820
Is that why you're here,
because you were worried?

363
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:44,617
Yeah. A skosh.

364
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:45,884
Here.

365
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:48,490
What's wrong?

366
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:53,523
Mm. Work thing,
I probably shouldn't discuss it.

367
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:56,465
Come on, give your old man a chance.

368
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:58,696
I do know a thing or two
about criminals.

369
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:01,874
Maybe I can help.

370
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:05,637
Okay, well, there are these
three brothers called the Klügs.

371
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:09,044
They are never in the same place,
but they're going to be in L. A...

372
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,683
for their sister's wedding.

373
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:13,786
They carry around this device with them,
called the Zephyr...

374
00:23:13,954 --> 00:23:18,220
but they rotate it
amongst themselves and, um...

375
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:22,323
- You know, never mind, this is...
- No, I'm listening.

376
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:25,659
Your mark are the Klügs
and the Zephyr's the package.

377
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,961
Right. But the problem
is the wedding reception...

378
00:23:29,136 --> 00:23:32,071
that they're supposed to be at
is one of Daphne's cons.

379
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,900
Any way that we could...

380
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:37,373
make that wedding reception happen?
- Daphne's records did say...

381
00:23:37,545 --> 00:23:41,242
that she never met the Gerlichs
in person, but even if I convinced them...

382
00:23:41,415 --> 00:23:44,350
it's still on, how could
I throw a $100,000 wedding...

383
00:23:44,518 --> 00:23:46,884
in 24 hours with no CIA resources?

384
00:23:47,054 --> 00:23:50,023
Because, darling, you got me.

385
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:52,082
I know you guys are all used...

386
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:55,126
to having some high-tech resources
at your fingertips.

387
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:57,992
But everything I know
I learned in the '80s when VCRs...

388
00:23:58,165 --> 00:24:01,396
and rollerblades were the cutting edge,
so just bear with me.

389
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:02,661
Especially you, Chuck.

390
00:24:03,304 --> 00:24:05,932
Just wanted to thank you guys
for including me on this.

391
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:08,631
Always wanted to pull a con, so...

392
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:12,743
Daphne Peralta promised the Gerlichs
a lavish reception...

393
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:14,608
at the grand
Ambassador Hotel Ballroom.

394
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:17,007
That is beautiful.

395
00:24:17,184 --> 00:24:18,776
Unfortunately,
the ballroom was booked...

396
00:24:18,953 --> 00:24:21,353
months in advance
for Tammy Katz's bat mitzvah.

397
00:24:21,522 --> 00:24:23,615
- So it's a no-go.
- Not necessarily.

398
00:24:24,391 --> 00:24:29,624
Bat mitzvah starts at 8
and our reception begins at 6:30.

399
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,525
Ma'am, can I help you?

400
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:34,065
So you gonna act like
you don't know who I am now?

401
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:37,631
Daphne Peralta,
Tammy Katz's bat mitzvah coordinator.

402
00:24:37,972 --> 00:24:41,135
Now, per Tammy, I called in advance
to ensure I'd have the room...

403
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:44,004
for two hours before the party.

404
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:48,848
Hungarian wedding.

405
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:43,465
- Ahem.
- Casey, what are you doing here?

406
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:46,834
I came to stop you.
You're in deep enough as it is.

407
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:50,238
But, Casey, the three Klüg brothers
will all be here tonight.

408
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:53,869
One of them will be carrying the Zephyr
that has Iran's nuclear research.

409
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:55,481
Sounds crazy, but it's true.

410
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:59,317
Look, I shouldn't have lied to you.
I did it to protect you. I'm sorry.

411
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:02,944
It was a mistake, but what Chuck
is talking about is very real.

412
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:07,592
Okay, what can I do to help?

413
00:26:08,662 --> 00:26:11,597
Hey, cop face. Glad you could join us.

414
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:13,457
I think we got a job for you.

415
00:26:16,904 --> 00:26:21,466
All right, all you party people,
let's get this shindig a-going. Come on!

416
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:23,507
Hey!

417
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:26,173
Uh huh

418
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:29,108
Hey!

419
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:34,214
- That's what I like about you
- That's what I like about you

420
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:36,253
Hey!

421
00:26:37,725 --> 00:26:39,420
There you go. Enjoy.

422
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:44,556
Still no sign of the Klügs.

423
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:46,695
Keep stalling.

424
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:54,863
Alrighty, folks. Let's slow things down
for a second, huh?

425
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:59,945
Grab that special someone and show
them how much you love them.

426
00:27:07,187 --> 00:27:08,814
Shall we?

427
00:27:09,923 --> 00:27:11,322
You're asking me to dance?

428
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:13,857
We got time.

429
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,133
My love has come along.

430
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:26,605
And my lonely days.

431
00:27:26,774 --> 00:27:31,143
Plus, uh, it could be the only chance I get
to dance with my daughter at a wedding.

432
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:37,983
And life is like a song

433
00:27:38,152 --> 00:27:39,517
Um...

434
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:40,983
Uh...

435
00:27:41,155 --> 00:27:43,214
Chuck and I are getting married.

436
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:47,218
I know.

437
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,564
- I'm sorry I didn't invite you.
- No, no, you were right not to.

438
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:56,999
I don't exactly have
a great track record of, uh...

439
00:27:58,472 --> 00:27:59,939
Well...

440
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:01,869
being around.

441
00:28:03,443 --> 00:28:05,536
Truth is, I, uh...

442
00:28:05,946 --> 00:28:08,506
I never thought my little girl
would settle down.

443
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:14,042
I thought you'd end up more like me,
just one adventure after another...

444
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,689
never stay in one place too long.

445
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:18,588
Isn't that what you wanted?

446
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:21,585
It was.

447
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:26,563
But, um, I found a home here,
a good one and I'm happy.

448
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:28,525
I'm sorry, Dad.

449
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:41,642
Got my eyes on the Klüg brothers.
Be careful. They're armed and dangerous.

450
00:28:41,815 --> 00:28:43,715
You ready for this?

451
00:28:43,884 --> 00:28:46,182
Just like old times, kid.

452
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:50,986
All right, Sarah. You're up.
Klüg number one is approaching the bar.

453
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,921
Mr. Klüg, hello.
Daphne Peralta, wedding planner.

454
00:28:57,097 --> 00:28:59,565
- Are you enjoying the party?
- Yes, it's very nice.

455
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:03,965
It wouldn't be the same without your
extraordinarily generous gift to the Gerlichs.

456
00:29:04,271 --> 00:29:05,397
The toaster?

457
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:07,631
No, silly. The open bar.

458
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:13,445
No, no, no. This is a mistake.

459
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:17,744
Oh, I'm sorry. I've got your credit card
on file in the back...

460
00:29:17,918 --> 00:29:21,319
and if you just follow me, I'm sure
we can sort this mess out, okay?

461
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:27,222
Again, I'm so sorry
for the inconvenience, dear.

462
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:28,452
It's no problem.

463
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:37,127
Got mine.

464
00:29:37,304 --> 00:29:38,999
I'm so sorry. I'm an imperfect man.

465
00:29:39,172 --> 00:29:41,299
We have something back here
that can get the stain out.

466
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:43,807
Unh! Incoming.

467
00:29:49,316 --> 00:29:50,977
Spy high-five.

468
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:52,846
Casey? Two Klügs down.

469
00:29:54,354 --> 00:29:56,117
One to go.

470
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:10,398
Oh! Scratch that, I've got a bogey. I need
someone to cover Klüg number three.

471
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:23,176
- Hey. Hey, friend. How you doing?
- Do I know you?

472
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,012
Oh, sorry, my bad. It's Spencer Finn.

473
00:30:28,188 --> 00:30:30,019
Alex.

474
00:30:34,194 --> 00:30:35,456
Oh.

475
00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:37,426
Sure didn't want it
to happen this way.

476
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:41,590
- Kath, what are you doing here?
- I followed you from the Buy More.

477
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,030
- Unbelievable.
- I can't believe you dated Parisa too?

478
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,205
- Who didn't? Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

479
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:51,469
Hey, tell you what, why don't we just
go drink a toast to her?

480
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:53,875
Good stuff's in the back. Ha! Come on.

481
00:31:00,387 --> 00:31:02,252
I don't understand.

482
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,885
We had your funeral.

483
00:31:06,193 --> 00:31:07,956
I was given your flag.

484
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:11,528
But you didn't die.

485
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:15,763
You just left?

486
00:31:15,936 --> 00:31:17,995
You left me for, what?

487
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:20,662
We've neutralized the Klügs. Let's get out.

488
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:25,540
To work part-time as a security guard
and moonlight at the Buy More?

489
00:31:25,712 --> 00:31:29,739
Really can't talk to you about this
right now. Please. You need to leave.

490
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:32,908
I talked to Alex
and, uh, she already knew.

491
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:37,553
She thinks you're some kind of hero
or something.

492
00:31:37,724 --> 00:31:39,589
That you work
for the government, that...

493
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:45,260
She wanted to believe it so much.

494
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:46,658
I guess I did too.

495
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,892
Casey, where are you?

496
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:50,934
You should go.

497
00:31:52,672 --> 00:31:54,970
But only if you promise
to tell Alex the truth.

498
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,579
You wanna be a part of her life,
you owe her that.

499
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:02,010
I don't wanna lie to anyone.

500
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:04,173
Then don't.

501
00:32:12,926 --> 00:32:15,986
Hey, where's the DJ?
He needs to make an announcement.

502
00:32:16,196 --> 00:32:18,960
- They're just about to cut the cake.
- Oh, the cake. Right.

503
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:21,760
Uh, the DJ will be back in a minute,
I promise.

504
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:24,267
He's in the bathroom, so don't worry.

505
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:27,197
What am I looking for?

506
00:32:27,774 --> 00:32:30,470
Well, the Zephyr's small,
like a portable hard drive.

507
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:34,079
- Bruno's clean.
- So is Paulie.

508
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:35,305
This one too.

509
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:37,549
Then where's the device?

510
00:32:38,952 --> 00:32:40,283
How do none of them have it?

511
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:44,624
Guys, listen to me,
people are getting restless, all right?

512
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,952
The father of the bride wants
to cut the cake.

513
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:53,123
And in case everybody has forgot,
the cake is made of Styrofoam. Unh!

514
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,234
I don't get it. I mean, my flash said...

515
00:32:55,402 --> 00:32:58,997
that one of the Klüg brothers keeps
the Zephyr on him at all times.

516
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:02,000
- It's a shell game.
- What?

517
00:33:02,175 --> 00:33:05,303
Right. The Klügs are just decoys
to keep everybody distracted.

518
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:08,812
We didn't know it because they've
never been in the same place.

519
00:33:08,982 --> 00:33:11,473
In the game,
the ball is always close by.

520
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:13,414
Which means someone else here
has the Zephyr.

521
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:19,420
Coming through, coming through.
That knife is very dirty.

522
00:33:19,593 --> 00:33:21,083
This is their moment.

523
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:34,734
The cake is made of Styrofoam
and you knew it.

524
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:36,508
What's really going on here?

525
00:33:37,511 --> 00:33:40,912
Where are my sons?
Who do you work for?

526
00:33:41,081 --> 00:33:42,173
Daphne Peralta.

527
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,881
Let's talk outside.

528
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:47,212
We need to get back out there.

529
00:33:47,387 --> 00:33:49,912
Listen, there's no reason for the gun, sir.

530
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,355
- Uh, I mean, Mr. Father of the Bride.
- Morgan, where's he taking you?

531
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:56,428
Oh, what a lovely parking garage.

532
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:59,588
No, no, no. Hold on a second.
I am nobody. I'm nobody.

533
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:02,666
There'd virtually be no consequence
in you letting me go.

534
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:04,736
- The same goes for killing you.
- What?

535
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:07,237
- Freeze.
- Put your gun down. You're under arrest.

536
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:12,205
Stop.

537
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:13,744
Morgan.

538
00:34:15,448 --> 00:34:17,439
Hey! You got no place to go.

539
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:26,148
- Hi, Casey.
- Hi, Morgan.

540
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:29,586
Sorry, Casey.

541
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:33,889
You wouldn't risk your partner's life.

542
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:36,528
You won't pull trigger.

543
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:43,566
You couldn't be more wrong, my friend.

544
00:34:44,744 --> 00:34:45,904
Listen.

545
00:34:47,047 --> 00:34:49,038
Can I call you "friend"?

546
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:52,315
- What is your dad doing?
- Just give him a minute.

547
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:56,478
This man is going to shoot you
and he is not going to miss.

548
00:34:56,923 --> 00:34:58,982
I'm hoping
that he doesn't have to kill you.

549
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,525
See, I've got a daughter too.

550
00:35:02,095 --> 00:35:04,120
And based on the situation here...

551
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:08,427
I'm thinking you're not
the best father in the world.

552
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:12,394
Heh, join the club.

553
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:14,938
I guess the only thing
we can really hope for...

554
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:21,308
is that someday our little girls
might be happy despite us.

555
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:25,110
And yours is.
She's upstairs right now in her white dress.

556
00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:30,951
And here you are,
about to take a bullet in the head.

557
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:34,086
So...

558
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:37,794
do one thing for her, friend.

559
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:40,622
Put the gun down.

560
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,847
Turn around.

561
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,356
Colonel John Casey.

562
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:12,889
NSA.

563
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:29,395
The behavior you two displayed
with your wedding planner...

564
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:32,661
- Come on woman.
- Was unprofessional and unacceptable.

565
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:35,806
General, I promise
I will never fake a flash again.

566
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:37,874
We are very sorry, general.

567
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:41,706
However, my superiors were impressed
with the exceptional work you did...

568
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,848
in acquiring the Zephyr device.

569
00:36:44,015 --> 00:36:46,745
Though I question how you managed
to accomplish that task...

570
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:48,818
without any CIA resources.

571
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:52,479
Uh, well, it was really, um...

572
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:54,090
You could chalk it up to...

573
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:57,490
- I have a feeling the less I know, the better.
- Hmm.

574
00:36:57,662 --> 00:37:00,529
Welcome back. You're dismissed.

575
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:04,829
That went better than expected.

576
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:06,163
- I thought so. Hmm.
- Yeah.

577
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:11,834
You leaving already?

578
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,468
Yeah. I got wind of a wealthy Alabama
couple looking into orange futures...

579
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:18,013
and I'm pretty sure
I own a bunch of those, so...

580
00:37:18,183 --> 00:37:20,617
- Huh.
- I'm on the next flight out.

581
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:24,653
Okay, but Sarah's on her way home.
She'll be here soon.

582
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:27,614
Hmm.

583
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:30,386
We've never been great at goodbyes.

584
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:34,623
Look, I, uh, know that you never got a
proper invitation in the mail or anything...

585
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:37,563
but just watching you and Sarah...

586
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:39,066
Look, she'd never say it...

587
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:42,866
but it'd mean the world to her
if you came to our wedding...

588
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:45,201
and walked her down the aisle.

589
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,339
You should follow my daughter's lead.
She knows me very well.

590
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:51,245
I wish you both the best...

591
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:55,546
but, uh, I'm afraid I won't be able
to make the wedding.

592
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,517
What do you mean? You're her dad.

593
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,154
I've always been a better con man
than a father.

594
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:03,487
I made a promise to myself,
a long time ago...

595
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:06,255
to never promise her something
I couldn't give her.

596
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:09,423
She's had her heart broken
too many times by me. I, uh...

597
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:13,764
- I just don't wanna do it again.
- Just... Hey, just...

598
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:15,997
Just stay for dinner at least.

599
00:38:16,508 --> 00:38:17,736
Please?

600
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:27,179
All right, Charlie, I'll stay for dinner.

601
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:30,019
Good, good. Thank you.

602
00:38:31,222 --> 00:38:33,952
This is my fault.

603
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:38,023
I just never thought I'd see you again.

604
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:44,032
- She does that.
- Hmm?

605
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:47,137
Alex. That thing with your hand.

606
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:51,971
- Alex does that when she's nervous.
- Oh.

607
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:55,742
Uh. Hadn't realized. Never noticed.

608
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,346
Alex is amazing.

609
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:04,988
You should be proud.
You've done a great job, Kath.

610
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,988
Well, it'll be easier for her
now that I know.

611
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:12,493
Well, I didn't just do it for her.

612
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:14,529
Look at you.

613
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:17,725
You're a soldier, you're a hero.

614
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:22,837
You have everything
that you've ever wanted.

615
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:29,142
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

616
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:31,542
So I was doing a little research...

617
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:35,413
and I was thinking that a courthouse
wedding might be kind of romantic.

618
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,051
Or at the very least,
within our new budget.

619
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,515
- That sounds nice.
- Mm-hm.

620
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:46,027
And I got all the ingredients for dinner
with your dad.

621
00:39:46,331 --> 00:39:49,164
I'm making your favorite,
chicken pepperoni.

622
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:51,801
Where is he?

623
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:54,505
He's gone.

624
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:04,042
- Did he tell you he was leaving?
- He didn't have to.

625
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:07,116
It's what my dad does, Chuck.
He just leaves.

626
00:40:08,987 --> 00:40:12,150
Once you know all the cons,
you can never be a sucker.

627
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:37,175
Come here, sweetie.

628
00:40:58,136 --> 00:41:00,434
See you later, alligator.

629
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:33,527
You gave this to me a long time ago...

630
00:41:33,705 --> 00:41:36,674
and I want you to know
I never spent a dime of it.

631
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:39,036
I only ever added to it.

632
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:42,509
It should more than cover the cost
of your wedding to the schnook.

633
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,343
I hope now you can have
all the adventures you ever wanted...

634
00:41:46,517 --> 00:41:48,212
with a man far better than me.
