1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:04,582
Here are a few things
you need to know.

2
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:06,608
I need to talk to you
about Dad's computer.

3
00:00:06,786 --> 00:00:10,361
Yeah. I thought that I uncovered
some secret files.

4
00:00:10,362 --> 00:00:13,297
Turned out to be cheats
on some video game he was developing.

5
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:16,161
My sister just lied to me.
She's never lied to me.

6
00:00:16,368 --> 00:00:18,427
There was one man
my father was afraid of.

7
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:22,835
He went by the name Agent X.
I'm gonna track him down and kill him.

8
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:25,067
Then no one can touch me. Ever.

9
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:49,781
Freeze!

10
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:54,261
Take it easy, tiger. I'm here to help.

11
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:58,256
DS&T picked up some chatter
of a possible break-in attempt.

12
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:02,062
Not likely.

13
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:05,205
- It's always a ghost town down here.
- Oh.

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,267
Damn it. Sorry.
I haven't had my morning coffee yet.

15
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:12,872
Let me, um...

16
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,571
help.

17
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:21,783
Who says chivalry is dead?

18
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:30,259
Good work.
I knew there was a reason I brought you.

19
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:32,331
Outside of the obvious, of course.

20
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:44,204
- Hmm.
- That's the computer...

21
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:45,572
with the Agent X files?

22
00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:47,847
No, it's a tracker.

23
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:50,347
Somebody must be using
the computer.

24
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:53,780
But it looks as if the CIA
is keeping tabs.

25
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:57,584
Locate this signal and we'll have
exactly what Miss Volkoff wants.

26
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,095
This was too easy. Have to imagine
the CIA's being way more careful...

27
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:04,356
with the actual computer.

28
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:09,225
Oh, shoot. Ellie, come on.

29
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:13,400
Babe, doing last-minute prep
for Chuck's bachelor party.

30
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:16,441
- Give me a little sunscreen pre-coat?
- Sure.

31
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:19,808
Make sure you lube up the lats.
It's gonna be sunny in Vegas.

32
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,345
What's with the old house?

33
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:25,944
I figured out a cyclomatic complexity...

34
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,817
that ran through the conditionals
in my dad's research. End of the loop.

35
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:33,392
- Awesome.
- All paths seem to end at that photo.

36
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:36,689
Why would my dad want me
to have this picture of an old house?

37
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:39,958
Aren't you supposed to be getting ready
for Sarah's party?

38
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:44,332
Clara's already at your parents' house,
I am all packed for our girls' day trip.

39
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:46,939
I'll turn it off
as soon as the festivities begin.

40
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:48,166
- Okay?
- Fair enough.

41
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:52,574
Gonna finish packing for the dude trip.
Vegas, baby. Vegas.

42
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:10,655
I got a fat stack burning a hole
in my crotch.

43
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,067
- I don't think that's...
- It's burning.

44
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:17,602
No idea.
I put Awesome in charge of everything.

45
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:19,865
Apparently, he's the Vegas expert.

46
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,099
- Nice.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:24,210
- You, Casey? Any casino preferences?
- No. Forget the casinos.

48
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:28,246
The gun ranges.
Brought some of my fancy targets.

49
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:31,109
I got some bad news.
See you guys on Monday.

50
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:33,378
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
Hang on, Big Michael.

51
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:36,751
- You're not coming?
- Bologna Grimes says I couldn't go.

52
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:40,690
Knows I tapped Vegas dry back when
I was with Earth, Wind, Fire and Rain.

53
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:43,728
Want me to call this Baloney lady,
give her the what for?

54
00:03:43,898 --> 00:03:47,095
No. Once Bologna's made a decision
there's no going back on it.

55
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:49,727
You guys enjoy.

56
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,672
No.

57
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:58,175
No, no, no.
Hold on a second, hold on a second.

58
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:01,543
You are my future stepfather.
This will not stand.

59
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:03,843
Now, come on. We're men.

60
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:05,315
Men who take what's theirs.

61
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:09,545
You have to march into that house,
slam your fist on the counter...

62
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:14,593
look at my mother in the eye and say,
"Bologna, I am so sorry, woman...

63
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,093
but I have to work all weekend."
This way, when she asks me...

64
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,029
I'll say, "Yeah, we got all this inventory.

65
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:23,796
- We have to work." Boom. Ha.
- Boom.

66
00:04:25,573 --> 00:04:29,566
That's the greatest thing
a white person's ever done for me.

67
00:04:29,744 --> 00:04:30,733
Oh.

68
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:33,840
Let's go to Vegas.

69
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,614
Vegas, Vegas.
What does a bachelor wear in Vegas?

70
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:42,620
I can't believe you've never been to Vegas.
A bachelor does not wear that.

71
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,556
You're not digging the business-up-top,
party-below-the-waist thing?

72
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:49,628
It covered all the Vegas activities
with one fell swoop.

73
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,962
Speaking of looks, you're sure doing
an awful lot of maintenance over there.

74
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:56,831
Reminding you of what you'll be
missing out on in Vegas.

75
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:59,336
Oh, trust me, I'll remember.

76
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,001
- Where's Ellie taking you guys anyway?
- I'm not sure.

77
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,669
Every time I do recon,
she's on your dad's computer.

78
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:08,678
She spends a lot of time
on that thing.

79
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:12,945
Yeah, Ellie's always been into puzzles.
Logic puzzles, Sudoku, crosswords.

80
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,454
One of my earliest memories was when
she solved the 12-sided Rubik's cube...

81
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,684
before I even got mine
out of the box.

82
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,794
Have you spoken to Devon yet?

83
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:24,692
Told him that you know
Ellie is still using the computer?

84
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,264
No.

85
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:27,992
Not yet.

86
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:30,963
I'm planning on having
a good man-to-man talk...

87
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:32,605
as soon as we get to Vegas.

88
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:36,470
It's the perfect place to have
a sincere, honest, heartfelt conversation.

89
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:39,879
You really have never been to Vegas,
have you?

90
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,140
Awesome!

91
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:47,510
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Uh... Just a minute, Chuck. Coming.

92
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:51,551
- Hi.
- Hi.

93
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:55,183
- What's up?
- I was just... I was reading a book.

94
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:57,494
You don't have to lie to me.

95
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:02,930
You're planning Sarah's bachelorette party.
We've all got secrets.

96
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:05,833
- Don't we, Awesome?
- You don't know the half of it, bro.

97
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:07,234
Let me tell you something.

98
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,500
This weekend...

99
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:10,903
I'm gonna make a man out of you.

100
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:13,940
- Goody. I can't wait for that.
- Oh-ho.

101
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:18,917
Okay, well, you guys have fun, be safe.
And I'm just... I'm gonna do stuff.

102
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:21,179
- Okay.
- Okay.

103
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:22,981
- Bye.
- Bye.

104
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:24,647
Bye, bye, bye.

105
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:28,223
We finally have a lock
on the Orion computer signal.

106
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:32,060
Echo Park, Los Angeles.

107
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,133
Perfect. Let's move.

108
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,510
Chuck 4x22 - Versus Agent X

109
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,058
All right, boys.
I want you to get ready.

110
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,861
Even if you've been before,
you've never been with me.

111
00:07:24,036 --> 00:07:26,368
Thank you so much
for planning this trip.

112
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,199
Dude, you kidding? I live for this.

113
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:30,668
We need to think of this weekend
like a war.

114
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,803
- Now you're talking my language.
- When we get there...

115
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:37,676
we immediately take over the Strip.
- High-rolling on the Strip.

116
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:40,147
What the...? Ow, ow.

117
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,150
- What are you doing?
- Making it rain.

118
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:44,983
Canadian style,
which is, technically, making it snow.

119
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:48,489
Dollar, dollar coins, y'all. Boom!

120
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,356
- Save the socialist funny money.
- And save your energy.

121
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,997
Vegas is the land of excess.

122
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:56,495
For those of you who like to chase tail,
plenty of that too.

123
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:58,295
Rest up, boys.

124
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,405
Because we might not sleep again
for a long time.

125
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:02,972
- All right!
- Yeah!

126
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:04,335
Hey!

127
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,909
Here is to a delightful
bachelorette weekend.

128
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,546
Cheers.

129
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:11,809
So are you gonna let me in
on the big secret?

130
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:14,214
What have you got planned
for tomorrow?

131
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,115
Okay. We are going to a spa
in Santa Barbara.

132
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,349
And we're not just doing massages,
we're doing body scrubs too.

133
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:25,429
Wow, that sounds very relaxing.

134
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:28,063
Get ready
for some hard-core aromatherapy.

135
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,825
Ahh.

136
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,599
All right, boys.

137
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:40,006
- Let's tear this town a new one.
- Yeah!

138
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:46,144
- All right.
- Whoo.

139
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,682
- All right.
- Welcome to Las Vecas, boys. Ha-ha-ha.

140
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:56,050
Devon, what's going on?
This is not Las Vegas.

141
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:57,718
Las Vecas, buddy. Look.

142
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:06,695
So this whole time,
you've been saying Las Vecas?

143
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:08,772
Of course.
What else would I be saying?

144
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:11,905
- Las Vegas?
- Hold on. I heard you say "city of sin."

145
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:15,638
It is the city of Cinnamon Falls.
After the famous waterfall.

146
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,873
- Locals call it city of Cinn.
- The Strip?

147
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,314
The old mining strip
next to the campsite.

148
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:23,750
- We were gonna chase tail.
- Huge yellow-bellied marmot population.

149
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:26,823
- They love being chased.
- Long as I can set up a gun range.

150
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:30,120
Yeah. Nature's gun range.
The great outdoors.

151
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:32,422
Hey. You okay, buddy?

152
00:09:32,597 --> 00:09:35,498
I know that you were looking forward
to partying in Vegas.

153
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,259
I knew we were going to Vecas.

154
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:38,933
This place is amazing.

155
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:41,265
They grow magic fungus up in them
there hills.

156
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,798
I'm gonna find some.

157
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:45,340
- Maybe chase a little tail.
- That's the spirit.

158
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,740
Yeah. Let's get unpacked.

159
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:51,178
Well, I better go unpack
and rest up for the big day.

160
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:53,609
Rest up?
This is your bachelorette party.

161
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:56,618
We have to get you tired
before you can rest.

162
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:58,415
- Tired?
- Come on.

163
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:01,451
Surprise!

164
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:06,662
You didn't think I was just gonna
take you to some lame spa?

165
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,264
I tried to call the girls from
C.A.T. Squad, but they're in Libya.

166
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:13,961
I invited the Wienerlicious girls
and some friends.

167
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:16,107
Thank you. This is a very nice surprise.

168
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:19,774
It's not gonna be as crazy as Vegas,
but we'll have a few drinks...

169
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:22,675
see where the night takes us. Okay.
- Okay.

170
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:32,847
All right, boys.

171
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,521
Get ready for the bachelor party hike.

172
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:38,458
I figure we can forage for our supper
out there.

173
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:41,056
I do not forage.

174
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,168
Okay, look, guys,
I know this isn't exactly Las Vegas...

175
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:46,736
but Awesome worked hard
putting this together.

176
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:48,896
Admire the man
for sticking to strategy.

177
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:51,668
- Sure.
- And a hike sounds pretty invigorating.

178
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:54,505
- I've never hiked in a tie.
- I know, right? Yeah.

179
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,648
Get the blood pumping.
It could be just as fun as Vegas.

180
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,552
Because this weekend is...
It's about bonding after all, isn't it?

181
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,245
No. No, it isn't.

182
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:06,822
Not at all.
It's about steaks and gambling...

183
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:10,393
getting into weird stuff that might
haunt you the rest of your life.

184
00:11:10,595 --> 00:11:15,362
Amen. Michael, may I have a word
with you over by that crappy tree?

185
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:17,963
Listen. I have a plan.

186
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,728
Don't bother telling me. I'm in.

187
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:21,497
All right.

188
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:24,039
You were the best Wiener girl.

189
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:32,578
Chuck, the secure CIA location has been
compromised and we need to bring in...

190
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:38,519
the Orion computer immediately.
Call me, tell me where your sister keeps it.

191
00:11:39,357 --> 00:11:40,881
Okay, game time.

192
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,357
Let's give our bride-to-be
a toilet paper dress.

193
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,729
Listen, can we please talk? I want...

194
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:49,900
Ellie, wait. We need to talk.
Okay, no. Ellie, this...

195
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:51,126
This can't wait. My...

196
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,100
My employer knows
about your father's computer...

197
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:58,367
and I have to take it
to a secure location right now.

198
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:01,770
Why? What happened?

199
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:10,050
The signal is coming
from a mile up the road.

200
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,585
Nothing to be alarmed about.
The CIA had a breach of security...

201
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:19,423
and your dad's computer
could be involved.

202
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:22,531
I should've known something like this
would happen. Sorry.

203
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,931
I was accessing a lot of weird stuff.

204
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:28,664
Something about an Agent X
and an Intersect program. I hid it in here.

205
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:39,914
This isn't my bag. This is Devon's.
He must have taken it by mistake.

206
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:43,646
It's okay. Nothing to worry about.
Nobody is in any danger.

207
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:44,846
Okay.

208
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:57,525
Sarah Walker?

209
00:12:58,503 --> 00:12:59,868
Lock and load.

210
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,011
- Ellie, what do I do?
- Oh, go, go, go. Ha-ha-ha.

211
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:16,945
Ellie...

212
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:19,288
Oh, okay. Yeah.

213
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:21,049
You mind if I make a phone call?

214
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,491
- Ooh.
- Yeah!

215
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:26,195
Uh... Okay. Um...

216
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:28,298
I'm sorry. I don't mean to look at...

217
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:30,627
I'm sorry. Okay. Um...

218
00:13:32,237 --> 00:13:36,970
Ahem. General, I need you to put me in
touch with our agents in Las Vegas.

219
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,244
Ooh. Is that a gun? No.

220
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:52,016
This way.

221
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:54,189
Whew.

222
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:57,889
That's a...

223
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:01,965
- That's a pretty fantastic hike. Thanks.
- Yeah. I'm glad those other dudes...

224
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,625
found some stuff to do.
Vecas has got a lot for everyone.

225
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,329
Right in the ribs. Heh. Uh...

226
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,442
Listen, since it's just the two of us...

227
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:14,043
you mind if we talk man-to-man?
- Sure.

228
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,576
I know that you didn't take
the hard drive out of my dad's computer.

229
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,284
Sorry, Chuck. It just made Ellie so happy.
I couldn't do it to her.

230
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:26,447
I get it. I get that.
And I'm happy that she's happy.

231
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:29,354
I'm happy that she's continuing
my father's work.

232
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:32,189
It's just that these secrets, they're...

233
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:34,423
I feel like they're tearing my family apart.

234
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,226
Down, down.

235
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,803
Kill that light.

236
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:54,541
Ah.

237
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,747
Devon, why would you bring that
to my bachelor party?

238
00:14:58,923 --> 00:15:02,381
Oh, no.
I must've grabbed Ellie's bag.

239
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,460
This is the device Miss Volkoff wants.

240
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:06,424
It has all the Agent X files.

241
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:07,989
Vivian Volkoff?

242
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,896
We can't let her access
the information on that computer.

243
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,627
Sweep the woods.

244
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:14,499
Leave no witnesses.

245
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:16,836
Hey.

246
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:19,434
You guys here for the bachelor party?

247
00:15:21,513 --> 00:15:22,673
Whoa.

248
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:24,906
Awesome brought entertainment.

249
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:35,816
Do you like this?

250
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:38,519
Because I got three more
where that came from.

251
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:50,337
- They must've tracked the laptop.
- Who's this Vivian Volkoff?

252
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:53,341
- It's a long story.
- Pretty easy. It's Chuck's nemesis.

253
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:57,208
He put her old man behind bars,
she sent an assassin to blow up Castle.

254
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:59,441
What about Agent X?

255
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:02,010
I think I might be Agent X.

256
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:09,491
I am so sorry that I let Ellie touch
your dad's computer.

257
00:16:09,661 --> 00:16:12,186
I'm so sorry I let this guy plan
your bachelor party.

258
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,825
This is so awful.

259
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:15,966
Oh, yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

260
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:21,831
Let's get this party started. Ha-ha-ha.

261
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,699
My sentiments exactly.

262
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:33,477
- The CIA cracked the encryption.
- I'll upload the files to Miss Volkoff.

263
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,310
Yeah. But first,
find out how much he knows.

264
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:40,219
And if he doesn't talk,
see that he never talks again.

265
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:46,723
- Welcome back.
- You know why I'm here, don't you?

266
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:50,356
Is it because I've been a bad boy?

267
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:53,864
Ha. What's in the shooter?

268
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:55,835
Sodium pentathol.

269
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:58,100
- Truth serum.
- Freaky.

270
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:00,904
I don't think that'll mix
with what I'm on.

271
00:17:04,883 --> 00:17:08,580
They're torturing him. Lester and Big Mike
can wander in any second.

272
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:11,244
- We gotta do something.
- Yeah. Casey, what's the...?

273
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:24,596
- Who was that?
- Mercenaries.

274
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,862
Ex-Green Berets,
judging by their tactics.

275
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:28,801
I count three. Including the leader.

276
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:31,237
- Did you see that clean break?
- I can save him.

277
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:35,038
No, he's dead. And so are we
unless you three tighten up.

278
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:36,339
What's this?

279
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,847
You and Morgan are gonna find
good strong sticks and start sharpening.

280
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,781
Yes, sir. Perfect. Sharpening what?

281
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,415
Toothpicks.

282
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:47,752
Spears, idiot. I'll draw the rest of the team
out into the woods.

283
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:50,986
I'm sorry. You want us to fight
former Green Berets with spears?

284
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:54,131
Not you. You're gonna go down
to the camp and spring Jeff.

285
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,860
Happy hunting, boys.

286
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,964
Happy hunting?

287
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:04,035
Looking, looking, looking. I'm showing the
nearest casino is in Las Vegas, Nevada.

288
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,801
Did you say "Las Vecas"?

289
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,308
- I did not.
- What...? No. We have to stay local.

290
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:10,981
There's gotta be a nightclub, a bar,
a liquor store...

291
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:13,117
Vegas. Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.

292
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:15,684
- Are you saying "Vecas"?
- Don't play with me, boy.

293
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:19,345
We are getting the hell out of here.
This is not what I signed up for.

294
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:22,084
Wait. No. We can't just leave them.

295
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,161
- They may die out there.
- Take the drama down a notch.

296
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:27,988
I only care about Jeff.

297
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:42,970
- Ooh.
- What? What is it?

298
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:45,547
- A splinter, I think.
- Let me take a look.

299
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,186
There are men trying to kill us.
I can handle a little splinter...

300
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:50,878
Ooh. It hurts.

301
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,950
Morgan, you ever kill a man?

302
00:18:57,495 --> 00:19:00,987
Let me tell you something.
First one? First one's the hardest.

303
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:03,395
- There's no doubt about it.
- Wow. Really?

304
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:06,366
They don't even give me a gun
on missions, you kidding me?

305
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:11,471
I'm a doctor.
I took an oath to preserve lives.

306
00:19:11,643 --> 00:19:14,476
What about your own?
You heard Casey. It's them or it's us.

307
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:18,177
What if we met these guys
at a bar? We could be frat brothers.

308
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:21,443
Frat brothers. These are mercenaries, dude.
Drinks? Beers?

309
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:27,149
- Hear something?
- You're having first-mission jitters.

310
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:29,259
- Not my first mish.
- It's your first.

311
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:31,418
How are those spears coming?

312
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,731
You are lucky we didn't kill you with these.
They're sharp.

313
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,994
I feel so bad
for those mercenaries right now:

314
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,831
You ought to. They're dead.

315
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,996
Dead? Well, what are these for?

316
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:44,607
Kept you out of my way.

317
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:58,947
Men, what's your status?

318
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,585
Poor baby.
Looks like you're fresh out of friends.

319
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:07,492
In that case, I'm just gonna have to
come out there and kill you myself.

320
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,395
- The captive's unconscious.
- Kill him.

321
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:40,425
Ha-ha. You've had knife training.
Let me give you one final lesson.

322
00:20:52,243 --> 00:20:53,301
It's over.

323
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:01,114
It's over.

324
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,588
Sorry to interrupt your little lap dance.

325
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,435
If anyone is still alive...

326
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:24,169
meet me at the extraction point.

327
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:26,503
- What's going on?
- Jeff's having a bad trip.

328
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:29,612
- Gotta get out of Vecas.
- Good thing you came to your senses.

329
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:32,409
- Come on.
- Best bachelor party ever. Vecas, baby.

330
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,982
Yeah.

331
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,461
Hey, where have you been?
Beckman sent a team to Vegas.

332
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:50,226
- They've been looking for you.
- Yeah. Wrong Vegas.

333
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:53,063
So where's Orion's laptop?
Beckman thought...

334
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:55,831
Vivian Volkoff sent a team for it.
Tried to kill us.

335
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:58,942
I've gotta tell Ellie.
If I didn't grab the wrong bag...

336
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,170
you girls would've been ambushed.
- Ellie deserves to know.

337
00:22:02,346 --> 00:22:05,804
I'll tell her. I feel responsible
that the CIA used her to find Agent X.

338
00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:07,473
No, I'll tell her.

339
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:13,987
But then you'll have to tell her the truth
about you.

340
00:22:15,393 --> 00:22:16,883
I know.

341
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,129
What are you doing home?

342
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:32,831
Uh... I had to cut the bachelor party short.

343
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,843
There's something
that's been on my mind.

344
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:37,878
What is it?

345
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:42,944
We've always been able
to tell each other anything, right?

346
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,248
Lately, I felt like...

347
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:49,552
- Like there's something in the way.
- Yes.

348
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:52,195
Our family is so full of secrets.

349
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:54,888
Too many secrets.
I mean, our parents alone...

350
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:58,866
And I don't think there should be
any secrets between the two of us.

351
00:22:59,036 --> 00:23:01,504
I've been working on something.
I didn't tell you...

352
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:06,041
I know about Dad's laptop
and his research. Mom told me.

353
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:07,810
So why are we here?

354
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:13,377
You're still a spy.

355
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:16,213
I had a whole speech
and you just figured that out.

356
00:23:16,387 --> 00:23:18,548
You can't figure that out by yourself.

357
00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:20,156
I think I just did.

358
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:23,089
You just Rubik's cubed me, sis.

359
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:28,687
Of course you still work for the CIA.
Sarah is a spy.

360
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,596
You're clearly built for better things
than the Buy More.

361
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:37,863
- You're not mad?
- I'm not mad that you did it.

362
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,806
I'm mad you didn't tell me.
I get it. The same reason...

363
00:23:40,978 --> 00:23:43,742
I kept Dad's computer a secret
from you.

364
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:49,275
Us Bartowskis, when we're good
at something, we just jump right in.

365
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:51,755
No more secrets, though.

366
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:55,085
One more little secret.

367
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:07,969
Wow, look at this place.

368
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:13,006
What are you guarding here
that's so important?

369
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:16,374
Uh... Well...

370
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,306
me.

371
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,512
You know that Intersect project
that Dad was working on?

372
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,722
Yeah. I've been trying to figure it out
for weeks.

373
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:28,489
It's in my head.

374
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,661
What? No.

375
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,698
Morgan, katana sword, please.

376
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,629
Oh, yes. Yes.

377
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:39,667
- Katana?
- Yeah.

378
00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:41,964
- Full speed or half speed?
- Full speed.

379
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:43,902
Okay. Okay.

380
00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:47,840
Banzai!

381
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:19,106
Hai!

382
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:25,510
Sleeveless. It's a bit '80s,
but I like this look.

383
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:28,910
Pretty cool, right?

384
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:33,049
Our dad was amazing.

385
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,254
He did it.

386
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:40,263
He actually figured out a way
to program the human brain using...

387
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:43,559
What happened?

388
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,901
I was gonna use this to find Agent X.

389
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,506
You found him. You're looking
at the first human Intersect. It's me.

390
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,905
No. Not unless he gave it to you
before you were born.

391
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:54,977
November 21st, 1980.

392
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,478
There was an Intersect before Chuck?

393
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:00,344
From what I can piece together...

394
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,954
Dad used this program to input
a new identity into an operative.

395
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,080
So Agent X could go undercover.

396
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:09,454
But once undercover, something
went wrong. The program took over.

397
00:26:09,627 --> 00:26:11,788
He became his cover identity.

398
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:13,960
Dad must've felt responsible for it...

399
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:16,827
that's why he spent his whole life
looking for him.

400
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:25,809
Not that that's gonna happen now.

401
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:31,612
Ellie, I haven't spent 10 years
in the Nerd Herd for nothing.

402
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,247
Morgan, get my tools.

403
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:35,351
Yes, sir, of course.

404
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:36,944
What tools?

405
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:40,955
- For fixing computers.
- Tools for fixing computers, coming up.

406
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:47,931
Well, I might as well get started
on this inventory.

407
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:50,431
Somehow my cover story
became the truth.

408
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:56,268
Hold on a second.

409
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,534
Let me ask you two a question.

410
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,135
Who am I?

411
00:27:01,946 --> 00:27:03,311
- You're Big Mike.
- No.

412
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:05,176
I'm Rain...

413
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:08,611
of Earth, Wind, Fire and Rain.

414
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:12,783
And Rain does not waste
a free party pass.

415
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:14,151
Neither does Thunder.

416
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:19,125
- Is that name taken?
- Okay, wait, wait.

417
00:27:19,296 --> 00:27:21,662
- Are we gonna go to the real Vegas?
- No.

418
00:27:21,832 --> 00:27:23,356
- Well, then...
- Me and the boys...

419
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:28,062
had a standing engagement in a city
that makes Vegas look like the Vatican.

420
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:30,804
What is this mythical place?

421
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:33,734
Go get my Corolla.

422
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:36,342
We're going to The Big Dirty.

423
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:37,572
Reno.

424
00:28:05,242 --> 00:28:06,834
Got it.

425
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:12,014
Here are the files. Dad must've collected
everything there was on Agent X.

426
00:28:12,183 --> 00:28:14,117
For what it's worth.

427
00:28:15,052 --> 00:28:16,849
His whole file's been redacted.

428
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:19,819
- Except for a name. Hartley.
- He did leave something else.

429
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,391
I have no idea what it means
or if it's some sort of clue.

430
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:35,101
- Ah. I know where that is.
- What? How?

431
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,133
The Intersect. Incredible.

432
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:42,711
- Yeah.
- Heh.

433
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:46,777
Ellie, look at that date.

434
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,748
A week before Agent X went missing.

435
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:53,853
Maybe took the photo as keepsake
before his final mission?

436
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,322
This place must be special for him.
Maybe home.

437
00:28:56,627 --> 00:28:58,219
Or some kind of safe house.

438
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:01,764
Agent X has been hiding out there
for 30 years?

439
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,368
What's going on?

440
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:12,441
Well, Ellie, we're not the only ones
trying to find Agent X.

441
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:15,943
The people who put that hole
in Dad's laptop, they're after him too.

442
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:17,171
I'm coming with you.

443
00:29:17,348 --> 00:29:20,112
- What, are you crazy?
- Baby Clara.

444
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,885
- What about you?
- Don't worry about it. It's what I do.

445
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:37,027
- Hasn't changed in 30 years.
- Looks like somebody's still living there.

446
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:39,519
If this guy has been hiding
all these years...

447
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:42,461
he might not take too well
to being found.

448
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:52,770
Oh, hello. May I help you?

449
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:54,707
Heh. Uh...

450
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:58,076
So sorry to disturb you, ma'am,
but our car has just broken down.

451
00:29:58,249 --> 00:29:59,807
And I was looking in the boot...

452
00:30:00,084 --> 00:30:01,176
The bonnet.

453
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:03,377
Long story short we're stranded.

454
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:04,953
Could we please use your phone?

455
00:30:05,356 --> 00:30:09,292
Oh, of course. Come in. I'll make
some tea while you wait for the lorry.

456
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,020
- Thank you.
- That way.

457
00:30:12,196 --> 00:30:14,061
Cheers, lovely. Heh.

458
00:30:19,937 --> 00:30:22,667
- What's taking her so long?
- Will you relax, Casey?

459
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,603
You don't think
she's Agent X, do you?

460
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:26,243
I don't know who she is.

461
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,901
That old bird could be poisoning our tea
as we speak.

462
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,172
Here we are.

463
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:32,846
Nice cup of tea.

464
00:30:33,818 --> 00:30:36,616
Now, get it while it's hot.

465
00:30:36,888 --> 00:30:38,856
And this one is for you.

466
00:30:39,023 --> 00:30:40,581
Thank you.

467
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,534
Delicious, thank you.

468
00:31:02,213 --> 00:31:03,840
So where are you all from?

469
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:05,539
Not far from here, actually.

470
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:08,913
I was just showing my fiancé
the countryside before the wedding.

471
00:31:09,086 --> 00:31:11,247
- He's American, of course.
- Mm.

472
00:31:11,422 --> 00:31:13,788
And this handsome young man?

473
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:17,583
He is a hitchhiker we picked up
on the edge of town.

474
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:21,027
Yeah. He had such a nice face,
we figured, what the hell?

475
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,995
I was just telling my fiancé
my father had a friend...

476
00:31:24,168 --> 00:31:26,363
who lived here, actually.
- In this house?

477
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:27,936
Oh, how interesting.

478
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:31,040
Yes, I believe his name was Hartley.
Any relation to you?

479
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:33,734
Oh, no. I'm just an old spinster.

480
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:39,275
But I do know the man
you're referring to.

481
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,940
He was the previous tenant.

482
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:43,780
Bit of a recluse,
judging by the way he left the place.

483
00:31:43,955 --> 00:31:45,820
Oh, do you know what happened
to him?

484
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,423
No, I'm afraid not.

485
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,759
Well, thank you for the tea.

486
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:53,425
Maybe we should go
and wait for the tow truck.

487
00:31:53,598 --> 00:31:57,432
But he did leave behind
a box of personal effects.

488
00:31:57,702 --> 00:32:01,433
Oh, I'd forgotten all about it.
I mean, it has been 30 years.

489
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:05,435
- Oh, well, I'd hate to bother you.
- No, you're welcome to it.

490
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,738
Well, if your fiancé would kindly
give me a hand.

491
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:10,446
I believe it's a bit heavy.

492
00:32:10,615 --> 00:32:12,276
I would love to.

493
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:22,689
Oh, wait here while I grab a torch.

494
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,828
Oh, delightful.

495
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:48,643
Tell me who you are
and what you want with my son.

496
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:50,980
Before you make me go ruin
my wallpaper.

497
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:55,114
Ma'am, I'm here to help your son.
I'm here to help Hartley. I'm with the CIA.

498
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:58,592
So you're saying you work
for the people who took my son?

499
00:32:58,763 --> 00:32:59,957
Give me your sidearm.

500
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:01,930
I actually don't carry a gun.

501
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:04,567
Hartley should never have been
sent undercover.

502
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:05,895
He was a scientist.

503
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,698
When the CIA couldn't bring him in,
they disavowed him.

504
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:10,969
No one lifted a finger.

505
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:15,203
They did, they did. My father, he spent
his entire career trying to find Hartley.

506
00:33:18,282 --> 00:33:20,147
You're Stephen Bartowski's boy?

507
00:33:22,553 --> 00:33:23,645
You knew my dad?

508
00:33:23,821 --> 00:33:25,152
Of course.

509
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:27,416
He and Hartley were quite close.

510
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:32,825
Are you gonna fix my son?

511
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:43,266
This is the place.

512
00:33:45,343 --> 00:33:48,369
Looks like someone beat us to it.
Move out.

513
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:50,936
Not bad.

514
00:34:03,728 --> 00:34:06,219
Great. We're outgunned and outmanned.

515
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:10,533
What are you waiting for, laddie?
Lay down some fire.

516
00:34:14,939 --> 00:34:17,840
- Who are these people?
- Mercenaries. Must've followed us.

517
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:21,274
They're not after you. They're after
the same thing you came for.

518
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:22,935
Hartley's spy will.

519
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:28,483
Oh, here.

520
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:31,712
There's a vault in the cellar.
You'll find the spy will there.

521
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:33,784
Go.

522
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:36,921
Oh, put down that damn peashooter.

523
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:39,892
I've got a real gun in this chest.

524
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:44,091
There. I was prepared
for something like this.

525
00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:46,895
You know how to feed
one of these things?

526
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:49,004
Please. You're feeding me.

527
00:34:56,814 --> 00:35:01,183
Where would you put a spy will? Uh...

528
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:07,247
There go my primroses.

529
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:09,086
Eat lead, you bastards.

530
00:35:39,924 --> 00:35:41,949
- There it is.
- Here we go.

531
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:43,616
Let's go.

532
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:50,864
Eh. We're out. Now what?

533
00:35:51,202 --> 00:35:53,500
We'll have to scuttle the house.

534
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:56,569
Go, go, go.

535
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,347
Like the mother I never had.

536
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:07,013
Oh, and charming to boot.

537
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:11,015
Come on. Let's go find your team,
so we can get out the back door.

538
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,829
- What's she doing?
- You don't wanna know.

539
00:36:26,904 --> 00:36:27,996
Ready?

540
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:37,612
Oh, no.

541
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:01,770
- Ha-ha.
- You remind me of my son.

542
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:04,999
He didn't care much for guns either.

543
00:37:05,643 --> 00:37:10,137
Whatever it was in this box,
I hope it's what you're looking for. Ha-ha.

544
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,304
I love this woman.

545
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:20,052
Only a few more hours
till we hit Reno.

546
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:23,716
Reno? More like Reen-yes.

547
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:26,727
Won't know what hit them
when we pull up in my luxurious...

548
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:30,333
yet practical automobile.
- Yes, it is practical.

549
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,333
Oh, man, this is my jam.

550
00:37:33,904 --> 00:37:35,462
- This yours?
- Whoo!

551
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:37,138
Reno, here we come.

552
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:41,574
Who's that lady
Coming down the road

553
00:37:41,745 --> 00:37:46,682
Who's that lady
I'll be your non-stop lover

554
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:51,116
Get it while you can
Your non-stop miracle

555
00:37:51,288 --> 00:37:53,483
I'm your man

556
00:37:53,657 --> 00:37:57,423
Get outta my dreams

557
00:37:57,595 --> 00:38:01,691
- Get into my car
- Get into my car

558
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:05,631
Get outta my dreams
Get in the back seat, baby

559
00:38:05,803 --> 00:38:08,897
- Get into my car
- Beep, beep, yeah

560
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,706
Get outta my mind

561
00:38:13,077 --> 00:38:16,274
- We're here.
- Really? Whoo! Whoo!

562
00:38:16,447 --> 00:38:18,938
- Yeah.
- Whoo! Whoo!

563
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:29,426
- Jeffrey, this isn't Reno.
- Um, yeah, it is.

564
00:38:33,097 --> 00:38:35,065
- Good Lord.
- Ugh.

565
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:36,893
I can't believe this is happening.

566
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,932
- You're welcome.
- Aah!

567
00:38:39,803 --> 00:38:42,636
No, no, no. I blame you, Michael.

568
00:38:42,806 --> 00:38:43,898
Wait.

569
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:46,201
Stop killing. Stop the killing.

570
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:50,141
What's that over yonder?

571
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:56,251
Boys, we're here.

572
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:58,746
Let's make it snow.

573
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,658
Remember, boys, joker's worth 13.

574
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:15,927
Are we waiting for a code from the CIA
to open it or something?

575
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:19,169
I was waiting to open it with you.

576
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:25,107
So the identity of Agent X
is inside that box.

577
00:39:25,382 --> 00:39:27,247
Our dad's obsession.

578
00:39:27,418 --> 00:39:29,409
The whole reason our family fell apart.

579
00:40:02,886 --> 00:40:04,217
What?

580
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:06,116
Volkoff?

581
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:09,618
Agent X is Alexei Volkoff?

582
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:13,957
I know this man. Mom brought him
to the house for Thanksgiving. He's a spy.

583
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:15,393
No. Not exactly.

584
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:19,702
He's locked up now, but Alexei Volkoff
is a powerful, evil arms dealer.

585
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,033
But he wasn't. That's the thing.
Volkoff was a cover identity.

586
00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:26,074
In reality, he was a scientist
who didn't like using guns.

587
00:40:26,243 --> 00:40:27,870
So Dad's original Intersect...

588
00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:31,242
created one of the world's
most dangerous criminals for the CIA?

589
00:40:31,415 --> 00:40:32,507
We should talk to Mom.

590
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:35,151
Maybe she was trying to fix him
in her own way.

591
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:36,547
We need to call Beckman...

592
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,587
see what our next step is.
- No. We tell no one.

593
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:43,921
Interrogation room. Now.

594
00:40:46,997 --> 00:40:50,763
It ends here. We're all gonna pretend
we never saw this.

595
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:53,334
My dad wanted Chuck and me
to figure this out.

596
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,665
- There must be a reason.
- The CIA created...

597
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:58,307
one of the most murderous men
in the world.

598
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:01,774
Powerful people spent an enormous
amount of energy covering that up.

599
00:41:01,945 --> 00:41:03,913
If they find out we know...

600
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:07,949
they order a guy like me to put a bullet
in each one of our heads.

601
00:41:12,823 --> 00:41:16,554
Pretty sure your dad didn't want this
to end that way.

602
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:23,259
So we're to just sweep this thing
under the rug?

603
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:26,296
Ellie, we're talking about the CIA.

604
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,529
- There are rules.
- What about Dad?

605
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:31,640
What? What if his plan
was just to get us to search together?

606
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:35,404
We haven't exactly been the most
honest siblings the past couple of years.

607
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:40,977
No, we haven't.

608
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:44,609
But this search,
it made us rely on each other.

609
00:41:45,322 --> 00:41:48,416
Be honest, work together.

610
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:52,090
What if that was only half of it?

611
00:41:52,563 --> 00:41:55,031
I don't think
that we're supposed to stop here.

612
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,394
I don't think we're supposed
to find Agent X.

613
00:41:57,568 --> 00:41:59,968
We're supposed to fix him.

614
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:05,669
This isn't for the CIA to solve, Chuck.

615
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:10,169
I think this is for us.
