1
00:00:02,038 --> 00:00:04,700
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things
you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:09,971
I'm not gonna fight you on this anymore.
If you trust her, that's enough for me.

3
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:12,579
Your father never wanted you to see this.

4
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:14,011
See what?

5
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:19,980
Flash, come on.

6
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:22,482
My mom did something to me
with that device.

7
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:24,455
You mom gave us a way out.

8
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:27,755
Sarah, I can't flash.
The Intersect is gone.

9
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,257
We're in a real mess,
Agent Bartowski.

10
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:36,192
Your trust in Agent Frost proved
a colossal error.

11
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:38,057
I know I screwed up, general.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,222
If she weren't my mom, I would have
shown much better judgment.

13
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:44,246
Which is why you haven't
been ejected from the agency.

14
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:47,015
But Agent Frost
is extremely dangerous.

15
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:50,550
She and Alexei Volkoff
are now top priorities for capture.

16
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:54,664
Agent Walker, Interpol reported
a sighting of them in Istanbul.

17
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,094
Move out immediately.

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,470
- What about me?
- Until the Intersect is working...

19
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:04,733
you're Chuck's shadow, in Burbank.

20
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:11,145
Uh, general? I'm sorry.

21
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:15,309
I'm sorry, but are you saying
that the Intersect can, in fact, be fixed?

22
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:18,979
Our scientists think
your mother used a suppression device.

23
00:01:19,157 --> 00:01:20,818
There could be countermeasures.

24
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:24,519
So it's only been suppressed.
It's not gone, like "gone" gone?

25
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:26,163
I'm not a scientist, Chuck.

26
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:29,630
But you're about to meet a lot.
You can ask them.

27
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:34,437
This is pretty snug.

28
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:37,973
The Intersect is an implanted collection
of memories.

29
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:40,509
A suppression device hides
those memories...

30
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:44,375
under what you might call
a psychological rock.

31
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,983
We need to find that rock
and remove it.

32
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,377
Here we go.

33
00:01:57,362 --> 00:01:58,727
Ooh.

34
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:25,888
What was the point of the water?
I was just wondering.

35
00:02:33,398 --> 00:02:34,524
Mm-mm.

36
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,568
All right.

37
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,575
And that's day 31.

38
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:51,874
Great session, fellas.

39
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:03,060
The file you requested, Mr. Bartowski.

40
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:05,757
Thanks, Greta.

41
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:10,193
Is it strange that all of the new
employees have been named Greta?

42
00:03:16,274 --> 00:03:17,764
As long as they're spicy.

43
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:20,240
That's strange
that you don't find that strange.

44
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:24,711
But speaking of strange. You've been
giving off some real sad sack vibes lately.

45
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:28,613
Bit of a whiny wuss, if you ask me.

46
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:32,022
Do you ever wonder
if this is all life is gonna be?

47
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:36,450
You know, Buy More? Burbank?
Are the best years behind us?

48
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:37,652
- Whoa, whoa.
- Wow.

49
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,729
- That sounds like candor.
- Yeah, no.

50
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:42,559
Yes. No. Yeah, no.
I mean, I can handle candor.

51
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:44,964
I'm an emotional man.
But candor from you?

52
00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:47,297
No-ski, Bartowski. No interest.

53
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:49,940
- You knew that.
- I must be worse off than I thought.

54
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:51,132
I don't know why.

55
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:54,437
My life would be a never-ending
Cialis commercial if I had her.

56
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,261
- Hey.
- Hey.

57
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,657
You look gorgeous.

58
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,029
- How was, uh?
- Russia this time?

59
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:20,693
I wish I had good news.

60
00:04:20,872 --> 00:04:23,670
There's no sign of your mom
or Volkoff anywhere.

61
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:25,832
- What about his headquarters?
- Boarded up.

62
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,205
For the last month,
every trail has gone cold.

63
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,176
They're underground. Any luck with...?

64
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:31,838
Tests?

65
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:33,176
You'd have heard.

66
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:37,151
And by that I mean you'd have heard
my giant sigh of relief, even in Moscow.

67
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:39,654
- Ha, ha.
- You'll get it back soon enough.

68
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:41,849
When? What's the timeline?

69
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:44,288
I'm hoping very soon.

70
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:46,657
Because I haven't been on a mission
in a month.

71
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:49,023
I wake up
with my trigger finger twitching.

72
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,295
It's itchy. Literally, it itches.

73
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,462
Um, all the scientists who were checking
me out, they hit a wall.

74
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,871
But they're sending a specialist in.
Should be here any minute.

75
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:00,510
- Better be good.
- Casey...

76
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:04,478
nobody wants to put the team back
together on missions more than me.

77
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,377
He's not being fair.

78
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:11,915
- Hey.
- Don't let anybody pressure you.

79
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:16,526
Hey, hey, no pressure, buddy,
but, uh, Casey is a disaster.

80
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:19,254
- Morgan.
- No, I'm worried about the guy, okay?

81
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,090
I was talking to Alex.
He went over to move furniture.

82
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:26,259
He stood there, staring at her fish tank,
muttering about an itchy trigger finger.

83
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:28,337
I need the Intersect back. I get it.

84
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:30,167
- He gets it.
- Okay.

85
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:33,708
Look, the specialist is probably here
right now, so wish me luck.

86
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:36,346
Really, really, really good luck.

87
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:48,184
Hello?

88
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:12,542
Stop! Oh!

89
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:16,579
Whoa, ho, ho. Whoo!

90
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:18,551
Amazing work, Agent Carmichael.

91
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:21,451
You've got the stones of a bull.

92
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,255
Thanks. And who might you be?

93
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,295
Agent Rye. Jim.

94
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:31,759
CIA psyops division, Langley.
Forgive the dramatic introduction...

95
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:34,734
but I need to know
what kind of man I was working with.

96
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:39,438
And you, taking on three ninjas
without the Intersect?

97
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:42,309
Impressive.

98
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,471
Thanks. Ha.

99
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:46,947
You're, uh, different
than the other scientists.

100
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:50,815
I don't believe the psychological rock
can be hoisted off the Intersect...

101
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:52,922
by watching kittens play with yarn.

102
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,321
- Huh.
- My method is physical...

103
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:59,753
psychological, painful...

104
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:01,696
brutal.

105
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:04,198
Brutal? Can't wait to get started.

106
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:07,599
Chuck, if you're serious
about restoring the Intersect...

107
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:11,674
then I promise you, at the end
of this process you will be a spy again.

108
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:13,537
Now what do you say?

109
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:15,041
You with me?

110
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,443
Let's get physical.

111
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:27,602
Chuck 4x08 - Versus the Fear of Death

112
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:04,176
Visualize for me
the rock sitting on the Intersect.

113
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:08,046
Done. It's, uh, granite, I guess.

114
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:10,048
Ooh.
With specks of marble. The kind of...

115
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:12,983
Talk to me about size.
Is it large, small?

116
00:08:13,822 --> 00:08:16,154
Large-y small? I don't know, it's... Ow.

117
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:19,721
- What was that for?
- We're starting with pain therapy.

118
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:23,160
That was the required dose
to lift a small psychological rock.

119
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:25,390
Great, great. Got it.

120
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:28,092
Small psychological rock.
Okay, good. Got it. Ow.

121
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,465
- Why?
- That was the shock for a medium.

122
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:33,899
- I need to know what I'm dealing with.
- Oh, so if it's a boulder...

123
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:37,011
are you gonna hit him with a tank?
- I have to do this.

124
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,774
- We are digging deep into my mind.
- It looks like he's hitting you.

125
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:44,515
Agent Walker, how long has it been
since you've done kempo karate?

126
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:46,884
Not since spy candidate school.

127
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:50,219
- Naihanchi one!
- Unh.

128
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:52,121
- Naihanchi two! Bear kata.
- Unh.

129
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:55,629
Old man kata. Hyah, hyah.

130
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:00,766
Well executed.

131
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:04,062
And you smell delightfully
of grapefruit.

132
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:06,940
Once we determine
the proper method of treatment...

133
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:09,942
be it fear, pain, anxiety...

134
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:13,240
this will happen with the Intersect,
like her memory of kempo.

135
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:16,748
We just have to find the right stimulus
to reactivate.

136
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,149
Agent Walker, no more interruptions.

137
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:33,799
Yes. Thank you for coming in today.
Next time, buy something.

138
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:36,804
That's all I'm...

139
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:43,242
Dude, dude, listen to me.

140
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:46,776
That new Greta just disappeared
into thin air.

141
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:48,541
- I've seen her do that before.
- Mm-hm.

142
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:49,809
I thought it was in my head.

143
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:51,976
- No.
- She also has a tail.

144
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:54,615
That is in your head.
But this disappearing...

145
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,621
isn't that highly suspicious?

146
00:09:56,792 --> 00:10:00,057
I'll answer for you.
Yes, beautiful Lester, it is.

147
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:08,829
Follow moi.

148
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:23,348
Black forest ham on honey oat
with chipotle sauce...

149
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:25,816
banana peppers and jalapeños?
- See?

150
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:28,684
No Buy More employee
is that sophisticated.

151
00:10:57,653 --> 00:10:59,086
Oh.

152
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,816
God, you got beaten to a pulp.

153
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,857
Yeah, well, neuroscience hurts.

154
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:07,393
You know, I don't know
about Agent Rye's method.

155
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:09,496
He seems a little unorthodox.

156
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:12,998
Well, yes, granted. No question
about that. But he's doing his best.

157
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:16,569
And I'm willing to endure pain
if it means getting the Intersect back.

158
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:19,366
Chuck, your physical and mental health
are important too.

159
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,565
Ah, ah, ah.

160
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:22,334
Why are my earlobes sore?

161
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:24,570
Okay, I think I know how to fix this.

162
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:26,270
Oh. Ahem.

163
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:31,615
Oh.

164
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:33,277
Oh, yeah.

165
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:36,015
I should get beat up more often.

166
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:42,022
Chuck, this, um, treatment,
the experiments...

167
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:44,722
promise me you're not doing it
for me or us.

168
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,300
No. No, I'm doing it for the team.

169
00:11:47,803 --> 00:11:49,964
No, I just...

170
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:54,472
I've never been a spy without the
Intersect. And I quite like being a spy.

171
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:58,608
Doing great things, doing them with you.
I want that back.

172
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,409
You don't need the Intersect to do
great things. You're great on your own.

173
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:05,116
But am I a spy?

174
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:08,746
Yes.
Yes, but you're Chuck Bartowski...

175
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:11,290
and you do that all on your own.

176
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:15,060
Massage oil should be warm.
I'll be right back.

177
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:32,912
I think we should start
with some top half.

178
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:37,452
- Aah!
- Honey, we have company.

179
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:43,119
What happened?
Did you flash?

180
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:45,454
What the hell is going on?

181
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:47,322
What the hell is going on?

182
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:48,588
Did you flash?

183
00:12:48,764 --> 00:12:51,232
- Yes or no?
- What are you doing in our bedroom?

184
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:54,502
Since our pain experiments failed,
your fault, not mine...

185
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:58,628
I think the key to restarting
the Intersect is fear.

186
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:01,139
What are you doing in our home?

187
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:04,836
The castle's a safety zone.
And apparently this place is too.

188
00:13:05,781 --> 00:13:09,376
Chuck feels protected by you.
We need to up the ante, again.

189
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:11,018
PFOD.

190
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:12,676
P-F?

191
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:13,946
Pfod?

192
00:13:14,122 --> 00:13:15,316
Pure fear of death.

193
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,856
We need uncut, pure,
adrenalized fear...

194
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:20,324
rocketing through your plasma
right now.

195
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:23,896
This was close,
but, hey, that could be the cure.

196
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:32,803
Holy...! Ha-ha.

197
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:35,467
Boy, you scared me half to death. L...

198
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:37,908
Two civilian employees
have been watching me.

199
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,478
I'm getting annoyed by this.

200
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:41,843
I have a way of dealing
with annoying things.

201
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:44,383
It's pleasant. But only for me.

202
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:46,646
Oh, I see.

203
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:50,189
And, uh, could you tell me
which two civilians...

204
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:52,423
might, uh, that be?

205
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,892
Why'd I even bother?
Of course, I will keep an eye on them.

206
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:04,932
Okay.

207
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:10,567
- Go home. Go home.
- You go home.

208
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:12,838
- Get out of here.
- This way.

209
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:16,507
Chuck can't go on a mission
without Intersect. That's insane.

210
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:20,883
As well as being an expert psyops
operative and neurological Ph. D...

211
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:23,616
Agent Rye is a fully trained
field operative.

212
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:27,784
If he thinks the Intersect will be restored
on a mission, he's going.

213
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:31,399
And a mission just hit our radar,
Agent Rye. I think it fits your bill.

214
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,227
- Is it dangerous?
- Incredibly.

215
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,028
- Chance of violence?
- Guaranteed.

216
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:37,805
- Great.
- This is not great. This is crazy.

217
00:14:37,973 --> 00:14:40,271
Agent Walker,
this is what Chuck wants.

218
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:42,537
Right, Chuck?

219
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:45,705
Whatever it takes
to get the Intersect back.

220
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:49,650
Chuck and Agent Rye will be
going to a chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland...

221
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:52,115
for the auction
of a 100-carat diamond...

222
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:53,914
the Cane Volto.

223
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:57,820
Our intelligence indicates leaders
of criminal and terrorist organizations...

224
00:14:57,993 --> 00:14:59,927
plan to attend the auction.

225
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,756
This stone is more than it seems.

226
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,797
Method for money laundering,
payment for illegal weapons.

227
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,866
- Yeah, we've done this before.
- Thanks.

228
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:08,663
Ooh.

229
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:13,137
Chuck, your job is to win the auction
and bring the stone back to the U.S.

230
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:17,738
A room full of underworld killers.
Sounds great, right?

231
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:20,677
- Casey and I will be there as a backup?
- No.

232
00:15:21,182 --> 00:15:24,310
No. With them in Gstaad,
Chuck will never reach maximum fear.

233
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:27,478
Walker, you and Casey will monitor
the mission from Castle.

234
00:15:27,656 --> 00:15:28,816
What?

235
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,185
Chuck is going alone
with Agent Rye?

236
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:33,759
I'll be able to flash
if there's no safety net.

237
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:36,329
Yes, Chuck,
but then there's no safety net.

238
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,292
We got a plane to catch.
Let's move out.

239
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,834
- Wish me luck?
- Chuck, don't.

240
00:15:49,144 --> 00:15:51,135
Don't be a hero.

241
00:15:51,313 --> 00:15:52,905
Just come home safe to me, okay?

242
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:13,998
Quite a tableau.

243
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,799
Sometimes the scenery makes me cry.

244
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:24,170
Isn't it amazing being a spy?

245
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:27,411
I wish Sarah was here.

246
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:32,409
Not in, uh, an official capacity,
of course.

247
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:36,515
The only way in or out
of the chalet is the gondola.

248
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:39,319
Things go south, we're trapped.

249
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:44,454
You'll produce enough adrenalized fear
to lift a car, let alone restart the Intersect.

250
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:49,497
He's a big boy, Walker.

251
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:53,198
Yeah, Chuck's never been on a mission
without the Intersect.

252
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:57,442
Tell me, honestly, if things go wrong,
do you think that he can handle himself?

253
00:16:57,612 --> 00:17:00,445
I don't know. But I know he'll try.

254
00:17:00,615 --> 00:17:02,606
Which is exactly what worries me.

255
00:17:02,784 --> 00:17:05,116
I'm just gonna just check in again.

256
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:07,686
For the sixth time.

257
00:17:09,457 --> 00:17:10,685
Chuck, are you there yet?

258
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,554
Yeah, we're here.

259
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:16,489
Sarah, Switzerland is amazing.

260
00:17:16,664 --> 00:17:19,462
Other than the fact
that this place is populated...

261
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:22,398
with a crowd
of international psychopaths...

262
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:27,064
the air is so fresh,
and the chocolate, so milky.

263
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:31,906
Uh, Chuck, listen, listen. If you get
cornered and you still can't flash...

264
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,638
just don't do anything crazy.

265
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:37,751
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be
just fine. I'll talk to you soon, okay?

266
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:42,182
Hey, are you sure
I don't need a disguise?

267
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:43,551
Hmm.

268
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:46,853
Someone could recognize you as CIA
and come after you with a knife.

269
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:48,518
Ha, ha. That would be great.

270
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:49,993
Ladies and gentlemen,

271
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:52,531
if you'll take
your seats, we will begin the auction.

272
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:54,593
Thank you.

273
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:03,236
The seller, Aldebert De Smet.

274
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:06,209
- Better known as the Belgian.
- Oh.

275
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:08,872
I bet I know how he likes his waffles.

276
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:13,220
Belgian. Yes, yes.

277
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:15,720
- I love your humor. So disarming.
- Oh.

278
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:21,452
De Smet is known for industrial
espionage not precious gems...

279
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:24,894
which is another reason
this auction seems odd...

280
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:26,397
aside from the crowd.

281
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:30,595
We've got underworld players
from Russia, Serbia, Montenegro.

282
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:33,138
Wow, you really know
your Euro baddies, don't you?

283
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:36,766
Focus. When you win the bidding,
your competition is not gonna be happy.

284
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:41,014
If you're lucky,
they'll follow you and try and kill you.

285
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:43,480
Fingers crossed.

286
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:45,744
- Good luck.
- No, wait.

287
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,945
You're going? I'm alone on this?

288
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:50,250
It's your best chance to flash.

289
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:54,389
- Okay.
- The Cane Volto diamond.

290
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:58,094
Very rare, 100 carats...

291
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:01,891
D colored, internally flawless.

292
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,164
Bidding starts
at 25 million Swiss francs.

293
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:08,000
Do I see 30 million? Thirty million.

294
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:09,768
Do I see 40?

295
00:19:09,944 --> 00:19:12,310
Forty. Do I see 50?

296
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:15,072
Sir, you're already the high bidder.

297
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,980
Do I see? Fifty.

298
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:19,643
Sixty?

299
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:21,618
Sixty million Swiss francs?

300
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,984
Bid again, get bullet in back.

301
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,684
Holding at 50 million?
Fifty million going once?

302
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:29,159
Nice try, Rye,
but I'm not falling for it.

303
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,992
- Going twice.
- Sixty million Swiss francs.

304
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:35,659
I'm not afraid of your phony
Russian accent or your finger gun, okay?

305
00:19:35,837 --> 00:19:39,466
- Bid again and die.
- Do I hear 65?

306
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:42,542
Ooh, let's get crazy.
Eighty million Swiss francs.

307
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,701
Eighty million to bidder number three.

308
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,278
Oh, I didn't die. What a shocker.

309
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,813
Stop fooling around, okay?
We got a job to do.

310
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:50,678
Do not bid.

311
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:55,221
Eighty then, going once...

312
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,085
One hundred million Swiss francs.

313
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:01,726
One hundred million,
ladies and gentleman.

314
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,291
Going once...

315
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:06,626
twice...

316
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:08,530
sold.

317
00:20:08,703 --> 00:20:10,227
You can go.

318
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:19,804
- I blew it.
- You absolutely blew it. And no flash, huh?

319
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:23,882
- Have you had this chocolate?
- Yes, it's so milky.

320
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:26,919
So good. Thought that Russian
would get your blood pumping.

321
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:28,486
I thought it was you.

322
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:32,148
The Russian? It was such
a horrible accent. It sounded so phony.

323
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:35,160
What kind of a spy am I?
I can't even be scared properly.

324
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,025
But listen, I had a thought.

325
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:40,531
Who carries around a hundred million
Swiss francs on them? Nobody.

326
00:20:40,702 --> 00:20:43,830
The diamond is gonna be here
until the money is transferred.

327
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,639
Until then, we can get a better look
at the thing.

328
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,234
You're good, Chuck.
Genius minds think alike.

329
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:52,777
But I say we do more
than just look at it.

330
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,778
Let's steal it.

331
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:07,426
You all know of this new Greta.

332
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:10,587
She's beautiful, yes.
And efficient, sure.

333
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:13,757
But why all the suspicious behavior?

334
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:17,928
We're forming a fact-finding mob
and we want you, my friends, involved.

335
00:21:18,106 --> 00:21:22,304
We are calling it
Operation Get-A-Greta.

336
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:26,470
The objective is to root out
why such a nefarious individual...

337
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,649
is working here at the Buy More.

338
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:31,478
Oh, crap. They're onto Greta.

339
00:21:31,653 --> 00:21:34,986
- What do we do?
- Tell Greta. She'll handle it.

340
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:36,781
Right, she'll... Wait a minute.

341
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,051
What do you mean, "She'll handle it"?
Hey.

342
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:42,321
- Who is she?
- Assassin.

343
00:21:42,764 --> 00:21:44,994
No, she'll chop them up
into a bunch of pieces.

344
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:48,066
Are you kidding me?
I mean, these are our sort-of friends.

345
00:21:48,836 --> 00:21:50,394
- Colleagues?
- Hmm.

346
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:54,098
No, huh? It doesn't matter.
No assassins. We have to handle this.

347
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:57,767
We don't have to do anything.
You're on your own.

348
00:21:57,945 --> 00:22:01,210
Come on, I thought we were a team,
you and I? A damn good one.

349
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:03,843
The team is DOA
without the Intersect working.

350
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:06,486
So why protect something
that's going up in smoke, hmm?

351
00:22:06,654 --> 00:22:09,452
You wanna waste time with these idiots?
You're on your own.

352
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:16,790
Hey, Chuck, hold on a second.

353
00:22:16,964 --> 00:22:19,023
Do you happen to have the time?

354
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:23,933
Amazing. Where did you learn that?

355
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:25,470
Star Trek.

356
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,937
Star Trek? Really?

357
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:29,633
No, not really. Bangladesh.

358
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:30,869
Meditative trancing.

359
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:33,113
The secret is mind over matter.

360
00:22:34,982 --> 00:22:36,950
- But I love the show.
- Well, who doesn't.

361
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:43,683
There is nothing in here.

362
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:49,990
Well, what are we supposed
to do now?

363
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:51,722
Now you flash.

364
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:53,799
How can I? I don't exactly fear death.

365
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:58,371
Security measures
will activate in four, three...

366
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:00,871
two, one.
- Security measures?

367
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:09,482
I've heard of this thing.

368
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,518
The temp drops about
150 degrees in 30 seconds.

369
00:23:13,688 --> 00:23:15,849
So unless you wanna become
a Chucksicle...

370
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:17,786
I suggest you flash.

371
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:34,200
It's not happening.

372
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:37,832
Concentrate.
Feel the fear lifting the rock.

373
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:39,508
No flash, no flash.

374
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:43,141
Maybe Sarah can help us.
Yeah, Sarah can help us.

375
00:23:44,817 --> 00:23:47,877
I got no service. What are we gonna do?
My teeth are freezing.

376
00:23:48,054 --> 00:23:49,817
Chuck, can you flash?

377
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:52,116
It's not happening.

378
00:23:55,328 --> 00:23:56,386
How about now?

379
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,860
Nothing.

380
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,265
How about now?

381
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:05,400
All right. Move out of the way.

382
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:19,207
I honestly thought you would flash.

383
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:21,754
You knew the combination
this whole time?

384
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:25,286
We have a mission to complete.
I came prepared.

385
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:36,295
- But I honestly wasn't prepared for this.
- There's more than one diamond.

386
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:40,862
What is going on? This has gotta be
worth billions of dollars.

387
00:24:41,574 --> 00:24:44,975
They can't just be diamonds.
On my missions, it's never just diamonds.

388
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:47,544
Yeah, you're right.
They're working some angle.

389
00:24:48,948 --> 00:24:50,381
Do you always carry a loupe?

390
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,145
Yeah, well, when I heard the mission
was diamond-related...

391
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,448
I took the liberty of grabbing a loupe
out of Castle's closet.

392
00:24:57,623 --> 00:25:00,114
I took an online gemology class
on the flight here.

393
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:01,954
It was very convenient.

394
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:06,428
Like I thought, fake. It's made of glass.
But there's something embedded inside.

395
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:09,659
Microdot.

396
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:11,497
Replace it with our phony.

397
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:16,132
This is a fake too.

398
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:19,778
Great work, Bartowski.

399
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:23,473
Now we gotta figure out what the story
is on these phony diamonds.

400
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:27,716
Rye, I don't understand.

401
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:32,148
A minute ago, I was truly fearing
for my life. Why isn't this working?

402
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:35,590
We need to explore a more sophisticated
level of fear therapy.

403
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:39,754
The psychological rock has keyed
onto a deeper anxiety...

404
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:41,465
a person...

405
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:44,035
a relationship.
- With whom?

406
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:46,335
Ah. What are you...?

407
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,137
With her.

408
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:02,953
Well, this has been a quiet lunch.

409
00:26:03,356 --> 00:26:06,223
Uh. I should let you get back
to your books.

410
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:08,451
And you back to work.

411
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:10,318
How is that going by the way?

412
00:26:11,397 --> 00:26:14,457
- What have you heard?
- Just what Morgan's told me.

413
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:17,629
That he's about ready
to have an intervention on you.

414
00:26:17,803 --> 00:26:22,001
Look, we both know you haven't been
on a mission in a while...

415
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:26,771
but I think there's a little more to this
than just an itchy trigger finger.

416
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:29,340
What gives?

417
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:36,312
I'm preparing myself psychologically...

418
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:39,887
in case I get sent back
to Afghanistan or Iraq.

419
00:26:40,393 --> 00:26:42,588
I got soft. I made friends here.

420
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:48,523
Well, you know Morgan is scared
of the team being broken up too.

421
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:52,159
And if you are transferred,
which might not even happen...

422
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:56,001
don't you think it'd be better
to be nice to your friends...

423
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:58,006
than drive them away?

424
00:26:58,177 --> 00:27:00,008
Just a thought.

425
00:27:12,225 --> 00:27:14,056
Hey, fellas.

426
00:27:14,694 --> 00:27:17,322
What are you doing?
Can you tell me what this is?

427
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,063
Not a lure for the new Greta.

428
00:27:19,232 --> 00:27:23,430
Do me a favor. You need to back off
this Greta thing. For your own good.

429
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:26,333
The operation is underway.
You can't stop this pit bull.

430
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:29,699
- He's got a taste for meat.
- Who's gonna be meat? You guys.

431
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,069
- You don't scare us.
- Yeah.

432
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:33,405
We won't be stopped.
And we can't be stopped.

433
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:35,376
And we won't be stopped.

434
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:38,716
I think I see her. Move.

435
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:41,352
- Move.
- Hey, what are you...?

436
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:47,824
Hey, now! Wow, ha-ha.

437
00:27:47,994 --> 00:27:50,121
You have to stop that.
I have a bad ticker.

438
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:52,161
This is absolutely the last straw.

439
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:55,156
They put a webcam in my locker,
bugged my price gun.

440
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:59,737
The psychotic one follows me, narrating,
"The tracking of the Greta marmot."

441
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:01,896
What does that even mean?

442
00:28:02,174 --> 00:28:05,109
Which one do you think
is the psychotic one? Doesn't matter.

443
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,270
If they discover my identity,
it'll breach national security...

444
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:11,075
and a CIA facility will be at risk.

445
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,081
It's time to neutralize the risk.

446
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:16,153
Oh, hold on a second, please.
They don't know anything, okay?

447
00:28:16,322 --> 00:28:19,291
You... Trust me, they have
the mental capacity of field mice.

448
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:23,918
They bother me again,
they meet my favorite friend.

449
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:26,923
Understood.

450
00:28:28,534 --> 00:28:31,002
I'm magnifying the microdot.

451
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,762
God only knows what's on it.

452
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:35,133
But it can't be good.

453
00:28:36,108 --> 00:28:39,168
We'll start the analysis
and send it back to the team at Castle.

454
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,116
Do you really think that Sarah is the
emotional rock sitting on the Intersect?

455
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:47,548
Why do you always call for her
before you flash?

456
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,813
You did it in the bedroom
and in the vault.

457
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:51,957
- Yeah, well, you know, I was...
- Scared.

458
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:53,784
Perfectly normal.

459
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:56,126
For a Nerd Herder.

460
00:28:56,295 --> 00:28:59,128
But a spy, Chuck,
handles his fear on his own.

461
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:01,860
- Or her own.
- Ask yourself a question.

462
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:05,231
Are you a spy
or are you a guy with a spy girlfriend?

463
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,305
I'm a spy.

464
00:29:09,475 --> 00:29:11,375
The microdot is heavily encrypted...

465
00:29:11,544 --> 00:29:14,980
but it appears to contain photographs
and blueprints for CIA assets.

466
00:29:15,147 --> 00:29:17,638
Belgian is selling our intel
to the highest bidder.

467
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:20,308
And there are
a dozen other fake diamonds.

468
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:23,182
Colonel Casey, Agent Walker,
finish decoding the intel.

469
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:27,019
Bartowski and Rye, capture the Belgian
and recover the fake stones.

470
00:29:27,193 --> 00:29:29,218
Until we know
what's on those microdots...

471
00:29:29,395 --> 00:29:32,330
this is code red
and could likely get very ugly.

472
00:29:32,498 --> 00:29:35,524
I feel it's essential I go
with Chuck and Rye to Switzerland.

473
00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:38,495
Um, I think Sarah should
let us handle this...

474
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:42,163
seeing as this is the only way
I will get the Intersect back working.

475
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:44,104
We're talking about real danger now.

476
00:29:44,276 --> 00:29:45,903
I can only handle fake danger?

477
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:49,605
I know Intersect is important but
none of Rye's therapies have worked.

478
00:29:49,782 --> 00:29:53,878
The microdot contains highly sensitive
information the wrong people will kill for.

479
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:56,578
I can take care of these people
without you holding my hand.

480
00:29:56,756 --> 00:29:58,781
Why does it make sense
to risk your life?

481
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:00,288
It's what I do, I'm a spy.

482
00:30:00,493 --> 00:30:02,222
No, Chuck, you're not.

483
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:10,535
Not right now.

484
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:15,200
The mission is best accomplished
with the proper manpower.

485
00:30:15,374 --> 00:30:18,605
Agent Walker, get to Gstaad.

486
00:30:22,415 --> 00:30:25,407
A supersonic jet will have me there
in five hours. We'll talk.

487
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:29,918
Okay? I'm sorry Chuck.
I just can't let you risk your own life.

488
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:45,697
Greta to the cage.
Greta to the cage, please.

489
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:48,169
Greta to the cage.

490
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:52,777
A delicious, though complicated,
footlong sub...

491
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:55,413
with black forest ham...

492
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:57,579
honey oat...
- No, no, no.

493
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,719
Chipotle sauce and banana peppers...
- What are you doing?

494
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:03,878
- If she doesn't kill you, I will.
...and jalapeños...

495
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,917
has been found
with your name on it.

496
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:10,459
So come to the cage.

497
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:14,759
Now we wait.

498
00:31:19,772 --> 00:31:22,468
So I see our little lure worked,
eh, Greta?

499
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:25,235
If that is your name.

500
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:27,943
Come, sit.

501
00:31:35,554 --> 00:31:38,045
What the hell are you doing, moron?

502
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:41,460
Listen to me. Mm-hm.

503
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:47,797
We can do this the hard way
or we can do this...

504
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:50,460
the way...

505
00:31:51,604 --> 00:31:54,004
that's very difficult.

506
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:56,300
Whoa, whoa, stop, guys.
Greta, guys...

507
00:31:56,475 --> 00:31:57,772
- ...quit this now.
- No.

508
00:31:57,943 --> 00:32:00,912
I have had it. This stops here and now.

509
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,105
Who are you, Greta?
And what do you know?

510
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:06,314
Okay, there it is.

511
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:09,477
There it is. We are prepared
for the knife eventuality.

512
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:11,247
- Jeffrey, please disarm her.
- No.

513
00:32:17,696 --> 00:32:19,960
Whoa, mama.

514
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:24,967
The only question is, do you wanna die
with your wig on or off?

515
00:32:25,137 --> 00:32:26,798
Are you talking about my hair?

516
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:29,440
Wait, no.
Whatever you're thinking, do not do it.

517
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:32,270
- It is not worth it.
- Stand down. Now.

518
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:34,476
Stand down.

519
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:38,911
What is going on here?

520
00:32:43,722 --> 00:32:46,282
Her locker was full of credit card slips.

521
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,688
And she was making off
with the head massagers.

522
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:51,557
She's been sneaking around
because she's a thief.

523
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:56,129
You swine. How could you do
that to me after I trusted you?

524
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:58,395
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

525
00:32:58,571 --> 00:32:59,697
Thank you. Well, done.

526
00:32:59,872 --> 00:33:01,237
- Casey, thank you.
- Mm.

527
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,171
- Okay, you're going downtown.
- Thief?

528
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:07,676
How does a thief disappear
into thin air?

529
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:11,974
There's an old walkway behind the walls
in the HTR for electrical repairs.

530
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:15,545
Should have been boarded up
after the fire, but she found it.

531
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:19,054
Why did she transmogrify
into a woodland creature?

532
00:33:19,224 --> 00:33:21,215
- Shh.
- Why does she have a tail?

533
00:33:22,728 --> 00:33:25,424
Consider that ignored.
You fellas did a great job.

534
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:27,532
Buy More thanks you.

535
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:32,766
That was intense. We caught a thief.

536
00:33:32,972 --> 00:33:37,204
And I need a change of trousers.

537
00:33:40,245 --> 00:33:44,181
Hey, hey, hey, Chuck,
I think we got a visitor. Yep.

538
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,841
The Belgian just entered the vault.

539
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:54,054
- There's no microdot.
- Evidently, we, uh, had a security breach?

540
00:33:54,226 --> 00:33:57,252
Get surveillance footage
of the vault and the hallway.

541
00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:00,023
- And meet me at the gondola.
- But the Russian buyer...

542
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:03,293
No time for that. Pack up the diamonds.
We're leaving now.

543
00:34:04,136 --> 00:34:05,228
Gondola.

544
00:34:05,404 --> 00:34:09,204
Perfect. Enclosed space, no escape.

545
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:12,401
- We'll arrest them there.
- Uh, Sarah's plane is almost here.

546
00:34:12,578 --> 00:34:14,443
Well, we can wait for her and lose him.

547
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:17,514
Or go be heroes.

548
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,815
- Let's be heroes.
- Thattaboy.

549
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:25,513
Yes.

550
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:40,837
Hey, it's Chuck.
You know what to do.

551
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:44,407
It's me again. Why aren't you getting
my calls? Call me, okay?

552
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:46,305
I love you.

553
00:34:50,582 --> 00:34:54,313
Colonel Casey,
I've admired your work for years...

554
00:34:54,486 --> 00:34:58,149
but this outpost and its personnel...

555
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,148
are unprofessional.

556
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:02,589
And I'm disappointed in you.

557
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,427
Well, listen, Agent Greta.

558
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:08,498
I don't know who you've worked with
or what crew you were on.

559
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:11,496
This is the best damn spy team
in the world.

560
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:16,073
We are strong. So do us a favor,
don't let the door hit you in the ass.

561
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:29,983
- We are strong, aren't we?
- Mm.

562
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:32,885
Yeah, even if we are missing
a few pieces.

563
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:35,356
Doesn't it feel better
being part of a team...

564
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:38,223
than always suffering alone.

565
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:41,457
Right. I always forget
the no-touch thing. Point taken.

566
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:45,201
Oh, man. Speaking of missing pieces.

567
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,901
Casey, why is Chuck on that monitor?

568
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,475
This isn't good.

569
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:57,575
- Hey.
- Chuck's on the microdot.

570
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,911
- The Belgian knows he's the Intersect.
- What?

571
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:07,751
Come on, Chuck, pick up the phone.

572
00:36:10,996 --> 00:36:12,395
- Chuck.
- Sarah.

573
00:36:12,564 --> 00:36:15,226
- Where are you?
- We're about to arrest the Belgian.

574
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,335
- If anything happens, I know I'll flash.
- The Belgian knows...

575
00:36:18,504 --> 00:36:21,132
- Walker, we can handle it from here.
- No, wait!

576
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:24,165
All right, just follow my lead.

577
00:36:24,343 --> 00:36:28,040
If we get into real trouble, you'll get us
out of it. You don't need Sarah.

578
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:30,545
This is all you.

579
00:36:33,418 --> 00:36:34,510
Last chance, Chuck.

580
00:36:34,953 --> 00:36:36,045
On or off?

581
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,254
On.

582
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,000
Aldebert De Smet,
you're coming with us.

583
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:03,141
No, no, no.
Agent Carmichael is coming with me.

584
00:37:03,315 --> 00:37:05,977
The assets in your head
is worth far more...

585
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:09,177
than the entire list embedded
in these microchips.

586
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:12,118
Surrender or die.

587
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,350
- They know I'm the Intersect.
- Scared?

588
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:16,960
Me too.

589
00:37:22,134 --> 00:37:24,694
- Drop your weapon.
- No tether, no Sarah.

590
00:37:25,003 --> 00:37:26,903
We're in it up to our chins.

591
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,540
- How we feeling, Chuck?
- Not great.

592
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:36,841
- I sort of flashed, but I'm not sure.
- All right. Well, let's find out.

593
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:55,895
Rye.

594
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,170
- Rye!
- Two hundred feet to the rocks below.

595
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,205
Talk about some serious danger, huh?

596
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,134
Ow.

597
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:11,707
Anything?

598
00:38:11,884 --> 00:38:13,374
No. No, nothing yet.

599
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:15,747
Believe me, I'm plenty terrified.
Help me up.

600
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:19,020
Sorry, Chuck, not gonna happen.

601
00:38:19,524 --> 00:38:21,253
What? No. My hands are slipping.

602
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:23,724
Rye, I may actually die right now.

603
00:38:23,896 --> 00:38:27,423
Fantastic. This is your final test.
The wind's picking up.

604
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,365
You're looking death in the face.
Only thing that can save you is Intersect.

605
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:34,801
Focus, Chuck. You can do this.

606
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:41,376
- No, this is crazy. It's not coming back.
- But you know the rock is Sarah.

607
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:45,112
Tell yourself you don't need her
and give in to the fear.

608
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:47,252
But I do need her. I love her.

609
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:50,217
I'd rather love Sarah
than have the Intersect. Help me up.

610
00:38:50,389 --> 00:38:53,688
The CIA didn't send me out here
to affirm your love, Bartowski.

611
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:57,895
You need the Intersect up and running.
Now, get that rock off your chest...

612
00:38:58,063 --> 00:39:00,293
and be a real spy like me.

613
00:39:03,568 --> 00:39:06,196
Did I just get shot?

614
00:39:06,571 --> 00:39:07,902
No, no, no.

615
00:39:08,073 --> 00:39:10,268
I certainly did.

616
00:39:14,012 --> 00:39:15,502
Grab my hand or die.

617
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:19,279
Come on.

618
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:29,116
What's going on? Where are you?

619
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:31,819
Pursue Agent Carmichael
and we will kill him.

620
00:39:32,364 --> 00:39:33,456
Slowly.

621
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,994
There will be no further warning.

622
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:38,431
No. Please wait.

623
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:48,340
General, I want immediate authorization
to hunt down this son of a bitch.

624
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:51,539
I would grant if there was indication
De Smet was in Belgium.

625
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,117
- There's no indication of his whereabouts.
- They were at Gstaad Airport.

626
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:58,984
I have a witness who saw them board
a private jet, tail number CLM...

627
00:39:59,157 --> 00:40:01,990
CLM1211. I know, Agent Walker.

628
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,288
The plane didn't just disappear.
It had to have landed somewhere.

629
00:40:05,464 --> 00:40:08,797
We put a code red out to
every clandestine agency on the planet.

630
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:12,528
The moment there's a sign of Chuck,
we'll mobilize every resource.

631
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:15,730
Colonel Casey, you've got your mission.
You're running point.

632
00:40:15,907 --> 00:40:17,067
And me?

633
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:20,540
Sarah, he's out there. We'll find him.

634
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:23,977
But until there's intel,
go home and get some rest.

635
00:40:24,149 --> 00:40:26,014
You'll be informed
of any developments.

636
00:40:26,184 --> 00:40:27,412
I'm staying right here.

637
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:30,146
You're going home. That's an order.

638
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:37,718
Bartowski's smart.
Intersect or no, he'll be fine.

639
00:40:38,196 --> 00:40:40,061
This is all my fault.

640
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,928
He did this to prove to me
that he could be a spy.

641
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:21,898
What do you want?

642
00:41:22,074 --> 00:41:23,564
I want the Intersect.

643
00:41:35,587 --> 00:41:37,555
What are you doing, Walker?

644
00:41:46,364 --> 00:41:48,059
I'm gonna go find Chuck.

645
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:49,723
We'll go together.

646
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:53,997
Wherever he is, we will find him
and we'll bring him back.

647
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:57,135
Thank you.

648
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:59,777
I don't have it, Mr. Belgian... De Smet.

649
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:03,478
It's gone. I lost it.

650
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:07,880
Please, Agent Carmichael,
don't take me for a fool.

651
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,255
The less you resist,
the less painful this will be.
