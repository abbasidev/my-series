1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,027
They say it's a personality thing...

2
00:00:05,204 --> 00:00:08,935
but to me, a martini's got gin,
not vodka.

3
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:10,735
Some folks like chocolate.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,377
I'll take vanilla.

5
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,912
I say baseball over football.

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:20,416
And to me, man's best friend
doesn't bark or fetch a ball.

7
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:23,783
See, personally, I like cats.

8
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:26,288
Meet my Clandestine Attack Team.

9
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,053
Better known as the CAT Squad.

10
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:31,093
Meow.

11
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,425
They were the best spy team
in the business.

12
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:36,363
The year, 2003.

13
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,436
The girls:

14
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,529
Cold-hearted Carina.

15
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:48,839
Zondra, the bitch!

16
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,887
Amy, the party girl.

17
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,724
And...

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,494
my pride and joy...

19
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,464
Sarah Walker.

20
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:27,477
Go get them, CATs.

21
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:28,677
Meow!

22
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,090
Buddy. Buddy, hey.
You still with me?

23
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,487
Yeah. Yeah. No. I just...

24
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,221
Your description of the CAT Squad
has sent me into fantasy land.

25
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:40,126
Don't wanna think
about what goes on there.

26
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,961
According to the CIA,
the CAT Squad was badass.

27
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,434
I hope they're tight,
because I'm running dry...

28
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,438
trying to find Sarah's friends
for our engagement party.

29
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:53,773
Really? Um, here's a crazy notion.
Ask Sarah.

30
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:58,474
Yeah, uh, not such a wild notion. It's just
that she's being very reluctant to help.

31
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,643
She's got a complicated relationship
with her family.

32
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,813
She's lost touch with friends.
But I know she'd want someone there.

33
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,154
So I'm nudging, being a good fiancé.
I'm trying to help fix things.

34
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:09,624
Got it. Good.

35
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,922
Good for you. Where do I come in?

36
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,124
Well, uh, Carina was one of the CATs.

37
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,727
"Carina" Carina?

38
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,303
- So I need her info.
- Chuck.

39
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,565
Carina? Really?

40
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:25,199
I mean, Alex is gonna be there.
Alex, Carina. Carina, Alex.

41
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,141
Two of my lovers in the same place?

44
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:38,051
Here's her phone and e-mail
and Facebook alias.

45
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:41,352
We're friends. Restricted.
I can't post or view pictures.

46
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:45,524
Go easy on her. Break this whole
Alex thing to her gently.

47
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,830
Carina's a delicate girl.

48
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:07,586
Walker in a white dress? Please.
But the CATs...

49
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:09,482
- Interesting.
- What?

50
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,418
My old spy partner's getting hitched.

51
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,718
Her fiancé wants to get
the old team together.

52
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,053
Nice.

53
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:21,261
- Hello?
- Amy, Walker's getting married.

54
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,732
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Stop screaming.

55
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,598
How do we find Zondra?

56
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,733
Hi, Sarah.

57
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,432
Hey. Heading out?

58
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,578
Yes, to the in-laws.

59
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,579
Devon's packing up the car. We're doing
a little overnight for the grandparents.

60
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,274
But we'll be back with plenty of time
for your party.

61
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,885
How's the invite list coming?

62
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,782
Done. I thought.

63
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,958
I told Chuck that I didn't
really have anyone to invite...

64
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,459
but he has this big idea now
that he wants to discuss with me.

65
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,097
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

66
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,234
I'm excited for the party,
but digging into the past...

67
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,835
old friends and family, it's, um...

68
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,595
It's a bit complicated for me.

69
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,570
- And Chuck just dives right in.
- Head first.

70
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,800
I could talk to him.

71
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:07,412
No, I should probably try
and get over the terror...

72
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,104
that I'm feeling right now.

73
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:13,150
Sarah, if you ever need to talk
about complicated family situations...

74
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,083
wedding stuff, anything,
you can come to me.

75
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:20,783
Thank you. I appreciate that.
It does feel good to talk about it.

76
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,120
Anyway, have fun.

77
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,695
Well, not likely, but thank you.

78
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:33,996
We having company?

79
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:37,200
Oh, no, not we. You.

80
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:40,174
CAT Squad.

81
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,539
The CAT Squad.

82
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:49,177
- Wow, I, um, didn't see that one coming.
- Well, I thought it'd be fun.

83
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:51,015
Heh. I mean, your old team.

84
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,317
One could be a bridesmaid,
or maid of honor.

85
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:56,586
I haven't seen them in a very long time,
and I've changed a lot.

86
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:59,026
I think that we should have
talked about this.

87
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,961
This could open a Pandora's box.

88
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,895
- Really? How?
- Well, first of all, Carina?

89
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,366
She was the mellow one.

90
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,837
Oh, so you were a little wild
back in the day.

91
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,538
Hey. Hey, hey, Sarah.

92
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,371
I get it. I do. I get it. You're nervous.
I was terrified when I went...

93
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,018
searching for my mom,
but look how that paid off.

94
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,780
It's just... You don't really know
what to expect with this team.

95
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,159
Yoo-hoo, Sarah Walker.

96
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:30,022
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no," what?

97
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,068
What's going on?

98
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,332
Is it Close Encounters?
Is this really happening?

99
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,168
There's our girl.

100
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:08,324
- It's my ex.
- Heard you were getting married.

101
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,629
- You know what that means.
- Girls' night out.

102
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,404
- I'm Chuck, by the way.
- Buckle up, girl. We're going for a ride.

103
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:19,271
We'll have her back by 12.

104
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,776
Midnight is very sensible.

105
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:24,848
Ha! Try noon tomorrow, lover boy.
Maybe.

106
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,986
Hello, Carina. You look well.

107
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,653
Morgan. Remember my...? Morgan?

108
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,856
Something's different about you.

109
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,794
I am trying a new cologne.

110
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:42,991
So that might be, uh...

111
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:49,798
Let's go.

112
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,412
I think she remembered me.

113
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,808
Sarah was right.

114
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:58,347
I honestly wasn't expecting that.

115
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:06,532
Chuck 4x15 - Versus the Cat Squad

116
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,042
Sarah?

117
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,907
Head hurts.

118
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:58,108
You're very dressed up for bed.

119
00:07:58,285 --> 00:08:00,048
Yeah. We went to a club in Hollywood...

120
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,051
and then another one in Vegas...

121
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:04,918
and then an after-hours spot
in Miami.

122
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:09,295
Who knew that Mikhail Gorbachev
could dance so well?

123
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:12,193
I guess reconnecting
wasn't such a bad idea, was it?

124
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,197
- It was okay.
- Okay?

125
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,461
Well, okay is good. Okay is a start.

126
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:18,127
- Springboard.
- Oh, Chuck.

127
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:20,068
You saw your friends
and you had fun.

128
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,677
- The band's back together again!
- No, the band is not back together again.

129
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:28,178
- Why?
- Look, some of us don't trust each other.

130
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:32,183
Well, maybe you should just have a
quiet coffee and some conversation.

131
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:33,843
No, look.

132
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:35,648
We were on a long-term mission...

133
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:38,314
and the target
kept anticipating our next move.

134
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:42,485
Something wasn't right in the team,
so I swept our equipment for bugs...

135
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:45,996
and I found a hidden transmitter
in the heel of Zondra's boot.

136
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:50,694
She denied it was hers,
and she passed a lie-detector test...

137
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:55,774
and we shook on it, and we decided to
let it go, but it stirred some bad feelings.

138
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:57,910
Well, honey,
if the CIA cleared Zondra...

139
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:00,239
then it's gotta be
some misunderstanding.

140
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,746
Right? Time can heal those.

141
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,781
Margaritas don't hurt, either.

142
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:07,283
I'm working on a new recipe for the party.

143
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:09,922
Engagement parties
are not the Squad's cup of tea.

144
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,853
They're leaving when they wake up.

145
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:14,517
- The CAT Squad? They're here?
- Mm-hm.

146
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:20,089
Yeah. They were too tired
to find a hotel room.

147
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:22,764
Sarah, where is Carina?

148
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,108
Hi. Good morning.

149
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:33,873
What are you doing here?

150
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:37,908
There was nowhere else to go
except the floor.

151
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:41,748
- But the floor can be fun too, hmm?
- What? No. Get... Stop.

152
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:45,783
That was sultry.
You were just sultry there.

153
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:48,953
And are you na...? Are you na...?

154
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,493
- Are you hitting on me?
- Something is different about you.

155
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:56,659
The confidence, straight spine.

156
00:09:56,837 --> 00:10:03,037
Can't be true, but you're behaving like
you're having regular sexual intercourse.

157
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:05,974
Martin, get back in this bed.

158
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:09,274
No. No. All the times
that I e-mailed you...

159
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,977
and snail mailed, texted,
called out into the night. Nothing.

160
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:17,089
You completely ignored me.
And now I'm off the market, okay?

161
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:19,088
So I would like you to leave.

162
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,487
I have a lot of work to...

163
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:29,265
Chuck! Chuck!

164
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:32,997
That woman is an animal, okay?
And I will be back when she's gone.

165
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:34,970
This is ridiculous.

166
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,648
Well, that is a snazzy outfit.

167
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,787
Hey. Hi. What brings you by here?

168
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:50,854
Breakfast.

169
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,523
- You forgot.
- Here's the thing.

170
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,958
I was helping Chuck surprise Sarah.

171
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,997
She has old work friends in town
for this engagement party.

172
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,828
Just old hens, and I just got caught up
trying to help...

173
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:05,165
and be the good friend, and I'm sorry.
- Let's just reschedule.

174
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,035
No. Two seconds,
I'm out of this fashion statement...

175
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,506
and I'm gonna be ready to go.
I'll meet you...

176
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:13,168
You starting the French toast?
Chuck said you would.

177
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:14,507
None of us can cook.

178
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:18,149
Oh, hi. Um, I'm Carina.

179
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:21,981
Okay. Carina, this is Alex.
This is my girlfriend.

180
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:25,717
Beautiful girlfriend.
And this is, um, one of Sarah's...

181
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,726
- Old hens.
- Right. Ha-ha-ha.

182
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,332
Well, it looks like you have
been enlisted to cook.

183
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:34,831
Yeah, as in now. We are starving.

184
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:39,439
Oh, okay. Excuse... Easy, easy.
Back inside, you. Off you go. Ha, ha.

185
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:42,336
The draft will be the death of you.
Ha, ha.

186
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:44,443
Whoa. Heh.

187
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:48,678
I'm sorry, okay? You look beautiful,
and I feel like a jerk.

188
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:51,147
Lunch tomorrow, okay?

189
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,181
- Sure.
- Heh, heh.

190
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:59,348
And don't worry. Morgan, I trust you.

191
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:02,256
Thank you. Well, and I know your dad.

192
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,260
And I trust you.

193
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:05,955
Right.

194
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:10,225
Now, that seemed like a threat.

195
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:22,976
I bet you CATs have some wild stories
from your CAT Squad-ing days, huh?

196
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:25,083
- They're top-secret.
- Are they?

197
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:28,244
We could talk about our mission
to Reykjavik. The sulfur baths?

198
00:12:28,422 --> 00:12:30,754
- The floating massages.
- Don't you guys miss it?

199
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,619
Running around together?

200
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,454
- I guess.
- Sometimes.

201
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:38,627
But I also like working one-on-one.

202
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,063
Hey, what's up?
Anybody want some more bacon?

203
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:42,395
Anything? Nothing?

204
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:45,834
Hey, remember Pyongyang?
That dissident we broke out of jail?

205
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:48,099
All those shots
of snake's blood afterwards.

206
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:49,401
That was you and Sarah.

207
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:52,067
You guys made an amazing team.

208
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:55,272
I learned so much from you
and had fun.

209
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:57,508
I think about it a lot.

210
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:04,485
I've been on a number of missions
myself, actually, yeah.

211
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,252
My first one, I had to disarm
this explosive device...

212
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:09,588
using Internet pornography. So...

213
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:11,321
Wow.

214
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:13,966
This Chuck, quite a catch.

215
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,630
- He's all right.
- He certainly is.

216
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:21,501
Okay, well, girls, it was good to see you.
Sarah, gotta catch a flight.

217
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,701
- Me too. Got room on your bike?
- Yep.

218
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:26,038
I better go too. Take me?

219
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:27,270
- Sure.
- Good.

220
00:13:28,282 --> 00:13:31,809
The CATs certainly pack an attitude,
and Zondra is an acquired taste...

221
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:34,112
but I do think
it's good you reconnected.

222
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:37,721
I'll miss you. Congratulations.

223
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:40,189
- I'm gonna miss all you guys. Text me?
- Yeah.

224
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,385
- Okay.
- Come on, girl, let's ride.

225
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:50,259
- It wasn't all bad, but I'm glad it's over.
- Walker. Good luck with, uh, that.

226
00:13:51,972 --> 00:13:53,303
Keys?

227
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:55,236
Baby steps, right?

228
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:56,967
And no more surprises.

229
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:04,374
Carina.

230
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:10,350
Carina? Carina?

231
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:12,321
I'll call an ambulance.

232
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:13,823
Please.

233
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:18,657
Carina, your leg!

234
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:25,704
It's part of the bomb.

235
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:32,835
Uh...

236
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:35,413
Ladies, who's Augusto Gaez?

237
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:42,422
Augusto Gaez is the arch nemesis
of the CAT Squad...

238
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,250
and leader of the Gentle Hand.

239
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:47,120
The bomb fragments trace
to his factory in Rio.

240
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:48,726
He tracked you down.

241
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:50,760
Excuse me, general, the "Gentle Hand"?

242
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,831
Are these bad guys,
or a massage parlor?

243
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,230
They're brutal killers.
Terrorists for hire.

244
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:58,098
You want your competition blown away,
that's who you call.

245
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:01,798
We hunted the Gentle Hand for years,
but we could never pin down Gaez.

246
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:04,409
Every time we got close,
he slipped away.

247
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:07,046
He must have thought we reunited
to come after him.

248
00:15:07,214 --> 00:15:09,774
And tried to kill you on American soil.

249
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,282
CATs, the mission is in from Langley.

250
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:15,751
Capture Gaez and extradite him
back to the States for trial.

251
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:18,083
I'm happy to hunt Gaez
with Chuck and Casey...

252
00:15:18,258 --> 00:15:20,351
Langley said all available hands.

253
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:21,892
Carina, due to your injury...

254
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:24,656
you will monitor the mission
and provide support from Castle.

255
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:27,095
Chuck and Casey,
you're shadowing the CATs.

256
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:28,598
It's Carnival in Rio.

257
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:31,329
Gaez will throw a big party,
he does every year.

258
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:34,099
It'll be guarded,
but I'm sure we can find our way in.

259
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:36,606
- I love it.
- General, we're not a team anymore.

260
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,608
This comes from the top, Sarah.

261
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:41,441
The CATs are back.

262
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,081
So, hey, Rio.
Sun, sand, that's good, right?

263
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:53,920
You know that tracking device
I found in Zondra's boot?

264
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:57,325
We were on a mission
to nail Augusto Gaez.

265
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,164
You think that Zondra's working for Gaez,
that she planted the bomb?

266
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:03,825
- The government cleared her name.
- Yeah, we'll see.

267
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:13,369
Yes?

268
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:16,573
The CAT Squad is on their way to Rio.

269
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,944
Excellent.

270
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:20,780
The plan is going perfectly.

271
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:35,292
We're going on a mission again.
CAT Squad high-five.

272
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:43,042
- You guys are zero fun.
- Hey, Sarah. I have an idea.

273
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,841
I know that you have good intentions...

274
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:47,775
but can we ease up on the ideas?

275
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:51,281
This is solid, hear me out.
I'm gonna be stuck in a van with Casey...

276
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:55,854
which gives me time to review the CIA
files on both the CAT Squad and Gaez.

277
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:57,683
Run them through the old computer.

278
00:16:57,858 --> 00:17:00,691
If Zondra turns out to be a double agent,
we take her down.

279
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:04,388
If she turns out innocent, you can be
friends and reconnect in a real way.

280
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,031
Maybe I can help you fix this.

281
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,532
It doesn't matter whether I have
friends at my engagement party.

282
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:14,197
I'm talking big picture here.
I'm talking you engaging with your past.

283
00:17:14,374 --> 00:17:16,842
- Okay.
- Okay.

284
00:17:19,713 --> 00:17:23,171
I can just see that little hamster wheel
turning in your head, Walker.

285
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,979
- All I'm thinking about is nailing Gaez.
- Hmm.

286
00:17:27,154 --> 00:17:29,816
You make sure you keep
your paws out of my boot heels.

287
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,788
- Oh, you wanna start that again?
- Yes, I do.

288
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:36,553
Hey, hey. Cool it, CATs, hmm?

289
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,025
You rang, Casey?

290
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:43,897
Is it hot in here, or is it me?

291
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,935
Carina's assigned to Castle.

292
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,337
Make sure she has IT support,
food, whatever she needs.

293
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:53,172
No, no, listen to me, I can't be alone
here with that woman, okay? She...

294
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:55,871
She wants me. Badly.

295
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:01,614
John, she desires my physical person.

296
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:05,018
And I'm hunting unicorns.
You're babysitting. Get over it.

297
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:06,817
I have intel on Gaez's party.

298
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:10,087
He'll be at Cabaret Soco Na Garganta.
Near the Sambadrome.

299
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:13,289
The only question now is,
how do we breach security?

300
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,764
Disguise or commando entry?

301
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:17,267
Guys? Ha, ha.

302
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:20,031
Duh! It's a party.

303
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:33,442
How do Brazilian spies
work with all this noise?

304
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,783
We're in the club. Do you have the signal?

305
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:38,852
Camera's up.

306
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:50,966
No sign of Gaez.

307
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:52,468
He won't show till later.

308
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:57,441
I know his habits.
I've been keeping tabs on the Hand.

309
00:18:57,611 --> 00:18:59,238
Convenient.

310
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:03,910
- We can cover more ground if we split up.
- I'm not comfortable with you on your own.

311
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:06,279
I'm not sure I care.

312
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,011
Oh. Good.

313
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,485
This is a hornets' nest.

314
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:12,022
Let's just do our job.

315
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,941
You know, CIA's gone over that
a hundred times.

316
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:37,515
Findings were inconclusive. Get over it.

317
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:41,211
Eight years ago the CATs got yanked
into a Gentle Hand mission in Milan...

318
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:44,219
but Gaez escaped before the girls
ever made it to Italy.

319
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:48,326
I figured out that Gaez was tipped off
from a CIA safe house inside Milan.

320
00:19:48,495 --> 00:19:51,157
If I can prove that Zondra
wasn't in said safe house...

321
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:55,791
maybe Sarah will be able to trust her.
- You know, I used to be like you.

322
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:58,437
Wanted to fix everything.

323
00:19:58,805 --> 00:19:59,863
Not now.

324
00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:05,877
Grimes suggested
I approach Alex's mom.

325
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:08,879
I was tempted at first, but...

326
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:12,041
she's moved on. So...

327
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:15,548
Didn't need her life disrupted, and...

328
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:17,182
I let it lie.

329
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:33,569
I've spotted Gaez.
He's surrounded by muscle.

330
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:43,576
He's heading into the VIP room.
We can get the layout...

331
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,377
from Chuck and Casey.

332
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:49,044
I'm not here to discuss anything
past your needs, which have been met...

333
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:52,123
so I'm gone.
- My needs have not been met.

334
00:20:52,726 --> 00:20:56,355
You're upset I never called you back.
Look, I'm sorry. Get over it.

335
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,224
Oh, I'm over it, sweetheart.

336
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:00,059
Yeah, yeah. And I'm with someone.

337
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:04,128
Some... Oh, the girl at the door.

338
00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:06,735
So, uh, you've told her you love her?

339
00:21:06,906 --> 00:21:09,101
Yeah, of... Pfft.

340
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:13,377
No. No. But I was going to, and then
her father got thrown from a roof.

341
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:15,013
I plan to do it very soon...

342
00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:17,706
and I just... What...?
- So it's not even serious.

343
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:18,908
Look...

344
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,251
Excuse me. It's Alex.

345
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:27,450
Oh, she's at the Buy More.
Listen to me, I have to go.

346
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:31,654
Uh-uh, you're staying. You don't like it,
take it up with General Beckman.

347
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:33,799
You gotta be kidding me.

348
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:37,664
So you're at the Buy More
and I'm not.

349
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,966
No. You do not appear to be.

350
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:44,975
Yeah, yeah,
and I don't think that's gonna...

351
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:47,443
change soon,
because I got shanghaied...

352
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:50,583
into babysitting this injured agent.

353
00:21:52,085 --> 00:21:54,815
Oh, ahem. So you're, um...

354
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:57,286
You're canceling on me again?

355
00:21:57,457 --> 00:21:58,924
You're needed.

356
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,060
- Now.
- Uh, one sec. One second.

357
00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:03,923
Would you pl...?

358
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:07,089
Yeah. I'm afraid so.
But I am gonna make it up to you.

359
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:09,667
Dinner, movie. I owe you...

360
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:13,772
so huge.
- Yes, you do owe me.

361
00:22:14,274 --> 00:22:15,605
I will be in touch.

362
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:18,972
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

363
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:23,146
If you're done slobbering, Grimes,
there is a problem in Rio.

364
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:30,115
Um, can I asks you a question?

365
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,855
Your insurance paid up?

366
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:40,726
- Ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

367
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,390
I'm ready!

368
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:52,877
Chuck, Casey. NSA monitored a call
from Burbank to Gaez yesterday.

369
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:56,482
- Gaez knows the CATs are coming.
- It's a trap, guys. Abort now.

370
00:22:56,649 --> 00:22:58,549
Sarah, you have to get out of there.

371
00:23:06,693 --> 00:23:09,355
It's been a long time, CATs.

372
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,554
Drop your weapons or die.

373
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:20,839
All these years.

374
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:23,038
Enemies.

375
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:26,508
Fighting each other.

376
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:29,779
- Such a waste, no?
- You're the bad guy.

377
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:31,109
That's how it works.

378
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,876
Says who?

379
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:34,417
Why can't we work together?

380
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,250
That's why we're here? A sales pitch?

381
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:44,624
The worldwide market for the Gentle Hand
has blown wide open.

382
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:49,894
I need skilled operatives
who can open a door with a fist.

383
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:51,900
Or a smile.

384
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:53,698
Kitty, kitty, kitties.

385
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:56,808
You have been lured here
to accept a career...

386
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,773
with the Hand.

387
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:01,745
Or I'll bury you on Mount Corcovado.

388
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,582
Casey. They're tied up.
Five guards, all armed.

389
00:24:09,756 --> 00:24:11,951
I'm gonna use the Intersect
to capture Gaez.

390
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,150
Just gonna drop down
out of the sky, hero?

391
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,091
Overcompensating because you got
your girlfriend's car blown up?

392
00:24:17,263 --> 00:24:20,426
- That's not true.
- Sit tight till I give you the signal.

393
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,931
You only have a tranq gun.

394
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,070
A career in the Hand?
With you and who else?

395
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:28,799
Because you've already got one of us,
don't you?

396
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:30,933
Do I, Sarah?

397
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,977
- Why don't you let her finish?
- Why don't you shut up?

398
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:36,945
No, I would like the air cleared.

399
00:24:37,116 --> 00:24:39,676
- Sarah, let's just get out of this alive.
- No.

400
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:41,342
Let her say my name.

401
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:44,990
Offer me up, Walker. Accuse me out loud
instead of under your breath...

402
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:48,616
- ...like you've been doing for years.
- That's what you've been doing.

403
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:51,423
Telling people that I put
the tracker in your boot?

404
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:55,167
The suspense is a killer, no?

405
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:58,103
Maybe it's not tough Zondra.

406
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:00,433
Maybe sweet Amy.

407
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:03,567
Suspicious.

408
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,010
But so is Sarah Walker...

409
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,545
the kitty who doth protest too much.

410
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,115
It's not me.
I've got no intention of joining up.

411
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:13,945
If you plan to kill us,
you may as well tell the truth.

412
00:25:15,488 --> 00:25:16,614
I think that's fair.

413
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:22,390
I'd rather just kill you.

414
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:25,888
Casey? This just got ugly.

415
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:33,728
You're done. Do you wanna live,
or do you wanna die?

416
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:35,134
Keep cool.

417
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:38,744
- We are all keeping cool.
- You tell me what I wanna know...

418
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:41,539
or you're the one getting buried
on Mount Corcovado.

419
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:43,375
Okay.

420
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:45,312
- The name is...
- Yeah?

421
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:46,509
Okay.

422
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:49,553
- I think Sarah needs help.
- I'll tell you.

423
00:26:10,677 --> 00:26:12,042
Hey. Hey! Wait!

424
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:14,710
I need immediate extraction.

425
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:16,940
Anyway you can. Plane, boat, car.

426
00:26:17,383 --> 00:26:19,214
How about fist?

427
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:22,650
I've got Gaez. Let's get out of here.

428
00:26:22,822 --> 00:26:23,982
- Ugh.
- Wait.

429
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:25,886
He was about to tell me
the name of the mole.

430
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:28,459
Now that he's in custody,
he'll never talk.

431
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:31,061
I was just... I was helping.
I was helping.

432
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,722
- Look at all the bad guys I tranq'd.
- I don't need help with my job.

433
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:37,062
I don't need help with my past,
so stop okay?

434
00:26:37,236 --> 00:26:38,260
I don't need help!

435
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:42,040
No, no, no!

436
00:26:46,746 --> 00:26:48,543
I deserved that.

437
00:26:48,715 --> 00:26:52,378
Excellent work in Rio,
in spite of the hiccups.

438
00:26:52,552 --> 00:26:53,985
But, Sarah, you were right.

439
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:57,156
- There's a traitor in the CATs.
- You know who my money's on.

440
00:26:57,323 --> 00:27:00,588
- Thought that Carina had a shifty look.
- How well do you know Amy?

441
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,193
Is anyone really that perky?

442
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:06,058
Conjecture and ill will do not
make a case for treason. We need facts.

443
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:08,792
Until we have them,
I want the CATs to stay in Castle.

444
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:10,902
Casey, interrogate Gaez for the mole.

445
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,095
You're dismissed.

446
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:16,736
I have a job for you.

447
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:23,913
Attention, shoppers.
Buy More will be closing in five minutes.

448
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:27,810
Hello, beautiful.

449
00:27:27,987 --> 00:27:32,788
Do I have the night of nights planned
for you. First of all, we are...

450
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,221
What? What?

451
00:27:34,393 --> 00:27:36,224
Lipstick on your collar?

452
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,528
- Oh, that dirty little...
- Whose lipstick is it?

453
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:44,430
The wounded agent?

454
00:27:44,604 --> 00:27:45,832
Miss French-Toast?

455
00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:47,939
She rubbed it in to sabotage our date.

456
00:27:48,107 --> 00:27:50,268
She has the soul of a bridge troll.

457
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:56,441
I really wanna believe you, Morgan,
but you have been acting so strange.

458
00:27:56,616 --> 00:27:58,516
And three times in a row?

459
00:27:58,684 --> 00:28:00,811
That is asking a little too much.

460
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:03,854
Okay. Oh, yes. Oh, but, Alex... Alex.

461
00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:06,753
But you trust me, remember?

462
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,887
Do I?

463
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:15,127
The CATs left their luggage.

464
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:19,032
There might be another tracking device
and I don't want anything leading home.

465
00:28:19,205 --> 00:28:21,264
Sounds like you're
trying to get rid of me.

466
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,136
Look, I know I screwed up, Sarah.

467
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:28,337
Okay, fine. I did some analysis
on the CATs' failed mission to Milan...

468
00:28:28,514 --> 00:28:31,176
and it seems very suspect.
It's not conclusive.

469
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:33,909
But if we can figure out
who was in Milan...

470
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:36,520
You're still helping. Stop. Now.

471
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:39,421
No. Sarah. But...

472
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,685
Hey, Walker.
I'm not running anywhere.

473
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:46,298
You know what? In fact,
I am sick and tired of pussying around.

474
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:48,524
So why don't we settle
this old-school?

475
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:49,725
Toe-to-toe.

476
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:52,704
Yeah, let's do it.

477
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:14,226
Still got that jab, Walker.

478
00:29:14,393 --> 00:29:15,417
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

479
00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:16,926
You want some more?

480
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,261
Got some questions for you, Gaez.

481
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:28,070
What is she here for?

482
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,836
- Muscle.
- I thought it might be fun.

483
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:36,638
Ouch.

484
00:29:37,116 --> 00:29:38,276
Shall we begin?

485
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,432
I have never even heard of an
organization called the Gentle Hand.

486
00:29:56,602 --> 00:29:58,069
I'm a businessman.

487
00:29:58,237 --> 00:30:00,637
Yeah. Business of terror.

488
00:30:00,806 --> 00:30:03,673
Built a fortune, killed a lot of men.

489
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:05,501
But that all ends now.

490
00:30:11,884 --> 00:30:15,320
I'm not the traitor.
I didn't plant that tracker.

491
00:30:16,188 --> 00:30:18,019
- Neither did I.
- Where'd it come from?

492
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,818
- You were the only one in Milan.
- I was never in Milan.

493
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:25,089
I was supposed to be, but I got
an anonymous call to stay put in Paris.

494
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:26,526
We need to disc...

495
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:32,001
You're just gonna primp
the whole time?

496
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,704
- One of us had to have been in Milan.
- Carina was in the U.S.

497
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:45,706
I read it in Chuck's report.

498
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:49,211
That leaves...

499
00:30:49,422 --> 00:30:51,151
Amy.

500
00:30:54,427 --> 00:30:55,655
- Traitor.
- Yeah.

501
00:30:55,828 --> 00:30:57,659
So what? I paid for it.

502
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,627
Acting like the world's biggest dope.

503
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,859
Wearing stupid sexed-up costumes
to fight world crime.

504
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:06,061
Now I have everything
I ever dreamed of...

505
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:08,900
except it is a little lonely.

506
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,703
- Join me.
- Go to hell.

507
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:18,945
I know where you live, Walker. You even
think of trying to find us, remember...

508
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:24,078
there's a target on your back.
You, Chuck, the sister with the baby.

509
00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:26,156
Don't forget.

510
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,729
Chuck.

511
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,772
Think about making two trips?

512
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:48,973
Not really my style.

513
00:31:49,682 --> 00:31:50,842
How's the reunion going?

514
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:56,047
Doesn't everybody want their
friends and family around?

515
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:58,019
Wouldn't you have been
disappointed...

516
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,626
if there hadn't been one friend
or family member at your wedding?

517
00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:05,758
Yeah. But maybe Sarah
sees the world differently.

518
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:09,367
I just wanna make her happy,
and everything I did backfired.

519
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:12,402
Chuck, you bend over backwards
to help people.

520
00:32:12,571 --> 00:32:15,131
It's one of the reasons
that you're so easy to love...

521
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:18,799
but sometimes the best thing
you can do is just take a step back.

522
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,407
Be understanding.

523
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:25,549
- You don't have to fix everything.
- So I blew it?

524
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:30,788
Bigtime. But I'm pretty sure
she still loves you.

525
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,790
Where is she? Where is she?

526
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:39,453
Okay, I don't know what it's gonna take to
get it through that thick spy skull of yours.

527
00:32:39,632 --> 00:32:42,328
You need to understand
you are not the only game in town.

528
00:32:42,535 --> 00:32:44,059
I am in love with somebody else.

529
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:46,101
- You are angry.
- You're damn right.

530
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:48,763
I'm through with you,
I'm through being your slave.

531
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:51,273
Wow, you're so worked up.

532
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:54,470
- I guess you really do love her, huh?
- You guess? You...?

533
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:57,639
You're supposed to be an
intelligence officer, and you guess?

534
00:32:57,817 --> 00:33:00,149
Well, you haven't said it to her.
I just figured.

535
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,446
You figured wrong, all right?

536
00:33:02,621 --> 00:33:06,990
Although, I really should tell her.
I do love her.

537
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,421
Aw.

538
00:33:08,594 --> 00:33:11,290
Oh, shut up.
I'm gonna go get her back.

539
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:14,524
- You need anything, you can go to hell.
- Marty, don't move!

540
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,794
Marty. Here we... It's Morgan!
How many times do I got...?

541
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:23,864
Sorry, puss. Sleep time.

542
00:33:38,624 --> 00:33:40,182
Come on, Chuck, pick up.

543
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:52,000
- Sarah, I am the idiot of the century.
- Chuck, Amy just escaped with Gaez.

544
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:55,868
- She's the traitor. Where are you?
- The Buy More. The store is closed.

545
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,804
- Where are you?
- Locked in Castle...

546
00:33:57,977 --> 00:34:01,174
trying to override the system.
Gaez and Amy are headed your way.

547
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:03,110
They're in the elevator.

548
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:08,252
Okay, listen. Do not try and fight them.
Just hold tight and we'll be right there.

549
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:13,049
There's no time for that. Just stay
by the monitors and spot them for me.

550
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:15,318
Lockdown engaged.

551
00:34:19,064 --> 00:34:21,362
- He's a dead man.
- Well, he's got a plan.

552
00:34:21,534 --> 00:34:22,831
At least, I think he does.

553
00:34:24,837 --> 00:34:26,771
My God, is he shopping?
What's he doing?

554
00:34:29,441 --> 00:34:31,568
They're following you.
You've got 10 seconds.

555
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:35,407
Well, can I just take these 10 seconds
to apologize for being such a fool?

556
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:37,776
Chuck, now's not the time.

557
00:34:41,387 --> 00:34:42,411
Chuck?

558
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:47,217
Give us the key to the store
and we're gone for good.

559
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:49,258
You're no match for us
and you know it.

560
00:34:49,428 --> 00:34:53,524
We don't wanna hurt you, but we will
certainly enjoy doing it if we have to.

561
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:03,597
- Talk to me, Sarah. Where are they?
- They're at the Nerd Herd desk.

562
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:08,374
I wanna say that I have no intention
of opening up any more cans of worms...

563
00:35:08,547 --> 00:35:11,710
or Pandora's boxes or anything else.
I want you to be happy.

564
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:14,478
- Concentrate on getting out alive.
- Be easier...

565
00:35:14,687 --> 00:35:18,054
- ...if you'd consider forgiving me.
- No time. They're headed your way.

566
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,727
I don't like fighting girls.

567
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:06,832
What I mean is,
I was taught to be a gentleman.

568
00:36:24,957 --> 00:36:27,983
Going somewhere, pussy?

569
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,506
Small price to pay
to find the real traitor.

570
00:36:45,678 --> 00:36:48,146
Yeah, took us long enough.

571
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,413
I'm sorry.

572
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:54,081
I should have never
jumped to conclusions.

573
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,413
Me neither.

574
00:36:55,587 --> 00:36:58,579
- It cost us a lot of years.
- Yeah.

575
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:01,856
We could try to make up for it.

576
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:03,119
We were good friends.

577
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:04,455
Yeah, I miss that.

578
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,635
Well, there is, uh, this engagement party.

579
00:37:10,803 --> 00:37:12,065
- I'll be there.
- Me too.

580
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:15,070
- I have an apology to make.
- I would love to have you guys.

581
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,041
At the wedding too, if you can make it.
Maybe you could be bridesmaids?

582
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:24,447
I've never been a bridesmaid.

583
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:27,244
Well, pretended to once for a mission.

584
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:30,718
I did too, once, but there was
a machine gun under the pink taffeta.

585
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:32,220
- Oh. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

586
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:34,586
Well, maybe we can try it for real
this time.

587
00:37:36,595 --> 00:37:42,056
- No machine guns.
- Scary, but I'll give it a shot.

588
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:44,630
- All right.
- Okay.

589
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:51,107
Hey.

590
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:55,209
- Can I just...?
- Chuck, no more apologies.

591
00:37:56,648 --> 00:37:58,138
I wanna say thank you.

592
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:03,015
I'm glad that the girls are here tonight.
They'll be here for the wedding.

593
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:06,953
I'm just not ready
to dive into my past right now.

594
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:09,892
Yeah. No way. Nuh-uh.

595
00:38:10,262 --> 00:38:11,752
And my family...

596
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:15,964
Well, there's no misunderstanding
to straighten out, really.

597
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:17,659
I know that it's complicated.

598
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:19,360
I totally hear you. I do.

599
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:21,301
And I'm done helping out.

600
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:24,271
No, Chuck,
please don't ever stop helping me.

601
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,870
There are a thousand ways that I need
your help every single day...

602
00:38:28,046 --> 00:38:29,240
and you're perfect.

603
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:33,747
Well, then I'll stick to those.

604
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:43,757
- Let's party.
- Let's do it.

605
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:14,552
I wanna start.

606
00:39:15,427 --> 00:39:18,487
- Okay.
- We're...

607
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:23,400
We're done. It's not that I think
you were unfaithful, I just...

608
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,436
I mean, leggy girls...

609
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:28,869
getting half the truth...

610
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:31,236
I don't fit into this world.

611
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,107
I can count the amount of
special relationships I've had...

612
00:39:35,314 --> 00:39:38,078
on half of one hand.
- Me too.

613
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:43,847
Then why don't I feel special, Morgan?
I just feel lied to.

614
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,954
I'm sorry.

615
00:39:51,363 --> 00:39:53,593
No, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

616
00:39:53,765 --> 00:39:55,630
Hear me out, okay?

617
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:59,702
The reason I kept Carina
a secret from you is because...

618
00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:03,933
I didn't know how to handle you
running into someone I'd had a...

619
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:05,371
relationship with.

620
00:40:05,544 --> 00:40:08,638
To be honest,
there have been so few, that...

621
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:11,543
it was damn near
a statistical impossibility.

622
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:13,082
I mean...

623
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,213
I want you to know something, though.

624
00:40:18,223 --> 00:40:19,656
Nothing happened between us...

625
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:23,089
because nothing means more to me
than this relationship.

626
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,794
I'd never do anything
to threaten that. Ever.

627
00:40:25,964 --> 00:40:27,727
I love you.

628
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:30,459
I love you.

629
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:34,372
I am in love with you.

630
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,735
Like, for real, "I love you"?

631
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:40,742
Oh, for real I love you, I love you.

632
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:44,081
I love you too.

633
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:45,876
But you cannot do this.

634
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:48,579
I won't. I promise.

635
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,951
I think I owe you an apology.

636
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,156
- I acted like a real...
- It's okay.

637
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,028
He loves me.

638
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:10,802
Hey. This is lovely.

639
00:41:10,976 --> 00:41:13,809
Oh, I'm so glad that you think so.

640
00:41:13,979 --> 00:41:17,107
I'm really happy to be here in a dress
and having a little wine.

641
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:19,147
So...

642
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:24,414
What's on your mind?

643
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,321
Oh...

644
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,622
Must be hard being here
without your family.

645
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:32,520
Yeah, well, I'm...

646
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,359
I don't know where my father is...

647
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:38,594
and I have a very strained relationship
with my mother, so it's...

648
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,965
- Complicated?
- Yeah.

649
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,176
How about you and I talk about this?
We can get Chuck involved later.

650
00:41:45,344 --> 00:41:46,971
That would be great. Thank you.

651
00:41:47,145 --> 00:41:49,705
- We're practically family, right?
- Yeah, ha, ha.

652
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:52,645
- More importantly, we're friends.
- Yeah.

653
00:41:54,586 --> 00:41:56,486
Well, I have a question for you.

654
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,321
I was wondering if you would be
my maid of honor.

655
00:42:02,027 --> 00:42:04,188
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

656
00:42:04,363 --> 00:42:06,354
Oh, I would love to. Of course.

657
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:11,494
Aw, who says CATs can't play nice?

658
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,834
You never know. Maybe we'll add
another member to the Squad.
