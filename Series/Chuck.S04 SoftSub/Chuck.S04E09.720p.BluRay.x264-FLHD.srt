1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,571
Hey, I'm Chuck. Here's a couple of things
you might need to know or just forgot.

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,766
This isn't a code, Devon.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,431
This is a real car.
My dad must've left this for me.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,873
Your father never wanted you to see this.

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,808
See what?

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,539
Come on! Flash!

7
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,419
Sarah, my mom did something to me
with that device.

8
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,886
I can't flash. The Intersect is gone.

9
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:29,521
Agent Carmichael is coming with me.
Surrender or die.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,798
- What do you want?
- I want the Intersect.

11
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,866
It's gone. I lost it.

12
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:39,565
The less you resist,
the less painful this will be.

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,426
You know what I really want?

14
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:06,426
This could be a very good "show me,
don't tell me" situation, I think.

15
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,964
I want you to flash.

16
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,407
- What?
- I want you to flash for me.

17
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,634
Come on, do it. Show me.

18
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,507
But I can't. You know that I can't.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,581
The Intersect's not working.
Why are we talking about this?

20
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,308
Are you sure that you can't flash?

21
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,919
Well, yeah.

22
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,990
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
But we could do other stuff, you know?

23
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:37,323
We could, uh...
We could kiss more or talk.

24
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,828
No. Never mind.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,161
Why? No. No. Hey.

26
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,496
Hey, you. Hey. Hey.

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,138
You know, there's pills for this.

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,304
Easy. Easy, buddy.
This is all in your head.

29
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,008
You have got to get over this.

30
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:57,809
I mean, come on.

31
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:01,681
You really expect to keep
a girl like that without flashing?

32
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,391
This doesn't make any sense.

33
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,655
Why are you here?
I shouldn't even be here.

34
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,630
I was on a mission in Switzerland.
I was on a gondola.

35
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,292
I was taken by a Belgian.
What is going on?

36
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,165
Why isn't this working?

37
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,807
He knows he's in a dream.

38
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,035
Lester was the wrong choice.

39
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,538
Intensify the current.
Try something else.

40
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,315
I just need to figure out...

41
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,977
the right combination of people
from his life to use.

42
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,355
You've got to dig it out.

43
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:46,158
I can sell the secrets in his head for
more money than you can imagine.

44
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,995
Telling me again isn't going
to make this go any faster.

45
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,734
Agent Carmichael's brain will access
the Intersect if it's properly motivated.

46
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,398
It was clear from interrogation
that anxiety...

47
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,703
is his strongest motivating emotion.

48
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,005
God knows he is a neurotic man.

49
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,416
When we find the right mix of people
from his life to pressure him...

50
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,611
he will become so anxious
about not having the Intersect...

51
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,279
that his brain will be forced
to flash.

52
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,720
But this woman,
she will do most of the work.

53
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:21,500
Nothing makes him more anxious
than this Sarah Walker.

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,806
Five countries in three days,
and nothing.

55
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,276
Where's Chuck, Casey?

56
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,811
Got every agent in Castle
out looking for him. We'll find him.

57
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,416
Let's regroup with Beckman.
She'll have something.

58
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,885
We have nothing. The Berlin team
had an address for a lieutenant.

59
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,991
By the time we got a search warrant,
he had disappeared.

60
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,093
The same thing happened in Caracas.

61
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,891
Target dropped behind North Korean lines
where we couldn't follow.

62
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,228
General, a lot of bureaucracy
is keeping us from finding Chuck.

63
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,303
I know,
but we have to work with our allies here.

64
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,505
Get a couple of hours of sleep.

65
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,836
I'm not going to sleep. Chuck is
out there without the Intersect...

66
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,978
with people who think he has it.
He's never been more helpless.

67
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:11,313
I know. And be assured that
the Intersect is a priority to the U. S...

68
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,180
as is finding the Belgian
before he sells our secrets.

69
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,345
Forget the secrets,
this is about Chuck.

70
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,552
General, I'll make sure we get some rest,
check back with you later.

71
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,133
Don't. I know.

72
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,264
Being a worried girlfriend
isn't gonna help him.

73
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,635
- You need to be a spy, a professional.
- Fine.

74
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,840
- Where do we look next?
- Is she off?

75
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,875
Yeah. Welcome back.

76
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,141
And Daddy got something Daddy likes.
Oh, Daddy.

77
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,883
I'm Daddy. You guys were kind of...
Okay, you were just looking at me...

78
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,082
This is from our Swiss field op,
which, by the way, I just love saying.

79
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,786
His name is Anand Chanarong,
an aide to the Thai ambassador...

80
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,798
but he is also a known associate
of one...

81
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,631
Guys, come on. Baddie the Belgian.
He handles all the Belgian's dirty work.

82
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,241
Extortion, kidnapping.
And he's in L.A. At the Thai embassy.

83
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,037
Which is Thai soil.
It's not in our jurisdiction.

84
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,910
- We don't have jurisdiction, Walker.
- Come on, Casey. Be a spy.

85
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,090
Who told you to bring this in here?

86
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,894
This is the ugliest rug I've ever seen.

87
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,367
We're looking for the Belgian.

88
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,873
- Who are you?
- He's taken somebody.

89
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,905
Charles Carmichael. Goes by "Chuck."

90
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,873
What do you know about him?

91
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,706
You have no right to be here
on Thai soil.

92
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,199
Hi, welcome to American soil.

93
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,204
Now, where's Chuck?

94
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:19,353
Chuck 4x09 - Versus the Phase Three

95
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:59,842
I'm asking you again,
where can I find the Belgian?

96
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:09,646
You don't understand
how high the stakes are.

97
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,948
You're gonna tell me exactly
what I wanna know.

98
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,950
Listen, I think Sarah's about to go
all Kill Bill on this dude.

99
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:21,495
Beckman knows somebody stormed
into the embassy and stole a national.

100
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:24,156
I'm new, but I think that's
international incident-y.

101
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:27,167
Walker knows what lines not to cross.

102
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:28,804
Walker!

103
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:31,797
A word, please.

104
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:33,966
- Well, can it wait?
- No.

105
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:41,840
He's not talking. And he's a smirker.

106
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:45,476
Just because I helped bring him here
doesn't mean I'm giving you free rein.

107
00:07:45,655 --> 00:07:47,452
You need to cool down,
get some rest.

108
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:49,717
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Yeah, I was wrong.

109
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:51,986
You're not acting
like a worried girlfriend.

110
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:54,494
No, you're acting like a spy
I used to know.

111
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:58,156
Before Chuck.
Langston Graham's wild-card enforcer.

112
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:01,793
I didn't like that Sarah Walker.
You know why? She was unpredictable.

113
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:04,697
Now you're gonna go home. I insist.

114
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,834
- You insist? How are you gonna do that?
- I insist. I insist.

115
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:12,880
Hey, hey, listen to me. Look, Sarah,
we all wanna find Chuck, okay?

116
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:15,813
But I think we could all use
a little rest too, right?

117
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:18,580
I know I'm super cranky
if I get under nine hours.

118
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:21,519
So let's calm down
and let's go get a few winks...

119
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:26,560
and then you go back to your manhunt
nice and well-rested, okay?

120
00:08:27,764 --> 00:08:30,062
You have two hours.

121
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:34,661
Wow.

122
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:37,238
Man, that was scary. Did I do okay?

123
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:40,899
I was kind of shaking there.
I know it's not scary for you, but...

124
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:47,043
I can't believe you have a 36-hour shift.
You're pregnant, it's not okay.

125
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:49,617
Honey, the nurses reserved me
my own broom closet.

126
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:52,118
I have a very nice cot.
I will steal some winks.

127
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,849
Between long shifts
and the stressing about family...

128
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:57,125
I'm worried about you and the baby.

129
00:08:57,294 --> 00:08:59,956
Listen, I promise
to take care of myself.

130
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:03,564
- You need to be calm and peaceful.
- I will be calm and peaceful.

131
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,224
Not too calm.
Don't go falling asleep at the wheel.

132
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:09,463
- Speaking of, can't you take the Sienna?
- I like my dad's ride.

133
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:12,608
Did your dad's ride get five out of five
stars on side-impact protection?

134
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:17,310
What is this?

135
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:22,677
Whoa.

136
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:25,381
What is this thing?

137
00:09:25,555 --> 00:09:28,149
- I've never seen anything like it.
- I don't know.

138
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:31,488
I thought I'd found everything
of my dad's that there was to find.

139
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:34,956
- Do you think it's spy stuff?
- I don't know.

140
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:38,965
Well, we could try and turn it on
and figure out.

141
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:40,903
Right.

142
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:45,601
I don't want it to be spy stuff.

143
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:47,600
You do it.

144
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,151
- Nothing.
- Shoot.

145
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:07,294
I'm late. I can't believe
that I have to work for two days.

146
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:09,489
This is all I'm gonna think about.

147
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,294
Babe, remember,
we're staying calm, okay?

148
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:15,461
Go to work and don't worry.
I'll call Chuck and figure it out.

149
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,799
No. No Chuck, okay?

150
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:19,601
If this is spy-related,
it's gonna reel him back in.

151
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:20,834
I wanna keep him safe.

152
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:26,772
Chuck, listen to me very closely.

153
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,953
If you don't access the Intersect,
forget about Sarah...

154
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:38,622
Ellie, Morgan,
and this Awesome character...

155
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:41,229
no one will love you.

156
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:43,764
You'll be nothing.

157
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:47,201
You will lose them all.

158
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,130
How you holding up?

159
00:11:58,508 --> 00:11:59,532
Not great.

160
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,643
Yeah. No, me either.

161
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:05,110
I've had this awful taste in my mouth
ever since Chuck disappeared.

162
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:08,580
Makes me think, wherever he is,
he's probably eating something icky.

163
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:12,287
Strange twin thing.

164
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:17,553
Do you know what this is?

165
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:23,592
No. Nope.
Never really saw that before.

166
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,632
I really miss him.

167
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:28,362
Fine. Okay, I fold.
It's Chuck's proposal plan.

168
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:31,133
I hate myself.

169
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,070
Chuck was planning on proposing?

170
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:37,379
Yeah.

171
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:41,344
See, it's a combination of things
that are important to both of you.

172
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:43,782
And some of it
is just from when he was little.

173
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:49,120
So here is where he was gonna
drive up in his DeLorean, of course.

174
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:53,194
And that'd be you, coming down
on a wild stallion. You'd meet here.

175
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,432
You were gonna hop in this Lamborghini
and take off down the coast and...

176
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,694
This might be an older draft.
It's been revamped since puberty.

177
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:02,667
When was he planning on doing this?

178
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:06,441
I don't know.
Ever since he lost the Intersect...

179
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:09,305
the proposal plan got put on hold.

180
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:12,778
Did he think that I wouldn't
wanna marry him without the Intersect?

181
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:17,045
- Is that how I made him feel?
- No. No. Chuck knew that...

182
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:20,990
Chuck knows that you love him,
Sarah, okay?

183
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:23,489
It's just you're kind of a big fish,
you know?

184
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,823
And to a regular guy
with no supercomputer in his brain...

185
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:30,488
I gotta think that
that's pretty intimidating.

186
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:33,696
That's not the reason
why I love Chuck.

187
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,499
I do wanna spend my life with Chuck,
with or without the Intersect.

188
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:39,471
That's fantastic. That's great.

189
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:42,042
He knows that, right?
Because you told him that.

190
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,281
Oh.

191
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:56,051
You're certain you know nothing
about the whereabouts...

192
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:57,887
of the aide, Anand Chanarong.

193
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:01,258
- Haven't heard a word, ma'am.
- How mysterious.

194
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:03,432
I want you to keep an eye
on Agent Walker.

195
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,900
I think she might be on the edge.

196
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:11,706
What are you doing back here?

197
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,934
Is the camera in Chanarong's cell
still out?

198
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,543
- What's in the bag?
- Go.

199
00:14:15,712 --> 00:14:17,942
- You're not gonna wanna be here.
- I'm not going anywhere.

200
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:22,844
I insist.

201
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:42,295
Do you feel like talking yet?

202
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:48,000
An American agent in a government
facility would never use any of that.

203
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:51,712
- I'm not afraid.
- You're right.

204
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:57,219
Normally, I wouldn't threaten the subject
with death by ammonia injection.

205
00:14:58,121 --> 00:14:59,952
Burning somebody
from the inside out...

206
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:04,215
doesn't sound like something that's
in the Geneva Convention, does it?

207
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:09,023
But this man that I'm looking for,
he loves me.

208
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,264
He wants to marry me.

209
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,399
I see.

210
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:18,564
It's amazing what a woman would do
to find a husband.

211
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:25,339
Even the toughest spies in the world are
just racing against that biological clock.

212
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:29,382
Tick, tick, tick, tock.

213
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,917
You got me.

214
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:39,018
I'm just a needy, love-crazed girl
on a husband hunt.

215
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:43,661
Who's trained in over 200 ways
to kill you.

216
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,664
Afraid yet?

217
00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:50,466
The Belgian has a hideout in northern
Thailand near the Burmese border.

218
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,200
That jungle's filled with killers.
I'm going with you.

219
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:57,774
You're not going where I'm going.
I'll do anything to get him back.

220
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,472
And I'm not gonna take you down
with me.

221
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:04,211
You were right. I'm different
without Chuck and I don't like it.

222
00:16:04,387 --> 00:16:08,448
- You let me out of here. You need me.
- No. I need Chuck.

223
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:10,817
Walker.

224
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:12,320
Walker!

225
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,806
Who's got a screw loose?

226
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:36,975
- That has two meanings.
- Hey, guys, thanks for coming.

227
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:40,320
I'm hopeless and I was hoping
to get this computer fixed...

228
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,458
before Ellie got home from her shift.

229
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:46,152
Lucky for you, my Tuesday trapeze class
was canceled, so we're all yours.

230
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,127
You have a Roark 7?

231
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:51,193
Yeah, I guess so.

232
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:52,493
Oh, one other thing.

233
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:56,127
This little project has to stay a secret
from Chuck. Can we do that?

234
00:16:56,306 --> 00:17:01,141
Yeah, yeah, absolutely we can, my large,
chiseled, dulce-de-leche-colored friend.

235
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:06,044
But we want a little something from you,
if you know what I mean.

236
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,145
No, I actually have no idea
what you mean.

237
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,350
Four words:

238
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:14,718
My abscess, Lester's gout.

239
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:19,654
Medical consult for tech expertise.

240
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:21,690
You in?

241
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:25,433
Yeah, uh, anything for Ellie.

242
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:27,829
Good. Fabulous. Fabulous. All right.

243
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:31,462
Now let me look at the computer
while Jeffrey takes off his pants.

244
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:34,700
Yeah, I need to get my kit.

245
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:39,840
Hey.

246
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:42,576
I closed my eyes for a minute
and then she was gone.

247
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:45,016
She is so sneaky,
she must make an awesome spy.

248
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:48,521
- Walker went AWOL. Open the door.
- I figured she'd do something crazy.

249
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:52,650
I might be responsible. I told her
about Chuck's plans on proposing.

250
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:56,595
What? You threw gas on the fire.
Can't you ever keep your mouth shut?

251
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:59,894
Well, I'm sorry, Casey, okay?
I over-share to connect.

252
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:01,593
- I'm a connector.
- Open the door.

253
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:06,273
Yeah. Okay, I...

254
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:08,903
What?

255
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:12,275
I want in, okay? No, listen to me.
Chuck is my best friend.

256
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,848
And I wanna do more
than sit behind some computer.

257
00:18:15,018 --> 00:18:16,383
Absolutely not.

258
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:19,077
Chuck's in the jungles of hell.
It's too dangerous.

259
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:22,952
Well, fine. I mean, you want out,
I want in, all right?

260
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:25,526
Come on, I'm ready to go.
I have a backpack.

261
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,055
Casey, it's Chuck.

262
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,198
Fine.

263
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:34,700
- Deal?
- Deal.

264
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:39,764
No bullets for you.
Come on, we're going to Thailand.

265
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:14,105
You can talk to me.

266
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:20,616
I heard the Belgian has a hideout here.
Is that true?

267
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:26,318
First, sit down, relax.
Join me for a drink.

268
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:31,954
He has my boyfriend. Where is he?

269
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:34,763
Maybe I can be your boyfriend.

270
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,973
Anyone else wanna be my boyfriend?

271
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:54,109
Sarah, no. I can't lose you.
Please don't go. I'll do anything.

272
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,512
You say that, but then you don't flash.
You clearly don't want me enough.

273
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,524
I do. But I can't flash.
I know you wouldn't do this.

274
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:06,855
I know this is a dream
but please come back!

275
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,303
It's not working.

276
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:17,905
He's still aware enough
to suppress the Intersect.

277
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:20,575
Look at this.
I'm stimulating the hippocampus...

278
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:23,303
as much as I can
without causing permanent damage.

279
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:26,209
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you are boring me.

280
00:20:26,382 --> 00:20:28,612
Push harder.

281
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:31,479
Then we are in Phase Three.

282
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:34,982
We wipe out everything in his head
but the Intersect.

283
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:36,420
We lobotomize him.

284
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,157
So there would be no personality...

285
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:43,264
no memories, no thoughts
in the way of the Intersect.

286
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,995
All right, let's do it.

287
00:20:55,678 --> 00:20:57,373
That was very impressive.

288
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,105
I'm guessing you are the woman...

289
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:02,046
who has been fighting her way
across Thailand.

290
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:05,779
The people have been talking much
about the giant blond she-male.

291
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:08,914
Can you tell me
where to find the Belgian?

292
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:11,753
He's taken somebody
very important to me.

293
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:15,364
I don't like the Belgian,
so I will tell you where he is.

294
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:17,294
But first, a little fun.

295
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:23,966
I will give you the information
if you can beat my best fighter.

296
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:27,233
It's been months
since he's had a good match.

297
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,537
He kills too fast. Ha, ha.

298
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:32,374
I think you might make things
entertaining.

299
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:37,074
So yes?

300
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:16,412
This ends now.

301
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:22,381
I definitely know how to use this,
dirtbags.

302
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:39,431
Smart move.

303
00:23:39,642 --> 00:23:40,836
Good move, gentlemen.

304
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:43,677
Nice beard, nice beard.

305
00:23:43,846 --> 00:23:45,336
- Sarah.
- Oh.

306
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:49,716
- Morgan?
- Yeah, yeah, are you okay? Hold on.

307
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:51,747
You using this?

308
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:56,515
Here, some water. Some water.

309
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:59,422
- How did you find me?
- How did we find...?

310
00:23:59,762 --> 00:24:03,289
Half of Thailand is talking about
the giant she-male tearing through town.

311
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:06,867
But it's okay now. Casey and I are here.

312
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:11,139
Oh, my God. Scary snake. Scary snake.

313
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:12,433
King cobra.

314
00:24:15,478 --> 00:24:18,572
Walker, what are you
doing here all alone?

315
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,808
This place is nothing but scoundrels,
assassins and warlords.

316
00:24:21,984 --> 00:24:23,281
The scum of the earth.

317
00:24:23,452 --> 00:24:26,785
Ah, Mr. Casey, your usual?

318
00:24:30,926 --> 00:24:32,894
Come on, let's get out of here.

319
00:24:34,096 --> 00:24:36,997
A deal's a deal. The fight's not over.

320
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:41,403
I beat your guy,
you tell me where the Belgian is.

321
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:47,401
- I'm gonna finish this.
- What? Seriously?

322
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:50,272
Does no one care
there is a cobra in there?

323
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:53,177
Okay. Move it over. Oh, oh, come on.

324
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:56,182
You are not getting bullets
for a long, long time.

325
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:58,946
There was a lot of bullets.
Tons and tons of bullets.

326
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,248
I can't work with this.
Nando, Pozidriv screwdriver, stat.

327
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:08,455
What is this? This is not a Po...

328
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:10,826
Are you gonna earn your lanced boil
or aren't you?

329
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,628
Ah, you know what? Just go. Jeffrey.

330
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:17,266
Hey, we only got a few hours left
till the end of Ellie's shift.

331
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,841
- I can't make heads or tails of this thing.
- Can't anyone upstairs help?

332
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,138
Ooh. What a relief.
So I just insert the softener and...

333
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:27,476
- Yeah, that should do it.
- I really appreciate your help.

334
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,450
You're a heart doctor and don't often
deal in the darker corners of the body.

335
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,713
No, no, sure don't.

336
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:36,687
Now, you have a part
that Lester needed?

337
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:39,157
Sure do. Here you go.

338
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,125
Thank you, Michael.

339
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:43,663
Nice thing you're doing for your lady,
by the way.

340
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,063
Thanks. I'm gonna go wash up.

341
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:52,826
Yeah!

342
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:00,232
- Hello?
- Hey. Finally got you.

343
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:02,934
- I haven't seen you in a few days.
- Ellie...

344
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:05,470
Ellie, Ellie, listen.

345
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:08,648
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I'm in major trouble.

346
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:19,155
- What's going on?
- Listen.

347
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:23,320
Okay, please don't be mad, but I've been
spying again and I've been taken, okay?

348
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:25,592
I need you to call Sarah. Call Casey.

349
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:55,993
Now, where's Chuck?

350
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:58,326
I am somewhere in the jungle
in Thailand.

351
00:27:58,634 --> 00:28:00,829
And I am running for my life.

352
00:28:01,003 --> 00:28:03,528
- Can't you flash?
- Well, uh, no, I can't.

353
00:28:03,706 --> 00:28:05,697
Uh, I think you can.

354
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:08,606
Ellie, you don't sound very upset.

355
00:28:08,777 --> 00:28:11,610
Well, I just know that you could flash
if you really tried.

356
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:16,011
This is all a dream too.

357
00:28:18,187 --> 00:28:19,916
I can't get out of here, can I?

358
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:23,682
No, Chuck, you can't.
My name is Dr. Mueller.

359
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:27,222
I'm the one doing this to you.

360
00:28:27,563 --> 00:28:33,024
If you don't access the Intersect,
I'll be erasing everything that is you.

361
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:37,696
Your thoughts, your memories, your life.

362
00:28:44,046 --> 00:28:45,843
- You're real.
- I'm very real.

363
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,041
Now, Chuck, do you want to disappear
or give me the Intersect?

364
00:28:52,955 --> 00:28:54,479
I can't.

365
00:29:09,493 --> 00:29:11,757
Look, I'm sorry about Castle,
but Chuck is...

366
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:14,625
No, no. It's all right. Moron told me
he blabbed about the proposal.

367
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:19,267
I'm not leaving until I find him.

368
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:21,195
Neither am I.

369
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:29,840
Wow.

370
00:29:29,914 --> 00:29:32,610
It's like your gun is your soul.
Your metaphorical yes...

371
00:29:32,783 --> 00:29:36,480
to a question she couldn't possibly
bring herself to ask. Emotion later.

372
00:29:36,654 --> 00:29:38,952
- Tonight, we find Chuck.
- You're with the gear.

373
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,483
- You ride in the back.
- I ride in the back.

374
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,707
Initiating Phase Three.

375
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,350
How long will it take?

376
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,881
To wipe his mind clean? It varies.

377
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:58,124
But look at this section here.
It's beginning.

378
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,661
Goodbye, Chuck.

379
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:08,334
Hey, Chuck. Chuck.

380
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,868
Hey. Hey, wake up, buddy.

381
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,475
Hey, son. Get on up.

382
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,670
You've been sleeping
for a long time, man.

383
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:27,255
I know...
I know that this is still just a dream.

384
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,087
But you are all very real.

385
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,263
- Of course we're real.
- No, no, no.

386
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,331
I was taken.

387
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,496
And I almost escaped.

388
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,868
No, that was a dream too.
Like The Manchurian Candidate.

389
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,601
Or that episode of either Family Ties
or Hogan's Family?

390
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,745
All right, I don't know
what you're talking about, buddy.

391
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,677
But we sure would like it
if you were to flash.

392
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,958
Ha!

393
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,628
See? See, I told you
this was just a dream.

394
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,524
A dream that hurts. Ow.

395
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,374
- Here.
- Okay.

396
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,976
Here's my pitch. What if we
didn't use guns this time, okay?

397
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,210
If you don't use guns,
they don't use guns.

398
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,618
If they don't use guns, we have
a mission where nobody gets shot.

399
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,788
- You see what I'm saying?
- Hmm.

400
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,487
A diversion instead.

401
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:40,921
A magnet. Ready, Morgan?

402
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,098
Guns. Let's use lots of guns.

403
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:54,477
What do you think it feels like
to watch your life disappear?

404
00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:02,243
Chuck?

405
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:06,483
- Hey, Chuck.
- Morg?

406
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,858
It's me, buddy. Yeah.

407
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:11,290
I'm right here, okay? Now just flash.

408
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,488
Right. This is a dream.
This is only a dream.

409
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:16,462
Chuck, over here.

410
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,465
I need you to flash, son.

411
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,036
Okay. I'm ready to wake up now.

412
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,441
I mean,
remember when Sarah left you?

413
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,844
Oh, my God. That was...
That was funny. I mean, man...

414
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,982
Chuck, I'm on TV.

415
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,617
What's it gonna be, Bartowski, huh?

416
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,848
You wanna be a nerd,
or you wanna be a spy?

417
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,152
Flash or become expendable,
Agent Bartowski.

418
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,161
Flash, okay? Flash now, Chuck.

419
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,426
- Do it.
- This is your last chance.

420
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,293
- Flash.
- Do it, Bartowski.

421
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,701
What's the matter?
Don't you love your country?

422
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,704
- Can I get out?
- Yes, and you'll flash.

423
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,672
Understand?
Do you love your country?

424
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,573
Do you wanna be more than a nerd?

425
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:05,113
- You need to flash right now.
- No! No, I can't! I can't!

426
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:08,013
The government wants you to flash.

427
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,583
Only you can prevent
forest fires, man.

428
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,490
This is dangerous. Be careful.

429
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,994
Is this a hostel? Or is there a...?
Is there a hostel nearby?

430
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,727
Because... It's a book. It's just a book.

431
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,510
Oh, man. Help me out here, guys.

432
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,118
Hey, you!

433
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,212
Shut up.

434
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:48,119
- Get on your knees.
- Who brought their dad to the party?

435
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,294
I have some friendship bracelets.

436
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,562
All right, this is like a violation
of my civil rights.

437
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:20,512
Looks like we didn't need the guns.
What's up with the she-male thing?

438
00:34:21,158 --> 00:34:22,523
Chuck, it's okay.

439
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,896
Ellie. Ellie, help me. Help me.

440
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:33,230
I know you're not real,
but help me wake up.

441
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,894
Chuck, I'm right here.

442
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,937
We all really need you
to flash, though.

443
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,666
No. No, I can't!

444
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:47,283
No, get away from the door.

445
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,553
Stay with me.

446
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:51,947
Help me!

447
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:58,059
Argo? Thomas? What's going on out there?

448
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,656
None of the guards are answering.
Let's get out of here.

449
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,559
I've been looking for you.

450
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,142
- Chuck!
- There really is no use.

451
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,475
- He's almost completely gone.
- Shut up.

452
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,154
Chuck?

453
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,523
Chuck. Oh, my God.

454
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,988
Chuck, come on. Please wake up.

455
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,393
Chuck, listen to me. I'm here.

456
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,590
Chuck, I'm here.

457
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,500
Chuck, I'm here.

458
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,368
But you're not.

459
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,046
You're not real. This is a dream.

460
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,706
I came to rescue you.
I'm right here, Chuck.

461
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,646
Chuck, please, come on.

462
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,315
Hey, hey, hey.
Tell him what you told me before, okay?

463
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,189
He'll hear that. I know it.
This is your chance.

464
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:09,697
Don't be Sarah Walker the spy,
be Sarah Walker the girlfriend.

465
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,357
Chuck, please.

466
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,200
Chuck, I love you.

467
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,272
Please wake up.

468
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,841
I have so much that I wanna tell you.

469
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:25,114
- I found your proposal plan.
- No, no, no.

470
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:28,945
This is my mind playing tricks on me.
You don't know anything about my plan.

471
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,280
You were gonna do it
on the beach in Malibu...

472
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,421
where we watched the sunrise
after our first date.

473
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:41,855
- There were several racecars involved.
- I revised that.

474
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,058
I wanna spend the rest of my life
with you.

475
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,432
I don't care
if you have the Intersect or not.

476
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,038
Without you, I'm nobody.

477
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,733
I'm nothing but a spy.

478
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,974
Come back to me, Chuck.

479
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,611
I wanna marry you.

480
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,204
Oh, Chuck.

481
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:29,442
He's okay. He's okay.

482
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,709
Hmm.

483
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,476
- Yeah. Yeah. He's okay.
- Hi.

484
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:53,257
Bro, you almost done yet?

485
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:55,899
Ellie called to see
if I've figured this thing out.

486
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:59,696
While I'll examine dark places for that
woman, I'm at the end of my rope.

487
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:03,063
Not to worry,
my supple yet hard-bodied friend.

488
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:06,642
- You really don't need to call me that.
- Okay, people. Gather, humans.

489
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:12,472
You, uh, minions ready to see
what your broken bodies have wrought?

490
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,641
- Do it.
- Here goes.

491
00:38:18,956 --> 00:38:21,720
Nice work, amigo. You did it.

492
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:26,153
Hmm.

493
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,161
Needs a password.

494
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:32,467
"Knock, knock."
It's an impenetrable riddle.

495
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:35,171
I could hack it.
Take me about 12 hours.

496
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,933
And, uh, maybe I should try
a colonoscopy.

497
00:38:38,242 --> 00:38:39,709
Okay, everyone out, now.

498
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:43,210
- Let's go. We're done. Thank you.
- That's a no to the colonoscopy?

499
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:44,939
Congratulations, team.

500
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:48,483
The Belgian is in custody and America's
secrets are safe once more.

501
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:50,348
Oh, yeah. That's what I did today.

502
00:38:50,521 --> 00:38:53,456
Agent Bartowski,
I trust you're feeling better?

503
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:55,524
Yeah. Uh, yeah, I feel fine.

504
00:38:55,693 --> 00:39:00,460
I'm a little hazy on everything,
but, um, much better. Thank you.

505
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:03,532
And Agent Walker,
you are back to normal?

506
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:07,304
- Yes, uh. Yes, I am, general.
- Very good.

507
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:09,701
Because we have something
important to discuss:

508
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:13,071
Agent Bartowski's position in the agency
without the Intersect.

509
00:39:13,277 --> 00:39:15,074
Excuse me?
Government still wants me?

510
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:17,474
The Intersect appears
to be buried for good...

511
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:20,981
but we'll find a use for you.
You're an asset with or without it.

512
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:23,779
Yes, he is.

513
00:39:23,954 --> 00:39:25,854
Ahem. One last thing.

514
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:27,757
You're absolutely certain...

515
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:31,417
that even though the Belgian and
Chuck were both found in Thailand...

516
00:39:31,595 --> 00:39:36,032
you had nothing to do with the Thai
official who woke up this morning...

517
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,498
with no recollection of where he went
for two days?

518
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:39,897
Hmm?

519
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:42,039
No, ma'am.

520
00:39:42,206 --> 00:39:44,106
Crazy coincidence.

521
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:45,935
Welcome back.

522
00:39:47,211 --> 00:39:50,578
- I agree. Welcome back.
- Thank you for coming with me.

523
00:39:51,816 --> 00:39:54,444
Beckman knew, right?
I think she knew. I mean...

524
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:56,586
Hey, wait up, Casey.

525
00:39:57,822 --> 00:40:02,589
- Okay, so I'm still a spy.
- More importantly, you're home.

526
00:40:07,164 --> 00:40:10,793
Hey, um, you should know...

527
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:16,133
that the proposal plan that you found?
Just a rough draft.

528
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:20,240
- So you do remember what happened?
- Yeah, maybe a little.

529
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:21,969
A scoch.

530
00:40:22,146 --> 00:40:25,707
Don't think you know all the surprises
that I got hidden up my sleeves.

531
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:29,080
Because my sleeves are
chock-full o' surprises, you know?

532
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:30,277
Mm-hm.

533
00:40:30,454 --> 00:40:34,151
I'm surprised I could get in here with
all the surprises that are in my sleeves.

534
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:36,792
I got magic coming your way, baby.
Okay? Magic.

535
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:38,223
- Magic. Magic.
- Mm-hm.

536
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:42,560
- I've got no magic. You ruined my life.
- I saved your life. I took a Thai leech.

537
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:45,634
But now I can't use my
proposal plan, buddy. Come on.

538
00:40:45,803 --> 00:40:47,964
I need something new.
I need to surprise her.

539
00:40:48,139 --> 00:40:50,300
- How can I surprise a super spy?
- It's fine.

540
00:40:50,474 --> 00:40:53,807
Team Chuck and Morgan have
To blow Sarah's mind.

541
00:40:53,978 --> 00:40:56,572
By the way, you should've seen Sarah
without you, man.

542
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:59,807
Maybe it's good you lost the Intersect
because now you know...

543
00:40:59,984 --> 00:41:01,246
that girl loves you.

544
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:04,445
I mean, she will do anything for you.

545
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,582
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.

546
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:09,589
No, seriously. Anything, okay?

547
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,591
I had to pick a Thai tooth
out of her arm.

548
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:13,286
Ow.

549
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:15,965
I've got people who take teeth
and leeches for me.

550
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:19,330
- I'm a lucky guy.
- It's good having you back.

551
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:24,097
Ugh. I'm so happy to be home.

552
00:41:25,142 --> 00:41:28,839
And I am so happy to tell you that you
have nothing left on your plate today.

553
00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:30,844
- Hi.
- Hi. Mm.

554
00:41:31,015 --> 00:41:34,974
Your husband has fixed this computer.

555
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:36,483
Really?

556
00:41:36,654 --> 00:41:37,814
Oh, you're amazing.

557
00:41:38,856 --> 00:41:42,690
All we need now is a password.
The prompt is "knock, knock."

558
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,457
Know what it could be?

559
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:47,153
It's not, "Who's there?"
Already tried that one. Ha, ha.

560
00:41:50,234 --> 00:41:52,225
I know what it is.

561
00:41:53,204 --> 00:41:57,368
When I was a little girl, I would always
mess up the "knock, knock" routine.

562
00:41:57,541 --> 00:42:01,875
My dad would say, "Knock, knock,"
and I would say, "I'm here."

563
00:42:04,715 --> 00:42:07,707
It made him laugh so hard,
I never wanted to do it right.

564
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:22,557
Oh, my God.
