1
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:04,474
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few
things that you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:06,284
Alejandro Fulgencio Goya,

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:08,904
chief military officer of Costa Gravas.

4
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:10,694
You saved my life.

5
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:12,424
How can I ever hope to repay you?

6
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:13,714
Casey!

7
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:14,985
Gonna be laid up for a while.

8
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:18,004
Well, maybe you could use
the time to meet up with Alex,

9
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:19,435
figure out what your
role is in her life.

10
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,284
Why do you have my
daughter's phone number?

11
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:25,244
I do need to take things... slow.

12
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:27,395
Super slow.

13
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:38,735
The...

14
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:46,545
You're not... I.
I mean...

15
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,024
No! Oh, no, no.

16
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:50,044
This... I don't want...

17
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:52,564
It was here, it was on
the... it was on the ground.

18
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:54,145
Of course, with the one
knee, you were assum...

19
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:56,545
but no, not, that's not it.

20
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:00,555
- Well, I'm going to go talk to...
- I'm gonna go exercise.

21
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:05,664
So awkward.

22
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,284
In a world filled with
awkward Chuck and Sarah moments

23
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:11,504
comes one moment so awkward...

24
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:12,795
- Morgan.
- ...That it will have...

25
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:15,554
Morgan! Please, don't torture me.

26
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:17,785
Sarah and I haven't spoken
one word about what happened,

27
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,505
and even though I wasn't proposing,

28
00:01:19,506 --> 00:01:24,085
I'd like to know if thinking I
might have been was, you know,

29
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:26,254
good news or horrible news.

30
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:28,145
She's acting like nothing ever happened.

31
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:29,415
I get it, I get it.

32
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,464
Your woman is a hot mystery...

33
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:32,824
we both know that...

34
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:37,474
but I'm actually more interested
in this piece of the puzzle.

35
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:38,594
Now...

36
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:43,624
would you have been happy if she accidentally
said yes to your accidental proposal?

37
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,145
That's what's on the table.

38
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:51,884
I mean, I didn't think
we were there yet, but...

39
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:53,114
maybe.

40
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:55,585
Well, I tell you what. Before
there are any proposals,

41
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:56,975
I'll tell you what I know.

42
00:02:01,616 --> 00:02:05,024
Precious looks and whimsical little
make-ups after big misunderstandings,

43
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,984
you guys are fantastic, sure, but...

44
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:11,044
actual real live day-to-day open
communication about your feelings?

45
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:12,324
I get it.

46
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:14,704
We could be better communicators, fine.

47
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:16,214
So what now?

48
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:18,074
A self-help book?

49
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:18,914
No.

50
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:20,385
This isn't just any self-help book.

51
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:22,954
This is Dr. Fred's 101
Conversations Before "I Do."

52
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:25,704
Yeah, but I can't bring Sarah
a book about getting to "I do."

53
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:29,744
We just had a talk about how
she needs to take it slow, buddy.

54
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:30,685
Don't show her the book,

55
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:33,144
but use it as a tool to
help you guys talk, man.

56
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:35,944
Look, we can communicate
without the help of a book, okay?

57
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:36,785
We're not that bad.

58
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:38,345
You're great. You're
right, I'm sorry, yeah.

59
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:39,895
I mean, you don't know
whether or not you proposed,

60
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:41,135
or if you did, if you're happy about it,

61
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:43,435
or if she said yes or no to what
may or may not have been a proposal,

62
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:46,464
or if either of you ever want
you to actually ask her for real.

63
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:47,834
Yeah?

64
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,095
Yeah, you don't need no book.

65
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:51,005
You're fine. You're the perfect couple.

66
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:53,825
And when you're older,

67
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:56,684
You and Daddy can work out together.

68
00:02:56,685 --> 00:03:01,134
This is one of Daddy's
favorite jams for tri-blasting.

69
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:02,844
Devon. Yeah.

70
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:05,634
Do you realize that you haven't
addressed me in over an hour?

71
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,454
Oh. Sorry, babe.

72
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:10,505
Hey, I gotta talk to
Mommy for a minute, okay?

73
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:13,514
Hello, beautiful.

74
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,364
Hello.

75
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:16,664
We need to talk.

76
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:19,734
I am, uh, feeling a little over-babied.

77
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:21,314
I'm not even four months pregnant,

78
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:22,964
and it's all we talk about.

79
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:25,114
My hot husband suddenly
drives a minivan.

80
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:27,124
Yeah, an awesome minivan.

81
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,914
Toyota Sienna, safest
family auto in its class.

82
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,045
I'm just saying that maybe we could...

83
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:33,614
maybe we could get away,
go somewhere, like...

84
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:35,554
Let's take a babymoon.

85
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:37,234
Oh, babe, I'd love to.

86
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:40,864
But colleges can cost over
$300,000 grand by 2028.

87
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:42,055
We gotta prioritize.

88
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,834
The baby's not even here yet.

89
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:47,394
Can't we just spend these
last few months as just us?

90
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:49,234
You need a break from babyland.

91
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:52,305
- Yes.
- I am with you, honey.

92
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:55,264
We'll talk later, huh?

93
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:56,764
Good evening, team.

94
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:59,855
Comandante Juan Pablo Turrini.

95
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:04,024
Most trusted advisor to Costa
Gravan Premier Alejandro Goya.

96
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:06,814
Ah! The Generalissimo.

97
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,544
Casey, you're supposed
to in bed recovering.

98
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:11,574
Getting some fresh air.

99
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,794
In an underground bunker.

100
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,835
So what's with Turrini?

101
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:17,705
I ran into him a couple of times when
I was trying to kill the Generalissimo.

102
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:19,964
He's the head of Costa
Gravan Secret Police,

103
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,514
and he's in town unannounced,

104
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,644
which is extremely unusual.

105
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:25,824
I want everyone who wasn't shot recently

106
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:28,664
to stake out the embassy
to see if he turns up.

107
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:31,885
Everyone else should be in bed.

108
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:40,655
No sign of Costa Gravan activity.

109
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:46,924
Sarah?

110
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:49,245
Yeah?

111
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,295
What is it, Chuck?

112
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:57,044
- We are crap communicators.
- What?

113
00:04:57,045 --> 00:05:00,344
Why are we so afraid to talk
about the whole ring thing?

114
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,745
You know? I mean, we're in love.

115
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,235
You wear your teeth-bleaching
system in front of me.

116
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:06,844
We should be able to talk, no?

117
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:09,134
Okay. Well, um, let's talk about it.

118
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:11,794
Okay! Okay.

119
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,035
Well, first of all, first of all,

120
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:16,554
you know that-that
definitely was not a...

121
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:18,004
proposal, right?

122
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:20,274
Yes! Yes, uh, totally, of course.

123
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:25,855
Of course. Of course? I mean,
it could've been misconstrued.

124
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:32,574
Morgan-I know-Morgan
gave me this book.

125
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:34,384
This kind of, you know...

126
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:38,904
It's a silly book, full of
silly things, like questions,

127
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,265
that you're supposed to ask your partner

128
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:42,535
to help you get talking about
the hard to talk about things.

129
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:44,604
So I was thinking... I
don't know, maybe we'll...

130
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:46,824
- Should I read it?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

131
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:48,044
I'll read it.

132
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:49,925
I'll read it, and I'll ask
you the questions, yeah.

133
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:54,164
And then we can have a series of
emotionally stimulating conversations.

134
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:56,984
Or at least that's what
the back cover says.

135
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:59,624
Walker, Bartowski, we
have new information.

136
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,325
What is it?

137
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,804
Our satellite picked
up Turrini's motorcade.

138
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:05,464
He's not headed to the embassy.

139
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,495
So then, where is he heading?

140
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:20,074
Buenas noches, Dr. Woodcomb.

141
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:23,705
Costa Gravas calls once more.

142
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:31,896
Chuck 4x04 - Versus the Coup d'Etat

143
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,959
What's going on?

144
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,129
Hey, bro. Just in time.

145
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,189
Good evening.

146
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,419
I am Comandante Juan Pablo Turrini.

147
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,650
I am here to deliver a personal
message from the Generalissimo.

148
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,609
Hola, Devon Woodcomb.

149
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,220
And bride!

150
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,869
I've been so wanting to
thank you for saving my life,

151
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,860
and I think the best way
is just to invite you here

152
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:41,659
to my little bit of Paradise.

153
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,969
Costa Gravas is beautiful
at this time of year,

154
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,359
as is my private jet
that will fly you here.

155
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,669
Private jet.

156
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,120
Enjoy my beaches, eh?

157
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,270
My jungles!

158
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,409
My palace!

159
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,529
Allow me to drench you both,
please, in luxury this very weekend.

160
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,959
Come... to Costa Gravas!

161
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,229
Devon, babymoon.

162
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,849
Babe, it's not safe. We can't go.

163
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,079
Come on...

164
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,179
Sarah, is it safe?

165
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,169
Well, actually, Costa
Gravas is stable right now.

166
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,459
Actually, Costa Gravas is very stable.

167
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,579
We have peace now.

168
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,429
And Subway sandwich franchises.

169
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,059
Come on. It sounds like the
most amazing couple's weekend.

170
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,209
We could go, too, you know.

171
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,990
If it would make you
feel safer, Sarah could...

172
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:34,879
could be there, relaxing, talking...

173
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,879
In a bikini.

174
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,179
You are both more than welcome.

175
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,709
Plus, you will be staying at the palace.

176
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,929
There is no safer or more
luxurious place in all the world.

177
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,550
Prepare for luxury.

178
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,639
There you go.

179
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,899
Snuggles, huh? Okay. Do
you need anything else?

180
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,880
I don't need anything.

181
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,919
Okay.

182
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,250
That's fine. I understand.

183
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,169
I'll get it. I'll get it.

184
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,489
No, no, no, no. Stay! I will get it.

185
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,729
I'm supposed to be helping you, Casey.

186
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,189
- Morgan!
- Alex!

187
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,289
- Daughter.
- Dad.

188
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,450
You're in a wheelchair.

189
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,549
You said that you were just sick.

190
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,489
Oh, just shot in the leg. Fine.

191
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,370
Well, I... brought you soup.

192
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,750
I didn't know you were
going to be here, Morgan.

193
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,829
How did, uh, how did
the pot roast turn out?

194
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,069
Uh... great.

195
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,359
Yeah, no, it was perfect.

196
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,779
Thank you for the recipe.

197
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,159
You two talk often?

198
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,429
No. No, I wouldn't say often.

199
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,859
Once in a blue moon, when
we need to discuss meats.

200
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,449
Meat.

201
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,559
Assorted meats. Potted meat.

202
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,429
Oh, movies! Good, good, good,
let's see what we got...

203
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,029
Roman Holiday?

204
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,779
Yeah. Nothing makes me feel better
when I'm sick than Princess Audrey.

205
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,419
Stop it, this is my sick day movie, too.

206
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,159
Come on. Seriously?

207
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,699
Okay, Grimes, you're done.

208
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,639
Go.

209
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,120
Well, I, uh, I better be going, too.

210
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:13,189
I gotta get back to work.

211
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,749
But I will talk to you later.

212
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,339
That sounds great.

213
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,130
Bye.

214
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,089
- Yes.
- Grimes?

215
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,840
- Right.
- Give her a five minute lead, hmm?

216
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,130
Of course.

217
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Okay, which one?

218
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:46,990
This one or the leopard print?

219
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,599
Uh, yes, that, both, all of the above.

220
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,059
Okay.

221
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,739
So... you, uh...

222
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,720
You just wanted to go on a vacation?

223
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:59,339
Exactly. Yeah.

224
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,900
You know, because
Turrini's not a threat,

225
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:02,850
and Beckman cleared us
for a couple days off,

226
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:04,750
and we've been so
focused on my mom hunt,

227
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,289
I thought it would be nice if we
were just a couple of regular people

228
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,910
relaxing on a tropical island.

229
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,629
Working on our communication exercises.

230
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,299
That's what you're excited about?

231
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,809
Our communication exercises?

232
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:25,000
Well, there are many ways
in which to communicate.

233
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,030
Like that.

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,929
Welcome! I'm so glad you've come.

235
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,160
Oh! Oh! Generalissimo!

236
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:56,749
Thanks for having us.

237
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,090
And the bride. Hello.

238
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,869
There's an unmistakable fragrance.

239
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,689
You are with child.

240
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,519
Oh. He's good.

241
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,590
There is nothing sweeter
than a ripe fruit, no?

242
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,380
May I introduce my wife. Amor.

243
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,980
The light of Costa Gravas.

244
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,589
The woman behind the man,

245
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,880
Senora Hortencia de la Corazon Goya.

246
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,129
Bienvenidos.

247
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,890
I apologize if my husband has
charmed away any of your women.

248
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,130
Come. Tonight we dance.

249
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,419
So, uh, where were we
on the conversations?

250
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,760
- Personal time.
- Oh, yes, yes.

251
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:09,519
Morgan is going to need at
least five hours of my time

252
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,259
every week for Halo purposes.

253
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,569
And I need 30 minutes of
complete silence before sleep.

254
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,099
Which is gonna be a challenge
of my cuddling needs.

255
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,379
Okay, how about we do one night
cuddle, one night silent thing?

256
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,129
Hey, see, these are
useful conversations.

257
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,409
Everyone.

258
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,650
Please.

259
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:36,819
I would like to present now a gift to
my guest of honor, Dr. Devon Woodcomb.

260
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,710
For your great service to our country.

261
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,140
Did you just flash?

262
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,949
Huh? No. No, no, no. Not now.

263
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,350
We were just starting to get somewhere.

264
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:14,930
We were talking, I
was gonna have sangria.

265
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:16,489
Chuck.

266
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,649
There's a... There's a
Soviet-era weapons system

267
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,260
down that hallway behind a red door.

268
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,740
But we're here for, like, five days, so
why don't we just grab it on the way out,

269
00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:27,039
after rain forest zip-lining.

270
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,079
- Chuck, if it's a threat...
- I know, I know.

271
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,280
I know, I know, but my sister's
here. I can't be spying around her.

272
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:33,990
What if something happens?

273
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,879
Move into position.

274
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,259
Now.

275
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,370
It's okay. We'll just go in,

276
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,130
we'll check it out, we'll
come back into the party,

277
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:47,910
nobody will know, and
nobody will get hurt.

278
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,359
Our time is here.

279
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,319
Our beautiful Socialist dream

280
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,259
has been taken apart
by Capitalist swine.

281
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,179
But tonight,

282
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,880
our voices will heard.

283
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,810
I'm gonna call Casey about your flash.

284
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:09,450
He hunted the Generalissimo
in this palace for a decade.

285
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,551
He can give us the layout.

286
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:13,760
Okay, okay, well, he, uh,
did just get shot in the leg,

287
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:17,671
and is resting up, so he
probably won't be available.

288
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:20,630
Casey. What do you need?

289
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,040
A little bored, Casey?

290
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,941
Dear God, please give
me something to do.

291
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:30,690
Hey. I just flashed on
some stupid weapons system

292
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:33,800
behind a red door. I think it's down
the northeast hallway off the ballroom?

293
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:35,300
I know that hallway.

294
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,421
When I was hunting the Generalissimo
back in my Angel de la Muerte days,

295
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:40,420
I lived in one of those
walls for two weeks.

296
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:42,311
You know, one of these days
we really ought to write down

297
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:44,530
all of these crazy stories of yours.

298
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:46,560
Let me talk to Sarah,
and we'll call you back.

299
00:15:46,561 --> 00:15:48,561
We have to figure out how
to get past the guards.

300
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:50,570
We need a diversion.

301
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:51,930
Oh, shucks!

302
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:53,411
Impossible. Not gonna happen.

303
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,781
I guess we're just gonna have to
save the world after the party.

304
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:02,380
I only do this once a year, but

305
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:05,601
it's such a special occasion, no?

306
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:23,051
Fine, but I'm bringing my drink.

307
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:30,800
Look at the abs on this statue.

308
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:33,320
I think I've put on
a little baby weight.

309
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:37,120
Hey, no baby talk, remember?

310
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,340
This weekend, we are
just husband and wife

311
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:43,320
on a sexy vacation.

312
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:44,791
How do you feel about taking a tour

313
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:47,430
of some of the darker
corners of the palacio?

314
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:51,950
Babe, is nine-foot marble me
making you a little caliente?

315
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:53,941
Maybe.

316
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:59,431
Way to go, marble me.

317
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,661
Okay, Casey, we're down the staircase.

318
00:17:07,662 --> 00:17:09,101
Keep heading down the hall.

319
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:10,860
Just follow the stink of commie.

320
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:14,031
Roger that.

321
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:17,140
Well, in the meantime, let's keep
going with the questions, huh?

322
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:20,341
What are five words you'd
use to describe your partner?

323
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:28,480
Start moving everyone into position.

324
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,420
My husband, the pig, and his
American friends can roast together.

325
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:35,350
Brunette? Tall?

326
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:36,720
Okay, yeah, good, close,

327
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,460
but how about, like,
charming, terminally handsome,

328
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:41,280
incredibly intelligent.

329
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:42,461
Uh, this is the door.

330
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,981
Here. Hold this.

331
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:01,690
Okay, this is the door.

332
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:03,390
So, what do you think?

333
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,480
Rock and roll.

334
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:06,610
This may take a few minutes.

335
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:10,470
Oh, God. Ramming happening right
now. What do we do? Any ideas?

336
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:15,000
- Oh, Devon, you're so bad.
- How bad am I?

337
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,291
Good Lord, get me out of here.

338
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:27,210
Uh, hi, guys. Hey. Chuck, hi.

339
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:29,590
Sorry. Really sorry.

340
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:31,160
For me mostly.

341
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:33,770
I know what you two
were sneaking off to do.

342
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:38,851
Looks like Costa Gravas makes
everyone run a little more caliente.

343
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:41,451
What was that?

344
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:05,630
Bring me my husband's head!

345
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:07,180
I want him dead or alive.

346
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:08,840
So, not the strongest of marriage.

347
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:10,151
Okay, Chuck, I know
you're not a spy anymore,

348
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:12,961
but I really need you
to do some spy stuff!

349
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:18,270
Dude. They blew my head off.

350
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:20,500
We have to get the Generalissimo.

351
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:22,121
Oh, my God.

352
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:34,481
Chuck, the gun!

353
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:43,671
Chuck?

354
00:19:57,431 --> 00:20:00,430
Sis, you okay?

355
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:02,360
Yeah, yeah, we're good, man.

356
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:03,361
That was awesome, Chuck.

357
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:05,201
Good. Great. Let's go.

358
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:10,680
Casey, get us out of here.

359
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:13,311
If you can get to the
basement, I can get you out.

360
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,321
Generalissimo, is there an escape plan?

361
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:17,191
Of course. I'm sorry about all of this.

362
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:19,491
My wife and I - we've been fighting a lot lately.
You know, women...

363
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:22,030
Generalissimo, I once saved your
life. I need you to save ours.

364
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:25,380
Of course. Of course.
Come. Come. Right this way.

365
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:27,880
Funny story. The Angel de la Muerte...

366
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:31,110
he hid in these very walls for
two weeks trying to kill me.

367
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:33,960
I was in Havana with
Castro the whole time.

368
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,961
I heard that.

369
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:43,251
This way. My plane awaits.

370
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:50,061
Come on, come on, come on.

371
00:20:57,301 --> 00:21:01,201
I cannot believe that there
was a coup on my babymoon.

372
00:21:01,491 --> 00:21:03,830
Chuck, thank God that you were there.

373
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:05,970
You were so amazing, really.

374
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:08,040
Seriously, bro. Thank you.

375
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:12,901
I just wanted to save the day
before Awesome got a chance to.

376
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:17,300
I am so sorry that I made us go
there. It was so stupid of me.

377
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:19,190
No, it wasn't stupid.

378
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:20,760
We do need time away.

379
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:23,530
That's why, when we go home,
we're going straight to Malibu.

380
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:24,701
I hear you, hon.

381
00:21:24,702 --> 00:21:27,791
And this babymoon will happen.

382
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:39,231
Just look at them, Sarah.

383
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:43,060
They're like communication all-stars.

384
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:47,401
That's all great, but we have a
homeless dictator on our hands.

385
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:52,000
I mean, I knew things had cooled over
the years between Hortencia and myself,

386
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:53,821
but a coup d'état?

387
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:57,090
We used to finish
each other's sentences.

388
00:21:57,091 --> 00:21:59,090
I know, Generalissimo, I know.

389
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:02,530
The Costa Gravan embassy in Los
Angeles is preparing for your arrival.

390
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,400
Are you crazy?

391
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:05,791
If I cannot trust my wife now,

392
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,711
how am I supposed to trust my embassy?

393
00:22:07,712 --> 00:22:11,540
Uh, we can try to arrange a CIA safe
house with some guards for the time being.

394
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:15,331
No, I know where I will go now.

395
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,351
There is only one person
to whom I trust my life now.

396
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:22,941
John Casey.

397
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:26,420
So... roomies.

398
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:29,010
The wheelchair is not as
intimidating as I would hope,

399
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:30,710
but...

400
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:33,811
your casa is my casa, huh?

401
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,619
What a freaking disaster.

402
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:49,615
- Morning, boss.
- Morning, Big Mike.

403
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:51,964
Oh, Big Mike, hey, I
could use some advice.

404
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:54,704
I'm having a little lady trouble.

405
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:58,684
A son asking his new daddy
for love advice. Yeah.

406
00:22:58,685 --> 00:23:00,104
I could well up.

407
00:23:00,105 --> 00:23:01,104
Please don't.

408
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:02,575
Here's the thing-
I-I met this girl,

409
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:04,774
and there's this wonderful connection,

410
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:08,054
and I think she might be
it, except there's this,

411
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,494
like, this little detail.

412
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:13,185
It's Casey's daughter.

413
00:23:14,615 --> 00:23:16,544
Yeah, well,

414
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,635
that's not a daddy you
want giving you a spanking.

415
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:20,494
- We agree.
- Well, son,

416
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:23,014
you have to decide whether
this girl is really it or not,

417
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:24,704
because if she is,

418
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:29,875
there is no arm or leg worth as
much as the love of a good woman.

419
00:23:32,225 --> 00:23:35,824
The computer is analyzing the
photos I took in Costa Gravas.

420
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:38,574
I'm sorry our vacation didn't work out.

421
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:39,675
No, hey, whatever.

422
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:42,884
I mean, we can still keep
having conversations anyway.

423
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:45,224
I mean, we've got, like, 87 more to go,

424
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:47,724
and the next few are about sex.

425
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:48,925
Chuck, we have a mission.

426
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:50,525
We don't need to talk
about our sex life.

427
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:52,365
Sarah, there's always
going to be a mission,

428
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,455
and I think it's important
that we make time to talk,

429
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:55,795
even about the awkward stuff.

430
00:23:55,796 --> 00:23:59,014
In fact, you know, if
it is the awkward thing,

431
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:03,094
Dr. Fred suggests talking about the difficult
things to your partner while they're sleeping.

432
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:05,395
I'm not going to talk to
you while you're asleep.

433
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:06,675
This book sounds kind of ridiculous.

434
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:07,945
Okay, so it's not, it's not perfect,

435
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,834
but I do think it's helping us talk.

436
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:14,185
Dr. Fred is world-renowned, after all.

437
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:26,774
101 Conversations Before "I Do"?

438
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:31,085
That's the book, the one
covered in wedding rings?

439
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:34,545
Yeah.

440
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:36,405
I thought we talked about this.

441
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:37,895
I thought we were going to take it slow.

442
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:40,874
I know, I know we did, and
we are going to take it slow.

443
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:43,074
It's just...

444
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:47,234
you know, someday maybe
we could talk about that.

445
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,864
And it takes a long time
to have 101 conversations.

446
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,524
Why do we always have to talk
and push and change things?

447
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:55,165
Why can't we just be?

448
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:03,534
Uh, Sarah...

449
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,914
Everything is great.

450
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:07,524
What if we do "I do," and it changes us?

451
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:08,425
It's nuclear.

452
00:25:08,426 --> 00:25:10,595
Exactly, everything we love
about us could be destroyed.

453
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:13,184
No, not us, the weapon.

454
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:15,714
It's a nuclear control panel.

455
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:19,095
The Costa Gravans have nukes.

456
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,884
Costa Gravas is nuclear?!

457
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:24,265
All right, yes.

458
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:27,474
I have a nuclear weapons
control panel in my basement.

459
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:29,204
This is such ugliness.

460
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:29,945
How does it work?

461
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:33,804
There are nuclear missiles at sites
throughout the Costa Gravan jungle.

462
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:36,904
They're all aimed at different
cities, mostly American.

463
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:39,004
Look, it takes two keys, okay,

464
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:41,094
two keys to use the system.

465
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:44,454
One of them is right
here. It's around my neck, see?

466
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:47,444
You have one key.

467
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,485
Where is the other one?

468
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:54,425
This is so embarrassing, you know?

469
00:25:56,245 --> 00:26:02,674
I gave it away years ago to
the person I trusted the most.

470
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:05,625
Okay?

471
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:07,204
My wife.

472
00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:09,444
The woman who has just
taken over your country?

473
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:13,765
You have questioned the
Generalissimo enough for one night.

474
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:16,404
He lost his country and his love today.

475
00:26:16,405 --> 00:26:17,265
He must rest.

476
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:18,484
All right.

477
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:21,114
Colonel Casey, watch the
Generalissimo closely.

478
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:22,754
We'll speak more in the morning.

479
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:25,615
Walker and Bartowski, private line.

480
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:31,204
You two are going back to Costa Gravas.

481
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:34,014
We can't have a rogue leader
with nuclear capabilities.

482
00:26:34,015 --> 00:26:36,894
Meet with Colonel Casey about
the layout of the palace tonight,

483
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,134
and leave first thing in the morning.

484
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:41,105
Yes, ma'am.

485
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:44,234
Isn't life funny, Colonel Casey?

486
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,204
That I would be here, hmm,

487
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:49,034
guarded by the Angel of Death?

488
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:50,314
Forgive me...

489
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:52,234
the Angel of Life.

490
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:56,424
That I would be here and
wondering where will I go next?

491
00:26:56,425 --> 00:27:01,214
I got to be honest. This isn't
how I thought it'd end up for you.

492
00:27:01,215 --> 00:27:03,464
Why?

493
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:06,434
Well, I wrote a report back in '91

494
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:10,474
theorizing you'd be taken down
by someone else altogether,

495
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:13,744
someone whose politics
never moved to the center,

496
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:17,094
as have yours.

497
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:20,975
Someone who could never
take his eyes off your wife.

498
00:27:22,745 --> 00:27:26,695
Move around behind me, Generalissimo.

499
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,995
Do not make me shoot
a man in a wheelchair.

500
00:27:47,105 --> 00:27:49,034
Better?

501
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:51,184
Generalissimo,

502
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:53,744
you're coming with me.

503
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:56,064
Hortencia and I need your key.

504
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:58,574
You're not going
anywhere, Generalissimo.

505
00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:00,985
I think you are.

506
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:07,914
Cute.

507
00:28:07,915 --> 00:28:10,704
Too bad you didn't bring enough.

508
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:13,074
Ahora...

509
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:16,485
¿Quién quiere morir primero?

510
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:24,504
I'm sorry, my friend.

511
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:27,284
No harm comes to him.

512
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:30,805
¿Comprende?

513
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:35,834
His blood runs in my veins.

514
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:39,955
You do not kill him, I go with you.

515
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:44,895
Vamos.

516
00:28:51,423 --> 00:28:53,937
Your task is to sneak
back into Costa Gravas,

517
00:28:53,938 --> 00:28:56,847
destroy the nuclear control
room, and find the missiles.

518
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:58,947
The U. S. wants the
Generalissimo back in charge

519
00:28:58,948 --> 00:29:01,627
but without nuclear capabilities.

520
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:02,588
On it, General.

521
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:05,257
I know every corner of
that godforsaken slime hole.

522
00:29:05,258 --> 00:29:08,187
Colonel Casey, are you certain
you're up for a mission?

523
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:10,598
- He seems to be pretty determined.
- I think he is.

524
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,257
Casey.

525
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:19,768
You could have told
me that when you said

526
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:22,147
this place was a
"godforsaken slime hole,"

527
00:29:22,148 --> 00:29:25,707
you were speaking literally.

528
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:27,937
We're almost to the control room.

529
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:29,517
Yeah.

530
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,337
We'll place the charges around it.

531
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:34,968
That way, if we have to, we
can obliterate the whole thing.

532
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:39,777
Oh, what is that smell?

533
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,958
That is the stench of tyranny.

534
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,477
Dr. Fred.

535
00:29:57,478 --> 00:30:00,007
Wow, big fan, really just a big fan.

536
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,047
Listen, I-I met someone recently,

537
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:04,227
and it is of
life-or-death importance

538
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:07,467
that I make absolutely
certain that she is The One.

539
00:30:07,468 --> 00:30:11,297
Actually, that is the topic
of my next book How to Know...

540
00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:13,747
250 pages of exercises guiding you

541
00:30:13,748 --> 00:30:16,607
through a revolutionary
40-step process.

542
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:17,867
40 steps, huh?

543
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:20,218
Yeah, that's a lot of detail,
you know, but I just...

544
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:22,387
Excuse me.

545
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:25,637
Son, are you going to
another man for love advice?

546
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:29,787
Have I not made your mama Bolonia
sing like the happiest bird in the sky?

547
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,797
Probably, sir, sure.

548
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:34,967
Listen, here's the thing-this guy
wrote the book on it, literally.

549
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:39,107
Boy, when has anyone ever learned
anything important from a book?

550
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:40,627
You got to take your woman,

551
00:30:40,628 --> 00:30:43,167
kiss her on the lips,
and see what happens.

552
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:45,737
If you hear sweet, smooth jams

553
00:30:45,738 --> 00:30:50,698
rise up from your soul,
then that's your answer.

554
00:30:55,388 --> 00:30:59,487
I've never, ever heard smooth jams.

555
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:01,687
The former head of our
people became a puppet

556
00:31:01,688 --> 00:31:05,117
for the Americans and was
getting fat off our land.

557
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:08,847
I think I've stayed very
fit over the years, actually.

558
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:11,437
Shut up, Alejandro, you've
ruined seven takes already.

559
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:12,418
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

560
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:16,108
I just wish I knew why
you were so angry with me.

561
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:18,047
Why?

562
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:21,177
I have been telling you for
years that I was unhappy.

563
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:22,478
But would you work on it?

564
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,728
Would you go see someone with me?

565
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:27,137
Amor, what kind of rebel leader
goes to a marriage counselor?

566
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:28,557
It's ridiculous.

567
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:31,358
Hortencia.

568
00:31:35,318 --> 00:31:38,917
For any who might want to
remove the people from office,

569
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:41,087
know that we hold the keys

570
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:43,747
to the most powerful weapon in the world

571
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:46,327
and are not afraid to use force.

572
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:48,987
You know, darling, maybe you
should unbutton one more button.

573
00:31:48,988 --> 00:31:50,507
Shut up!

574
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,217
This is exactly the problem.

575
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:56,048
You have to do everything your way!

576
00:31:58,628 --> 00:32:00,347
We need to act fast right now.

577
00:32:00,348 --> 00:32:02,857
Somebody's about to
accidentally start World War III.

578
00:32:02,858 --> 00:32:06,337
I say we blow the room, let
the Costa Gravans start fresh.

579
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:09,207
We are more or less in the room.

580
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,048
It's better than an accidental nuking.

581
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:12,647
You're crazy.

582
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:17,658
We're all about to die over basically
just one big relationship problem?

583
00:32:18,428 --> 00:32:20,307
Por favor, move.

584
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:23,277
Make me shoot you through the head
like you shot me through the heart.

585
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,568
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. No shooting.

586
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:30,027
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

587
00:32:30,028 --> 00:32:31,988
I know this is a very private moment.

588
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:34,057
I just thought maybe
you needed a mediator.

589
00:32:34,058 --> 00:32:36,388
Grab him!

590
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:40,457
Stop. Stop.

591
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,338
We're here to help.

592
00:32:48,588 --> 00:32:50,877
How did you get back into my country?

593
00:32:50,878 --> 00:32:52,667
Who are you people working for?

594
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:56,117
Well, uh, technically,
we're with the CIA.

595
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:56,828
Shoot them.

596
00:32:56,829 --> 00:32:58,188
Wait, wait, wait. Wait. No, listen.

597
00:32:58,189 --> 00:33:01,267
We are trained to deal with
situations just like this,

598
00:33:01,268 --> 00:33:03,427
and by the way, you're
right about your husband.

599
00:33:03,428 --> 00:33:04,687
Totally right.

600
00:33:04,688 --> 00:33:06,957
Guards, take them to the barracks.

601
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:09,158
Stop.

602
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:12,098
What do you mean?

603
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:14,167
So glad you asked. So glad she asked.

604
00:33:14,168 --> 00:33:16,907
Interesting. Um, this is what
I mean. This is what I mean.

605
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:18,487
We heard him undermining you

606
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:20,728
when you were just trying to
make, you know, your little

607
00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:22,757
new head-of-state
video.

608
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:27,048
And you know, getting treated like
that for 25 years? Who needs it?!

609
00:33:27,968 --> 00:33:29,537
Thank you.

610
00:33:29,538 --> 00:33:30,648
You're welcome. You're welcome.

611
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:32,318
But, hey, I just call it like I see it.

612
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,497
Here's the thing, Hortencia.

613
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:36,727
You two clearly still
care about each other.

614
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:39,018
You could have killed the
Generalissimo at any point,

615
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:39,708
and you haven't done it.

616
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:43,427
What is happening?! Hortencia, shoot
these people!

617
00:33:43,428 --> 00:33:46,208
Lead your country.

618
00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:50,647
I bet... I bet, when you started out,

619
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:53,727
just the two of you crazy kids cuddled
up in your little tropical cave,

620
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:57,587
dreaming of revolution, and
having sweet, sweet jungle love,

621
00:33:57,588 --> 00:34:00,557
everything was perfect, no?

622
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,308
But then we moved into
the palace, and he changed.

623
00:34:05,598 --> 00:34:09,647
So change ruined things?

624
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,397
But change is unavoidable.

625
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:14,307
Unavoidable. Life is full of changes.

626
00:34:14,308 --> 00:34:16,447
Constantly changing,
and the question is,

627
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:23,678
no matter what the changes
are, is the love still there?

628
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:30,568
Fine. I'll shoot them.

629
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:36,938
Angel de la Vida!

630
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:43,237
Today I'm Muerte.

631
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:45,087
FYI, lady,

632
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:47,367
this guy used to watch you sleep.

633
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:50,968
Trust me. I lived in
these walls for two weeks.

634
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:53,177
Chuck, keep talking.

635
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:53,988
Talking, talking, yes!

636
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,628
We were, we were talking about change.

637
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:58,887
The fact is we were partners...

638
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,937
comrades.

639
00:35:00,938 --> 00:35:04,917
And then he stopped listening to me.

640
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:05,998
No, I listened.

641
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:09,667
No, it was different
before when it was just us.

642
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:15,047
Uh, that-that, um, that love
that you had in the cave?

643
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:18,448
That doesn't have to change.

644
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:29,208
Amor...

645
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:35,237
would you join me again in
leading this country? Will you?

646
00:35:35,238 --> 00:35:36,967
I need you...

647
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,637
just to challenge me,

648
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:39,937
to feed my soul.

649
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:44,028
We'll get back to who
we were, I know it.

650
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:48,027
My love never died.

651
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:50,347
And you will give me an official role?

652
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,977
You'll be Secretary of State.

653
00:35:52,978 --> 00:35:55,737
I love it when you talk politics.

654
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,728
Baby...

655
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:36,315
I'm, uh, so glad you're here.

656
00:36:36,605 --> 00:36:40,724
Look, I know we've had some flirtation

657
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:44,994
going on, and, uh, I've been a bit...

658
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,014
tentative.

659
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:49,284
Right?

660
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:50,605
But I was talking to Dr. Fred,

661
00:36:50,606 --> 00:36:52,185
and he has this whole, like, you know,

662
00:36:52,186 --> 00:36:54,975
series of exercises that could help...

663
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,465
Or just go that route.

664
00:37:03,466 --> 00:37:06,094
Morgan, I like you.

665
00:37:06,095 --> 00:37:08,314
I know that you're
freaked out about my dad,

666
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:12,485
but I want to do this.

667
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:14,994
Do you?

668
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:18,834
Oh, it's not that I... it's not...

669
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:20,674
Just, I just, you know,

670
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:22,805
I feel like there are steps
that people need to take,

671
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:28,404
you know. There are questions
that need to be... answered.

672
00:37:28,405 --> 00:37:30,215
An answer, they don't get answered,

673
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:31,505
then there's more.

674
00:37:31,506 --> 00:37:33,784
Okay, I'm gonna go.

675
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,104
I don't... I...

676
00:37:36,105 --> 00:37:38,435
Oh, screw it!

677
00:37:57,065 --> 00:38:00,004
We got troops incoming shortly to
collect and dismantle the missiles.

678
00:38:00,005 --> 00:38:02,835
And we're almost done in here.

679
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:12,264
You come, my friends,
and join the celebration.

680
00:38:12,265 --> 00:38:15,404
In Costa Gravas, first we
revolution, but then we party.

681
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:18,274
Did you purchase this system
from Volkoff Industries?

682
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:20,504
What?

683
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:21,444
Yeah.

684
00:38:21,445 --> 00:38:24,614
It was part of his
underground weapons pipeline.

685
00:38:24,615 --> 00:38:26,824
It was called Project Beacon.

686
00:38:26,825 --> 00:38:29,864
That's what Heather
Chandler told us about.

687
00:38:29,865 --> 00:38:31,864
Did any of Volkoff's
men ever mention a woman,

688
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:35,694
she was CIA, code name "Frost"?

689
00:38:35,695 --> 00:38:36,824
Yeah.

690
00:38:36,825 --> 00:38:38,234
I never met her.

691
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:40,384
He kept her tucked away back home.

692
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,054
Some kind of a kept woman.

693
00:38:42,055 --> 00:38:44,034
Angel de la Vida,

694
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:46,864
I got a few Costa Gravan
angels downstairs, huh,

695
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:50,925
for the man who rescued
their country from civil war.

696
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:57,924
General, do you remember anything
else about Volkoff or-or Frost?

697
00:38:57,925 --> 00:38:59,885
I'm gonna give you all my
files of my dealings with him.

698
00:38:59,886 --> 00:39:04,235
Just remember these are
dangerous people, okay?

699
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:08,074
Proceed with caution.

700
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:11,145
These are people you don't want to find.

701
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:31,085
Hey, back from the babymoon, huh?

702
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:34,814
How was it?

703
00:39:34,815 --> 00:39:36,484
It was beautiful.

704
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:40,875
I, uh, I was thinking
about you a lot, actually.

705
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:46,874
You were pretty good at
the spy stuff, weren't you?

706
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:47,565
I mean...

707
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:52,754
You just seemed so alive back there.

708
00:39:52,755 --> 00:39:57,765
I don't think I really realized
what you were giving up for me.

709
00:39:58,135 --> 00:40:00,184
Ah! I didn't really
give up all that much.

710
00:40:00,185 --> 00:40:03,344
Yes, you did, and it
must have been difficult.

711
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:06,464
And I just wanted to tell you that
I'm so glad that you have a life now

712
00:40:06,465 --> 00:40:09,214
that we can talk about.

713
00:40:09,215 --> 00:40:11,805
No secrets.

714
00:40:13,355 --> 00:40:15,144
You know, especially with the baby

715
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:17,295
and you being the only
family on my side, anyways.

716
00:40:17,296 --> 00:40:21,084
Ellie, I'm looking for Mom.

717
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,875
What?

718
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,184
Why?

719
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:30,454
Because I think...

720
00:40:30,455 --> 00:40:35,585
I think we should know the whole
truth about why she left us.

721
00:40:38,175 --> 00:40:41,264
What story can possibly
explain leaving your family?

722
00:40:41,265 --> 00:40:44,764
I don't know. I don't know.

723
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:48,404
But did you ever think that maybe
she had to go for some reason?

724
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:52,435
Like some reason that
was beyond her control?

725
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:02,415
I don't know. I don't know.

726
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:09,035
But what if there isn't
another side to the story?

727
00:41:10,995 --> 00:41:13,334
What if our mother is

728
00:41:13,335 --> 00:41:17,205
exactly who we think she is?

729
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:21,705
Well, then we'll find that out, too.

730
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:42,755
Are you awake?

731
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:47,885
Can you hear me, Chuck?

732
00:41:52,215 --> 00:41:55,694
I love you, Chuck.

733
00:41:55,695 --> 00:41:59,915
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

734
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:03,824
And if you ask me for real,

735
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:08,545
then my answer would be yes.
