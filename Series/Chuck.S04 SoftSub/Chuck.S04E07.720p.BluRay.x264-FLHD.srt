1
00:00:01,927 --> 00:00:04,307
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here's a few things
that you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:07,167
I'm the magnet for bad
guys? Are you kidding me?

3
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:09,837
I cannot believe that you would bring
me here and use me as a human target.

4
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:12,486
Everything about Bartowski's
mother's life is a fake.

5
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:14,667
I should've grabbed her before
she dropped off the map again.

6
00:00:14,668 --> 00:00:15,967
My mom, she left a message.

7
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:19,347
She wants to see Ellie tonight
before sheoes back undercover.

8
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:23,647
- Chuck!
- No! No! Let her go!

9
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:25,617
Stop! Stop! You have
no idea what's going on.

10
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:27,847
You mom isn't the spy you think she is.

11
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:30,376
Ellie, I'm sorry, but Mom is not coming.

12
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:32,177
Why does she keep doing this to us?

13
00:00:32,178 --> 00:00:34,647
Because she's a spy.

14
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:49,137
Colonel Casey, the Project Isis
file you discover was authentic.

15
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:54,427
Mary Bartowski, alias Frost, was a CIA
agent working undeover for Volkoff

16
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:58,507
until 20 years ago, when she turned
and we never heard from her again.

17
00:00:58,837 --> 00:01:02,597
Agent Walker, you made the right
decision by bringing in Frost.

18
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:05,947
- Agent Walker?
- Walker.

19
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:09,507
Oh, uh, yes, General, what's the next step?

20
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:13,387
We're moving Frost to a
black site facility tomorrow.

21
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:17,336
That means no one is to see
her, especially Bartowski.

22
00:01:17,337 --> 00:01:21,396
Agent Walker, I suspect I can
trust you to keep an eye on Chuck.

23
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:23,106
Of course, yes.

24
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:25,867
Good. How is he handling all this?

25
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:28,977
- Uh, he...
- He's fine, General.

26
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:32,497
Calm, actually. Very calm.

27
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:35,037
Calm?! How am I supposed totay calm?

28
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:36,847
Sarah, I had everything under control.

29
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:40,126
My mom was going to meet Ellie for
five minutes and then disappear forever.

30
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:42,177
I asked you trust me, and
you went behind my back.

31
00:01:42,178 --> 00:01:45,107
Why is it so har for
you to believe in me?

32
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:49,167
- How was that?
- You were certainly passionate.

33
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:51,107
- But I wouldn't use the "F" word.
- I didn't.

34
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:52,667
- No?
- No.

35
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:54,637
Maybe just seemed that way
because you were so intense.

36
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:57,456
And didn't Sarah have proof that
your mom was working for Volkoff?

37
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:59,897
- Whose side are you on, buddy?
- Chuck, do I have to pick a side?

38
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:01,616
- Yeah.
- Then you...

39
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:03,906
Well, no. I don't... I don't know.

40
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:06,367
Sarah and I have never really
had a fight before, so...

41
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:08,786
Not-Not a real one, not like this.

42
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,396
Trust me. I'm going
through it right now myself.

43
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:19,887
- You and Alex?
- No. Me and Casey, actually.

44
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:22,076
So, I'm just... You
know, I'm taking some time.

45
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:23,756
Cool off, clear the old mechanm.

46
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:26,447
- You should do the same thing with Sarah.
- You're probably right.

47
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:29,697
I mean, it's certainly not getting me
any closer to proving my mom's innocence.

48
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:31,707
My dad spent his whole
life searching for her,

49
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,717
and there's nothing in here th can
help us prove she's not a traitor.

50
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:38,187
You're telling me. Holy cow!
This technology is ancient.

51
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:41,117
But we can clean her up a little bit
and sell her on Ebay. What do you think?

52
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:45,006
What, are you joking? Nobody's going
to buy a Phalanx XR-12 computer.

53
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:48,587
I mean the thing only
takes triangle-shaped disks.

54
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:51,557
- And this is everything, huh?
- What do you mean?

55
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:53,357
Well, ur father left
all this stuff for you,

56
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:56,827
but is there a possibility he might
have left something for Ellie, too?

57
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,037
What do you mean, left something?

58
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:03,967
I don't know. Information?
Something about Mom maybe.

59
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:07,307
You know, Dad used to send me those
coded messages in the classifieds,

60
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:11,357
but I haven't found anything
since before he passed away.

61
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:13,386
What is this about, Chuck?

62
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:16,106
I guess it's just all
this stuff with Mom.

63
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:18,207
I was hoping that Dad might
have left us some answers.

64
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,427
I wish that we knew both of them better,

65
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:25,577
but since the only person who can give
us answers is locked away in a CIA base,

66
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:29,637
it's not like we can just
waltz in there and ask her.

67
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:33,157
Right. No. Yeah, can't.

68
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:40,327
Tom, Jerry. Good to see you guys again.

69
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,876
Keep up the good work. Just keep
doing what you're doing, you know?

70
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:44,477
Have fun with it. That's
what I try to do, anyway.

71
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:46,126
Hey, Ginger.

72
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,286
Wow, Casey, a lot of new
faces down here, huh?

73
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:51,237
Huh? We should have a mixer or something.
You know, a little get-to-know-u.

74
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:54,607
We can exchange fake
names and backgrounds.

75
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:57,617
Okay, great. Good times.

76
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:03,077
Chuck?

77
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:08,777
Sneaking into your own home...

78
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,926
Morgan. How long have you
been hiding behind that door?

79
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:17,896
An uncomfortably long
time, actually, but-but that's not the point.

80
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:21,146
The point is this. You and Chuck
are in a relationship crisis.

81
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:22,597
Crisis? Did he say something to you?

82
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,817
Yeah, actually. He-He
told me everything. And...

83
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:28,686
I think he just needs
some time to cool off.

84
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:31,316
But he always wants to
talk about... anything.

85
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:34,677
What do you want me to say here? I mean, you
did go behind his back, have his mother arrested.

86
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:36,107
I was just trying to protect him.

87
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:37,896
Yeah. Ellie said the same thing.

88
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:38,947
He told Ellie, too?

89
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:43,087
You know, contrary to popular bief, we think that there
is a heart of gold underneath this cold exterior.

90
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:44,487
Morgan, please don't touch my chest.

91
00:04:44,488 --> 00:04:46,287
Oh, gosh, yeah. No, I meant
that completely non-sexual.

92
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:49,426
You know what? This is ridiculous. Neither
of us should be sneaking around at all.

93
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:52,087
If I could just talk to
Chuck, everything woulde okay.

94
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:54,017
Where is he, anyway?

95
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:17,127
- You shouldn't be here.
- I need your help.

96
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,087
Why? CIA thin I'm a traitor.

97
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:34,434
Chuck 4x07 - Versus the First Fight

98
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:15,727
If I'm gonna help you, I need
the truth this time, okay?

99
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:19,567
Casey found a file that said that
Project Isis was abandoned 20 years ago,

100
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:23,417
you betrayed the CIA and
joined forces with Volkoff.

101
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:26,327
- Yes, that much is true.
- What?!

102
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:30,646
20 years ago, Volkoff had started to
suspect that I was working with the CIA.

103
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:34,306
He was one step away from
discoverying my real identity.

104
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:37,296
- That you're a Bartowski?
- That I was a mother.

105
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,116
So I did the only thing I could.

106
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:42,746
I admitted I was CIA, and I told
Volkoff I wanted to join him.

107
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:46,296
I broke all ties with the
agency, and I went to work for MI6.

108
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:49,026
Tell me who to call, and
I will fix all of this.

109
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:50,476
No, it's not that simple.

110
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:54,057
Volkoff has sources at the
CIA. That's why I had to leave.

111
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:57,896
A 20-year mission wille wast
if he gets wind of any of this.

112
00:06:57,897 --> 00:06:59,326
But you can trust me.

113
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,406
You're not gonna tell
your girlfrid this time?

114
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:05,957
That's not gonna be too hard, considering we're in a
fight right now and not really on speaking terms.

115
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:11,097
Do you want to...

116
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:14,797
- talk about it, or...?
- No, that's okay. Thank you.

117
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:18,407
You think that being boyfriend and
girlfriend, she could trust me from time to time.

118
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:20,946
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Yes, I can keep it a secret.

119
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:23,027
Good.

120
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:28,947
There is one person at MI6 who can confirm
that everything I'm telling you is true.

121
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:32,096
His name is Gregory
Tuttle. He's my handler.

122
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:35,707
We have a preset meeting for today
at 2:00 at the Old Duke Tavern.

123
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:39,867
Go there and give him this
code. Per fas et nefas.

124
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:43,056
- Per fas et nefas? Per fas et nefas.
- Nefas.

125
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:46,037
- Okay. - Okay? It's the only way
he'll know he can trust you.

126
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:50,197
And Chuck, he doesn't
know that you're my son.

127
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:53,397
Nobody does.

128
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:55,837
Okay, I got it.

129
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:01,667
I'm sorry. The code one more time?

130
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,177
Babe, what is all this?
What are you doing?

131
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:13,347
I know that this sounds crazy, but what if my
dad did leave me a message in the classied ads?

132
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:16,146
Hon, I thought you decided months
ago that there was nothing here.

133
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:18,197
I know, but I just found
out that my mom is a spy,

134
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,817
and Chuck said something today.

135
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:23,166
This can't be just a coincidence.

136
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:27,877
Look, every day since he's passed away, there
has been an ad for a convertible Mustang.

137
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:30,777
Ell, if there was a hidden code
here, you would have found it by now.

138
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:33,736
I don't know. There's-There's
something about it.

139
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:34,012
{a6}For sale Ford mustang 1968.

140
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,377
Could it be my dad's last msage
to me? Something important?

141
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:38,887
Buy more.

142
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:40,977
Nerd herd.

143
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:44,997
- Hey.
- Yes?

144
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:48,877
Because I-I value our relationship, John, I
need to be frank with you.

145
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:51,977
- We are in a fight.
- Ok.

146
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:54,236
Really? Okay? That's all
you have to say to me?

147
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:55,776
My shift ended two minutes ago.

148
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:57,166
You lied to me, okay?

149
00:08:57,167 --> 00:09:01,727
You never told me that the Project Isis file had proof that Mrs.
Bartowski was working for Volkoff.

150
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:04,406
Now, okay, you asked me to shadow
you to make me a better spy,

151
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:06,527
but how am I supposed to do
at if I'm always the magnet?

152
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:10,447
Or having to wait in a van? Or
being lied to by my partner and...

153
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:12,647
friend?

154
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:18,687
Hey. Hey, Morg, I'm so glad I found you.

155
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:21,526
Buddy, I need your help on
super top secret mission.

156
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,997
Do I get to parachute out
of a plane on a wild horse?

157
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,787
No, you do not, because nobody ever does.

158
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:29,427
But you do get to wear an earpiece.

159
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:32,367
Sold. Yeah.

160
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:42,027
Morgan, buddy, remember we're undercover.

161
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:43,977
A little subtlety goes a long way.

162
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:47,057
Copy that, Chuck.
Oh, Charles.

163
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:50,696
Okay, so, earpiece is in
place, and I believe is working.

164
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:53,066
- Yes? Hello? Hello. Check.
- Stop touching it.

165
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:56,047
By touching it, u're drawing attention
to the fact that you're wearing it, okay?

166
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:58,246
You are to be my eyes and ears on this.

167
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:00,297
I need you to sit at the bar unnoticed.

168
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,076
Tuttle can't know that anyone
came with me here. Ready?

169
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:05,027
Break.

170
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:13,957
Do me a favor.

171
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,807
Can you make out the board with the
specials from where you're sitting?

172
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:20,097
Okay, let me say it again. We're
undercover. We're not here to order food.

173
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:22,896
And these earpieces are not
for personal conversations.

174
00:10:22,897 --> 00:10:25,707
I got you. Just remind me to tell
you what Sarah thought of your fight.

175
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:28,656
Sarah? You talked to
Sarah? What did Sarah say?

176
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:30,787
Wh-Wh-Whoa, what are you so
nervous about? It's fine.

177
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:32,947
I did all the talking, okay?
Kept it simple and concise,

178
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:37,086
and basically explained to her that by not believing
in you, she betrayed your trust and yo family.

179
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:38,386
Your words, not mine.

180
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,637
Morgan. Morgan, why would you...?

181
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,027
That was supposed to stay between us.

182
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:46,247
Yeah, okay. One second, buddy. Holon. Ow.

183
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:50,357
Ow. Ow. Sorry. Hold on one second.
This thing's not working right.

184
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:52,607
It's like...

185
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,227
One second, Chuck.

186
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:10,337
Oh, my gosh.

187
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:22,657
Cheers.

188
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,607
Just one.
I just have to...

189
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:37,057
I hate to make a scene.

190
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:40,736
But I'll rip your throat
out with this plastic fork

191
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:44,247
if you don't tell me who you are
and why you're wearing an earpiece.

192
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:46,367
Well, that certainly
would a scene, wouldn't it?

193
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:49,356
Okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait. Ha, ha.

194
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:52,357
You're Tuttle. You're Tuttle, right? You're
Tuttle, and I have a code word for you.

195
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:56,027
It's Latin, and it's...

196
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:57,727
What is it?

197
00:11:57,728 --> 00:12:00,777
Just great. Now I need to dry this out.

198
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:18,137
I got it, I got it. Per fas et nefas.

199
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,177
Oh, thank God.

200
00:12:22,747 --> 00:12:24,136
Frost sent you.

201
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:27,707
I just want to apologize for
questioning you in such a harsh tone

202
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,957
and-and of course for threatening
to rip out your throat.

203
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,467
I wouldn't even know how do that.

204
00:12:35,577 --> 00:12:37,446
You seemed very convinng to me.

205
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:40,146
That's kind of you, but
I'm just a handler for MI6.

206
00:12:40,147 --> 00:12:44,687
I'm not a trained field agent, you
know, field ready, as they say.

207
00:12:45,997 --> 00:12:48,616
Okay, time's up, Matlock.
There's a limit, all right?

208
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:51,636
Let's go, dry it up. Polyester, so
it's really absorbent.

209
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,957
Good? Okay, thank you. Come again.

210
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,587
Wait. Why did Frost send you?

211
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,387
Where is she?

212
00:13:02,627 --> 00:13:04,697
My name is Charles Carmichael.

213
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:09,757
I'm her ally at the CIA. I
have her in custody right now.

214
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:12,787
If she's in custody, then
Volkoff will be looking for her.

215
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:14,407
We don't have much time.

216
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:17,807
You'll start with whoever
she was last seewith.

217
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:22,057
Please don't tell me it was you.

218
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:25,947
Bloody hell.

219
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:34,477
Morgan... help.

220
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:42,566
Testing, testing. Chuck, I'm back.

221
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,027
We're back in
business, buddy. Let's just...

222
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,247
No. No, no, no. What?

223
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:55,437
You got to be kidding me.

224
00:13:56,717 --> 00:13:58,997
I lost him.

225
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:08,163
Hello, Agent Carmichael.

226
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:10,732
May I call you Charles?

227
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,943
Sure, yeah, that's fine.
Are we on a plane?

228
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:16,323
Yes. Been kidnapped by
Volkoff's operatives.

229
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:20,573
Nasty buggers. They must
think we've got Frost.

230
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:33,812
What are you looking at?

231
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:35,993
Not that scar. Or that scar.

232
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:40,473
Neither one of those scars. Or
your, or your, or your mole, mole.

233
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:42,532
That is a beauty mark.

234
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:45,322
Which is what I meant
by-by "mole": beauty mark.

235
00:14:45,323 --> 00:14:48,653
Tomato, tomato. You're so
stunning, I can't even look away.

236
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:53,063
You're going to tell me
what you've done with Frost.

237
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:57,223
And you're going to do it now.

238
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:00,363
- He doesn't know anything.
- And you do?

239
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:03,863
I... I know that if you use those tweezers,

240
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:08,593
on those rather large hairs in
your nostls, it would work wonders.

241
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:13,173
I mean, when was the last time
a man expressed interest in you?

242
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:15,853
Hmm? Be honest.

243
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,303
What are you doing?

244
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:24,363
Torture 101, my friend. I've
read every manual on the subject.

245
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:27,662
Weaken the enemy
emotionally, then take the power.

246
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:29,713
Just what could she possibly do
with those tiny little tweezers?

247
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:32,253
No, no, no, no, no! Please, stop! Stop, stop!

248
00:15:32,283 --> 00:15:34,223
- I'll tell you everything you want.
- No, don't.

249
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,623
My home address is 17 Tally
Place. My dog's name is Kipper.

250
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:39,773
And I had my first sexual experience
watching Lawrence of Arabia.

251
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:45,033
I'm not proud of it. I.
I came from a broken home.

252
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:49,303
All I want to know is what
you've done with Frost.

253
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,553
You are going to regret that.

254
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:55,353
I think I already do.

255
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:57,473
Look, I-I don't know anything, all right?

256
00:15:57,474 --> 00:15:59,703
One second Chuck was there, and
then he was just gone.

257
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:02,003
All right? We just did what
Mrs. Bartowski told us to do.

258
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:05,313
I don't understand why he keeps
trusting her. She just hurts him.

259
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:08,063
Not anymore. She's gonna
tell us what we want to know.

260
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,003
Yeah. Well, just let me...

261
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:13,853
That's why we keep you
in the van. You stay here.

262
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:21,983
Maybe I should try one
last thing from the manuals.

263
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:24,033
Please don't.

264
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:31,163
The Swedish slip. It actually worked.

265
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:33,733
And I didn't have to break my thumbs.

266
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:37,153
What do we do now?

267
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:44,832
Oh, cool. A tiny weapon stand-off.

268
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,693
En garde.

269
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:02,973
Hello there.

270
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,673
A little help here? Anything?

271
00:17:30,293 --> 00:17:32,583
Here! Catch!

272
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:47,363
Enough. You're gonna tell
us where Chuck is now.

273
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:49,313
I want to see my daughter.

274
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,453
We're not having a discussion
about what you want.

275
00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:55,202
Chuck came here this morning because
he trusted you, and now he's gone.

276
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:57,602
If he's with my
handler, I know he's safe.

277
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:59,493
All right, then why hasn't he called in?

278
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:02,123
Perhaps he doesn't want to see you.

279
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:04,863
Chuck told me about the fight.

280
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:08,482
Okay, listen. I can't protect your
son if I don't know where he is.

281
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:10,492
I am trying to protect him, too.

282
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:13,312
Which is why I am not saying
a word to either of you.

283
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:16,633
The only one I know
I can trust is my son.

284
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,443
Mrs. Bartowski.

285
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:23,282
Morgan Grimes?

286
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:25,243
- You...
- Wait.

287
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:32,052
I haven't seen you since
you were nine years old.

288
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,943
You want to know something? I haven't
had a decent Rice Krispy Treat since.

289
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,363
What are you doing here?

290
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:44,063
Kind of a long story, but the thing is,

291
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:46,822
it's a little bit my
fault that Chuck's gone.

292
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:49,733
So, if you could tell me where he is,

293
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:51,453
I'll make sure that they
give you want you want, okay?

294
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:53,993
I promise you, you will
get to see Ellie, but...

295
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:56,343
you have to tell us.

296
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:02,173
You can trust me, Mrs. B.

297
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:10,363
If you take me to see Ellie, I
will tell you where Chuck is.

298
00:19:10,743 --> 00:19:13,203
We can't get in the cockpit.
You find any parachutes?

299
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:15,012
I found one.

300
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:17,412
Oh, Charles. Girlfriend's moving.

301
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:18,813
Hurry up. We got to
find another parachute.

302
00:19:18,814 --> 00:19:20,523
There's not another
one. I looked everywhere.

303
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:22,042
What-What are we going to do?

304
00:19:22,043 --> 00:19:25,603
I'm just taking the piss out of you.
Of course there's another parachute.

305
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,213
Whoever heard of a plane
carrying only one parachute?

306
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,433
There we go.

307
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:35,752
- You okay?
- Yeah.

308
00:19:35,753 --> 00:19:38,623
It's just, it's so... thrilling.

309
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:41,283
It reminds me of that
great episode of Alias.

310
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:43,853
I loved that show.

311
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:47,873
- You ready?
- Yeah, as ready as I'll ever be.

312
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,223
Let's do something fantastic.

313
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,710
- What...?
- Charles. You're up.

314
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,530
How did we... How did we get here?

315
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,350
Well, it was really exciting until you
knocked yourself unconscious when we landed.

316
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,929
Luckily, I was able to get us
into the back of this sheep truck.

317
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,850
Well done. Well done. Well done. Where are we, uh.
Where are we going?

318
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,980
Well, this lot is going to the lamb chop
factory, so don't say anything abt mint sauce.

319
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,520
It's all right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

320
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:48,189
We are going to the City of Angels
to get the ntel that will clear Frost.

321
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,010
That's great news.

322
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,350
Now, I hope you don't mind me asking, but
why are you so intent on helping Frost?

323
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,360
I mean, You're not...
giving her one, are you?

324
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,860
Giving her one what?
Oh, giving-giving her one? No, no, no!

325
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,720
I would... I would ver give
her one. Simply just, no. no.

326
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,840
We have a very professional
relationship. You know?

327
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,700
- Plus, I have a girlfriend, anyway.
- Good for you.

328
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,620
Yeah, yeah. Good, yeah.
Good, normally. Usually, it's good.

329
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,330
It must be really hard being a field
agent and having a relationship.

330
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,610
Especially when she's a spy, too.

331
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,529
Well, that would bring I a
whole host of complications.

332
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,170
Tell me about it. You know? I an, we're
right in the middle of our first fight.

333
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:29,540
Oh, I don't mean to... Please.

334
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,099
No, I'd like to talk about it. You
see, it all began a few years ago...

335
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,790
{a6}Los Angeles 123.

336
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,500
She knows you're coming.

337
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,550
No.

338
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,780
Come in.

339
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,510
Eleanor.

340
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,460
I'm sorry, Ellie. I have to stay.

341
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,330
That's okay. I understand.

342
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,550
Lemonade?

343
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,530
That would be lovely. Thank you.

344
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,500
I'm sorry you have to see me like this.

345
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,049
Things are complicated right now,

346
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:54,990
but I wanted to see you, just you and me.

347
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,620
I don't know what I'm
ing with these coasters.

348
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:02,030
I don't... I don't even
use coasters. I don't...

349
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,410
It's okay.

350
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,650
You're all grown up.

351
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,590
I mean, I know that's obvious, but...

352
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,010
when I think of you, I still
see a gangly little girl,

353
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,040
too tall for her age,

354
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,440
unsure how she fits into her own skin.

355
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:42,050
Your dad and I used to take you for
drives in his burgundy '68 Mustang.

356
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,500
You would sit between us
with your legs curled up.

357
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,710
Do you remember?

358
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,560
I can't believe I forgot.

359
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,100
I remember, uh...

360
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,600
I remember those blue leather seats.

361
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,040
Your dad special ordered
those blue leather seats.

362
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,780
Watching you sleep in-between
us on those long drives

363
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,870
was one of my favorite things.

364
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,620
I just want to know what happened.

365
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,950
I want to know the truth.

366
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,370
I guess it all begins with a scientist.

367
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,180
His code name was Orion.

368
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,870
But his real name was Stephen Bartowski.

369
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:22,480
I wish that telling you that I did this
all for you and Chuck made a difference.

370
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,520
But I know it doesn't. And...

371
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,620
Sorry. We have to go.

372
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,350
Okay.

373
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,700
Thank you.

374
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,140
You kept your end of the
bargain. I'll keep mine.

375
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,929
I know you don't think I
care for my family, but I do.

376
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,239
If your MI6 handler actually
exists, tell him to bring Chuck here.

377
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,489
There's a relay station
that I call in to.

378
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,910
If my handler has posted his
location, I can take you there.

379
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,990
Once he sees me, he'll
know he can trust you.

380
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,920
Make the call. Let's go.

381
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,920
All the intel we need to
prove Frost's an MI6 agent

382
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,960
is on the series of disks
in that safety deposit box.

383
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,250
Sir?

384
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,590
There it is.

385
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:20,040
Babe, are you okay? I got
home as soon as I could.

386
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,380
How'd everything go with your mom?

387
00:27:21,381 --> 00:27:23,200
She said something when we were talking.

388
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,490
She told me a-a story about an
old car that my dad used to have.

389
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:31,450
A 1968 convertible Mustang.

390
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,235
With blue leather seats.

391
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,200
This isn't a code, Devon.
This is a real car.

392
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,170
My dad must ***** Let's go get it.

393
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,150
Quickly.

394
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,450
- Chuck!
- Sarah?

395
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,660
What are you two doing here? I
thought Beckman gave you orders...

396
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:52,670
I thought you were in trouble.

397
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,470
Agent Frost. I'm so glad you're okay.

398
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,459
Tuttle. You have the disks?

399
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,880
Oh, yeah. We're halfway there.

400
00:27:58,881 --> 00:28:00,969
These will prove that
I am not a traitor?

401
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,830
Yes, but there's a little problem.

402
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,219
These disks can only be
played on a special computer.

403
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,210
MI6 has got one in London.

404
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,520
Wait a minute. No, no, no, no.

405
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,329
These disks are for a
Phalanx XR-12 computer.

406
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,190
We don't have to go to London.
I know of one here, in L. A.

407
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,529
Well, then, what are we
waiting for? Let's go!

408
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,860
Frost isn't going anywhere.

409
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:23,579
Beckman's orders were clear.
I'm king her back to Castle.

410
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,220
No, no. Sarah, you can't. We're so close.

411
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:32,679
Everybody, on the ground! Now!

412
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:37,600
You got to be kidding
me. A bank robbery?

413
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:39,600
No, they're not bank robbers, Charles.

414
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,060
These are Volkoff's men.

415
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:06,694
Please. Nobody here wants to be a hero.

416
00:29:07,774 --> 00:29:10,204
Just take the money.
Take whatever you want.

417
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:11,694
Just don't take our lives.

418
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:15,454
Keep your pants on. You're not my type.

419
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:17,723
And you're not who I
am looking for, anyway.

420
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:19,814
I don't understand. How
did Volkoff's men find us?

421
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,963
Well, somebody must have let them here.

422
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:23,553
Don't just accuse her.

423
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:26,654
No, he's right. They must
have followed Charles and me.

424
00:29:26,744 --> 00:29:28,454
Just let him explain, really.

425
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:31,183
It'll make this fight you're
having seem like a little nothing.

426
00:29:31,184 --> 00:29:33,273
Just like a blip on the radar.

427
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:36,314
Is there anybody you
haven't told about our fight?

428
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:38,364
Well...

429
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:41,564
man, they've got them surrounded in
there. Casey, what are we going to do?

430
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:45,413
Well, if we go in through the bank's
roof, we can surprise Volkoff's men.

431
00:29:45,414 --> 00:29:47,734
Sweet. Give 'em hell, sir.

432
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:50,014
You coming?

433
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:52,924
I - I figured you wantede to
stay in the van. You know?

434
00:29:54,684 --> 00:29:58,424
How you ever going learn anything
if you stay in here, hmm? Let's go.

435
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:01,224
Yes, sir. I forgive you, too, Casey.

436
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:04,144
I can't believe you've talked to
everybody about our fight except for me.

437
00:30:04,214 --> 00:30:06,044
Let's go. Come on.

438
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:14,023
Listen, I was just waiting until
I calmed down a little bit.

439
00:30:14,024 --> 00:30:16,453
Okay? It's our first
real fight as a couple,

440
00:30:16,454 --> 00:30:18,924
and everyone knows that that sets
the tone for all future fights.

441
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:23,194
You're going to set the precedent by telling everybody
what you're thinking and feeling before me?

442
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:26,264
See, that just makes it sound bad.

443
00:30:34,574 --> 00:30:37,344
Well, you might as well have just
posted about our fight on Friendster.

444
00:30:37,464 --> 00:30:39,844
Friendster? Honey, people stopped
using Friendster five years ago.

445
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:41,474
Okay, fine. You know
what I'm talking about.

446
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:44,194
You know, you only just met him
and he knows everything about us.

447
00:30:44,394 --> 00:30:46,404
How do you know that you can trust him?

448
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:48,864
That's right. I totally forgot.

449
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:51,224
You can't believe in anyone
unless Beckman tells you to.

450
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:53,103
That's not fair.

451
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:55,474
That's not fair? You wait a sec.

452
00:30:57,934 --> 00:30:59,924
No. You know what's no
fair, is what you did.

453
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:01,824
You could have at least told
me before you arrested her.

454
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:04,463
Oh, what? And watch you
commit trson and go to prison?

455
00:31:04,464 --> 00:31:08,313
Kids, kids. You need to stop this
now. We need to do something.

456
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:09,863
You're not doing anything.

457
00:31:09,864 --> 00:31:11,224
I'll stay here, too, understand?

458
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:13,294
- Yeah, he's just a handler.
- Okay.

459
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,984
Okay, in ten seconds, we're
going to go over the counter.

460
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:19,514
There are two guys. I'm gonna take the
big guy. You're gonna take the small guy.

461
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,984
I'm perfectly capable of
handling a big guy, too, you know.

462
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:23,174
- Fine.
- Fine.

463
00:31:23,374 --> 00:31:25,194
- Fine.
- Fine.

464
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:32,884
Ready.

465
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:52,564
This is exhausting.

466
00:31:52,565 --> 00:31:55,174
Yeah, tell me about it. How do you
always fight the big guys all the time?

467
00:31:58,244 --> 00:32:00,494
No, I mean fighting
with you is exhausting.

468
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,624
- I hate it.
- Me, too.

469
00:32:04,974 --> 00:32:07,204
I've been thinking about you all day.

470
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:12,414
Just trying protect
you from getting hurt.

471
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:15,074
Behind you.

472
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,714
I don't need you to protect me.

473
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:20,014
I need you to believe in me.

474
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:23,894
I do believe in you.

475
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,864
I mean really believe in me.

476
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:33,164
Even when you think I'm wrong.

477
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,974
Two field agents in action!

478
00:32:38,864 --> 00:32:40,634
What a show!

479
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:43,524
No!

480
00:32:45,154 --> 00:32:46,884
Tuttle!

481
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:52,664
Oh, my God.

482
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:03,264
I'm so sorry, Charles.

483
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:07,454
It's up to you now.

484
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:10,034
No. No, no. No, no, no, Tuttle, we're
not leaving you here.

485
00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:12,184
Casey, we've got a man
down; where are you?

486
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:14,154
I'll be okay.

487
00:33:14,314 --> 00:33:19,314
Get those disks... to the
computer and finish it, Charles.

488
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:21,854
For Frost.

489
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:26,174
Okay, listen, Casey is on his way.
You're gonna be in safe hands, okay?

490
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:27,744
But we need to go right now.

491
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:29,564
Wait, what-what are you
saying? What about your orders?

492
00:33:29,565 --> 00:33:31,404
I'm not gonna fight you
on this anymore, Chuck.

493
00:33:31,405 --> 00:33:33,544
If you trust her, then...

494
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:37,244
that's gonna be enough for me.

495
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,174
You're gonna be just fine.

496
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:46,364
Let's go to Orion's space.

497
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:58,344
I guess I always assumed
your father sold the house.

498
00:33:59,614 --> 00:34:01,923
How long has this been under here?

499
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:06,164
I - I really don't know.
I only found out about it after he...

500
00:34:07,664 --> 00:34:09,484
It's his life's work, Mom.

501
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:11,594
The computer's right here.

502
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:17,444
You're welcome.

503
00:34:17,524 --> 00:34:21,474
Just another day in the
life of a public defender.

504
00:34:22,384 --> 00:34:23,883
Nobody move! Freeze!

505
00:34:23,884 --> 00:34:25,733
No, no! Please, I have children.

506
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,953
Here, take... the keys to the vault.

507
00:34:27,954 --> 00:34:29,984
My car key's on there, too.
I drive a very nice Cam.

508
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,424
Shut up. I'm a federal officer.

509
00:34:33,904 --> 00:34:35,654
And I'm with him.

510
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:38,494
You should look into the roof. I
saw an eye-opening piece on asbestos.

511
00:34:38,584 --> 00:34:40,594
Dangerous, dgerous stuff, and you
got it everywhere around here.

512
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:42,623
Grimes, Grimes, muzzle it.

513
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:44,394
Right. Shutting up.

514
00:34:58,074 --> 00:34:59,814
Phalanx XR-12 Secure
System Reading Disk... 45%.

515
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,224
Looking for an injured agent.

516
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:15,904
- Where did he go?
- He's right over...

517
00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:19,344
there.

518
00:35:25,894 --> 00:35:27,614
Eurybia.

519
00:35:32,914 --> 00:35:34,064
Disk empty 0
Files found.

520
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,803
This doesn't... make any sense.

521
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:38,324
This has got to be some
kind of misunderstanding.

522
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:41,274
The MI6 files are
supposed to be on here.

523
00:35:50,574 --> 00:35:52,874
This... Mom!

524
00:35:55,334 --> 00:35:57,294
Stay here.

525
00:36:11,874 --> 00:36:13,804
Sar... Sarah?

526
00:36:14,154 --> 00:36:15,894
Where'd you go?

527
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:18,104
Chuck.

528
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:22,084
Your father never
wanted you to see this.

529
00:36:22,524 --> 00:36:24,334
See what?

530
00:36:25,714 --> 00:36:27,974
What I know now of you is wrong.

531
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:50,264
Chuck? Get down.

532
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:52,404
What did you...?

533
00:36:59,194 --> 00:37:01,094
Tuttle.

534
00:37:01,414 --> 00:37:03,894
How are you here right...?
You were-you-you were...

535
00:37:03,964 --> 00:37:06,064
You were shot. What are you doing here?

536
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:08,504
There is no Tuttle, Charles.

537
00:37:09,114 --> 00:37:12,264
My name is Alexei Volkoff.

538
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:16,324
I believe you were looking for me.

539
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:26,308
What are you...?

540
00:37:27,588 --> 00:37:29,548
Why are you doing this?

541
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:33,308
It's really pathetic.

542
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:39,328
Orion spent his whole life searching
for a woman who didn't want to be found.

543
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:45,198
The wife he wanted so much to believe
in was exactly what she appeared to be...

544
00:37:45,258 --> 00:37:47,308
a traitor.

545
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:53,738
- You told him about...
- About my husband, of course.

546
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:56,618
And that he meant nothing to her.

547
00:37:57,378 --> 00:38:00,368
You know, Charles...

548
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:05,407
it really is shocking how Orion was able
to convince you to follow in his footsteps.

549
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,418
What was he to you?

550
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:10,068
Your mentor?

551
00:38:18,198 --> 00:38:19,907
He was a good man.

552
00:38:19,908 --> 00:38:21,727
He was a fool.

553
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:23,868
Just like you, Charles.

554
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:29,038
If you'd just let it alone, none of
this ruse would have been necessary.

555
00:38:29,428 --> 00:38:31,728
But you couldn't let it go.

556
00:38:32,368 --> 00:38:33,877
I had my reasons.

557
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,798
I'm sure you did.

558
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:38,678
Frost here is a master of deception.

559
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:42,147
But she wasn't able to fool
your girlfriend, was she?

560
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:43,958
And you...

561
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:49,227
when you locked up Frost, it became clear I
had to step in to find Orion's little base here

562
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:52,698
and destroy all his intelligence.

563
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:58,358
Along with all the people
who know about it, of course.

564
00:39:04,778 --> 00:39:06,968
Thank you for leading us here, Charles.

565
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:11,838
I couldn't have done it without you.

566
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:18,618
I believed in you.

567
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:21,018
Don't take it personally.

568
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:24,948
There's no point in going to
the grave with regrets, is there?

569
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,288
Frost...

570
00:39:28,388 --> 00:39:30,408
Ready.

571
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:39,618
Protect him.

572
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:45,098
Shall we finish this?

573
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:49,707
Apologies.

574
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:52,758
It really was a easure
getting to know you.

575
00:39:56,358 --> 00:39:58,968
You were right about her the whole time.

576
00:40:01,128 --> 00:40:02,798
I couldn't see it. I didn't...

577
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:04,978
I didn't want to see it.

578
00:40:06,768 --> 00:40:08,818
Flash! Come on!

579
00:40:08,898 --> 00:40:10,678
Flash!

580
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:14,708
Sarah, my mom did something
to me with that device.

581
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:17,068
Chuck, your mom gave us a way out.

582
00:40:17,568 --> 00:40:18,988
She might be working for Volkoff,

583
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:22,807
but she certainly has a reason for
not wanting us to die right now.

584
00:40:22,808 --> 00:40:25,707
- Come on. Hurry, let's go.
- Wait, what about my father's work?

585
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:27,918
No, we don't have time. Let's go.

586
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:53,178
Chuck... Chuck, are you okay?

587
00:40:55,468 --> 00:41:00,578
Sarah, *****.

588
00:41:00,678 --> 00:41:04,488
And now, All of my father's research...

589
00:41:04,568 --> 00:41:07,018
everything he ever created...

590
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:10,288
it's all gone.

591
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:16,038
He said it would be
outside waiting for us.

592
00:41:16,278 --> 00:41:18,148
It really is my dad's car.

593
00:41:18,598 --> 00:41:21,147
I can't lieve it's been
here this whole time.

594
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,998
Babe, it's beautiful.

595
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:24,068
{a6}Eleanor.

596
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:33,678
"Eleanor, if you're reading this,

597
00:41:33,898 --> 00:41:35,848
"then it means I'm not with you anymore.

598
00:41:35,948 --> 00:41:38,368
"And I know you'll be okay.

599
00:41:38,968 --> 00:41:41,728
"I only wish I could have
been the father you deserved,

600
00:41:42,048 --> 00:41:44,938
"but our family had a lot of secrets...

601
00:41:45,038 --> 00:41:48,538
"secrets I kept from you
because you were so young,

602
00:41:48,858 --> 00:41:51,158
"because I didn't want to hurt you.

603
00:41:51,788 --> 00:41:53,948
"I know you're a grown woman now,

604
00:41:54,698 --> 00:41:59,478
"but no matter what, you'll
always be my little girl

605
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:02,948
curled up on the middle
seat of this car."

606
00:42:04,808 --> 00:42:07,478
"This is my final gift to you, Eleanor,

607
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:10,958
"and I'm giving it to
you now for a reason.

608
00:42:11,298 --> 00:42:13,558
"I trust that you'll know what to do.

609
00:42:14,228 --> 00:42:17,348
I love you, always.
Dad."
