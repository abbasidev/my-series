1
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:04,639
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are things
you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:07,214
- Hello, Diane.
- Hello, Roan.

3
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:10,045
- What's the deal with this Roan guy?
- He's a legend.

4
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:13,116
An incredible spy.
Real old-school James Bond type.

5
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,120
Congratulations.

6
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:17,256
Awesome.

7
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:19,451
Hello, angel.

8
00:00:52,826 --> 00:00:56,057
I really wish you'd pick up.
I need to hear your voice tonight.

9
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,826
I'm sorry again that I couldn't make it.
But I'm thinking of you.

10
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,731
Sweet dreams and besos, my flower.

11
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,666
I'm jealous.

12
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:10,435
- Would you like a drink?
- Ha. I'd like to be that drink.

13
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:14,743
Men take one look at you
and tell you all their secrets.

14
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:16,109
Impress me.

15
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:20,385
Here's one. Look.

16
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:22,283
The new $100 bill.

17
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:26,290
Impossible to counterfeit,
but someone did. Perfectly.

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,827
It's called the super note
and I'm in town to find out who made it.

19
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,258
So you're a spy.

20
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:32,958
That's very exciting.

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,794
Roan Montgomery.

22
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:37,263
- Hello, Roan.
- What...?

23
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:40,702
- Naughty, naughty, Roan.
- Ha-ha-ha.

24
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,270
Aw.

25
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:50,877
What a way to go.

26
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:53,083
Poor Roan.

27
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:58,015
- Ellie, I think she has your mouth.
- Those cheeks. I wanna pinch them.

28
00:01:58,191 --> 00:02:00,455
She looks just like you.

29
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:02,353
I'm out of here.

30
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:04,656
Okay, here's the SITREP.

31
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:08,164
It has been 23 minutes
since Clara had a number one...

32
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:10,394
51 minutes since number two...

33
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,403
and 76 minutes
since her last feeding.

34
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:15,507
- Maybe she's hungry.
- Or needs a change.

35
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:19,476
- Could you get the diapers and wipes?
- Chuck, feeding pillow, stat.

36
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:20,738
Okay.

37
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:25,078
- Can you take her while I get settled?
- Yeah. Come to Grandma.

38
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:27,313
That's my girl.

39
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,580
Aw, Grandma's got the magic touch.

40
00:02:29,756 --> 00:02:33,021
Oh, smooth and silent.

41
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:37,152
Same technique I always used
for moving live explosives.

44
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,929
Babies are stressful.

45
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:47,130
Tell me about it.

46
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:50,367
You know, speaking of which,
Alex, you know...

47
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:54,206
there's something I wanna tell you.
Talk to you about.

48
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:57,908
Hold on, wow. It's all good, we're great.
Alex isn't pregnant.

49
00:02:58,085 --> 00:03:00,417
No, no. She just...
She wants me to meet her mom.

50
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:03,082
- Oh, Kathleen.
- Yeah, Kathleen.

51
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:07,090
The thing is I feel uncomfortable
starting off this relationship with her...

52
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,095
with this secret about
my friend-slash-not-dead-ex-fiancée.

53
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:15,063
Could you touch base with her
and tell her you're alive?

54
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:16,600
Not a good idea. Uh-uh.

55
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:19,569
You know, Alex is having a tough time
with this.

56
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,231
She's been lying to her mom
this whole time...

57
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:25,310
and she couldn't even talk to her
when you were in a coma.

58
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,413
You see, so...

59
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,585
- I'll think about it.
- Yes, thank you. Great. You're the man.

60
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:37,212
Could you do it quick? I just...
I have this dinner plan on Friday.

61
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,882
Chuck, Sarah, what are you thinking
for the big day?

62
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,961
Be great if Clara could walk down
the aisle as flower girl.

63
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,792
You know, Woodcombs usually walk
at six or seven months.

64
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:47,263
Don't have to wait long.

65
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:50,631
- What are your colors gonna be?
- Oh, I'm better gray than blue.

66
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:53,068
I still have my veil
if you wanna borrow it.

67
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,071
Don't know that Sarah is a veil girl.

68
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:58,302
My cousin is the raddest vegan caterer.
You gotta use him.

69
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,605
The wedding cake he made Jim
was beige.

70
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:04,478
Something old, something new,
something borrowed, something beige.

71
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:08,280
- Wrong. It's not beige. Something blue.
- Wow, family, intense.

72
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:09,615
I'm actually sweating.

73
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,985
Last time I sweat,
there was gunfire involved.

74
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,319
- Blue.
- Don't use red.

75
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:16,521
What does that mean?

76
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:19,824
- I hear you. We need a bad guy.
- So badly.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,160
More pearl than beige.

78
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,859
Guys, we need a mission.

79
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:33,457
Chuck 4x14 - Versus the Seduction Impossible

80
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:14,486
Sorry to disturb you, general.

81
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,653
No, ahem, not at all.

82
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:19,732
We were just wondering
if there was anything that you...

83
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:22,301
or our country needed from us.

84
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,439
Preferably far outside of America.

85
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:29,832
Actually, I do have a mission,
but it would be off the books.

86
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:33,003
You would have no support
and it's extremely dangerous.

87
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:35,706
- We're in.
- Then your mission is...

88
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:40,583
to rescue and return one of our own,
Agent Roan Montgomery.

89
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:43,991
Roan Montgomery,
the seduction master himself?

90
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,923
I love that guy. What happened?
Was he captured?

91
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:49,962
He was last seen in a café
in Marrakesh.

92
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:53,692
Uh, general, given Agent Montgomery's
proclivities...

93
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:57,599
is it possible that he, perhaps,
took an elective trip off...?

94
00:05:57,772 --> 00:05:59,672
No. That is not what happened.

95
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:03,641
We believe he was investigating
local crime czarina Fatima Tazi.

96
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:08,306
She is best known for her private
merc army of female soldiers.

97
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,974
Agent Montgomery, luckily,
has a tracker on him.

98
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:14,019
It shows that he is in Fatima's fortress
in Marrakesh.

99
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,818
Locate him and bring him safely back
to the United States.

100
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,786
Thank you.

101
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:25,994
What is going on with the general?
She's a hot mess.

102
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:29,193
Well, General Beckman
and Roan Montgomery have a history.

103
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,635
Their romance has been going on
for decades.

104
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:34,741
Events happen when those two
are together.

105
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:38,174
Berlin, '89. Iraq, '91.

106
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:39,677
Florida, 2000.

107
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,748
Which is why we better go get him.

108
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:50,219
Roan Montgomery.

109
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:55,294
Did you ever think your storied life
as a spy would come to an end...

110
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:58,364
because you picked up a girl
in a bar?

111
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:02,060
Well, actually, yes.
That's precisely how I thought I'd go.

112
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:05,263
- But that's not what happened.
- Oh?

113
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,307
Hmm. No, I'm exactly
where I wanted to be.

114
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:12,879
In front of the woman who's created the
world's only flawless counterfeit bills.

115
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:17,042
And meeting me was worth dying for?

116
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:18,549
You're not going to kill me.

117
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,779
You're going to make me
your head of distribution.

118
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:23,253
- Ha.
- No, no, no. I'm not joking.

119
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:26,291
My international contacts
can help you launder your money...

120
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:30,397
so that people like me
don't keep showing up at your door.

121
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:39,097
And why would I do business
with a CIA pig?

122
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:46,345
Mm. Because rolling around in the mud
can be so much fun.

123
00:07:56,724 --> 00:07:58,316
What?

124
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:00,660
You always overpack.

125
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,853
How am I to know
what kind of mission we're on?

126
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:05,022
It could be a shooting,
a dancing mission.

127
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:08,293
It could be a shoot-dance,
which I know isn't really a thing.

128
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:10,835
But knowing our track record,
is a possibility.

129
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:13,530
Let's just save that for the honeymoon,
shall we?

130
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:16,801
So your family...

131
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,175
Sorry, sorry. They're a little intense
about the wedding, huh?

132
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:23,249
They're very sweet but...

133
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:27,686
- But?
- I have a proposition for you.

134
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:29,413
Okay.

135
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,183
What if we eloped?

136
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:34,086
I know you want
the big family wedding...

137
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:37,527
but your family is going to be this intense
until we get married.

138
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:41,157
So, what if we, just the two of us,
were to run away...

139
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:45,466
to some beautiful, romantic,
amazing place...

140
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,475
and all of this stress and pressure
could be avoided?

141
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,871
Think about it.

142
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:04,018
Is she trying to kill me?

143
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:06,717
I know. Elope?

144
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:09,362
- I can't elope.
- Of course you can't.

145
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,259
Who's gonna be the best man?

146
00:09:11,432 --> 00:09:16,392
I'll tell you. Some weird cousin of some
weird old stranger you find to marry you.

147
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:19,972
And then his weird old wife who smells
is gonna stand up for Sarah...

148
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:24,305
then you're stuck with a bunch of
weird strangers in your wedding photos.

149
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,845
I just got my family back together,
you know?

150
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:30,507
I have a niece now.
I want them to be in my wedding.

151
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:33,711
You know,
marriage is about compromise...

152
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:37,380
and this is what Sarah wants.
- But you giving Sarah what she wants...

153
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:41,392
and me not getting what I want
is not necessarily "compromise."

154
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:43,723
Point is...
Sorry to say this to you, buddy.

155
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:46,423
You've never been able to do this
with a lady.

156
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:49,195
- But you're gonna have to put
your foot down.

157
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,860
Just say no.

158
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:54,333
No, huh? To Sarah?

159
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:58,036
This is what I think you should do.
You start by saying no to something...

160
00:09:58,212 --> 00:10:02,546
far less important, and then,
you know, slowly work your way up.

161
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:05,049
- A practice "no."
- A practice "no."

162
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:06,447
Interesting.

163
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:18,963
Okay, we'll cut through
and enter here.

164
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:24,462
Chuck, do you want some water?

165
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:28,774
Uh, you know what? No.

166
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,937
Okay.

167
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,309
Actually, yes. I'm kind of thirsty.

168
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:36,080
Okay.

169
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,979
Let's go.

170
00:10:39,387 --> 00:10:40,911
Do you want the pliers?

171
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:45,284
Yeah.

172
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,007
Huh. Some fortress.

173
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,769
Yeah, well, looks like we need
a costume change.

174
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:08,439
Making me once again right to,
as you say, overpack.

175
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:11,849
I will not at any point
during this mission...

176
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:14,715
be dressing as a belly dancer.

177
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:17,891
- What if you do it for our country?
- America can handle it.

178
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,825
By the way, if you're into the Moroccan
thing, we can always elope here.

179
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:25,295
- Just think about it.
- Come on, let's go. In here.

180
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:40,077
Casey, I can't apologize enough
for that accidental touching in there.

181
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:42,773
- It's a very tight changing space.
- Don't mention it.

182
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:47,813
- Looks like Roan is upstairs.
- Let's go.

183
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:49,957
Right.

184
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,685
Whoa, whoa.

185
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:03,662
- Bad Saudi oil tycoon at 12 o'clock.
- What do you think they're doing here?

186
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:06,739
That's not our mission.
We'll find Montgomery. Come on.

187
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:21,282
Well, according to the tracker,
Roan is in that room over there.

188
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:25,357
- After you, Casey.
- Okay. This could get fun.

189
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:48,715
Finally, my little minx.

190
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:50,214
Did you bring the oils?

191
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:54,020
Come here.

192
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:03,597
Shall we celebrate the little soiree
I made for you downstairs?

193
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:07,626
Wait, wait, wait.
I hear the footsteps of, hmm, two women.

194
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:09,527
And a large man.

195
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:12,502
Darling, you know I like it spicy
but I do think...

196
00:13:12,673 --> 00:13:14,265
- You mean two large men?
- What?

197
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:18,105
- You three? What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you. You're welcome.

198
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,578
I don't need rescuing.
Unlike you, Colonel Shoot-'Em-Up...

199
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:24,217
I can finesse my way
out of any situation.

200
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:26,876
- What situation would this be exactly?
- Look...

201
00:13:27,054 --> 00:13:30,080
I don't have time to go into it,
but I'm about to blow...

202
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,249
Fatima's counterfeiting ring
wide open.

203
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:33,893
Wait, you're on a mission?

204
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,585
Yes.

205
00:13:35,763 --> 00:13:38,755
She's making super notes. Wait a minute.

206
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,901
How did you find...? Who sent you?

207
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,065
- General Beckman.
- Gen...

208
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,339
Diane's birthday present. The watch.
It's got a tracking device in it?

209
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,978
You've gotta leave.
She's gonna be here any second.

210
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:55,172
We're going to, um, seal our partnership.

211
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:58,446
Look. She's coming. She's coming.
You gotta hide.

212
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:03,282
- Just hide. Hide.
- Go, go. Right here, go.

213
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:13,500
How is my naughty little turncoat?

214
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:16,193
Ready to be your naughty
little turn-on.

215
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,498
You are very feisty, eh?

216
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,867
Feed me or beat me, I don't care.
Just get in here.

217
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:29,712
- Hey.
- Hi. Oh!

218
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:33,848
So everything's set up for Friday.
You're gonna meet my mom.

219
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,725
- Are you excited?
- What? I am so excited. You kidding me?

220
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:41,384
It's just that
I have a surprise for you as well.

221
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:42,620
- Really?
- Yeah.

222
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:47,200
I talked to your father and he agreed
to get in touch with your mom.

223
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:51,031
Let her know that he's okay,
alive and well and back in the picture.

224
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:52,900
Isn't that great? Come on.

225
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:57,869
Morgan, no.
No, that is not great at all.

226
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:01,514
My God,
I have been keeping my dad a secret...

227
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:04,082
from my mom on purpose, okay?
To protect her.

228
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:08,187
Because for the first time in her life,
she is finally happy.

229
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:12,292
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Bad initiative.
I thought it would have made you happy.

230
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,224
Okay. I'm sorry. I'll fix this, okay?
I promise.

231
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,895
You look a lot like your father now.

232
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:20,056
Stick a cigar and a knife
and you would...

233
00:15:21,435 --> 00:15:23,801
You've been a very naughty,
naughty little spy.

234
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:28,533
- Oh, you better teach me a lesson.
- Yes, I will.

235
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,703
Chuck, if you get us caught
because you sneeze...

236
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:36,247
we are officially the worst spies
in the world.

237
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:40,478
I know. Bad Three Stooges.
I get it. And I won't.

238
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:42,212
But, man, it is dusty.

239
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:44,421
We have to get out.

240
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,456
Let's just take Fatima out, grab Roan,
and bail out the window.

241
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:50,722
Okay, copy that. You good, Chuck?

242
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:52,229
Um...

243
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,232
no.

244
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:57,368
- No?
- Yeah, no. I said, no...

245
00:15:57,538 --> 00:16:00,336
because I think Roan is making
some good headway here.

246
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:03,477
And we should let him finish.
The mission. Finish the mission.

247
00:16:04,378 --> 00:16:07,108
- But...
- But nothing, okay? I said, no.

248
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:08,942
Woman.

249
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,647
Sometimes in a relationship,
people disagree about things and...

250
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:15,679
Ah...

251
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,887
Ah...

252
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:21,623
See? See?
Not the worst spies in the world.

253
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,631
Guards.

254
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:30,634
- Betrayer.
- No.

255
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:32,636
- Not betrayer, lover.
- Shut up.

256
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:36,004
These are clearly your comrades.
Take them all to the dungeon.

257
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:41,174
Baby.

258
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:45,082
This is all a misunderstanding.
It's me, Roan.

259
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:48,619
Sit tight. I'll get you out.

260
00:16:55,362 --> 00:17:00,891
So last I saw you two,
you were a young, exciting couple...

261
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:03,195
chasing, flirting.

262
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,770
Now the silent treatment.

263
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,998
Sexy.

264
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:10,837
If you must know,
we are very much in love, happy...

265
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:12,342
and soon to be married.

266
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:15,710
We're just having a bit of a disagreement
right now.

267
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:20,411
- And the ball and chain isn't helping.
- Are you calling me a ball and chain?

268
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:23,523
There is a ball and chain...
There's an actual ball and chain.

269
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:26,284
Do you not see this on the ground,
attached to my leg?

270
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,520
- Ball and chain.
- Yes, thank you.

271
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:31,892
What's with the all the nos lately?

272
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:37,095
I may have been
a little obstinate before.

273
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:40,434
Okay, let me guess,
this is about something bigger.

274
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:41,870
Performance issues.

275
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:46,206
No. I am adequate.
More than adequate in that depart...

276
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,541
Right? You can't...?
You can't agree with...?

277
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:50,411
I don't wanna elope.

278
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:53,712
Okay? I just don't. Not at all.
Not even in the slightest bit.

279
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:56,516
I've always wanted
a big family wedding.

280
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,626
And now, more than ever.
So no. My answer to eloping is no.

281
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:03,160
Okay, fine, I hear what you're saying.

282
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,932
But why do you get to say no?
What about what I want?

283
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:38,195
Okay. I've got eyeballs
on the dungeon door.

284
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:41,766
And there is a lady guard.
I'm gonna seduce my way past her.

285
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:43,895
- Oh, no.
- Uh-oh.

286
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:45,095
What? What's happening?

287
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:47,433
Casey is gonna try and seduce
the guard.

288
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:50,941
No, what...? The man who flunked
my course at The Farm, twice?

289
00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:54,603
Casey, that's not a very good idea.
Don't you have a gun or explosives?

290
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:57,250
You're terrible at seduction.
You have no finesse.

291
00:18:57,418 --> 00:18:58,885
I heard that.

292
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:01,419
Blowing the door will only alert
the other guards.

293
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:04,387
This is exactly the type of girl
I know how to charm.

294
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:06,082
Oh, God, he's gonna charm her.

295
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,219
Tranq and explode.
Casey, tranq and explode.

296
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:14,457
- Evening.
- Stop.

297
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:19,462
That's a lovely weapon
you have there.

298
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:22,466
Go.

299
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:28,473
Gosh, it must get awfully lonely
down here in the dungeon...

300
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:31,584
by yourself, no one to talk to.

301
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:36,415
Yes. Yes, it does.

302
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:38,825
Cold too.

303
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:43,219
You can take it. You're hardy.

304
00:19:43,664 --> 00:19:47,657
I can see why they didn't assign
one of those skinny ones down here.

305
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:50,101
Don't tell me.

306
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:07,279
So you tranqed her and blew the door.

307
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:08,887
How charming.

308
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:10,990
I rescued you. Shut up.

309
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:15,286
Let's get out of here.

310
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:16,895
- I'm staying.
- What? Why?

311
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:20,158
Told Beckman about Montgomery's leads.
Gonna get these super notes.

312
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,598
- You get him back to Burbank.
- Ah. Yes, about that.

313
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,330
I'm not going back to the States.
Thanks all the same.

314
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:27,497
This has been a debacle.

315
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:30,667
- No, we need to take you back with us.
- No, thank you.

316
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:35,709
- Really?
- Beckman said he might try that.

317
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,147
Tell Morgan I'll be back
in a week or two. See you.

318
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:53,694
Okay. Well, mission accomplished.

319
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,994
Sarah and I will go,
let you guys catch up.

320
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:58,994
Sit down.

321
00:20:59,173 --> 00:21:00,504
Sitting down, ma'am.

322
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:04,440
Agent Montgomery,
your mission to Morocco.

323
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,272
Who ordered you to go?

324
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:09,280
- Well...
- No one did.

325
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,884
Fatima Tazi, the super notes?

326
00:21:12,052 --> 00:21:14,350
You went after them
without any authorization...

327
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:18,252
and now I have one of my best agents
hidden inside a Moroccan fortress...

328
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:19,790
without backup.

329
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:24,754
Be on standby. If Colonel Casey gets
into trouble in Morocco...

330
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:26,900
I am sending you in to get him out.

331
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:28,295
Diane...

332
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:31,737
General.

333
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:35,136
If there's trouble, I'll get Casey out.

334
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:38,608
No. You're done, Roan.

335
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:42,146
I have a new mission for you.

336
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:04,468
Charles, you should never sneak up
on a spy, even a former one.

337
00:22:05,773 --> 00:22:08,241
Right. Sorry.

338
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:13,011
So how's, uh?
How's everything going?

339
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,643
I've never felt polyester
against my skin before.

340
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:19,479
I feel a chafing.
The chafe of stylelessness.

341
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:22,116
I hear you on that.

342
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:24,917
Um, listen, I'm kind of going through...

343
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:28,255
my own "spy relationship turmoil"
thing situation here...

344
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:30,590
and, uh, I wanted to ask you
about the general.

345
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:33,164
- Is this about the Morocco thing?
- Of course not.

346
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,823
Diane is upset about Berlin.

347
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:37,766
- Berlin?
- Chuck, sit down.

348
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:40,771
I have a few minutes left on my break,
heh.

349
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:44,810
Berlin, 1989.

350
00:22:44,978 --> 00:22:47,845
Not a good year for building walls
in East Germany.

351
00:22:59,293 --> 00:23:02,660
We had just won the Cold War.
I was off to Moscow, a new assignment.

352
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,628
Diane was on her way back
to Washington and a promotion.

353
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:25,911
We wouldn't see each other for months.
And just before I left...

354
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:28,678
she asked the question.

355
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:29,981
What about us?

356
00:23:38,165 --> 00:23:41,032
That's when I said it.
I'm not even sure why.

357
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:44,329
I told her, if we're alive in 20 years,
let's throw in the towel.

358
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:48,601
Be a normal couple, lead a normal life.

359
00:23:50,377 --> 00:23:52,038
Beckman was a dirty blond?

360
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:56,046
Hmm. It was the '80s.
Everything was dirty blond.

361
00:23:56,316 --> 00:23:59,410
We were supposed to meet
in Washington a few days ago.

362
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,185
I wish you'd pick up.
I need to hear your voice tonight.

363
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:07,589
I'm sorry again that I couldn't make it.
But I'm thinking of you.

364
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:12,061
Sweet dreams and besos, my flower.

365
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:33,677
Casey.

366
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:36,481
Casey, yes.
Listen, I'm so glad I caught you.

367
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:38,716
- This will not take long.
- I'm on a mission.

368
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:40,450
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm in a wall.

369
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:42,959
Of course you are.
Hear me out, please.

370
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,724
- I know. Talk to Kathleen, I will.
- You know what?

371
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:48,959
Never mind about that. It's totally cool.
Thank you, though.

372
00:24:49,136 --> 00:24:54,130
- You were right. I'm gonna do it.
- No, I wasn't totally right as it turns out.

373
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:58,108
Alex doesn't want you to talk to her.

374
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,638
Oh.

375
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,283
But, uh, enjoy your wall,
and come back safe.

376
00:25:06,453 --> 00:25:09,320
So wait. So she doesn't ever want me
to talk to her mom?

377
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:11,753
I don't know, buddy. I don't know.

378
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:13,984
And for whatever it's worth,
I'm sorry.

379
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:16,755
In fact, if you need someone to talk to,
I'm here.

380
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,329
- I mean, dig deep...
- Gotta go.

381
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:19,624
Casey.

382
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,867
I never thought I'd make it 20 years.

383
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:24,600
I am a spy.

384
00:25:24,905 --> 00:25:27,373
I can't be normal. It's not who I am.

385
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:30,009
See, that's how I feel
about the eloping thing.

386
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:32,372
That's not who I am.

387
00:25:32,546 --> 00:25:35,640
Well, you have to stop saying no
to Sarah and convince her.

388
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,611
First thing I teach my students
at The Farm...

389
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:40,878
is to convince an intimate relation...

390
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:43,522
you have to set the scene
for the conversation.

391
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,318
Create an erotic atmosphere.

392
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:48,893
Oh, like a sexy situation.

393
00:25:49,062 --> 00:25:50,996
- Yes, but don't say it like that.
- Oh.

394
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:54,156
Everything is easier
with sex in the air.

395
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:55,631
Secrets are shared...

396
00:25:56,003 --> 00:26:00,167
yeses come more easily,
nos disappear.

397
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,867
Yeah. Yeah. I just... I just...
I don't think I know how to do that.

398
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:06,808
Charles, come here.

399
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,575
Let's try on some shirts. Yes.

400
00:26:11,985 --> 00:26:14,010
Now, you're going to need a suit.

401
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:22,823
Sarah?

402
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:25,191
I'll be right out.

403
00:26:25,966 --> 00:26:31,165
All right, well, listen, I made us
a reservation at this place...

404
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:35,905
so, uh, just throw on
a little something, huh?

405
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,602
Sarah?

406
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,631
Hi, Chuck.

407
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:04,636
I'm sorry.

408
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:10,768
Oh, well, that's an excellent apology.
I am very sorry too.

409
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:17,646
Now I want you to relax...

410
00:27:17,818 --> 00:27:21,447
and just think of the two of us
running away together.

411
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,220
Yeah?

412
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:31,057
Now just imagine...

413
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:34,223
instead of me wearing
a white wedding dress in L. A...

414
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:36,596
with all the family...

415
00:27:37,404 --> 00:27:41,636
picture me wearing this just for you.

416
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:45,169
Anywhere in the world.

417
00:27:45,345 --> 00:27:47,074
Sound like fun?

418
00:27:47,814 --> 00:27:48,940
Yeah.

419
00:28:00,827 --> 00:28:03,625
Chuck, elope with me.

420
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:04,957
Yeah.

421
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:09,927
No. Wait. No, no, no.
What are you doing?

422
00:28:10,103 --> 00:28:11,764
I can't believe you're doing this.

423
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:14,031
- What?
- You're using Roan's method.

424
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:17,643
Sexy situations, erotic atmospheres.
You're trying to seduce me.

425
00:28:18,178 --> 00:28:21,204
- Why are you wearing that outfit?
- Trying to seduce you too...

426
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:23,110
just not clearly as well.

427
00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:31,620
- Beckman wants to see us in Castle.
- Maybe we should change then.

428
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,885
Fine. Fine.

429
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:38,453
I'm not saying I wanna change.
I wanna... I want you to stay in red.

430
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:41,658
Always. Always be in whatever
you're wearing right now.

431
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:45,300
All right, here's the situation.

432
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:51,310
Fatima is meeting with her financial
backers on the other side of this wall.

433
00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:59,250
Fatima, we provided you
with 100 million in gold five months ago.

434
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:03,549
You won't tell us where your mint is
or where you're storing these bills.

435
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:06,988
Level with us,
do these super notes really exist?

436
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:09,922
It gives me great pleasure
to announce...

437
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,032
that we have been able to produce
more notes than originally anticipated...

438
00:29:14,434 --> 00:29:18,530
for a grand total of $1 trillion.

439
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:20,866
What are we going to do
with $1 trillion?

440
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:25,705
That is too much currency.
Our fortunes depend on a strong dollar.

441
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:29,007
Yours may, but mine does not.

442
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,081
Thanks for the gold.

443
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,418
What happened?

444
00:30:05,585 --> 00:30:07,280
Casey? Casey, are you there?

445
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:11,219
Casey. Oh, thank God. Are you okay?

446
00:30:11,892 --> 00:30:13,723
Hey. Yeah.

447
00:30:13,894 --> 00:30:17,990
I'm still hidden,
but part of the bearing wall came down.

448
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:20,462
I'm trapped.
I may have to cut my arm off.

449
00:30:21,134 --> 00:30:25,730
Hold on that, Colonel Casey.
Stand by for further instructions.

450
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:30,340
Go to Morocco. We need the location
of that mint so we can destroy it.

451
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,343
And we gotta get to Casey
before he chops his own arm off.

452
00:30:33,513 --> 00:30:35,777
How are we gonna find
the location of the mint?

453
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:37,280
Fatima isn't gonna tell us.

454
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,317
Only one man could possibly
get the information out of her.

455
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:44,253
Roan? Ma'am,
Fatima will have Roan shot on sight.

456
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:46,756
No man could seduce Fatima Tazi twice.
It's a...

457
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:48,121
Seduction impossible.

458
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:49,994
Get him.

459
00:30:50,163 --> 00:30:53,997
General, I know that Roan has broken
a promise or two...

460
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,192
but you can't send the man
to his death.

461
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:58,530
Get me Roan Montgomery.

462
00:31:06,346 --> 00:31:13,343
And that is the story
of "Sleeping Beauty."

463
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:19,554
You know,
Grandma once had to take a potion...

464
00:31:19,726 --> 00:31:22,786
that made me sleep for a few days.

465
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:26,426
But Grandma's partner
had a potion too.

466
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:32,231
And when it was time to wake me up,
he put the antidote on his lips...

467
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:37,338
and woke me with a kiss,
just like the prince.

468
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,035
Grandma was on a mission.

469
00:31:40,547 --> 00:31:42,344
Can you say "mission"?

470
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:47,647
A seduction, no problem. But rope climb?
I'm getting old for this.

471
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:51,313
Climb over, get to the boudoir,
and seduce the location out of Fatima.

472
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:53,925
- We'll get Casey.
- Once we have the location...

473
00:31:54,094 --> 00:31:56,426
our attack drones will take it out.
Move out.

474
00:31:58,365 --> 00:32:00,925
Hey, hey. One last thing.

475
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:04,502
In case I don't see you two crazy kids
again, do one thing for me.

476
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:07,572
Remember you're in love.
Listen to each other.

477
00:32:08,008 --> 00:32:11,034
Never go on a mission angry.

478
00:32:29,896 --> 00:32:33,297
Please, don't call out for help.

479
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:36,296
I had to come back to you, my love.

480
00:32:36,469 --> 00:32:37,697
What are you doing here?

481
00:32:41,341 --> 00:32:44,401
Just hear me out, please.
I'm not here as a spy.

482
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:46,040
I'm here because of you.

483
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:47,975
I never wanted to leave you.

484
00:32:48,148 --> 00:32:50,639
I was extracted
because of another woman.

485
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:52,785
Another woman?

486
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:55,479
Who?

487
00:32:56,489 --> 00:32:59,253
- My general.
- Who is impatient.

488
00:32:59,426 --> 00:33:01,223
Get the location of the mint, Roan.

489
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:04,090
Interpersonal stuff on a mission?

490
00:33:04,264 --> 00:33:06,528
- It's very unprofessional.
- I know.

491
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:09,429
- I don't wanna fight.
- Me neither.

492
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:14,640
Okay. Well, look,
we know my family is stressful.

493
00:33:14,808 --> 00:33:16,173
But what else? What...?

494
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,970
You know, other pros and cons
to having a big wedding?

495
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:21,613
Well, okay.
I mean, who am I gonna invite?

496
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:24,750
Who's gonna come and
who's gonna walk me down the aisle?

497
00:33:27,587 --> 00:33:30,750
I'm an idiot. This was never
about my family, this is about yours.

498
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:32,482
I should have figured that out.

499
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:35,287
I should have told you
and not had you figure it out.

500
00:33:35,462 --> 00:33:38,454
You kidding me with this conversation?
I'm about to cut my arm off.

501
00:33:38,631 --> 00:33:41,099
Casey, hey. Yes, good. Sorry.
We're right here.

502
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,134
I know you're not after wealth.

503
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:56,143
Your heart is far too pure for that.

504
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:57,544
What is it you want?

505
00:33:58,351 --> 00:34:01,320
Why don't you tell me?
Let me help you.

506
00:34:12,565 --> 00:34:15,625
When I was a girl...

507
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:19,663
my village was destroyed
by an American conglomerate.

508
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:23,800
They strip-mined over my entire world.

509
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:29,440
So I am going to flood the markets
with 1 trillion U.S. Dollars.

510
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:31,583
The American economy will collapse...

511
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:34,720
and it will be my little village
that brought them down.

512
00:34:36,523 --> 00:34:40,254
Yes, you told me about your village.
It's called Setouan.

513
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:41,518
Is that right?

514
00:34:42,662 --> 00:34:44,254
Yes. You listened.

515
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,398
Of course.

516
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:48,533
I'd love to visit it someday.

517
00:34:55,575 --> 00:34:57,406
I've got the village on my monitor.

518
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:01,570
There's the mint. We got it.

519
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:04,842
This is Beckman,
authorization 8485-Charlie.

520
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:07,919
Initiate air strike,
sending grid coordinates now.

521
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:10,248
Chuck, Sarah, get Casey out of there.

522
00:35:10,423 --> 00:35:11,549
We just need a minute.

523
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:17,695
Uh, general, we're gonna be
slightly delayed.

524
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:21,197
- Chuck, what's happening?
- Bad guys. Lots of bad guys.

525
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:32,570
I'm right behind you.

526
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:36,479
One step to the left.

527
00:35:38,084 --> 00:35:39,244
The other left, idiot.

528
00:35:41,654 --> 00:35:43,087
Never done this before.

529
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:44,746
What? Never done what before?

530
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:47,423
There are Americans in the palace.

531
00:35:47,594 --> 00:35:49,619
You bastard.

532
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:52,731
- Yes, I answer to that.
- What do we do?

533
00:35:55,235 --> 00:35:56,293
Kill them.

534
00:36:06,613 --> 00:36:08,274
That takes care of your friends.

535
00:36:10,483 --> 00:36:12,075
Casey, you are great.

536
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:13,944
Get me out of here.

537
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,348
Right. Right.

538
00:36:16,656 --> 00:36:18,248
Now to deal with you, Roan.

539
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:21,924
I'm so sorry.

540
00:36:22,462 --> 00:36:26,296
So rude. Hi. Could I call you right back?
I'm right in...

541
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:29,534
- Who is this?
- This is General Diane Beckman.

542
00:36:29,702 --> 00:36:30,930
With whom am I speaking?

543
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,766
This is the woman
who is about to kill your agent.

544
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,771
Good. It's about time.

545
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:37,667
Good?

546
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:39,503
She said "good."

547
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,675
We're in the middle of a tiff.

548
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:44,009
I don't wanna stop you.

549
00:36:44,183 --> 00:36:46,913
I'd just like to say one last thing
to Roan.

550
00:36:47,086 --> 00:36:49,111
I'm happy to see him die.

551
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:50,586
Ah.

552
00:36:51,324 --> 00:36:53,019
Another one of your admirers.

553
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,757
Hello. Diane, listen, I just wanna say
that I am truly sorry...

554
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,057
but, you know,
I can be such a bastard.

555
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:03,794
Thank you, Roan. Oh, one more thing.

556
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,597
Yes?

557
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:08,798
Duck.

558
00:37:31,864 --> 00:37:34,992
Roan? Roan, are you there?

559
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:36,425
Is he alive?

560
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:40,929
We got him, general. He's right here.

561
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,670
Are you okay?

562
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:50,282
I still got it.

563
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:51,908
Yeah.

564
00:37:52,352 --> 00:37:53,717
- Ahh, where's the bar?
- Come on.

565
00:37:53,886 --> 00:37:55,183
- Let's go.
- What? Just...

566
00:37:55,355 --> 00:37:57,585
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

567
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:05,554
Here is to the woman
who blows everyone else away.

568
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:10,395
Seeing you in action again,
it was like old times.

569
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,198
Old times? I like to say the '80s.

570
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:17,571
- Darling, listen, there's something...
- I know.

571
00:38:17,744 --> 00:38:20,611
You don't wanna settle down.
You're not made for that.

572
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,080
- You're a spy, that is your life.
- It's almost like you rehearsed that.

573
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:28,482
- It was my speech to you.
- You changed your mind too?

574
00:38:28,988 --> 00:38:30,319
Why did you hunt me down?

575
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,823
Roan, you never run away
from a general.

576
00:38:35,495 --> 00:38:37,360
Yes, of course.

577
00:38:38,297 --> 00:38:41,095
But I do hope our rendezvous
aren't over.

578
00:38:41,267 --> 00:38:44,600
Budapest last spring was divine.

579
00:38:45,004 --> 00:38:50,067
Well, I have high hopes
for Morocco tonight.

580
00:39:26,045 --> 00:39:28,138
Good for you, Kath.

581
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:30,813
Mom?

582
00:39:30,983 --> 00:39:33,952
Thirty more seconds,
then we check the temp.

583
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:37,822
Mom.

584
00:39:39,025 --> 00:39:40,117
What is it?

585
00:39:40,993 --> 00:39:42,620
Having you here has been great.

586
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:46,990
But you are ready to try it
on your own. I get it.

587
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:51,933
No. No, it's not that.
I would keep you here forever if I could.

588
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:56,006
Mom, do you really wanna be
a full-time grandma?

589
00:39:57,477 --> 00:39:58,671
It's okay.

590
00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:02,238
This is what I dreamed of
for so many years.

591
00:40:04,383 --> 00:40:07,045
I made Chuck quit the CIA.

592
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:10,752
And sometimes I wonder
if that was the right decision...

593
00:40:10,923 --> 00:40:13,448
because I know
that he's a good person...

594
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:16,958
who's helped people
and he's protected us.

595
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:20,027
He's a Bartowski.

596
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:24,032
And he says that you're the best.

597
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,500
I can't keep another person
from being a hero...

598
00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:31,234
simply because I'm afraid.

599
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:35,905
If you need to be a spy,
that's not another abandonment.

600
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:39,050
You'll still be in our lives.

601
00:40:39,218 --> 00:40:43,712
I wanna give everything to this baby
that I never gave to you or Chuck.

602
00:40:46,893 --> 00:40:48,554
That's my job.

603
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:56,301
You just have to be the best grandma
in the world.

604
00:40:59,105 --> 00:41:01,505
So tell me about that agent...

605
00:41:01,707 --> 00:41:05,234
who kissed you awake on the mission?
- Oh.

606
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:09,137
He was a big romantic.

607
00:41:10,483 --> 00:41:12,383
And the greatest husband
there ever was.

608
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:13,917
Aha!

609
00:41:17,757 --> 00:41:19,748
Well, I'm glad we talked.

610
00:41:19,926 --> 00:41:21,086
Me too.

611
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:27,528
I think eloping just seemed
like a way for me to avoid my family.

612
00:41:29,535 --> 00:41:33,767
Sarah, you've done so much
to help my family, how can I help yours?

613
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,674
I don't know. It's different.

614
00:41:37,677 --> 00:41:39,167
Sarah, come on.

615
00:41:39,345 --> 00:41:42,678
It's our job is to take care
of some of the world's biggest problems.

616
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:45,646
Terrorists and despots and oligarchs.

617
00:41:45,818 --> 00:41:48,309
I think we can handle a family.
Even yours.

618
00:41:50,022 --> 00:41:53,116
Hey, hey. You are Sarah Walker...

619
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:55,624
the most mysterious woman
in the world.

620
00:41:55,795 --> 00:41:59,754
So as the future Mr. Sarah Walker...

621
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:02,258
can't I get to know you better?
