1
00:00:01,955 --> 00:00:04,185
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things
you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:06,621
My dad must have left this for me.

3
00:00:09,663 --> 00:00:10,721
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:13,832
I didn't think you could top
abandoning me for 20 years.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,228
Then you shot me.

6
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:17,927
Sarah, my mom did something to me
with that device.

7
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:21,397
My name is Alexei Volkoff.

8
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:23,405
I believe you were looking for me.

9
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:27,210
Sarah, I can't flash. The Intersect is gone.

10
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:51,197
You wanted to see me, Alexei?

11
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:55,170
I've just had some disturbing news.

12
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:59,335
Agent Carmichael is still alive.

13
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:03,015
I'm as surprised as you are.

14
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:05,151
I was there.

15
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:07,950
We tied them up.

16
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,554
Planted explosives all around them.

17
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:13,719
And yet he survived.

18
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,759
It was my fault.

19
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,428
I underestimated him.

20
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:26,868
Let's tidy things up.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,736
These are my top assassins
in North America.

22
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,310
Pierre, Victor, Hercule.

23
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,946
Use them.

24
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:39,781
And, Frost?

25
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:45,547
Make certain he's really dead
this time.

26
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:52,991
Are you ready for this? You
and me, training for hand-to-hand combat.

27
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:56,168
Absolutely. Remember,
I had six months of training in Prague.

28
00:01:56,336 --> 00:01:58,270
Now this is Chuck unplugged.

29
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:00,599
Sounds hardcore
when you say it like that.

30
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:03,572
It's gonna be good.
I'm mostly just scared about today.

31
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:06,234
Black Friday?
The scariest shopping day of the year.

32
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:09,905
- Many a manager has fallen on this day.
- You're gonna be just fine.

33
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,143
- We'll learn moves, you'll get through it.
- I'm pumped.

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,312
Let's go in there
and kick some serious ass.

35
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:19,287
Get up on the floor
And show 'em all why

36
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,154
They gonna need sticky paper...

37
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:22,693
All right, ladies...

38
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:26,628
let's grab a pole
and make that booty clap.

39
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:30,401
What sort of hand-to-hand combat class
did you sign us up for?

40
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,662
Strip Kick.

41
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:36,036
Mixes the self-defense of Krav Maga
with the core workout of pole dancing.

44
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:49,517
How's it going with you and Sarah?
Any progress on el proposalito?

45
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:52,317
Well, I am working on something new.
Duck!

46
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,953
Whoo! But I'm keeping it
close to the vest.

47
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,562
What? Are you serious?

48
00:02:57,764 --> 00:03:00,733
Chuck, I'm a part-time spy, man, okay?

49
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,301
I am a very, very serious keeper
of secrets.

50
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:06,872
Jump!

51
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,843
- Casey can never know about this.
- Never.

52
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:13,773
So how's the combat training going?

53
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:17,348
Ha, ha. Cinnamon's a tough instructor,
but I'm picking things up quickly.

54
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:20,352
Well, I am just happy to have you back.

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,853
Me too. And you know what?
It's the best I've felt in a long time.

56
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:25,889
Good. I thought you might be upset...

57
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,220
after Ellie and Awesome
canceled dinner.

58
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:31,364
What? No, no, no. Of course not.
They're doctors, it happens.

59
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:34,364
Besides, tonight is our annual
leftover dinner.

60
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:38,334
Just as delicious as Thanksgiving
without all the big-event stress.

61
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,429
Let it snow.

62
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:44,441
Remember, Frost wants them killed
at close range.

63
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:46,579
No sound.

64
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:50,546
I guess I was just a little worried
because the holidays are for family time.

65
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:53,049
With everything that happened
with your mother...

66
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:55,312
Well, I've developed a little perspective.

67
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,046
I'm ready to put the past behind me.

68
00:03:57,223 --> 00:03:58,247
Really?

69
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:00,859
Ha, ha.
Don't sound so skeptical, all right?

70
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:04,724
If my mom were standing in front of me,
I honestly think I'd say:

71
00:04:04,898 --> 00:04:07,696
"All is forgiven
and good luck being an evil bad guy."

72
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:12,434
And, uh, speaking
of looking forward to the future...

73
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:15,907
Chuck, get down.

74
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,414
Wow, that stuff really works.

75
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:30,452
Sarah, I can't handle these guys without
the Intersect. I only got that one move!

76
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:32,281
Sarah?

77
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:46,398
Mom?

78
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,738
Come with me if you wanna live.

79
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,539
Chuck 4x10 - Versus the Leftovers

80
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:36,155
Okay, we're here, we're safe.
Start answering some of my questions.

81
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:40,458
We can't stay here. Volkoff has contacts
in the CIA. We have to move.

82
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:43,659
We should believe you.
Last time, trusting you worked out well.

83
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,067
Chuck, I didn't want to have to do
the things I did.

84
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,676
Most moms don't have to explain
to their kids why they shot them.

85
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:52,811
Or tied them up and blew up their home.

86
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,413
- I didn't have a choice.
- There's always a choice.

87
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:57,139
You could choose to let me...

88
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:00,444
Chuck, maybe we can step outside
for a second?

89
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:04,886
- We're running out of...
- Ah. You're not going anywhere.

90
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,786
What happened to
putting the past behind you?

91
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,021
You wanna be able to trust your mom,
not worry she'll shoot you in the face.

92
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:14,257
Which is why you should stay out of this.

93
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:18,268
There is something she's not telling us
and we're not gonna get to it with you.

94
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:20,497
I'm perfectly capable of doing this...

95
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:26,206
This is what a successful
Black Friday looks like.

96
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:28,312
You did it, son. I couldn't be prouder.

97
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:30,073
It was hairy for a minute, but...

98
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:33,878
- Like, we ran out of 7G smartphones.
- But you remembered what I taught you.

99
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:37,784
No phone? Sell them a head spa.
No head spa? Sell them a used phone.

100
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:40,050
- Heh, heh. Exactly.
- Now...

101
00:06:40,226 --> 00:06:42,558
I brought this for you.
- Really?

102
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:45,196
Just think of this as my fatherly love...

103
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:49,562
in the form of fresh meatballs
smothered in marinara...

104
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:53,330
with gooey delicious provolone
melting all over it.

105
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:56,202
Wow, that is just a terrible metaphor...

106
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,900
heh, heh, but I forgive you
because it smells delicious.

107
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:01,444
- You deserve it.
- Okay. All right.

108
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:05,140
I should go. I'm getting a little misty.

109
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:06,410
- Yeah.
- All right.

110
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:08,178
Okay.

111
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:19,722
Excuse me? Can you help me?

112
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:23,027
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry, miss. We're closed.

113
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:26,501
Well, I just wanna buy
one of those 7G smartphones.

114
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:28,765
- Completely sold out of those.
- Please.

115
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,600
I'll do anything.

116
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:34,575
Uh, not that I'm not flattered,
but who has two thumbs and is taken?

117
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:38,041
Boop. This guy. Okay. Happy holidays.

118
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,083
Okay.

119
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,455
This is our finest plan yet, Jeffrey.

120
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,120
Smartphones that can also send
and receive calls?

121
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:55,233
I mean, people will do anything
for these bad boys.

122
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:58,029
- Who have you been talking to?
- Stop being paranoid.

123
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:00,968
Remember, this is not stealing.

124
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,472
This is pre-buying with funds
we don't have...

125
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:06,874
which we will post-pay
when we sell these phones on eBay.

126
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,138
And then, my friend?

127
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:10,077
Use the profits to make our demo.

128
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:11,273
Jeffster!

129
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:15,447
Yes, yes, yes!

130
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,952
Stop. Listen.

131
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:20,889
I'm gonna go see if the coast is clear,
then we'll move these out of here.

132
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:25,330
Totally.

133
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:33,737
Knock, knock. Brought some carrots.

134
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:36,170
Rich in vitamin A,
good for retinal development.

135
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:38,810
- Thank you. I'm starving.
- I bet.

136
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,809
You've been working on this nonstop.

137
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,312
- You figure anything out?
- Well, more or less.

138
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:47,816
My dad left a sort of memory problem.
He was using the brain to store data.

139
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:50,512
He was approaching it from
an engineer's perspective.

140
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,180
Human memory works differently.

141
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:56,294
So a few adjustments
and 36 hours of MRls later...

142
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:58,088
voilá.

143
00:08:58,264 --> 00:09:01,700
Wait, are you telling me you just solved
the problem your dad left you?

144
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,698
No. I solved it 20 minutes ago...

145
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:07,464
and then, suddenly,
his computer just locked off. Look.

146
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:10,133
"One or 11?"

147
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,003
What does that mean?

148
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:16,080
I tried putting in each of the numbers.
Another mystery, courtesy of my dad.

149
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,942
Why would he leave this for me?

150
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:23,350
Brain scans?
I mean, this is obviously spy-related.

151
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,650
We should talk to Chuck.

152
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:29,625
No. I don't wanna give him any reason
to get back into that life.

153
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,261
What do you wanna do?

154
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:33,656
I don't know.

155
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,495
We know these men
were high-level Volkoff assassins.

156
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:37,966
So, what's your game here?

157
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:40,867
I was ordered to use those three
to kill Chuck.

158
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,498
I had to shoot them to save Chuck's life.

159
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:47,874
Protecting him has always been
my number-one priority.

160
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:54,377
- Hello?
- Ask her how disabling the Intersect...

161
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,249
is about protecting me.
- Are we gonna do this now?

162
00:09:57,423 --> 00:09:59,516
I'm just saying. Tell her to explain that.

163
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:01,184
Fine.

164
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,826
So how was shutting off the Intersect
meant to protect Chuck?

165
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:08,364
It was meant to stop him
from following me.

166
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,664
- Yes?
- I went out on missions unprotected.

167
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,398
She's made me more vulnerable.

168
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,169
- I don't think this is helping.
- Is that him?

169
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:21,336
- Let me talk to him.
- Here.

170
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:24,005
This is why we didn't want you
in this interrogation.

171
00:10:24,183 --> 00:10:26,845
- Let the grown-ups do their work.
- Fine. Hanging up now.

172
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:28,452
- Good. I'm glad.
- I'm gladder.

173
00:10:30,222 --> 00:10:34,249
- Huh. Where were we?
- Tell us what it is that you're really after.

174
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:38,227
Volkoff will know that they are dead,
which means he will come here for me.

175
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:39,625
We are not safe here.

176
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:45,596
Sarah? Sarah, pick up the phone.

177
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:05,313
I was able to get what you wanted.

178
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:06,985
Fantastic.

179
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:12,130
Now, you said
you were willing to do anything for it.

180
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:13,756
First...

181
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:16,965
I need you to shave my back.

182
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:18,802
I can't reach the middle.

183
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,098
Thomas Jefferson Barnes.

184
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:23,138
Hey, Jeffrey...

185
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:26,471
what are you doing?
- Getting what I deserve.

186
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,203
Getting what you...? Real...?

187
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:30,973
Excuse me. Listen to me.

188
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,119
We can't afford to let strangers
shave your back, Jeffrey.

189
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:38,416
Not now, when we're this close
to making our dreams come true.

190
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:41,457
You're so pretty.

191
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:44,629
I...

192
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,526
And we're secure.

193
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,768
Come on, guys.
Come on. Right over there.

194
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,602
- Bring it in.
- Let's move.

195
00:11:58,144 --> 00:11:59,543
Yeah.

196
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:08,383
Good work.

197
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:10,647
Now let's get what we came for.

198
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:17,493
Line them up together.

199
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,532
This way.

200
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:48,894
There's something she's not telling us.

201
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,552
You're not doing yourself any favors
by calling.

202
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,722
I'm sorry. If you wanna go back in,
I promise I'll stay off the phone.

203
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:02,797
One sec. I just gotta...

204
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:05,671
It's... I'm not calling you. Just... Morgan.

205
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:08,643
I can't really talk.
We're in the middle of a crisis here.

206
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:10,441
I don't know what crisis you're in.

207
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:13,414
But mine's carrying AK-47 s.
They just took over the store.

208
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:16,146
Hey. Did you...? Chuck? Chuck?

209
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:18,552
- Alexei Volkoff.
- Did you just say Volkoff?

210
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:21,158
- Volkoff is here?
- Morgan, I need you to hide.

211
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:22,692
Do not come out until I... Morgan?

212
00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:26,656
Volkoff cut off our cell phones.

213
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:29,960
That's always Volkoff's first move,
kill all communications.

214
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:31,460
Hmm.

215
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:33,662
What are we gonna do?
Morgan is still up there.

216
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,433
Lucky for us,
this is a state-of-the-art CIA facility.

217
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:38,543
Fully prepared for an internal attack.

218
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:45,373
We've less than a minute. Impress me.

219
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:48,883
Okay, let's do some damage.

220
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:53,457
Attention, members of the CIA.

221
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:56,686
You've killed three of my men
and captured my best agent.

222
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,790
I'm here to get her back.

223
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:01,398
Keep talking, commie. It's party time.

224
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:22,080
Mr. Volkoff, exit the Buy More now.

225
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:24,814
K.K., go.

226
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,322
Weapons system online.

227
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:35,263
Better dead than red.

228
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,134
Weapons disabled.

229
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,073
Casey, what's happening?

230
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:48,406
Must have hacked in. My guns are down.

231
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:52,073
Understand, this is not a negotiation.

232
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:55,417
Give me Frost...

233
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:56,816
or I'll kill you all...

234
00:14:56,989 --> 00:15:00,049
starting with the fat man
and the Indian.

235
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:07,762
God.

236
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:09,358
Progress?

237
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,402
Scans revealed an elevator shaft
behind the home-theater room.

238
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:16,166
K.K. Can't seem to override the system
and it's 3 feet of carbide steel.

239
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:18,701
Start cutting.

240
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:23,971
Okay, good news, bad news.

241
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:26,174
Jeff and Lester are about to die,
bad news.

242
00:15:26,352 --> 00:15:29,287
Good news, I've manually locked down
all entrances to Castle.

243
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:31,389
Bad news,
we're sitting ducks down here.

244
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,820
They're cutting in
through the elevator shaft.

245
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:37,326
Now, we have one option.
The defenses have a manual override.

246
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:39,657
They're buried deep
in the access tunnels.

247
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:42,699
We can override the lockdown,
bring our defenses back up.

248
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:44,802
Now, you two stay down here
with Mama B.

249
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,700
When Volkoff calls to negotiate,
buy me some time.

250
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:52,510
Why would Volkoff pull off an assault
on a CIA facility for one agent?

251
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:55,909
- He's gotta be after something bigger.
- Well, whatever it is...

252
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:58,845
there's something
my mom's not telling us.

253
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:01,246
I'm not lying. He wants me.

254
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,413
He'll take on the entire CIA, risk his
whole organization, for one agent?

255
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:06,750
He...

256
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,896
I need to know that Frost is still alive.

257
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,527
Put her on the phone.

258
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:22,537
Chuck,
you have to turn me over to him.

259
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,403
Please trust me.

260
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:29,705
I don't.

261
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,545
This is Charles Carmichael.

262
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,914
I'm the only one
you'll be speaking with.

263
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:38,454
Charles.
So good to hear your voice again.

264
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:41,883
Now, I know how scared you must be...

265
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:44,586
cut off from help
with a madman closing in on you.

266
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:47,596
So let me offer you
a simple suggestion.

267
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:51,395
Hand Frost the damn phone!

268
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:56,365
He wants to talk to you.

269
00:16:57,609 --> 00:16:59,167
Alexei, I'm here.

270
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:02,972
Frost.

271
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:04,908
Thank God.

272
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:08,079
- Are they treating you all right?
- I'm fine.

273
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,479
- Did they feed you?
- Yes.

274
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,382
Was it good?

275
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:15,985
It was delicious.

276
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:19,428
Tell them they better continue
treating you well...

277
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:23,231
or I'll make life very uncomfortable
for them very soon.

278
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:25,432
Tell them...

279
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:29,733
that I'm not leaving here without you,
my love.

280
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:34,776
Wha...?

281
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,744
- "My love"?
- What does that mean?

282
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:44,011
It means that Alexei Volkoff
is in love with me.

283
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:55,056
He's in love with you?
He called you "my love"?

284
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:58,719
Who is Volkoff to you? Your boyfriend?
Is he the reason you left Dad?

285
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:00,290
No.

286
00:18:00,463 --> 00:18:04,524
Alexei and I have never been together.
It's just he...

287
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:09,001
- He's in love with me, that's all.
- That's all? Got it. Got it. Great.

288
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,469
No, you don't get it.

289
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,130
Sarah, explain to him.

290
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:15,243
If you were working undercover
with the biggest psychopath...

291
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:18,278
and that psychopath
falls in love with you...

292
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:23,950
That would make me
a major intelligence asset.

293
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:28,416
I see. So that's why you've been gone
from my life since I was 9?

294
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,850
Chuck, I'm a spy.

295
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,118
It was my mission.

296
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:35,196
You've been close to Volkoff.
Why didn't you take him out?

297
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,095
My mission was to take down
the network, not the man.

298
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,929
Which is something
I still might be able to do.

299
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:46,101
But if you want to save yourself
and your friends, turn me over to him.

300
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:47,367
You have no choice.

301
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:50,678
Chuck, wait.

302
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:57,009
- Hey, are you okay?
- How can I trust anything she says?

303
00:18:57,186 --> 00:19:00,087
Every time I do, I wind up getting shot
or almost blown up.

304
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:01,855
I haven't been stabbed yet.

305
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:06,018
Going undercover for so long
and staying loyal is a hard thing to do.

306
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:10,097
I got lucky. I was assigned to you.
Your mom got Volkoff.

307
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,963
You think Volkoff really
is in love with her?

308
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:17,163
If he is, I bet he would rather negotiate
with us than risk her getting hurt.

309
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,367
I might be mad at my mom, really mad,
but I'm never gonna hurt her.

310
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:23,569
You and I know that, but Volkoff doesn't.

311
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,715
It might help us to buy more time
for Casey.

312
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:42,029
- Casey.
- Morgan, what are you doing in here?

313
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:46,059
- And where are your shoes?
- What...? Funny story. I was sitting...

314
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:47,566
Never mind about the shoes.

315
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,001
Where are Chuck and Sarah
and what is going on?

316
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:52,073
Volkoff's taken control of the Buy More.

317
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:54,732
He's captured Tweedledumb
and Tweedledumber.

318
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:57,607
He's gonna kill them
if we don't give him Chuck's mom.

319
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,839
- Jeff and Lester? We gotta save them.
- Mm-hm.

320
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:02,780
If we don't get those guns working,
we're gonna be killed.

321
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,352
No, no, no.
You're absolutely right. Okay.

322
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:08,388
I'll go. Get the guns running,
I'll save Jeff and Lester.

323
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,788
Morgan, that's a stupid idea.

324
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,021
Maybe, but I'm not just gonna sit here
on all fours and watch those two die.

325
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:17,029
Now, wish me luck.

326
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,029
Wait.

327
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:24,572
You might need that.

328
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:27,967
- Good thinking.
- Muzzle.

329
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:29,439
Right. I got it, I got it.

330
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:41,415
Yes, Charles?

331
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:42,922
You want Frost...

332
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,987
and we have her.

333
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:48,328
If you do what we ask,
she doesn't get hurt.

334
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,261
But if you don't do what we ask...

335
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,628
then bad things
are going to happen to her.

336
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:55,130
Very bad things.

337
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:56,703
Like...

338
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,604
Just very bad things.
We'll leave it at that.

339
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:02,506
Is that a threat?

340
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:08,606
Let me show you something.

341
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,287
This is a thermite-TH3
incendiary explosive.

342
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,524
When it's detonated, the temperatures
will exceed 4000 degrees Fahrenheit.

343
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,758
Metal will boil.

344
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,667
I'm gonna drop it
down the elevator shaft...

345
00:21:29,272 --> 00:21:31,866
and it will incinerate
every single one of you...

346
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,770
including my beloved Frost.

347
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:38,814
I'd rather she die
than have to live without me.

348
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,141
Give her back to me...

349
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:43,778
and I'll let you live.

350
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:48,813
That's how you threaten someone,
Charles.

351
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,691
So much for buying Casey more time.

352
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,167
Okay, come on.

353
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,668
Ow!

354
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,084
Hey. You came for me. Thank you.

355
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,024
- No time to talk, Grimes.
- Wait. No. No.

356
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:39,168
They were supposed to sell these.
What is wrong with those guys?

357
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:54,414
Let's go. Move.

358
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:24,276
Tell your men to back off.

359
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:26,387
Don't be afraid.

360
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:28,716
I told you I'd let you live and I meant it.

361
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:30,051
But you should know...

362
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,950
I have your friend Casey.

363
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:41,995
Put down your weapons.

364
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:57,249
Frost.

365
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,888
Thank you for coming for me.

366
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:02,789
I had no choice.

367
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:14,027
Now, there is just one small matter
to deal with.

368
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,641
Chuck.

369
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,805
- What happened to letting us go?
- I lied.

370
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:27,449
But in my defense,
you threatened the woman I love.

371
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:31,184
Frost...

372
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:34,612
I hope you think
this is a romantic gesture.

373
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:39,522
- Alexei, you can't.
- Why not? You like romance.

374
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:41,691
Because...

375
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:45,558
Charles is my son.

376
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:55,635
Really?

377
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:57,671
Really.

378
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,548
Really?

379
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,084
Really.

380
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:11,924
- Really?
- Really.

381
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:25,668
So this is why he isn't dead.

382
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:28,067
I'm sorry, Alexei.

383
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:30,337
My one weakness is my love for my son.

384
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,605
And he knows this
and uses it against me.

385
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,580
Don't be hard on yourself.

386
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:38,379
We always expect the best
from the ones we love.

387
00:25:38,554 --> 00:25:40,681
And rarely get it.

388
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,684
Why didn't you tell me?

389
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:46,021
Alexei, you run a multinational
criminal organization.

390
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:48,356
There's no room for family.

391
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,632
- Especially family that works for the CIA.
- What did you think I was going to do?

392
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,794
- Sir, there's an incoming call on the Buy...
- Shut up!

393
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:05,403
From an Ellie Bartowski.

394
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:15,587
Any relation, this Ellie Bartowski...

395
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:18,123
Mr. Bartowski?

396
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:28,327
Yeah.

397
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,567
No.

398
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:33,572
No. Yeah. Distant, distant relative.

399
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:38,912
Who... She lives in Alaska, I think.
Come to think of it, she's in Bangladesh.

400
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:40,139
You don't wanna...

401
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:42,181
- Not necessary.
- Chuck?

402
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,343
Hey, it's me.
Are you coming for dinner tonight?

403
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:49,914
I'm kind of, uh...
I'm kind of tied up here at work, sis.

404
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:52,492
No, you have to come.
I have so much food here.

405
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:56,188
We didn't get to have a family
Thanksgiving dinner. It'll be fun. Please?

406
00:27:01,437 --> 00:27:02,665
I'll try my best.

407
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:05,068
Okay, great. I'll see you soon.

408
00:27:05,808 --> 00:27:07,435
So...

409
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,976
a son and a daughter.

410
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:16,176
You didn't think I could have
a relationship with your family?

411
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:19,480
Kids love me.

412
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:23,984
I'll prove you wrong.

413
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:27,826
Charles...

414
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:30,223
Chuck.

415
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:38,471
Call your sister back.
Tell her you're coming to dinner...

416
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:41,132
and you're bringing some guests.

417
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,719
Okay.

418
00:27:54,888 --> 00:27:57,880
Okay, I know it's tough.
We just have to be calm.

419
00:27:58,091 --> 00:28:01,618
You just brought a psychotic killer
to your pregnant daughter's house.

420
00:28:01,795 --> 00:28:04,161
Considering the circumstances,
I'm pretty calm.

421
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:07,027
Everything's gonna be fine.
You just have to trust me.

422
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:09,195
I've heard that before.

423
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:15,699
Alexei, you do understand...

424
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:18,503
that my daughter and her husband
are civilians?

425
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:20,473
Of course.

426
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:22,410
I don't wanna frighten your family.

427
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,150
I just want to get to know them.

428
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:29,819
Hi.

429
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:33,884
Mom.

430
00:28:34,928 --> 00:28:37,920
I was telling you I was gonna bring
some surprise guests.

431
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:39,894
So, surprise!

432
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:42,894
Hey.

433
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,629
I'm Devon, your son-in-law.

434
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:47,369
- Hey.
- Come on in.

435
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:50,040
Hello, nice to meet you.

436
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,734
I want you to have fun tonight.

437
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:55,176
But if I get the feeling
that you're plotting against me...

438
00:28:56,583 --> 00:29:00,849
I need this dinner to be perfect,
understand?

439
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:02,079
Yeah, I think we do.

440
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:04,018
I think you don't.

441
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,682
If it isn't perfect,
I'll take it out on the people you love.

442
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:15,030
Well, this has been quite the surprise.

443
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:17,999
I can't remember the last time
we had you here for Thanksgiving, Mom.

444
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:20,162
Jingle bell, jingle bell rock

445
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,602
It was 1990.

446
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:23,265
You were 12...

447
00:29:23,443 --> 00:29:24,705
Chuck was 9.

448
00:29:24,878 --> 00:29:26,743
The turkey was overcooked.

449
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:29,777
Heh, heh. That's right.
That's right. I remember that.

450
00:29:29,949 --> 00:29:32,179
I, however, thought
the turkey tasted fine.

451
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:34,410
Jingle bell...

452
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:38,045
So, Alexei, you work with my mom.
Can I...?

453
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:40,715
I mean, am I allowed to ask
what happened to her?

454
00:29:41,795 --> 00:29:43,092
Dancin' and prancin'

455
00:29:43,263 --> 00:29:44,958
Well, it's complicated.

456
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:46,462
Let me explain.

457
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:52,900
Well, Ellie, in our business, sometimes
good people are confused for bad...

458
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:55,772
and bad for good.

459
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:59,478
But fortunately,
being your mother's handler...

460
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:02,979
I was able to convince the CIA
that she is good.

461
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:04,639
- In a one-horse sleigh

462
00:30:04,818 --> 00:30:05,978
Right, Sarah?

463
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:08,078
Right. Absolutely.

464
00:30:08,254 --> 00:30:11,018
And that's why your mother
is free to go now.

465
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:14,418
Well, that's good news, right?

466
00:30:15,795 --> 00:30:17,285
Yes.

467
00:30:17,464 --> 00:30:20,092
I know how painful it was
for your mother...

468
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:22,359
when she had to leave you years ago.

469
00:30:22,535 --> 00:30:26,130
I know how painful
it must have been for you too.

470
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,632
And your brother.

471
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:34,872
Thank you for helping our mom.

472
00:30:35,548 --> 00:30:38,346
You can't imagine what you've done
for this family.

473
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:41,817
Families come first.

474
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:50,829
Come on. Think, Morgan, think.

475
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:53,898
There's no Chuck, no Sarah.

476
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:55,825
It's up to you to save them.

477
00:30:56,002 --> 00:30:58,402
How? How?

478
00:31:05,512 --> 00:31:07,070
Okay.

479
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:10,241
- Okay. Uh, movie. Movie.
- Yes.

480
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,975
Gosh. Um...

481
00:31:12,652 --> 00:31:13,983
Three words.

482
00:31:42,015 --> 00:31:44,074
- Sounds like...
- Sounds like...

483
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,377
Hey, buddy, you having a good time?

484
00:31:46,553 --> 00:31:48,953
Are you kidding?
This Alexei is totally awesome.

485
00:31:49,122 --> 00:31:52,523
First guy I've met who's free-climbed K2,
no oxygen. Hardcore, bro.

486
00:31:52,692 --> 00:31:55,388
Yeah. Yeah, he's something else,
isn't he? Heh.

487
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:56,722
You know what else he is?

488
00:31:56,896 --> 00:32:00,764
An international arms dealer
and a very, very bad man.

489
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:04,233
We're in terrible danger. Don't freak out.
Bourne Identity.

490
00:32:04,404 --> 00:32:05,632
No!

491
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:08,899
- Ugh. So close.
- Dude, this is not funny.

492
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:12,044
Yeah, well, it's also not a joke,
Devon, okay?

493
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:18,315
I didn't wanna have to tell you this.
I'm spying again and I need your help.

494
00:32:18,485 --> 00:32:19,884
Batman Forever?

495
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:23,216
Wrong again, Charles.

496
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:27,822
You really should make some guesses,
otherwise it looks suspicious.

497
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:29,723
Uh, Bourne Identity?

498
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:34,728
- Three words.
- I said that.

499
00:32:34,901 --> 00:32:37,836
Whatever. What are you thinking,
bringing this guy home?

500
00:32:38,004 --> 00:32:40,734
I'm sorry. It's not my fault.
It wasn't my decision.

501
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:43,341
I can't make a move
without setting off Alexei...

502
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,479
but you're a civilian.
He won't suspect you of anything.

503
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,846
Devon,
I know you're the world's worst liar.

504
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:51,779
But right now...

505
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:53,578
I need you to be awesome.

506
00:32:56,022 --> 00:32:57,990
What do you want me to do?

507
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:01,793
Hey, looks like we're out of sugar.

508
00:33:01,961 --> 00:33:05,021
Hey, Chuck, you got any at your place?

509
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:12,096
Just getting some sugar.

510
00:33:22,882 --> 00:33:25,373
Oh. Oh.

511
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:31,280
Oh. Cold.

512
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:36,288
CIA emergency alert activated.

513
00:33:36,462 --> 00:33:38,623
Wow, that is surprisingly soothing.

514
00:33:42,335 --> 00:33:45,202
- Got the sugar.
- Oh, nice.

515
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:49,568
I'll take that.

516
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:55,073
Shouldn't your cell phone be ringing?

517
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:57,948
Huh? Right.

518
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,281
Huh. It's the hospital.

519
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:04,314
Hello?

520
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:09,258
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
Well, if you need us, we'll be right there.

521
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:10,759
What is it?

522
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:14,058
A bus accident on the 101.
They need all the hands they can get.

523
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:15,962
Oh, God.

524
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:19,399
I'm so sorry
that we have to take off like this.

525
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:22,507
It was a wonderful evening. You're so...

526
00:34:25,612 --> 00:34:27,978
- Go save some lives.
- Ha, ha. Okay.

527
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:29,405
Oh.

528
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:32,782
It was great to see you, Mom.

529
00:34:33,353 --> 00:34:35,082
Talk to you soon.

530
00:34:35,254 --> 00:34:36,744
- Okay.
- Okay.

531
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:39,915
Bye!

532
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:41,526
See you soon.

533
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,590
Such a sad end to a wonderful evening.

534
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:52,535
You had to go and alert the CIA,
didn't you?

535
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:57,204
Don't move.

536
00:34:57,543 --> 00:35:00,774
You do know that the nearest
tactical response team...

537
00:35:00,947 --> 00:35:02,608
is over 10 minutes away?

538
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:06,111
Until then...

539
00:35:06,285 --> 00:35:07,912
anything could happen.

540
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:10,248
Drop it, Sarah.

541
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:14,218
Mom, seriously?
You're betraying me again?

542
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:20,163
- No, stop.
- Alexei, we've had our dinner.

543
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,766
You've met the family.

544
00:35:22,301 --> 00:35:23,393
We're leaving.

545
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:28,472
But what kind of potential father-in-law
would I be if I didn't set an example?

546
00:35:28,975 --> 00:35:33,139
Chuck has to learn, you make a threat,
you follow through on it.

547
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:37,173
I didn't really have to do that...

548
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:40,350
but I just really like the sound.

549
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:41,679
Alexei, stop.

550
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:47,288
My love?

551
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,851
What are you doing?

552
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:53,430
This is exactly
why I didn't tell you about my family.

553
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,467
You don't know how to love someone.
You only know how to control them.

554
00:35:58,438 --> 00:35:59,962
But you should know...

555
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:04,303
that I could never love a man
who would do anything to hurt my son.

556
00:36:04,477 --> 00:36:06,308
So drop it.

557
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:16,448
Alexei, you know that I am loyal to you.

558
00:36:16,622 --> 00:36:18,783
But I will not return with you...

559
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:22,223
until you promise me
that my family and their friends...

560
00:36:22,395 --> 00:36:24,192
will remain safe.

561
00:36:24,464 --> 00:36:26,329
And if they don't...

562
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:29,794
I will end you.

563
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,477
You see?

564
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:42,470
That is a real threat.

565
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:56,657
Chuck, I'm sorry for everything.

566
00:36:57,497 --> 00:37:00,432
I hope someday you'll trust me.

567
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:03,660
Mom.

568
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,537
I already do.

569
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:28,988
Roger that, Mr. Volkoff.

570
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:32,683
Bad guys...

571
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:36,790
I surrender.

572
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,522
I surrender.

573
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,834
I surrender.

574
00:37:45,873 --> 00:37:47,135
Yippee-ki-yay...

575
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:52,940
Yippee-ki...

576
00:37:54,281 --> 00:37:55,612
- yay.

577
00:37:58,152 --> 00:37:59,551
Yippee-ki-yay.

578
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,846
Yip...

579
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,493
Okay.

580
00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:09,862
I surrender.

581
00:38:11,098 --> 00:38:12,292
You're free to go.

582
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,164
- What?
- What?

583
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,667
Volkoff's orders. We're out.

584
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:28,445
I'm unbelievable.

585
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,950
What should we do with these two?

586
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,852
What's going on?

587
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:44,293
You two have some sort of orgy in here
last night?

588
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:45,557
- I don't think...
- Yes.

589
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:51,701
Tell me you weren't planning on
selling these on eBay.

590
00:38:53,073 --> 00:38:57,635
That depends on
what you mean by "eBay."

591
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:02,215
Then you wouldn't have any problem
getting them out on the sales floor?

592
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:03,577
Let's say 10 minutes?

593
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:06,550
And get them fan stickers
off them boxes.

594
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,121
I wish I would've trusted my mom...

595
00:39:15,296 --> 00:39:18,060
instead of being so angry with her
the whole time...

596
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,666
and now she's gone.

597
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:23,393
She can't come back,
not until Volkoff is destroyed.

598
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,832
He knows too much.

599
00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:27,132
She's the only thing
keeping us safe right now.

600
00:39:29,777 --> 00:39:32,007
Hey, bro, can I talk to you for a minute?

601
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:33,510
Sure.

602
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,941
- Uh, hey, what's up?
- What were you thinking?

603
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,850
Not only are you spying again,
but you bring it back to our apartment?

604
00:39:43,023 --> 00:39:45,321
I had to lie to Ellie, and I hate lying.

605
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:48,928
I'm sorry, okay? I really am.
I was trying to protect my mom.

606
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:52,657
- Things went sideways...
- Stop, okay? Just stop. I don't wanna know.

607
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,324
I don't want this spy stuff
near Ellie ever again.

608
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:57,265
Never. Never ever again.

609
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:59,838
She doesn't want it near you either.
Understand?

610
00:40:00,007 --> 00:40:03,272
So, this conversation never took place.

611
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:11,984
- This is one of my father's laptops.
- He left it for Ellie.

612
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:15,981
It was broke and we fixed it.
There's something on it.

613
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:19,284
Brain scans, some memory problem
that Ellie figured out.

614
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:23,128
What...? What does it mean?

615
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:26,695
I don't wanna know.
And neither does Ellie.

616
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:28,858
But if you're spying again...

617
00:40:29,036 --> 00:40:30,435
maybe it can help you.

618
00:40:36,844 --> 00:40:38,402
Are you sure you wanna do this?

619
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,140
Look, I'm not even sure
what's on this thing, but if I'm right...

620
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,015
then yes.

621
00:40:45,185 --> 00:40:48,154
Well, let's get this over with.

622
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,223
"One or 11?"

623
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:02,262
What does that mean?

624
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,470
Well, it's the value of an ace
in blackjack...

625
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:11,842
but there's something
my dad used to say to me.

626
00:41:21,388 --> 00:41:22,650
Hm.

627
00:41:57,825 --> 00:41:59,315
Chuck?

628
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:01,289
I'm okay.

629
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:19,745
Guys, I know kung fu.

630
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,182
Again.
