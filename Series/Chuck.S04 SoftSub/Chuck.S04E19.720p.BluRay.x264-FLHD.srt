1
00:00:01,873 --> 00:00:04,034
I'm Chuck.
Here are things you need to know.

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:06,439
I'm putting together a team.
I want you to lead.

3
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:09,774
Your idea? Use my father's program
to make your own Intersects?

4
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:11,472
Vicki, no! Don't shoot!

5
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:16,646
You about to disarm a nuclear bomb
using fruit juice?

6
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:21,887
Agent Bartowski, you will oversee...

7
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:25,529
all aspects of the Intersect project
from here on out.

8
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:27,460
- Mrs. Woodcomb?
- Yes?

9
00:00:27,632 --> 00:00:29,998
I believe
that I have something of yours.

10
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:32,102
Great news.
I found my dad's computer.

11
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:40,042
Wow, Dad. Ha, ha.

12
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:46,951
- Still at it, babe?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:49,089
Did you get Clara down?

14
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:53,121
- Um, hon?
- What?

15
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:55,993
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:59,793
I'm so sleep-deprived.
I... I'm not tired at all, though.

17
00:00:59,968 --> 00:01:01,799
I feel totally awake, you know?

18
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,130
You're in the zone.

19
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:05,772
- How's it going?
- My dad's work is so amazing.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,704
I've never seen
such creative experimentation...

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,468
in neuroplasticity before.

22
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:13,773
His mind is incredible.

23
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:17,577
That's probably where Clara gets it.
She said "arthroscopic" yesterday.

24
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,922
Honey, if Clara can say "arthroscopic,"
she needs to stop pooping her pants.

25
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:27,727
You sure you should be digging around
in your dad's computer?

26
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:30,557
I mean, like you said,
what if it's dangerous?

27
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:31,858
Well, I don't know.

28
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:34,331
But I have never seen
anything like this before.

29
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:37,596
He was working on getting
the neural circuitry in the brain...

30
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:39,296
to reorganize itself.

31
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:43,638
- It's fascinating.
- Huh.

32
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,176
Don't worry, honey.

33
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:47,507
What's the worst that could happen?

34
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,691
Good morning, team.

35
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:10,667
As you know,
today begins the agency's new agenda:

36
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,396
Find Intersect candidates...

37
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:15,064
who are as similar
to Agent Bartowski as possible.

38
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:17,108
Thank you for joining us, director.

39
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:19,906
The Intersect clearly works better
in Chuck...

40
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:22,948
than in anyone
Director Bentley was able to find.

41
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:24,914
Ouch. So sorry.

42
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:32,893
Chuck, we need you to find more Chucks.

43
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:36,258
Well, it's gonna be tough.
You know, broke the mold, et cetera.

44
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:38,695
A reminder, you are all to provide support...

45
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:42,131
to Agent Bartowski
in any way he requires.

46
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:43,861
Chuck, you're in charge.

47
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,130
Thank you, general.

48
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:50,471
In charge. Man, oh, man, I'm moved here.

49
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:53,205
- I'm so proud of you.
- I appreciate the sentiment.

50
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:57,283
Not that big a deal. Although it seems
like it's been four years in the making.

51
00:02:57,452 --> 00:03:01,115
- Glad it hasn't gone to your head.
- Just saying, I may have saved the city...

52
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:03,450
disarming a nuclear bomb
using a juice box.

53
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:04,750
Yes, you did.

54
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:07,326
Be careful
because last time you were in charge...

55
00:03:07,528 --> 00:03:10,622
you led our party of D&D
adventurers to their fiery deaths.

56
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:13,995
Heh, heh. Ahem.
We've been over this, Morgan, okay?

57
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:16,602
If Tom had cast
the spell of confusion...

58
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:19,035
we would've been
out of that situation...

59
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:22,506
Neither here nor there. I wanna
address the elephant in the room...

60
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,304
which is "reporting to me."

61
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:29,340
Which can be a little weird or awkward
for some of you, uh...

62
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:32,350
- I think you're all very important.
- I hope you enjoy this.

63
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:36,483
I'll be back in charge as soon as you
and your stupid pocket protector...

64
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:38,056
screw it up.

65
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:41,662
Um, excuse me, pocket protectors
are not only very practical...

66
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,922
they are required Buy More attire, lady.

67
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,431
Okay. Well, using my own personality
as a guide...

68
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:51,129
I've created
an extensive psychological profile.

69
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:54,604
Langley culled their database for
matches and sent me four spies...

70
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,870
that are perfect candidates.
They're gonna be here in an hour.

71
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,344
Good Lord. Four more Chucks.

72
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,481
All right. First up is Lewis.

73
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:07,280
Tech-ops specialist,
star hacker by the age of 14.

74
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,447
His Warcraft Guild
took down Deathwing, World First.

75
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,354
- No.
- Yes.

76
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:13,858
And the coolest part?

77
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:15,359
Good afternoon.

78
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,792
He spent some time in England...

79
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,364
so he has a delightful English accent.

80
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:21,593
- Grr.
- Josie.

81
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,997
Psyops genius.

82
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:27,005
A real feeler and emoter with a scary
sense of intuition. Makes her great...

83
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:29,302
- ...in the interrogation room.
- Ah, I get it.

84
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,935
You had to get a girl to find someone
as feely as you. Heh, heh.

85
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:37,081
- Bogey. Get down.
- No, no, no.

86
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:39,151
Not a bogey. This is Damian.

87
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,912
Former Navy SEAL, Marksman award.

88
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:44,558
But because of his appearance,
he's been typecast by the agency.

89
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:48,183
Spent the last 10 years embedded
in one terrorist cell after another.

90
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:49,522
He's sick of the desert.

91
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:52,564
Kind of reminded me
of when I was stuck at the Buy More.

92
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:56,561
I think he could really shine
in an opportunity like this.

93
00:04:57,772 --> 00:05:00,332
And last but the opposite of least.

94
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:04,142
Wow.

95
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,403
Brody.

96
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:07,741
The Brodster.

97
00:05:07,915 --> 00:05:11,851
Nerdy, emotional,
into his family and friends...

98
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,953
disarmingly attractive.

99
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:17,891
Dear God, there's another one.

100
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,218
Okay. Let's get to work.

101
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:24,262
Casey,
you'll be handling physical testing.

102
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,760
Sarah, you'll handle
psychological evaluations.

103
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:32,633
You're in the field, you have a conflict
with your partner. What do you do?

104
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:35,970
You want me to say I'd talk about it
right away. What I'd really do...

105
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:38,805
is manipulate my partner
into doing what I want.

106
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,608
And, Morgan,
you're in charge of evaluating...

107
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:43,613
the candidates' cultural knowledge.

108
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,683
Quick. Rush's best album?

109
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,246
Ah. "Caress of Steel."

110
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:51,682
No. Next.

111
00:05:56,964 --> 00:06:00,764
I find that few conflicts come up
if everyone can just be civil.

112
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:03,096
Charlton Heston sci-fi question for you.

113
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:06,729
What's cooler?
Soylent Green or Omega Man?

114
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,001
Trick question. PotA.

115
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:10,337
Wow.

116
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,825
Bring Lewis an ice pack.

117
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:30,190
Favorite Bond. Connery excluded.

118
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:32,195
I have no opinion about any of this.

119
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:34,129
Why do men care about these things?

120
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:37,331
Nothing you're asking me
matters at all.

121
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:40,338
What on Earth is she talking about?

122
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:50,548
Talk about it right away,
for as long as it takes.

123
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,776
Nothing should ever wait
or be left unsaid.

124
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,787
Sometimes it's best to say things
two or three times even.

125
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,688
Most important graphic novelist.

126
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:01,350
Grant Morrison or Moore/Gibbons?

127
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:04,293
Kind of a Brian Vaughan man myself.

128
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,559
Actually,
I've always secretly felt that way.

129
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:15,641
So time to pick a new Intersect.

130
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,402
You ready, Chuck?

131
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:26,252
Ahem. Yes. Yes, I'm ready.

132
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,719
I was honestly feeling
kind of nervous earlier...

133
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,190
but I went upstairs,
got a little fresh air. Now I am ready.

134
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:39,190
I just feel bad for the others, you know?
I mean, we've really started...

135
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,665
to become friends.
I'm the cool boss.

136
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,930
Yes, you are incredibly cool.
Now, who are you going to choose?

137
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:50,568
Your vote? Just because I'm in charge
doesn't mean I don't value your opinion.

138
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:52,940
My opinion
is you're going to screw it up.

139
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,716
What is the...? Man, she hates me.

140
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:01,548
Well, you did steal her job.
You're her nemesis.

141
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:04,919
I hate being a nemesis.
Maybe I should take her out to coffee.

142
00:08:05,092 --> 00:08:06,582
- Yeah...
- Bentley is no joke.

143
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:08,922
Stop trying to befriend her.
Watch your back.

144
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:12,588
The only thing that's gonna make her
look worse is you succeeding...

145
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:16,760
where she and I couldn't.
Now, who is the new Intersect?

146
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:23,672
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

147
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:24,936
Any way you want it

148
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,477
Nice.

149
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:31,781
What are you doing?

150
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:47,265
Chuck 4x19 - Versus the Muuurder

151
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,468
Wow, really, is it Big BM Day?

152
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:25,235
That's the best kind of day there is.

153
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:27,898
Hand me some of them flyers,
and let's sell some TVs.

154
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:31,842
Sorry, Big Mike. Why are you wearing
the Big BM? I thought that we retired it?

155
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:35,540
It's for the new LED
flat-screen TV sale.

156
00:09:35,717 --> 00:09:38,584
The Large Mart has the same promotion
going on today.

157
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,681
Those bastards. They don't respect us.

158
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:45,384
The last five promotions that we've had,
Large Mart has had the same ones.

159
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,959
If we don't do something...

160
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,929
they are gonna hand us our head
in a handbasket just like always.

161
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,863
Don't know if that's the expression,
but let me tell you:

162
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:56,868
- You do not have to sell yourself like this.
- Say what?

163
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:59,768
Other men wear collared shirts all day...

164
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:02,910
while I get to wear
a great big BM on my chest.

165
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:05,242
That's job satisfaction.

166
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:07,242
- If you say so.
- You know, son...

167
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:10,213
as the leader of the Buy More,
you set the tone.

168
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:12,046
I know you got a lot going on here.

169
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,122
But remember,
the Buy More is a special place.

170
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:18,585
It can be fun here.

171
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,558
Okay, okay. You're right.
You know what?

172
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,392
Let's have fun, huh? All right.

173
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,801
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hurry!

174
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:35,033
Get off me!

175
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:38,241
- Hey!
- I got him. We got him.

176
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:42,309
Go, go, go!

177
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,322
Hey, gang.

178
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:56,926
Say, uh, has anyone seen Brody?

179
00:10:57,098 --> 00:10:59,089
- Hmm. No.
- No.

180
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,325
Haven't seen him.

181
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:02,961
Huh. All right.

182
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:07,708
- I guess Chuck has made his choice.
- Nobody ever picks me.

183
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:17,944
Hey, Devon. What's up?

184
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:21,145
I have bad news. Ellie has been working
on your dad's computer.

185
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:22,483
What?

186
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:25,956
That was supposed to be under lock
and key. How did she get it back?

187
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:30,223
She said some woman brought it over,
told her that the Buy More tech dudes...

188
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,127
gave it to her by mistake.

189
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,892
No, no, no.

190
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:39,301
Chuck, I would have told you sooner,
but I didn't think she'd find anything.

191
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:41,203
But, Chuck, she's making progress.

192
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:45,142
Okay, look, it is very important,
imperative even...

193
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,803
that we stop that work immediately.

194
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:48,677
You should see how happy she's been.

195
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:52,042
The work is making her feel
close to your dad again.

196
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:56,221
I'm stuck here for a bit...

197
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:58,689
so I need you to take care of this
right away.

198
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,057
Replace the hard drive
with a blank one when Ellie is not looking.

199
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,324
She'll think it just broke again.
I'll take care of the rest.

200
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,762
Bye.

201
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:11,802
Director Bentley?

202
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:14,703
Did you give the Orion computer
to my sister, Ellie?

203
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:16,605
- No.
- Well, I don't mean to offend...

204
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,178
but I don't believe you.
- Heh. You shouldn't.

205
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:20,538
I gave it to her.

206
00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:24,048
I knew it. I knew it, I knew it.
Okay. Maybe you were unaware...

207
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:27,746
that I feel very strongly about
keeping my sister away from the CIA.

208
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:31,359
Now that you know, I hope that
you respect it because I'm in charge.

209
00:12:31,526 --> 00:12:33,255
Problem is, I don't respect you.

210
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:37,728
Resent me all you want, this is
my project. I'm gonna tell Brody...

211
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:41,198
he's the new Intersect,
a choice I feel very confident will... Unh.

212
00:12:43,672 --> 00:12:45,902
- What the...? Unh.
- It's blood.

213
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:47,799
Ew.

214
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:49,666
And there's so much of it.

215
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:51,976
And it's coming from over there.

216
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,584
Well, there goes your first choice.

217
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:12,730
Dear Lord. There's been a murder!

218
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:18,672
So Large Mart claims
that this kidnapping is in retaliation.

219
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,776
But see, I know no one here
would break a two-year prank détente...

220
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:26,675
with the Large Mart
because I, as your leader, have forbid it.

221
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:30,079
Why? Because it's just that important.
But there you have it.

222
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:34,210
They claim we kidnapped Kevin Bacon.

223
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:37,247
What did you two do?

224
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:39,453
Huh.

225
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:44,163
You put Kevin Bacon in a closet.

226
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:50,131
- Really?
- Listen, we had to. Otherwise...

227
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:52,330
they would've dominated us,
like always.

228
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:54,771
- Yeah!
- Because, weirdly, an adorable pig...

229
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:58,674
attracts more customers than a man
wearing a big yellow and green BM.

230
00:13:58,847 --> 00:13:59,905
Call me crazy.

231
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:03,383
- Aw.
- Aw. That's so sweet.

232
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,542
I'm buying whatever he's selling.

233
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,221
I can't believe he's dead.

234
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,361
How could this happen on my watch?
Who would do this?

235
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:16,986
Nobody's been in Castle for a week
besides us, Bentley and the recruits.

236
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:19,459
That means the killer is still among us.

237
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:21,997
That's it.

238
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:25,128
Ah-ah.

239
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:29,173
Hmm.

240
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:31,676
And the one in your skivvies, mate.

241
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:38,513
D&D all over again.

242
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:41,814
Okay, you are still in charge,
you need to be calm and confident.

243
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,083
But remember,
we need to figure this out.

244
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:45,882
Right.

245
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:49,394
Calm, confident.

246
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:52,557
Okay. Okay.

247
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:56,329
Here's the situation, people.

248
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,563
Castle is officially in lockdown...

249
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,368
which means all cell phone use
is blocked.

250
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:03,943
We will be going over
the surveillance footage...

251
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,910
and interrogating
each and every one of you.

252
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:08,208
Casey, Sarah, sidebar.

253
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:12,217
- Looks like some are above suspicion.
- Why do they get to keep their weapons?

254
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:14,048
Yeah. Who the hell are they?

255
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:16,452
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.
Enough of that.

256
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,422
Casey here has been a part
of Team Bartowski, proudly...

257
00:15:19,594 --> 00:15:22,028
for years now.
Saved my life countless times.

258
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:25,894
Oh, I get it now.
You're the Intersect's brainless heavy.

259
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:29,935
Colonel Casey would never kill anyone.

260
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:32,198
Who didn't deserve it.

261
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:33,670
What about her?

262
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,140
Uh, I think I can safely say
that my fiancée here...

263
00:15:36,344 --> 00:15:39,313
would never kill anyone
who didn't deserve it.

264
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,882
- Your fiancée. Oh, now I see it.
- What is that supposed to mean?

265
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,885
You go back over there.

266
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:47,282
You come over here.

267
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,980
As I was saying,
it is not Casey nor is it Sarah.

268
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,126
Therefore, the killer must be one of you.

269
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:04,532
Right.
Let's blame the swarthy bearded guy.

270
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:09,903
I have friends who are terrorists.
This is just what my face looks like!

271
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:14,975
I didn't spend the last 10 years in a cave
for my country to have to deal with this.

272
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,242
I'm out of here.

273
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,850
Oh, and by the way...

274
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,111
I'm Greek.

275
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,352
Greek. I wouldn't have guessed that.
Wait!

276
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,185
Don't shoot anyone, Casey. Damian?

277
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:25,654
Wait, wait.

278
00:16:25,827 --> 00:16:29,820
Damian, halt. Please halt.
Not... Just... Now, please...

279
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:31,090
- I'm leaving.
- Damian.

280
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:34,633
Damian, no!

281
00:16:53,154 --> 00:16:54,587
Just get me out of here.

282
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:57,316
- He's losing a lot of blood.
- I need a doctor.

283
00:16:57,492 --> 00:17:00,052
I'm gonna grab some bandages.
Put pressure on the wound.

284
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,996
Everything is offline. We can't access
the surveillance videos...

285
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:10,035
and all communication channels
with CIA are dark.

286
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:15,034
Good job getting the emergency lights
back up.

287
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,838
That bomb was linked to three others.
Power grid is out.

288
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:20,810
The doors were already on lockdown,
we're without support.

289
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:23,177
We're trapped? This is not going well.

290
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:26,848
The most important thing about leadership
is to convince everybody...

291
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:30,320
you have everything under control.
- What if Casey was in charge?

292
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:33,585
- You could be in charge?
- Doesn't work like that. I had my shot.

293
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,251
Almost nuked the Inland Empire.

294
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,660
These people have been following you
for a week.

295
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:39,459
You're not in charge by accident.

296
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:42,034
You did disarm a nuclear bomb
using fruit juice.

297
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:44,671
You can do this.
We're right behind you.

298
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,830
Thanks. Okay.

299
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:49,704
Okay, okay. So here's the thing.

300
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:53,313
We are officially locked in now
with a killer...

301
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:56,143
but, not to worry,
I have everything under control.

302
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,614
I feel calm.

303
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,951
We're sitting here disarmed
and the meathead has all the guns.

304
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:08,391
Casey, listen, we need to swallow this.
What's important is to support Chuck...

305
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:10,996
and he needs to look like the boss.
- Fine.

306
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:15,460
I still don't trust an American operative
with a British accent.

307
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,070
Well, it's not my fault.

308
00:18:17,238 --> 00:18:18,671
It's from my semester abroad.

309
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:20,666
Wait, one semester?

310
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:23,370
You got an accent
from four months in England?

311
00:18:23,544 --> 00:18:26,775
Yeah, that's really annoying, dude.

312
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:28,912
It's not that bad.

313
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,184
I'd like to thank all of
the Large Mart representatives for coming.

314
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:34,878
I cannot apologize enough.

315
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:38,822
Just give us Kevin Bacon
and peace can be restored.

316
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:40,861
Fine. Fine.

317
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:43,891
I want my proof of life.

318
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:47,095
See, you have a certain human being
of ours...

319
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:49,361
and, uh, I'd like to speak with him.

320
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:58,342
Uh, you won't be able to track the signal,
so don't bother.

321
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,714
- Big Mike?
- Hello, son.

322
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:07,446
Thank God.
Big Mike, so good to hear your voice.

323
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:10,055
I can't go a whole day
without my number two.

324
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:12,089
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine.

325
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,751
Whatever you do,
don't give in to Large Mart's demands.

326
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:16,590
I'm gonna give in to their demands.

327
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:19,597
I gotta get you out of there.
Want me to call the police?

328
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,792
Uh, the police have no jurisdiction here.

329
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:25,427
This isn't anything
that can't be handled within the confines...

330
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:28,040
of the shopping center.
Anyway, I'm having a nice time.

331
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,734
They brought Subway
flatbread breakfast sandwiches.

332
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:34,814
- Steak, egg and cheese ones?
- With chipotle southwest sauce.

333
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:37,542
Reminds me of your mama. Muy caliente.

334
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,777
I've heard enough.

335
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,386
He has heard enough.

336
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:45,515
Okay. Marvin, here we are.
Take your pig and...

337
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,291
Is this some kind of joke?

338
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,465
Where is Kevin Bacon?

339
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:55,602
Don't... I don't know.

340
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,433
Okay, Marvin, you have my word,
I will get to the bottom of this.

341
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:03,338
But you need to give me till midnight
and I will find your pig.

342
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:06,947
Yeah, well, if you don't,
I can't promise your friend's safety.

343
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:08,275
But I promise you this:

344
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,446
A big, flaming BM on your doorstep.

345
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,083
Devon, I had a breakthrough.

346
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,319
What's going on?

347
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:23,964
I had an epiphany
between baby yoga and music.

348
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:27,832
I was trying to figure out
how my dad's research added up.

349
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:29,435
Then I thought about Clara...

350
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,095
and about how she's learning stuff
so fast.

351
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:35,938
My dad was trying to figure out a way
to input knowledge...

352
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,340
into the human brain
without having to learn it.

353
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:39,537
Wow.

354
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:41,944
Yeah. I mean,
think about the implications, Devon.

355
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:45,980
He left that knowledge for me
for a reason and I figured it out, but why?

356
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,256
I just... I don't know
what he wanted me to do with it.

357
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:55,862
I just wish... I wish he was here.

358
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,558
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

359
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:02,463
We do.

360
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:18,685
So, director, the way I see it,
you've got more motive than anyone.

361
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:22,016
You hate that I'm in charge,
you want my program to fail...

362
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,920
and you've said
very mean things to me all day.

363
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:28,391
- I would never do anything like this.
- Oh, wouldn't you?

364
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:32,158
You've already gone after my sister,
so you're willing to do anything...

365
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,359
to benefit your own project,
including murder.

366
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,271
You're the only one who knew
Brody was my first choice.

367
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:41,340
Brody made you light up
like a 13-year-old girl.

368
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,239
Everyone knew
he was your first choice.

369
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:46,243
Heh, what...?

370
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:47,706
Really?

371
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:49,873
I don't know what else
you want me to say.

372
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,211
I didn't do it.

373
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:54,751
I'm not buying this weepy thing.
Doesn't fit your profile.

374
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:57,555
You're not the only one who's trained
in psyops.

375
00:21:57,725 --> 00:21:59,625
You've been hiding something from us.

376
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,419
And you've been highly emotional.

377
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:03,858
For your information...

378
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,364
I'm emotional because I got dumped
last week by my boyfriend...

379
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:11,471
for being too emotional.

380
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:20,313
Look, I don't do too well
with girls and crying.

381
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:22,711
Maybe we should be a little easier on her.

382
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:26,149
She's trained to do this, Chuck.
Do not let her manipulate you.

383
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,287
Okay, fine, I won't. I won't.

384
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,449
Aah! This is torture.

385
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:35,289
- You're torturing me!
- We're not torturing you.

386
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:36,487
No torture going on here!

387
00:22:36,664 --> 00:22:38,962
Although there is no clear definition.

388
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,301
- Sarah.
- Ugh.

389
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:43,460
We're gonna get you painkillers...

390
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:47,005
but first, you're gonna answer
a few more questions. For example...

391
00:22:47,174 --> 00:22:49,142
why is your bag covered in sand,
huh?

392
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,938
A great way to throw off
our x-ray equipment.

393
00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:53,171
Mighty convenient.

394
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:56,839
Or it's because everything I have
is covered in sand.

395
00:22:57,018 --> 00:22:58,986
Because the CIA won't send me
anywhere...

396
00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:01,144
where there isn't any sand.

397
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,327
Old school. I like it.

398
00:23:08,496 --> 00:23:10,020
It doesn't even work.

399
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:12,455
Because there's sand in it.

400
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:14,032
Oh, God.

401
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:16,999
Lewis. My tech guy.

402
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:21,102
And, suspiciously,
an elite bomb specialist.

403
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:24,972
You knew I had high hopes for you.
Maybe that was your motivation.

404
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:28,206
You knew Brody was my first choice
and that you were my second.

405
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,816
I didn't know that,
but thanks for not choosing me.

406
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:33,813
You didn't? You didn't know that.

407
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:36,149
Oh, lookie what we have here.

408
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:38,549
Sharp.

409
00:23:38,726 --> 00:23:40,216
Can you explain this?

410
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:42,195
Uh, it's my knife.

411
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:47,858
Yes. But why do you have a knife
used by an IRA bomb maker in your bag?

412
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:51,994
Because I killed an IRA bomb maker
and I took it from him.

413
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:56,541
Walker, Bartowski.
You figure out who the killer is yet?

414
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:58,645
No luck. It could be any one of them.

415
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:02,806
All we know is that whoever the killer is,
they were sitting in that chair.

416
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:06,850
Well, I'm not even sure
that we know that much.

417
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:11,584
Actually, I'm pretty certain...

418
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,489
as there's a bomb
strapped to the bottom of the chair.

419
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,220
We gotta go right now!

420
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,037
Did you feel that?

421
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:33,112
I haven't felt anything for years.

422
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:41,555
What's happening?

423
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:44,122
My ears are ringing, can't hear anything.

424
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,349
Are you okay?

425
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:48,126
Yeah.

426
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,593
Walker, glad you're still you alive.

427
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:54,064
I'm good too. Thanks, buddy.

428
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,631
Damian caught another piece of shrapnel
in the back.

429
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:01,070
Oh, my God.
We gotta get him to a doctor.

430
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:03,540
We will. Unless we die here.

431
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,076
Then he'll have to wait.

432
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,869
Everyone is here except Lewis.

433
00:25:07,648 --> 00:25:10,139
Of course. The bomb expert.

434
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:13,150
He must have set off the bomb
so he could get away. Which means...

435
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,480
Lewis is the killer.

436
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:16,213
Seriously?

437
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,324
He was my second choice.

438
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:24,123
This is not just our BM
we're talking about here.

439
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:26,823
This is our Big Mike, okay?

440
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:29,196
He's in real danger here, fellas.
Real danger.

441
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,964
Think about it. What if these men
were to take his sandwiches. Hmm?

442
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,199
He is not built for that.

443
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,377
So I have to ask you one more time,
okay?

444
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:40,036
Where is Kevin Bacon?

445
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,142
Don't know what to say, my friend.
It's, uh... It's a mystery.

446
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,788
It's an unsolvable mystery.

447
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:52,050
It is not a mystery!
In fact, it is obvious what has happened.

448
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:56,663
You stole Kevin Bacon,
and, therefore, you two hid him. Hmm?

449
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:00,030
Or...

450
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:03,298
did we?

451
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:15,872
Okay, Damian is unconscious,
but he's still alive. For now.

452
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:23,387
The good news
is we can trust each other again.

453
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:26,420
Lewis clearly planted the bombs
and killed Brody...

454
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:29,154
who probably caught him
in the process.

455
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,388
Brody.

456
00:26:36,504 --> 00:26:39,735
We need all hands on deck.
Lewis is in Castle with nowhere to go.

457
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:43,070
Guy can build a bomb out of anything.
Watch for tripwires, booby traps.

458
00:26:43,244 --> 00:26:46,338
Yeah, also, remember, it's important
that we capture this guy alive.

459
00:26:46,514 --> 00:26:49,745
We need to find out who he's working for,
why he would try to sabotage Castle.

460
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:53,114
We're just gonna stand around
and talk about it, leader?

461
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:57,724
No. I'm gonna find Lewis
and I'm gonna take that bastard down.

462
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:07,530
Listen, director, I just want to apologize
for accusing you of murder.

463
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:10,693
If you promise to stay away
from my sister, we can get past it.

464
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:13,704
- Maybe even become friends.
- You know what your problem is?

465
00:27:13,874 --> 00:27:17,002
You want people to like you.
A good leader shouldn't care about that.

466
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,543
Sector 2, clear.

467
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:21,738
You don't understand,
six years we were together.

468
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:25,044
I mean, how did you get
the Intersect to commit?

469
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:27,312
Sector 1, clear.

470
00:27:27,888 --> 00:27:29,412
Clearly, you feel that way.

471
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,957
As you haven't made even the slightest
of attempts to be liked.

472
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:34,617
That's not important to me.

473
00:27:34,795 --> 00:27:36,763
Not even a little? Are you made of stone?

474
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:39,559
Shh. Did you hear that?

475
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,436
I hear movement in the ducts.

476
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:50,777
Yeah, I hear it too, Chuck. It's Lewis.

477
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,339
I lost him. Casey...

478
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,607
you got anything?

479
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:03,651
I'm right underneath him.

480
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:10,387
Freeze, limey,
if you wanna keep your boys.

481
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:19,997
What the hell?

482
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:21,466
What is it?

483
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:26,472
It's a pig.

484
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,350
A pig?

485
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,452
You hid Kevin Bacon in the air ducts.

486
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,822
If you love something, let it go.

487
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:43,725
And if it comes back, you can eat it.

488
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:48,094
He lives by a strange philosophy
of karma and diet.

489
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,662
He combines the two.
But it works for him.

490
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:55,740
- A pig? Did he really just say...?
- That means Lewis is still out there.

491
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,037
- And all I've got is you.
- Where are you going?

492
00:28:58,212 --> 00:28:59,736
I'm going to the Intersect room.

493
00:28:59,914 --> 00:29:02,007
It's bombproof.
The safest place in Castle.

494
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:05,481
Don't you... You...

495
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,153
Director! Stop! I command you!

496
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,318
Hey, hey. I don't wanna pull rank here,
but you can't just walk away like that.

497
00:29:16,497 --> 00:29:19,796
Ooh. You don't wanna pull rank
because I may not like you?

498
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:26,432
- What is that?
- That is none of your concern.

499
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:28,837
That is absolutely my concern.
It's my father's research.

500
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:31,569
- It's a matter of national security.
- My sister using the...

501
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:35,841
- You're putting my family in danger.
- I am saving my project from you.

502
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:40,546
Do you see him?

503
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,547
I see him.

504
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:50,563
We got you, Lewis.
There's nowhere left to go.

505
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:07,973
Well, I think we can safely say
that Lewis is not the killer.

506
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,047
Brilliant deduction, Sherlock.

507
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,621
It was bad.
I mean, I've seen bad, but this was grisly.

508
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:17,780
That means the killer is still out there.

509
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:20,324
Just the ladies. Figures.

510
00:30:20,494 --> 00:30:23,088
All right. Let's finish this.

511
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:26,926
- It's not me, so that leaves you.
- My sentiments exactly.

512
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:29,592
Everybody shut up.
Put your weapons down.

513
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,101
Unless it's one of them.

514
00:30:31,638 --> 00:30:33,731
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Drop your guns.

515
00:30:33,907 --> 00:30:35,135
You drop your guns.

516
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:37,937
- I want this to be over.
- This is a mess.

517
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,740
Okay, leader, what you got?

518
00:30:40,914 --> 00:30:42,745
Who's the killer?

519
00:30:50,424 --> 00:30:51,789
There's been a murder!

520
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:03,027
- I know who did it.
- What?

521
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,537
First, I thought Brody's killer
had to be Lewis.

522
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,335
My second choice
would wanna kill my first choice.

523
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:13,639
So I'm not your first or second choice.
That's good to know.

524
00:31:13,814 --> 00:31:15,941
No, no, no. Look, I loved all of you guys.

525
00:31:16,116 --> 00:31:19,176
It's just that there can only be
one number one...

526
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:20,544
and one number two.

527
00:31:21,021 --> 00:31:23,717
They're both dead now.
If it makes you feel any better...

528
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:26,792
I did suspect you of being the killer
for a little while.

529
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,326
Mainly because of your volatile
emotional state.

530
00:31:31,965 --> 00:31:33,193
Sorry.

531
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,627
But you're not a murderer.

532
00:31:36,036 --> 00:31:39,563
Going through your things, I found
the pregnancy stick. You're expecting.

533
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,968
Congratulations.
I hope you're blessed with a boy.

534
00:31:42,643 --> 00:31:44,975
Ahem. Which brings me
to where my suspicions...

535
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:47,045
have been pointing the entire time.

536
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:48,511
You must be joking.

537
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,550
Only one person was unaccounted for
during Brody's and Lewis' murders.

538
00:31:57,858 --> 00:32:00,292
My opinion
is you're going to screw it up.

539
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,328
And who has unique access
to Castle's infrastructure.

540
00:32:11,672 --> 00:32:12,900
I'd be very careful.

541
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:18,472
- I know it isn't you.
- What?

542
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,012
She had ample opportunity to kill me
and she didn't take it, okay?

543
00:32:22,182 --> 00:32:24,514
I just wanted everyone on this side
of the room...

544
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:27,313
so I could quietly tell you
it's Damian.

545
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:31,247
He's the killer
and he's probably armed.

546
00:32:35,796 --> 00:32:38,287
- Let's do it.
- I'll flank him on the left.

547
00:32:38,465 --> 00:32:42,162
- I got your right.
- I got your back, Chuck.

548
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:44,634
How about we go with plan B, Chuck?

549
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:53,270
You're gonna let me out of here.

550
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:55,847
You're gonna get me to a doctor.

551
00:32:58,952 --> 00:33:00,351
Or I'm gonna blow us all up.

552
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,752
The boom box? Really?
Actually, I should have expected that.

553
00:33:03,924 --> 00:33:06,825
Be rational. You wanna get out of here
just as much as we do.

554
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:10,157
How do you know what I want?
I wasn't even one of your choices.

555
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:15,065
Because you don't wanna die.
You've wanted out of here all along.

556
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:21,372
Brody caught you
planting the explosives in Castle.

557
00:33:21,642 --> 00:33:22,734
What are you doing?

558
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,674
That's why you killed him.
You had to cover your tracks.

559
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:29,305
But when we locked down...

560
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:32,680
it was only a matter of time
before we knew you were the killer.

561
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,753
That's when you really committed.
By blowing yourself up.

562
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:41,424
Knowing where the explosives
were placed...

563
00:33:41,595 --> 00:33:44,029
you used the door to shield yourself.

564
00:33:44,198 --> 00:33:45,927
Bold move.

565
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,157
I had no choice.

566
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:49,063
The bombs locked the doors.

567
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,260
You tried a new method.

568
00:33:50,437 --> 00:33:53,031
Thinking if we had a killer in mind,
we'd get you out.

569
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,303
So you planted a bomb under your chair
during your interrogation.

570
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,939
Aah! This is torture.

571
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,543
You're torturing me!

572
00:34:02,716 --> 00:34:06,277
When the bomb went off, you used
the chaos as cover to kill and hide Lewis.

573
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,050
But unfortunately for you,
we found him.

574
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:11,555
Now we know what happened,
but we don't know why.

575
00:34:11,725 --> 00:34:15,286
Who are you working for, Damian?
What are they after?

576
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,188
I came here for you, Chuck.

577
00:34:23,737 --> 00:34:26,672
Now, you're gonna get me out of here.

578
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,139
Chuck, you know what you have to do.

579
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:33,074
We can't let you leave. You know that.

580
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:35,742
So just put the bomb down.

581
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,246
No, thanks.

582
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:38,713
It's your choice, boss.

583
00:34:50,664 --> 00:34:53,997
- Sarah, the bomb has been activated.
- It's okay, you can do this.

584
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:57,068
Normally, yes, but not this fast.
So many security measures.

585
00:34:57,237 --> 00:35:00,866
- I can't defuse it in that amount of time.
- Chuck, keep everybody away...

586
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:03,032
from the Intersect room.
- No. Bentley!

587
00:35:03,543 --> 00:35:05,033
Bentley! What are you doing?

588
00:35:05,545 --> 00:35:08,241
Intersect room is the only room
that can contain this.

589
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:11,282
- The power is out, the doors won't shut.
- There's a manual release.

590
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,476
No, no. There's gotta be another way.

591
00:35:14,855 --> 00:35:17,790
This is what a leader does.

592
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:23,553
Hey.

593
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:45,479
I hot-wired the control panel
using my pocket protector...

594
00:35:45,652 --> 00:35:47,552
thank you very much.

595
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:49,780
- Come on, we don't have time.
- Let's go. Go.

596
00:36:10,143 --> 00:36:11,610
Holy.

597
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:23,250
Congratulations
on solving the murder mystery...

598
00:36:23,423 --> 00:36:25,015
and saving Castle from destruction.

599
00:36:25,192 --> 00:36:27,319
And a special commendation to you,
Chuck.

600
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:28,859
You are a true leader.

601
00:36:29,029 --> 00:36:30,326
Thank you, general.

602
00:36:30,497 --> 00:36:32,988
But I'm only as strong as the team
that surrounds me.

603
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:37,364
And, as always, Sarah and Casey
were my eyes, ears and more today.

604
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:40,870
I'm glad you feel that way.
This is the team we're sticking with.

605
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,406
Following the breach...

606
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:46,239
it has been deemed too dangerous
to put the Intersect into a new recruit.

607
00:36:46,446 --> 00:36:50,746
At least for the foreseeable future,
you are to remain the only Intersect.

608
00:36:50,951 --> 00:36:55,012
Director Bentley, you will await
reassignment in Washington.

609
00:36:55,188 --> 00:36:58,214
General,
if I could just add something quickly.

610
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:01,051
Director Bentley was invaluable today.

611
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:02,927
Noted.

612
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,064
Well done, team.

613
00:37:08,502 --> 00:37:10,402
So this is it, huh?

614
00:37:11,538 --> 00:37:13,529
You're a good spy, Chuck Bartowski.

615
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:16,535
I'm sorry for underestimating you.

616
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,200
Thank you.

617
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:20,776
It's good
to not have a nemesis anymore.

618
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,745
You know...

619
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:28,585
your sister is incredibly smart.

620
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:31,383
If anybody can figure out the Intersect,
it's her.

621
00:37:31,558 --> 00:37:34,994
You might wanna reconsider
keeping her away from her path.

622
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,224
Enough is enough.

623
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,363
We are not gonna let Big Mike...

624
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:44,128
- ...just sit there and rot.
- No!

625
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,704
Who knows what those heathens
could be doing to him.

626
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:49,637
I tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna break him out.

627
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,506
- Yeah!
- Look. He's alive.

628
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:19,232
Hey, how did you get free?

629
00:38:19,406 --> 00:38:21,840
Easy. They had a couple of nerds
watching me.

630
00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:24,743
My shift was over. I ain't staying late.

631
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:26,902
- Yeah!
- I'm glad you're okay.

632
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,877
We're glad. We're glad you're okay.

633
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:30,950
Okay.

634
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:41,757
Large Mart rules!

635
00:38:42,662 --> 00:38:43,754
Our BM.

636
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,457
It's okay, son.

637
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:49,295
It was worth it
to have some Large Mart fun again.

638
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:51,368
We can make another BM.

639
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:53,766
- Yeah.
- All right.

640
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:58,269
Hey, is this the Large Mart pig?

641
00:38:58,445 --> 00:39:00,174
Yeah, of course it is.

642
00:39:00,981 --> 00:39:02,039
Oh, hey.

643
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,446
Let me guess. Jeff and Lester stole
the porcine victim...

644
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:09,180
Large Mart snatched Big Mike,
he was able to liberate himself...

645
00:39:09,356 --> 00:39:12,655
but they still torched the Big BM
on your doorstep.

646
00:39:12,826 --> 00:39:14,657
Yeah, you left out, uh...

647
00:39:14,828 --> 00:39:16,455
- Nothing. Right.
- Figured as much.

648
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,825
Yeah, pretty much.
What happened to you?

649
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:20,864
- It's been a long day.
- Yeah.

650
00:39:21,034 --> 00:39:23,434
Let's just leave it at that. Here you go.
Here's Kevin Bacon.

651
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:26,465
- Oh, come on, buddy. Come on.
- Hey. Ha, ha.

652
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,838
- He also ate a lot, so just...
- Oh. No, no, it's good. I can kind of...

653
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:34,906
Oh, God. Oh, no. No.

654
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,480
I'll, uh... I'll be right in.

655
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,620
Hey.

656
00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:54,596
- Hey.
- So I took care of things on my end.

657
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,999
Ellie won't be bothered again.
How's everything going here?

658
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:00,135
It's done.

659
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:03,839
- The computer is taken care of?
- Kaput.

660
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,408
It's for the best.

661
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,548
Right?

662
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:20,549
Totally. Yeah.

663
00:40:32,872 --> 00:40:36,706
So we're still not telling Chuck, right?

664
00:40:36,876 --> 00:40:40,209
No. We don't want him to worry.

665
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:45,179
Well, guys...

666
00:40:45,552 --> 00:40:48,988
I wanna apologize for all the grief
you had to swallow to support me.

667
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:51,316
- That's not necessary.
- I think it is, though.

668
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,688
I would've fallen apart today
if it weren't for the two of you.

669
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:58,121
It's not just the computer or the man.

670
00:40:58,298 --> 00:41:02,428
The Intersect is all of us,
it's the three of us working together.

671
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:03,997
That's why it works.

672
00:41:05,939 --> 00:41:07,463
Don't ever forget that.

673
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:11,942
You're all here. I wanted to get
in touch with you right away.

674
00:41:12,112 --> 00:41:15,240
We've interrogated Damian.
He wasn't trying to obtain the Intersect.

675
00:41:15,415 --> 00:41:17,679
He was simply hired to bomb Castle.

676
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,614
Figured out who he was working for?

677
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:22,152
It turns out Damian was wired
$10 million...

678
00:41:22,322 --> 00:41:24,153
by none other than Vivian Volkoff.

679
00:41:24,324 --> 00:41:27,760
It appears she's going
after the man who took down her father.

680
00:41:27,927 --> 00:41:30,760
Wait, wait, wait.
Vivian Volkoff is trying to kill me?

681
00:41:31,164 --> 00:41:34,258
Your team will be contacted
should any more information surface.

682
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:38,131
For now, remain on high alert.

683
00:41:42,308 --> 00:41:44,105
I'm someone's nemesis?

684
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:47,005
For real this time.
