1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,129
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a
few things you need to know.

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:08,331
I'm going undercover into Volkoff
Industries. I'm gonna take them down.

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:12,308
Hydra is the heart
of Volkoff Industries. But it has a flaw.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,243
- So you destroyed the system?
- Of course not.

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,851
I just downloaded all the data
to a more secure backup location.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,317
All I want you to do
is to kill John Casey.

7
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:24,116
Throw me out the window.
There's a platform down there.

8
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,758
- Give this to Chuck.
- Huh?

9
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,867
Dr. Resh to Labor and Delivery.

10
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,209
- Hey, what'd he say?
- John's in good hands.

11
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,938
His doctor is a friend. Thinks he'll regain
consciousness in a day or two.

12
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,172
Thank you.

13
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,874
Casey's family.
Chuck and I do anything for family.

14
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,250
- Thanks for coming by, EI.
- Of course.

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,314
Thanks.

16
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,390
Hey, he is the strongest man
I've ever met, okay?

17
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,995
He'll pull through.

18
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,332
- You guys hear that?
- I think I did.

19
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,366
I don't know. Did I?

20
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,206
- A grunt. That is a Casey grunt.
- I think he's trying to say something.

21
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,142
- What do you got? Go ahead.
- Pants.

22
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,638
Pants. Pants. He said "pants."

23
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,481
That means...

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,844
Why pants?

25
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,986
The man's never gonna wear
pants again.

26
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,644
He means his pants.
Maybe there's something in them.

27
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,792
- That's... Yeah.
- Yeah. Good observation. Way to...

28
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,825
Got it. Here it is.
It's, uh, like, a half an eye.

29
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,432
That's half an eyeball.
What is he doing with that?

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,211
Casey, where did you get this?
Where did you get this eye?

31
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,712
Sarah.

32
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,108
Sarah.

33
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,814
What'd he say?

34
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,251
He said Sarah.

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,040
Volkoff's security is down.
We have exactly two minutes.

36
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,913
Let's hope this tells us where
he downloaded the Hydra network to.

37
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:48,959
You should answer it.

38
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,244
Hello, Alexei.

39
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,645
Frost, it's me.

40
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,378
Yes, I know, I can see you.

41
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,687
It's really dark there. Where are you?

42
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,366
Awful.
Andre wasn't working out in Budapest...

43
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,662
so I had to let him go
off a 30-story building.

44
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,930
Twenty seconds.

45
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,040
Oh, that's just awful.

46
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,705
- Well, I really should be going.
- All right.

47
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:35,871
Sweet dreams, my sweet little pea. Mwah.

48
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,449
Good night, darling.

49
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,825
Did you find its location?

50
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:52,055
Looks like Volkoff is entrusting the Hydra
to another person.

51
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,392
The Contessa.

52
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,693
We received a message from Agent Walker.

53
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,666
Seems she'll be in the field
a while longer.

54
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:02,501
She's learned that Volkoff is planning to
transfer the Hydra network to the Contessa.

55
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,734
What about the piece of Hydra
I flashed on?

56
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:08,846
Eimacher designed Yuri's eye. There's a
good chance he designed for the Contessa.

57
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,176
General, there's got to be
another way, okay?

58
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,752
Sarah pushed Casey out a window.
This ends now. She needs to come home.

59
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,082
As I said before, my superiors
will follow up on Eimacher...

60
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,159
and the rest of the information
in the Hydra fragment.

61
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,160
I'm sorry, but you're too close to this,
Agent Bartowski.

62
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,855
- Okay, fine. What am I supposed to do?
- You wait.

63
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,524
That's all you can do.

64
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,729
Okay. Hey. It'll be all right, buddy.

65
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,535
We'll go outside, get some fresh air.
We'll play bocce.

66
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,233
No.

67
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,976
No, Morgan, I can't do this anymore.

68
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,072
I watched my mom leave us
and my dad follow her.

69
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,344
I let Sarah go and now Casey,
and the whole time, I did nothing.

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,683
Nothing, while one man took everything
away from me.

71
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,521
Ellie's right.
Bartowskis take care of their family...

72
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:59,131
and right now, it's time I put mine
back together again.

73
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:03,927
This was my father's mission. I have to
finish it. We're gonna take down Volkoff.

74
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,902
We? Really? You were kind of talking
in the first person.

75
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,702
And I'm not usually invited on these
climactic missions. So I'm in, though.

76
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,869
- I mean, which guns do we grab?
- No guns.

77
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,811
- We need...
- Office supplies?

78
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,645
No, Morgan. We need a plan.

79
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,668
- This is gonna work.
- Yeah, it is.

80
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,569
- Course it is. It's a good plan.
- Thanks.

81
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,678
I've been doing a lot of yoga, so I feel
I'm peaking mentally and physically...

82
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,177
so no problems there.

83
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,744
You think this is what they call
a, uh, suicide mission?

84
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,442
What? No, of course not.

85
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,750
Look, the first step is, we find the guy
who designed Hydra, Roni Eimacher.

86
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,456
And, Morgan, this is going to work.

87
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,029
I promise.

88
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,632
Heh. Of course.

89
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,197
Oh, man. We're gonna need some help.

90
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,627
Get someone up here immediately.
We've got a problem with the...

91
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,339
What the hell is going on?

92
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,014
Who's doing this?

93
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,750
My God.

94
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,154
He's still alive.

95
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:18,621
Chuck 4x13 - Versus the Push Mix

96
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:53,935
Armand.

97
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:57,844
We have a problem.

98
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:00,845
In the form of Stephen Bartowski.

99
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:02,916
Orion was killed by The Ring.

100
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:07,453
Well, then somehow a dead man broke
into my computer system last night.

101
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:10,716
He wants something very dear to me.

102
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,383
I'm gonna take Frost to a safer place.

103
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:21,435
I want you to figure out where
Orion has been hiding all these years.

104
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:27,302
- Where can I find you?
- I'll be visiting an old friend.

105
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:29,466
The Contessa.

106
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,320
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

107
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:43,787
Thanks for meeting me here.
I appreciate that. Hold on one second.

108
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:46,556
Out and boom.

109
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:48,958
Push mix for Ellie.
What the doctor ordered.

110
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,566
Oh, thanks, bro. I know you're busy,
it's just, Ellie hates my music.

111
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:54,133
But Rusted Root's rad, right?

112
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:58,095
Yeah, yeah, they're radical.
Awesome. Good.

113
00:08:58,273 --> 00:09:00,070
- Happy to help.
- The plan is in place.

114
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:03,472
No deep terror can eat away at me
from the inside now.

115
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:06,010
Deep terror?

116
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,642
- I say "deep terror"?
- You said "deep terror."

117
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:09,841
Huh.

118
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:13,476
I gotta run. I gotta find someone to
make Ellie's placenta into vitamin pills.

119
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:15,953
Aah! I have to unhear that.
How do I unhear that?

120
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:18,922
I don't know how to unhear... Um...

121
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:21,928
One more thing, really quick.

122
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,422
I'm gonna be gone for a little while,
so I took the liberty...

123
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,933
of setting up some protection
for you and Ellie through the CIA.

124
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:30,969
- Protection?
- Just in case.

125
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,337
But promise me, if anything comes up,
you call that number...

126
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,707
an undercover team will show up
and they will take you anywhere.

127
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,882
- Well, thanks for everything, Chuck.
- Yeah.

128
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,518
Pardon me, Jeff.

129
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:03,165
I bet you Bartowski put a bunch
of indie crap on this push mix.

130
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:05,203
It's like, "We get it, you're cool."

131
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:07,170
He has no respect for the unborn.

132
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:10,675
The first sounds that a child hears
should not be from an audio disc.

133
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:14,508
- What's the matter with these people?
- They should be raw, unfiltered, live.

134
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:19,917
This baby needs a performance.
Delivery-room style.

135
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:23,216
This baby needs...

136
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:24,650
Jeffster.

137
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:29,986
So I tracked Eimacher through
his online "Settlers of Catan" league.

138
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:31,427
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

139
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:35,763
Turns out, he is a engineering
professor at UC Irvine.

140
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,301
Great. This'll be easy.

141
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:40,100
I've done a thousand missions like this.
Quick snatch and grab.

142
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:43,574
Where are you gonna take this guy?
We can't take him to Castle.

143
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:46,043
Beckman told us to back off.

144
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:48,614
I actually don't think we need Castle.

145
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,615
Oh, my God, where am I?

146
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:57,920
- Is this a bathroom?
- No, this is hell.

147
00:10:58,226 --> 00:11:00,751
Listen, you're gonna
tell us who the Contessa is.

148
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:03,625
The Contessa?
I have no idea who you're talking about.

149
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:06,528
Do not play games with us,
Roni Eimacher.

150
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:09,904
Roni Eimacher?
My name's Barry Greenfield.

151
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:13,063
Barry Green... Oops.

152
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:20,214
If you'll excuse us
for just a moment, Mr. Greenfield.

153
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:25,613
That is not Roni Eimacher.

154
00:11:25,787 --> 00:11:27,049
I know it's not Roni Eimacher...

155
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:29,747
but you gotta admit,
it looks a lot like him.

156
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:32,290
Okay, all right. Fine, fine.
What are we gonna do?

157
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,451
I'm gonna tranq him
and just put him back.

158
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,462
Perfect. Wait a minute.
He's seen half of our faces, Chuck.

159
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:39,964
- Doesn't that mean we have to, uh, khh?
- Are you crazy?

160
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:43,730
We just have to find the real Eimacher.
And this time, bring the picture.

161
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:51,670
Please don't hurt me,
I'm just an engineer. Wait.

162
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:54,581
- Am I in a bathroom?
- What? No. Jeez.

163
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:58,014
No, it's hell.
I mean, it's clearly hell, is it not?

164
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,983
We went through all this... It's hell.

165
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:01,986
You designed the glass eye...

166
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:04,318
that Alexei Volkoff
stored his Hydra network on.

167
00:12:04,492 --> 00:12:08,758
You are in trouble. Volkoff kidnapped me,
forced me to create the Hydra device.

168
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,592
He said he'd kill everyone I know
if I didn't do it.

169
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:14,826
- What'd he say?
- So you've never met the Contessa?

170
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:18,700
The Contessa? No, that's where
he took me to design the Hydra.

171
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:21,575
What does that mean?

172
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:25,141
The Contessa's not a person, it's a...

173
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:43,860
Welcome to the Contessa.
What do you think?

174
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:47,297
- Beautiful.
- Yeah, I love her.

175
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:50,528
I bought the old girl years ago,
on Craigslist Dubai.

176
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:53,970
She's got anti-aircraft missiles,
sonar stealth technology...

177
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:55,939
and an old-fashioned
ice cream parlor.

178
00:12:57,312 --> 00:13:00,713
I like to think of her
as my floating fortress of fun.

179
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:03,749
Captain, good to see you.

180
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:08,352
The Hydra network must be on this ship
somewhere. This is our chance.

181
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:11,651
But Volkoff brought us here
because he's nervous about something.

182
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:14,761
He wants to stay mobile.
We have to go for the Hydra tonight.

183
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,757
And nothing can get in our way.

184
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,628
Let's do this.

185
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:27,532
I told you to take the flippers off.

186
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:34,840
We're in.

187
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:39,478
Okay.

188
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:42,647
We gotta get to the lower decks.

189
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:44,519
That's where Eimacher said
the server was.

190
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:49,553
Hey, what's going on, buddy?
We gotta go.

191
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:53,189
You never told me you were gonna wear
something underneath that wetsuit.

192
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:55,836
Morgan, you're not wearing any clothes
under there?

193
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:57,767
Underwear. I'm wearing underwear.

194
00:13:57,972 --> 00:14:01,169
I mean, how do you even fit anything
else there? Where does it go?

195
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,674
It doesn't matter. I'm cool like this.

196
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:05,870
I look like a seal. A seal that does yoga.

197
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:07,207
- Yeah.
- Yoga seal.

198
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:11,011
- Yoga seal. All right, just don't squeak.
- Okay.

199
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:20,552
We're as close as we're ever gonna get.

200
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:25,063
Tonight, whether or not
we find the Hydra, you're going home.

201
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:26,427
What do you mean?

202
00:14:26,768 --> 00:14:29,236
I promised Chuck
I wouldn't come home without you.

203
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:31,872
Yes, I made a lot of promises too.

204
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,634
I don't want you to become me.

205
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:37,937
And I will not allow my son
to become his father.

206
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:41,548
So tonight, it ends.

207
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:49,214
Armand?

208
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,156
Whatever system Orion used
to contact you is untraceable.

209
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:56,161
I need to figure out
if he's working with someone inside.

210
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,299
I told you to find Orion.

211
00:14:58,466 --> 00:15:02,596
I'm well aware of his connections
inside my organization.

212
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,500
Then let me prove
Frost's loyalty is only to you.

213
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:07,868
Give me access to Hydra.

214
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,071
Hold on.

215
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:18,176
Do it.

216
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,947
It's not on this deck.

217
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,919
- What the...? Hey.
- Chuck?

218
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:27,789
Sarah.

219
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:36,870
- What are you two doing here?
- Taking down Volkoff.

220
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:39,335
How did you even find us?
You shouldn't be here.

221
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:41,873
She's right. This is my mission.
It's dangerous.

222
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:44,840
This is our mission, okay?
I never should have let you go.

223
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:48,141
Either one of you. You don't have
to do this alone. We're here to help.

224
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:51,945
Seriously, guys, it's gonna be okay.
Chuck has a plan.

225
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:55,849
The server room is right down there.

226
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,160
Mom. Mom? Mom.

227
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,373
When we get back, we need to have
a talk about the benefits of tranq guns.

228
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:18,169
There's the door to the server room.
I'll try and hack in.

229
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:22,341
Hang on a second,
this dude's got a key card, right?

230
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:24,611
Maybe this will help us with a way in.

231
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:28,017
Um, Morgan, we don't know
what's gonna happen if you do that.

232
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:30,682
See? Easy.

233
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:32,925
- Wait, this can't be right.
- What?

234
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:34,518
- Oh.
- Ahh.

235
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:45,196
Guys, I think I'm gonna die in here.

236
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,034
- Morgan, what's happening?
- Lasers.

237
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,177
Lots and lots of lasers
and they cut things.

238
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:54,541
Hang on, buddy.
Hang on, buddy, I'm in the system.

239
00:16:58,286 --> 00:17:01,687
Awesome, Chuck. Nice work. You got
the door to the server room open.

240
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:04,017
Now just turn off the lasers.

241
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:07,054
I don't think I can do it from here.

242
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:09,788
Morgan, if you can get
into the server room...

243
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:12,933
you can power them down
and open the door for us.

244
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:16,468
- He can't go through those lasers.
- I can't go through these lasers.

245
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:19,902
This could be the only chance you have.
We have to hurry.

246
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:28,205
Yes, you can. Yes, you can, Morgan.
I can do this.

247
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:32,079
I'm a yogi, all right? I am peaking
mentally and physically.

248
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:37,254
So I just need to use my ujjayi breath,
okay?

249
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:39,120
Now, come on.

250
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:57,808
Warrior 2 pose.

251
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:05,710
Transition, slowly, into Warrior 3 pose.

252
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,865
Huh. I didn't know I could do that.

253
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:33,206
Guys, I'm stuck.

254
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:36,179
Okay, okay, okay, buddy.
I'm gonna try something else.

255
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:41,878
Easy. Easy.
Your strength is in your core.

256
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,558
Oh, God.

257
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,194
Oh, not good. Lasers are moving now.

258
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:51,226
No, no, no. Worse now. Worse now.

259
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:54,664
Oh, God, it's slicing through my wetsuit.

260
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:57,127
Morgan? Are you okay?

261
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:14,181
Morgan? Morgan, don't you ever
do that again.

262
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:18,021
It's all right. It's all good.

263
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,556
Yeah.

264
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:26,359
- Kind of cold, yeah?
- Yeah.

265
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:43,578
Uh, Morgan, here.

266
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,879
I'm glad you're okay.

267
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,044
Thank you. Thanks.
And thank you for this.

268
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:51,089
Although I don't think it's gonna fit
over these shoulders, heh.

269
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,386
My lats have been really...

270
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:56,519
It's, you know,
it's just kind of barely... Ahem.

271
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:04,462
Careful, Chuck. Don't touch that.

272
00:20:05,406 --> 00:20:06,873
Okay.

273
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,599
I'm in.

274
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:10,843
All of Volkoff's contacts are here.

275
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:16,411
I am transferring Hydra
to a CIA offshore server...

276
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:19,879
now.

277
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,459
Hey, babe, watch me glide.

278
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,427
Devon, my water just broke.

279
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,393
But you're not due yet.

280
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,401
- What is Clara thinking?
- It happened about 10 minutes ago.

281
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:41,405
I took a shower and had a protein bar.
I'm ready to go. Let's go have a baby.

282
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,770
Okay. I'm prepared for this.

283
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:46,970
Yes, you are. You have a plan.
You have an awesome plan.

284
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,009
Okay. Everything's gonna be just fine.

285
00:20:56,457 --> 00:20:59,858
Where's my push mix? I got it from
Chuck. It couldn't have disappeared.

286
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:02,427
Devon, it's fine, really.
I don't need a push mix.

287
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,531
Let's just go.
I'm gonna grab some water for the road.

288
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:10,302
I'm not ready for this.
Perfect plan not perfect.

289
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:12,837
Oh, God, it's gone.
No push mix, no baby.

290
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:14,497
It's all gone.

291
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,777
Are you expecting someone?

292
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,459
Mrs. Woodcomb,
your transport service has arrived.

293
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,720
- Let's move quickly.
- Devon, did you arrange this?

294
00:21:37,498 --> 00:21:39,193
Voice identification required.

295
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:43,827
Damn it, only Volkoff can access this.
It's connected to his voice.

296
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:47,972
You and Morgan need to get out of here
right now.

297
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:50,406
You all need to get out.
Volkoff will be here any second.

298
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:54,344
- No. Not without you.
- Hey, hey. We're all going. Let's go.

299
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:13,522
Frost, I am very disappointed in you.

300
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:19,200
Death is the solution to all problems.

301
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:27,375
It's a quote from my favorite poet
and humanitarian...

302
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:29,038
Joseph Stalin.

303
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:44,686
Good job I didn't tell you
all my secrets, isn't it?

304
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,355
Just know...

305
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:48,798
you did this.

306
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:52,037
- Shoot them.
- All right, you can shoot them...

307
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:56,267
but not before I get one shot off
and one is all I need.

308
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:58,139
Get out of here, Chuck.

309
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:01,440
Morgan, go. Go now. Come on, Sarah.

310
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:06,446
Come on, come on. Come on.
Mom, come on.

311
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,815
For them to get out alive,
you have to stay.

312
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:11,123
Yes, I know.

313
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:15,886
- Run.
- Mom.

314
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,428
- Chuck, come on.
- Mom?

315
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:19,657
- Come on.
- Mom.

316
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:23,266
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

317
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:25,803
- We better get out.
- This wasn't part of my plan.

318
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:28,237
Come on, we have to go.

319
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:35,167
You have nothing to say to me?
No perfect excuses?

320
00:23:35,346 --> 00:23:36,745
No "Trust me, Alexei"?

321
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:38,643
- No.
- Nothing?

322
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:43,547
Give me the gun.

323
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:53,525
No one touches my Frost.

324
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,461
Armand.

325
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,265
Come, please. You have to see this.

326
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,602
There's something
I've got to show you.

327
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:11,646
Come, please. You have to see this.

328
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:16,981
"Meet me at Twin Pines Cabin.
Godspeed, my love.

329
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,286
Orion."

330
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,990
- What is this?
- You tell me.

331
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:28,262
Armand found it on our server
a few moments ago.

332
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,399
- I've never seen this before.
- Really?

333
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,631
Because this message led Armand
to hundreds more.

334
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:39,966
You've been talking to Orion every day
for years.

335
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:44,012
Night after night, behind my back.

336
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:46,012
That's why you didn't want me near you.

337
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:49,118
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

338
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:52,312
Stop lying to me.

339
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:57,322
You knew your husband was alive.

340
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,157
You knew the whole damn time.

341
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:02,928
I believed in you.

342
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:06,098
You want the truth, Alexei?

343
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,433
The truth is, my husband, alive or dead...

344
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:12,633
will always be 10 times
the man you are.

345
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:19,745
And every moment that I was with you,
I was thinking of him.

346
00:25:29,994 --> 00:25:32,861
I'm going to visit your husband.

347
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:35,897
And when I come back...

348
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,866
I'll bring you his body.

349
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,149
Moron, Grimes.

350
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:10,158
You're here.

351
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:12,361
Of course I am.

352
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:20,704
I, uh... I brought you a bonsai.
Thought it might feel more like home.

353
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,106
Would have brought guns...

354
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:25,339
but don't think they would have let me
through the door with those, so...

355
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:29,947
Save your strength, Dad.

356
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:33,012
The doctors said you need a rest.

357
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,824
Listen, I, uh...

358
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:41,923
I kind of like having my dad around.

359
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:47,598
I don't just like it,
I've gotten used to it, so...

360
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:51,332
I spent most of my life thinking
that my dad was dead...

361
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:55,075
and I'm not ready to do it again,
okay?

362
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,122
My contractions are 10 minutes apart.

363
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:12,961
Let's go ahead
and administer the Pitocin.

364
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,963
Can I get 10 cc's of Compazine?
I'm a little nauseous.

365
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,725
Of course, Dr. Woodcomb.

366
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,000
Is your husband all right?

367
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:23,670
Yeah, he'll snap out of it.

368
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:26,502
He was like this once before
during his exit exams.

369
00:27:26,677 --> 00:27:28,508
He'll be fine, I'm sure.

370
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:48,192
This is the location Orion listed
on his communiqué.

371
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:53,336
Then let's finally put this ghost
in the ground.

372
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:57,671
I'll do this myself.
Stay here and keep guard.

373
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:13,948
Orion.

374
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:15,785
We finally meet.

375
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:25,224
- Charles.
- Hello, Alexei.

376
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,233
I believe you were looking for me.

377
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:45,982
Morning, sunshine.

378
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:51,283
Oh, you seem very proud...

379
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:55,153
using your father's toys
to lure me in.

380
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:57,125
Oh.

381
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm not dead yet,
so you must want something.

382
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:03,401
Oh, you're right, actually.

383
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:06,802
There is still something I want.

384
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,715
I hadn't figured you as the vengeful type.

385
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:15,750
Is it because I spoke disparagingly
about your father?

386
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,184
This is because you took my mother
from him.

387
00:29:19,356 --> 00:29:21,551
You took his whole life and his death...

388
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:23,317
His death was ages ago.

389
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:26,122
Isn't it time you moved on?

390
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,390
Heh, bearing grudges.

391
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:30,561
A bit childish, isn't it?

392
00:29:33,237 --> 00:29:37,867
You can't kill me for the same reason
your mother and your girlfriend couldn't.

393
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:41,341
What do you think is gonna happen
to all those people you love...

394
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:44,606
if you put a bullet between my eyes?

395
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:51,611
I have access to everyone.

396
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:23,448
I have to admit, it was a good plan.

397
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,088
Using my own jealousy against me.

398
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:28,357
But it had its problems.

399
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,950
How could it not?

400
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:33,892
After all, you are your father's son.

401
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:37,625
Just know this...

402
00:30:38,268 --> 00:30:40,133
if it wasn't for you...

403
00:30:40,504 --> 00:30:44,167
everyone could have gotten
out of this alive.

404
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:14,766
And now for the sister.

405
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:21,774
I told my men to kill your mother
if they didn't hear from me.

406
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:28,179
And they won't...

407
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,616
so cheers, Charles.

408
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:34,087
Here's to a family reunion.

409
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:38,628
I can't believe you haven't figured out
the solution yet.

410
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:40,854
Solution?

411
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:43,696
To what?

412
00:31:45,235 --> 00:31:46,293
Gotcha.

413
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:50,798
Death is the solution to all problems.

414
00:31:50,974 --> 00:31:52,965
Got it, Chuck. We got the pass code.

415
00:31:57,514 --> 00:31:59,812
What is this?

416
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:02,978
Death is the solution to all problems.

417
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:09,553
That fake communiqué
you received from Orion...

418
00:32:09,726 --> 00:32:15,665
that wasn't just a play
on your weird affection for my mom.

419
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,859
That was also a virus
that my father created.

420
00:32:19,036 --> 00:32:24,736
And now that I have your passcode,
that virus will begin to transfer...

421
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:29,106
the entire Hydra network
onto this computer.

422
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,442
Technically, I guess you could say...

423
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:35,847
that in the end...

424
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:39,113
it was Stephen J. Bartowski
who took you down.

425
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:45,421
Fitting, don't you think?

426
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:49,231
You know, my father,
he taught me a lot of things.

427
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,391
Like looks can be deceiving...

428
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:04,303
and fight for your family.

429
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:06,977
Something's wrong.

430
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:11,020
- Aah! Unh.
- Mary, quick.

431
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,064
And, of course...

432
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,428
never use a gun...

433
00:33:29,573 --> 00:33:32,406
unless you absolutely have to.

434
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:40,311
Yeah, I probably should have told you,
I have this thing about bullets.

435
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:43,282
I was never gonna kill you, Alexei.

436
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:48,455
After all, I am my father's son, aren't I?

437
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:56,964
You've made one mistake, Charles.

438
00:33:57,134 --> 00:34:01,036
All the information you've got
is right here in your father's little cabin.

439
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:05,834
And outside that door,
I have dozens of heavily armed men.

440
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:10,343
If I don't walk out of here,
they're gonna come in for me.

441
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:13,915
You're gonna need an army
to get out of here alive.

442
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,234
Will they suffice?

443
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:40,840
Arrest him.

444
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:47,647
I just received word
from Frost and Walker.

445
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:49,809
They're en route to Burbank.

446
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:53,855
- It was a good plan, Agent Bartowski.
- Thank you, general.

447
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,490
Tell your mom to come visit.

448
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:01,061
It's been fun.

449
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:07,392
Chuck? Chuck. Hey, excuse me, guys.

450
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:08,936
You first.

451
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:11,707
As you were.

452
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:15,506
- We have to get out of here.
- What's up? Everything okay?

453
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,080
Just got a call from the hospital.
Ellie's having her baby now.

454
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:21,717
- What? Oh. Oh.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

455
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:23,580
Uh, general, can we borrow a van?

456
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:28,191
You just arrested Alexei Volkoff
and obtained the Hydra network...

457
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:31,384
we have spent the last 20 years
searching for.

458
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:34,052
Lieutenant, get this man a chopper.

459
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:36,023
Thanks.

460
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:45,001
You're dilated to 10
and fully effaced, Dr. Woodcomb.

461
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:47,769
Contractions are two minutes apart.
The baby's coming.

462
00:35:47,944 --> 00:35:49,707
Can you get the doctor?

463
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:52,375
Babe?

464
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,278
Honey, look at me.

465
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:59,350
I need you to go outside
and take five minutes for yourself.

466
00:35:59,523 --> 00:36:02,048
Pull yourself together
and then come back to me.

467
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,752
You're all I have right now, Devon.

468
00:36:04,928 --> 00:36:06,725
I need you.

469
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,633
Ew, pregnant women.

470
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,039
Ooh, pregnant women.

471
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,276
Excuse me, candy striper.

472
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:31,277
Hi. Listen, could you point us in
the direction of the Woodcomb womb?

473
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:32,950
- What?
- Without us...

474
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:37,059
that kid is gonna grow up listening
to Snow Patrol and Coldplay.

475
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:39,986
We just can't have that, can we?

476
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,627
I'm sorry, but no one goes in there
unless they're a family member.

477
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,325
So I suggest that you take a seat.

478
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:50,167
Dr. Adler, Room 315, please.

479
00:37:06,256 --> 00:37:08,781
Hey, Awesome. I heard Ellie's in labor.

480
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:11,018
Where is she?

481
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:16,499
Why aren't you in there?

482
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:21,168
Oh. Don't make the same mistake I did.

483
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:25,541
I missed my daughter's birth.
Missed her whole damn childhood.

484
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:29,043
Alex's mom had to raise her
all on her own.

485
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:34,283
There's not a day that goes by
I don't regret that.

486
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:38,449
Now, you get in there.

487
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:41,248
Move it.

488
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:07,172
- It's time to push.
- Okay.

489
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,655
Ahh, push it

490
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,222
Oh, God.

491
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:25,557
Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, baby

492
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:26,861
Ooh, baby, baby

493
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:29,164
Jeffster.

494
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:32,642
Ahh, push it

495
00:38:33,376 --> 00:38:35,071
Ahh, push it

496
00:38:35,245 --> 00:38:37,110
- Oh, no.
- Aah! Get up on this

497
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,547
Oh, baby

498
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:46,446
Salt-N-Pepa's here

499
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:50,559
Salt, Salt, Salt
Salt-N-Pepa's here

500
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,190
John.

501
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,029
Walker.

502
00:38:56,366 --> 00:38:59,062
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- Glad you're back.

503
00:39:01,771 --> 00:39:03,602
Want you to push it, babe

504
00:39:03,773 --> 00:39:07,265
Cool it by day then at night
Working up a sweat

505
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:10,106
Come on, girls, let's go show the guys
That we know

506
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,114
How to become number one
In a hot party show

507
00:39:14,284 --> 00:39:16,844
Now push it
Ahh, push it

508
00:39:17,587 --> 00:39:19,782
Push it good
Ahh, push it

509
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:21,218
- Let's go, guys.
- Aw.

510
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:22,619
It's over.

511
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:25,158
No. No, we did what
we came here to do, Jeffrey.

512
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:30,055
Cover song by cover song,
we are shaping the youth of America. Unh.

513
00:39:30,233 --> 00:39:32,861
I'm not allowed to do that anymore.

514
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:36,998
- Are you family?
- Yes.

515
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:39,767
Okay. Well, only one of you
can come in.

516
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:44,444
Um, Mom. Mom, go ahead, please.

517
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:49,343
Just make sure
she knows we're all out here, okay?

518
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:51,316
I will.

519
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,784
You came.

520
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,922
We all did.

521
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:17,170
Don't push yourself.

522
00:40:17,347 --> 00:40:19,838
- I can do it, you know.
- No, I got it.

523
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:21,847
- Where'd Alex go?
- She went home.

524
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:25,215
No, I didn't. I just went to get a coffee.

525
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:30,684
Whether you like it or not, Dad,
I am not going anywhere.

526
00:40:33,296 --> 00:40:35,059
Neither am I.

527
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:38,827
Good luck trying
to get rid of me, guys. Ha, ha.

528
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,333
I like you guys.

529
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:45,329
Your line is, "I like you too, Morgan."

530
00:40:57,687 --> 00:41:00,451
Ellie, she's so beautiful.

531
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:05,518
Congratulations.

532
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:07,253
Thank you.

533
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:20,900
Devon?

534
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:37,416
Awesome. Ha, ha.
