1
00:00:02,404 --> 00:00:04,738
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few
things that you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:06,297
An Intersect before Chuck?

3
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:10,000
Dad used this program to input
a new identity into an operative.

4
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:13,010
But something went wrong.
The program took over.

5
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:14,973
Agent X is Alexei Volkoff?

6
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,602
CIA created one of the most
murderous men in history.

7
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:19,451
If they find out we know?

8
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:22,316
They order a guy
to put a bullet in each of our heads.

9
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:23,682
The Norseman device.

10
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:26,726
It can kill a single person
in the middle of a crowd...

11
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:28,122
with 100 percent accuracy.

12
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:30,470
God, what is that noise?

13
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:35,662
Sarah? Sarah. Sarah.
No, no, no. Help me!

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,644
You awake?

15
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:49,285
Were you thinking about the wedding?

16
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:53,693
It's exactly one week away.
One single, solitary week.

17
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:55,589
Chuck, what if it rains?

18
00:00:55,763 --> 00:00:58,288
- That's good luck, right?
- Well, what if it doesn't?

19
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:01,127
Are we freaking out? We are.
That's normal though.

20
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:04,430
It's normal to freak out a little bit
a week before a wedding.

21
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,009
Unless...

22
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:11,842
It's cold feet?

23
00:01:14,214 --> 00:01:17,047
No.
No, no, because I wanna marry you.

24
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:19,718
No, I really wanna marry you too.

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,012
It's just the church...

26
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:25,284
and exchanging intimate feelings
in front of a crowd...

27
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:28,154
Wait, what if we did a dry run?

28
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,688
- A dry run?
- Yeah. Yeah, a dry run.

29
00:01:30,864 --> 00:01:34,027
That way we can work out the kinks,
no people, no cameras.

30
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,964
- Practice makes...
- Perfect.

31
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:40,435
We'll be ready for anything.

32
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:45,970
The poison is called thorium.
I don't know much about it.

33
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:48,546
Thorium is a radioactive metal,
not a poison.

34
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:50,047
- Liquid or solid?
- Liquid.

35
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:51,878
It's linked to her DNA somehow.

36
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:54,247
Then the thorium's been synthesized.
Devon?

37
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:56,446
Poison guns aren't in the textbooks.

38
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:58,181
I need a bath basin, stat.

39
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:05,389
Hypothermia will decrease the heart rate
and slow down any tissue damage.

40
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:09,332
If she's gonna survive, we need
to know exactly how this poison works.

41
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,869
And if it's exotic like you're saying,
we need to find an antidote.

42
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,886
Chuck?

43
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:32,051
Hey.

44
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:34,486
Hey, baby, I'm right here.

45
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,530
You look worried.

46
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:44,560
No. You know, it's just wedding stuff.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,407
Don't freak out, we're ready for it.

48
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:55,211
Sarah.

49
00:02:57,951 --> 00:02:59,509
Baby, I'm gonna fix this.

50
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,622
We're gonna get married
and be together...

51
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,559
forever.

52
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,964
I love you.

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,902
There's only one person
who can get us that antidote...

54
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:25,969
and it's the man
who made the damn thing:

55
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,647
Volkoff.

56
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:30,817
Well,
Volkoff is in a supermax penitentiary.

57
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:32,849
It'd take weeks to get clearance.

58
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,749
Then I guess we're just gonna
have to break in tonight.

59
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,829
- There.
- Mom, we've reached Volkoff's cell.

60
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,504
Copy that, Chuck.
You have precisely two minutes...

61
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:55,471
before the alarm system
comes back up.

62
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:58,202
Already open.

63
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:00,345
That's not right.

64
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:10,320
Casey, where's Volkoff?

65
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:13,891
He's gone,
Agent Bartowski. Stay where you are.

66
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,325
- Chuck, what is going on in there?
- I know that voice.

67
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:20,023
Casey, you're going pale.
I go pale, you don't.

68
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:22,725
Remember when I told you
opening the Agent X files...

69
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:26,600
would draw out a son of a bitch
that would destroy our whole team?

70
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:29,139
This is the guy they hire
to kill that guy.

71
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:33,144
Agent Bartowski, Colonel Casey.

72
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:35,713
Listen, I don't know who you are
and I don't care.

73
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:38,010
I need Volkoff. Now, where is he?

74
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:40,152
Name's Decker, Clyde Decker.

75
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:42,916
And I'm informing you
of a wash order...

76
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:45,523
on the Agent X program
and Operation Bartowski.

77
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:46,818
What does that mean?

78
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,690
It means your CIA resources
are revoked.

79
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:51,364
Sarah is dying.

80
00:04:51,565 --> 00:04:54,432
I don't care.
Now stand down or get buried.

81
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:57,564
- No.
- No?

82
00:04:57,771 --> 00:04:59,898
Let me explain.

83
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:07,040
That guy might think he's a hard ass,
but I'm the Intersect.

84
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:08,943
Let's move.

85
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:15,814
Chuck 4x24 - Versus the Cliffhanger

86
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,308
- Chuck.
- Any news?

87
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:25,383
Sarah's temperature's down
but it's not stabilizing.

88
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:26,814
What does that mean, EI?

89
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:29,750
There's signs
of a total-body dose of radiation.

90
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:32,949
She's breathing on her own.
She's in and out of consciousness.

91
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:34,560
How long does she have?

92
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:37,128
At this rate,
I would say that she has 12 hours.

93
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,029
She's here.

94
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,230
Thanks for helping us, general.

95
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:50,808
Decker's transporting Volkoff
to a black site.

96
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:52,944
No one who's gone in
has ever come out.

97
00:05:53,147 --> 00:05:55,240
We need to intercept Volkoff
in transit.

98
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,076
They're an hour ahead of you.

99
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:58,979
Then we need something with speed.

100
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:01,254
Can we still get into Castle?

101
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:05,051
Chuck, you realize if you go against
Decker, you're going against the CIA.

102
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:08,020
You and Sarah
will have to disappear forever.

103
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:09,992
You'll never see your family again.

104
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,963
I'll do anything I need to do
to save Sarah.

105
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:19,200
This should work.

106
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,771
Good luck, team.

107
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:24,104
- So, what's the bright idea?
- Why are you keeping us in the dark?

108
00:06:24,278 --> 00:06:25,677
I want the Nighthawk.

109
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:28,644
- Absolutely not.
- It's a prototype. Never been tested.

110
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:31,080
Eleven hours and counting.
I don't give a damn.

111
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:41,617
You're not even
supposed to know about it.

112
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:46,289
Come on, you thought you could keep a
superbike secret from me? She'll do 250.

113
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:47,866
You two navigate from Castle.

114
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:50,299
Chuck, have you ever even
ridden a motorcycle?

115
00:06:50,471 --> 00:06:52,632
And I hope to God the answer is no.

116
00:07:21,268 --> 00:07:26,638
Charles, I know time is of the essence
but you are driving awfully fast.

117
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,569
Sorry, Mom.

118
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:48,961
Don't get all icy on me, Volkoff.
I come in peace.

119
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:58,432
This transfer's not about killing you. CIA
wants you for some testing, that's all.

120
00:07:58,672 --> 00:07:59,900
Testing?

121
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:02,539
Regarding Agent X.

122
00:08:07,314 --> 00:08:10,613
Are you playing coy
or you don't remember any of this?

123
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:17,480
Casey.
Casey, I'm coming up on the transport.

124
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:25,322
Your real name
is Hartley Winterbottom.

125
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,801
Nobody names a person that.

126
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,804
Volkoff is a fictitious profile
you created with Stephen J. Bartowski.

127
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,737
What on Earth are you talking about?

128
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:48,481
The tech boys wanted you
sans Volkoff, so...

129
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:09,040
Casey, Mom, light it up.

130
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:14,304
Hold tight.

131
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:47,838
We're under attack. The cargo hold's
been breached. We need backup.

132
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:52,384
Chuck, you have 60 seconds to get
him out of there. They called in air support.

133
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:54,053
Oh, gosh.

134
00:09:56,723 --> 00:09:58,281
Hey.

135
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:01,183
Come on, wake up.
You're coming with me.

136
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,522
I am? Why?

137
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:06,257
Vivian shot Sarah with the Norseman.

138
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:08,298
Who shot whom with what?

139
00:10:08,502 --> 00:10:12,199
Bartowski,
you are galactically insubordinate.

140
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:14,298
I'm almost impressed.

141
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:15,907
I'm taking Volkoff with me.

142
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:18,441
Well, one problem, that ain't Volkoff.

143
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,941
His name's Hartley.

144
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:22,172
Volkoff was an Intersect implant.

145
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:24,043
It's gone now.

146
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:26,211
Hello.

147
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:28,043
Gentle as a lamb.

148
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:30,613
Give up, Chuck. You're done.

149
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,884
Bartowski.

150
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:37,689
Are you related
to Stephen Bartowski?

151
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:41,129
I'm his son,
and you're coming with me right now.

152
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:44,929
On that?

153
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:47,868
- It looks very dangerous.
- I said now!

154
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:51,635
You are kidnapping
a government prisoner, peckerwood.

155
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,874
- Hang tight.
- I am.

156
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:10,279
I mean, 30 years?

157
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:17,616
- Is he still in charge?
- If only.

158
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,248
The Volkoff profile that you and
Stephen developed for the Intersect...

159
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,793
was only supposed
to last for a couple of months.

160
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:27,223
What did I do?

161
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,630
I mean,
what did Volkoff do for 30 years?

162
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:35,831
What kind of a man was I?

163
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:41,502
You were very successful
in a highly competitive business.

164
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:45,543
No, Mary, there's gotta
be more to it than that...

165
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:48,312
if someone's been struck
by the Norseman.

166
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,216
We don't have time for this, okay?

167
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:54,155
My fiancée has been poisoned.
I need your help to save her life.

168
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:55,987
Right, right. The Norseman.

169
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:58,061
It developed alongside the Intersect.

170
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,822
And it was a weapon of deterrence.

171
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:04,196
We were gonna collect the DNA
of all the top black marketeers.

172
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,362
You could whack them
if they got out of line, Reagan smart.

173
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:09,564
Yeah, peace through violence.

174
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:11,039
Remember, it was the '80s.

175
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,236
- Hartley, is there an antidote?
- Iridium 5.

176
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,038
Okay, how do we get it?

177
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:18,512
Oh, it's simple.
I can make that for you.

178
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,450
Great. That's great.

179
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,850
That's fantastic. We'll talk on the way
to the hospital. Let's go.

180
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:28,587
Once we secure the antidote
we'll discuss our plans for Viv.

181
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:29,955
Viv?

182
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:32,222
Yeah. A gal named Vivian
fired the Norseman.

183
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,529
Which doesn't matter right now,
what does is the antidote.

184
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,259
Charles, who's Vivian?

185
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:39,260
It's a Winterbottom family name.

186
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:46,572
She's your daughter.

187
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:48,738
My daughter?

188
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:50,972
And she's your enemy?

189
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,846
It's a long story,
terrible mistakes were made.

190
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:56,283
And now we have to clean them up.

191
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:58,246
Will you help me save Sarah?

192
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,984
- Yeah. Of course I will.
- Thank you.

193
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:17,134
Okay, here we go.

194
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:24,373
Okay.

195
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:31,988
That's all you got there?
These are our wedding vows after all.

196
00:13:32,424 --> 00:13:33,982
I think I covered the bases.

197
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:35,683
Okay, cool. Yeah, good, good.

198
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:39,193
You go, then I'll go, and then
we'll have a little note session after.

199
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:42,526
- Okay, I'm just gonna go.
- Yeah, you get... Mm-hm.

200
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:47,466
"Chuck, you're a gift.

201
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,199
You're a gift
I never dreamed I could want, or need...

202
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:54,037
and every day I will show you
that you're a gift that I deserve.

203
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:57,046
You make me the best person
I could ever hope to be...

204
00:13:57,282 --> 00:14:01,514
and I wanna spend, and learn,
and love, the rest of my life with you."

205
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,482
Talky?

206
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:11,860
Perfect.

207
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:14,859
So perfect, it's so perfect.
Oh, my God.

208
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:18,465
Sarah. Oh, Sarah.

209
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:22,732
Mine are a tear-down.
This is a page one rewrite.

210
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:26,377
I scripted a wardrobe change,
you know, and a pause for applause.

211
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:28,546
Chuck, don't freak out.

212
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:31,683
Whatever they are,
they will be perfect.

213
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:37,046
Something's wrong.

214
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,087
The Iridium slowed the poison
but her temperature is back up.

215
00:14:41,593 --> 00:14:43,151
What are we talking about?

216
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:46,661
I think that you bought more time,
but she's still deteriorating.

217
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:50,934
Okay, okay.

218
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:53,196
Okay, what's next?

219
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:55,196
I don't know.

220
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:58,434
What do you mean you don't...?
Come on, people, think about this.

221
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,171
If there's an Iridium 5,
there's gotta be an Iridium 6, right?

222
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:06,716
About four years ago, Volkoff
was working on a new compound.

223
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,619
Very secret.
The file was labeled Lead Apron.

224
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:12,016
Way to protect
against radioactive poisoning.

225
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:13,919
Volkoff must have known...

226
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:17,562
No, I must have known
that number 5 was weak...

227
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:19,754
and developed
the next one, Iridium 6.

228
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:22,762
Volkoff kept the project close,
at his Moscow base.

229
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:24,901
EI, what's our time frame?

230
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,198
- A day, maybe less.
- Then we're out of here ASAP.

231
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:33,472
Got friends in Global Strike Command.
They'll give us a free jump to Russia.

232
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:36,637
- They love mixing it up with the Reds.
- Bartowski.

233
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:41,118
You may be the Intersect, boy,
but you can't outrun a bullet.

234
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:56,892
Chuck!

235
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,649
So of course, Chuck goes
marching back to these bullies...

236
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:16,185
and he demands
that they give me back my pants.

237
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:20,485
Says he's gonna call the Intergalactic
Firestorm Federation which didn't exist.

238
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:23,958
There's no such thing. Chuck just,
you know, made it up on the spot.

239
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,858
But he got me my pants back.

240
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:27,497
Yeah, I loved those pants.

241
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,925
Anyway, long story...

242
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:35,836
just to say
that Chuck never gives up.

243
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,933
You know that, right?

244
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:49,117
What are you doing? Sarah's dying.

245
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:51,380
I'm aware of that.

246
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:53,488
You're aware of that?
I could save her.

247
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:55,991
She's CIA just like you.
Let me get the antidote.

248
00:16:56,194 --> 00:17:01,222
- That's all I'm asking for.
- You're fired, Chuck, as of right now.

249
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,994
Operation Bartowski is done.
The Buy More is for sale.

250
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,296
Fine. Fine, fire me, just let me go.

251
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:09,030
Chuck, there is one last thing
I need from you.

252
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:11,666
Some CIA property.

253
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:17,144
- What is that?
- A suppression device.

254
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:20,149
They say it only hurts a lot.

255
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:28,190
No, no, no, don't take the Intersect.
I need it for the antidote.

256
00:17:28,393 --> 00:17:31,021
- I need it to save Sarah.
- I know, Chuck. I know.

257
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,054
Don't.

258
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:38,030
Don't.

259
00:17:49,948 --> 00:17:51,313
What do you want, Clyde?

260
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:54,776
You're going
to convince Agent Bartowski...

261
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:57,217
and his mom that this is over.

262
00:17:57,923 --> 00:18:01,381
No one can know the true origin
of Alexei Volkoff.

263
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:05,426
Uncuff him.

264
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:09,363
John, I don't need to threaten you
to follow an order.

265
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:11,035
You're a Marine.

266
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:14,969
You're going to do this
to protect the greater good.

267
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,266
Your country.

268
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:21,471
I'm on to you.

269
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:24,045
You know
I'm not gonna bail out on Walker.

270
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:27,845
Think I'm just gonna accept your offer,
try to escape with Frost and Chuck?

271
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:29,247
But it's a setup.

272
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:31,616
When I make my move, you kill us all.

273
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,624
In the report, you make yourself out
to be the good guy, right?

274
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:37,056
A real hero.

275
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:41,264
Well, that's all right.

276
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,730
See, John...

277
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:50,373
I'm not afraid to be the bad guy.

278
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:53,805
Neither am I.

279
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:05,615
Hey, Casey, what's up?

280
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:08,884
We're making our move.
Does the CIA still have a man on you?

281
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:11,258
Yes. Yes, they do.

282
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:13,294
Take him out.
Meet me at the apartment.

283
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:14,762
Yes, sir. Okay. All right.

284
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:17,192
What's going on?

285
00:19:17,402 --> 00:19:19,836
We're getting Chuck
and Hartley out of here.

286
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:22,838
Your mom and I are the magnet.
We're gonna distract Decker.

287
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:25,602
It's the only way
you'll make it to Moscow.

288
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:27,472
They took the Intersect out of me.

289
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:31,946
You're the second best spy I've ever
worked with. Go save the best one.

290
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:34,051
I'm sorry, what am I supposed to do?

291
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:36,777
You and Chuck need
to break into Volkoff Industries.

292
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:39,947
There'll be lots of security,
you have to go as your old self.

293
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,116
Of course, as Volkoff.

294
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:43,385
Yes, but he's not you.

295
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,621
He's a mean, dictatorial, conniving...

296
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:46,957
Manipulative, amoral...

297
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,860
Limey, with relatively good teeth.

298
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,967
- Sounds like I was a monster.
- You were.

299
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,129
And you didn't tell me this
for a reason?

300
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,709
My daughter.

301
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:00,503
I made her into me?

302
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,179
I made her into Volkoff?

303
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,976
I'm sorry, Hartley.

304
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:09,042
Okay, guys, we got a situation.

305
00:20:09,254 --> 00:20:12,519
We need to take out the CIA guard
at the end of the hall.

306
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:15,955
- What? We don't do that kind of thing.
- Morgan? Is he dangerous?

307
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:17,827
Yes. Yes, very.

308
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:20,827
- Devon, take him out.
- Wait, what? No.

309
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:23,365
I'm standing right here.
I'm the professional spy.

310
00:20:23,568 --> 00:20:27,197
Devon will go and distract,
I will be the one doing the taking out...

311
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:30,272
with a little spy maneuver
we like to call "The Magnet."

312
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:34,405
- So, what? You punch him out?
- Probably sweep the leg.

313
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:36,740
I haven't decided. I like to improvise.

314
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:41,611
Move. Up.

315
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,384
Chuck, new identities.

316
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,790
Untraceable, extremely rare.

317
00:20:51,396 --> 00:20:54,229
I made them years ago
for an occasion just like this.

318
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:57,367
You have to use them, Chuck.
You and Sarah need to disappear.

319
00:20:57,802 --> 00:20:58,860
I got it.

320
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:03,034
- If I've never...
- Get the antidote.

321
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,506
You get it to Sarah
then you disappear.

322
00:21:05,944 --> 00:21:08,276
You do whatever it takes,
you save her.

323
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:13,578
Am I ever gonna see you again, Mom?

324
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:16,117
Not if everything goes right.

325
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:19,223
- Goodbye, Chuck.
- I love you.

326
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:28,460
Come on. Come on.

327
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,011
All right, Morgan, sweep the leg.

328
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,045
Or karate chop.

329
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:47,548
- I love those shades.
- Or roundhouse kick.

330
00:21:47,752 --> 00:21:49,549
Or roundhouse... Or, uh...

331
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:53,021
Or, uh...

332
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:05,131
You are supposed to be the magnet.

333
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:06,463
Dude, sweep the leg?

334
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:09,835
In real life, you just make a fist
and hit him as hard as you can.

335
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:11,667
You got lucky.

336
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:18,848
So this is it.

337
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:21,584
The Volkoff Industries.

338
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,220
It's, uh...

339
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:26,283
Very stark.

340
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:32,489
Charles,
do you think this suit's a bit much?

341
00:22:32,697 --> 00:22:34,187
Too much sheen?

342
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:37,824
Hartley, you are Alexei Volkoff, okay?
Don't think about the suit.

343
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:42,302
Just say as little as possible
and we'll be fine. Think angry thoughts.

344
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:47,335
Actually, my mind has just gone blank.
I think I've forgotten the plan again.

345
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:50,237
Simply approach the receptionist...

346
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:54,249
and tell her in a very bold and
Volkovian way you're here to see Vivian.

347
00:22:54,419 --> 00:23:00,153
She'll lead us to your private elevator.
I'll slip into the air shaft, go to the lab.

348
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:01,817
I can't do it.

349
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:04,689
- No, you have to do it.
- No, I'm not this man.

350
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:06,558
I'm a scientist.

351
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:08,892
Your plan isn't gonna work, Charles.

352
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:12,194
Listen to me, it will work.
My plans always work. I promise.

353
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:14,395
But you're not the spy you used to be.

354
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:16,770
And I'm not the villain I used to be.

355
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:19,505
- We can't do it.
- Damn it, we can.

356
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:21,009
If we work together, we can.

357
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,773
What is it? What is going on?

358
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,244
What if she's up there?

359
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,682
My daughter.

360
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:31,715
This is about Vivian?

361
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,152
I don't know her.

362
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:37,592
What do you say to a daughter
you've never even met?

363
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:40,196
"I'm so sorry I've ruined your life?"

364
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:45,202
No. No.

365
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:48,368
I'm sorry, I can't see her.

366
00:23:52,677 --> 00:23:55,612
- I'm gonna run away now.
- No, Hart...

367
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,873
Wait!

368
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:13,427
Can I help you?

369
00:24:25,577 --> 00:24:28,307
My name is Charles Car...

370
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,447
Chuck Bartowski.

371
00:24:30,615 --> 00:24:32,412
I'm here to see Vivian Volkoff.

372
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:34,107
And what is this in regard to?

373
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:37,014
She wants to kill me.

374
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:55,262
I don't believe it.

375
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:58,272
Charles Carmichael.

376
00:24:59,477 --> 00:25:01,536
I'm impressed.

377
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:05,273
Walking into my office unarmed, bold.

378
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,542
Stupid but bold.

379
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,780
Sarah is still alive.

380
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:12,814
- How can that be?
- It doesn't matter.

381
00:25:13,024 --> 00:25:15,151
I need a vial of the antidote, Iridium 6.

382
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,691
Your father stored it here.

383
00:25:16,861 --> 00:25:19,796
- You need it.
- Please. I'm pleading with you.

384
00:25:19,964 --> 00:25:21,864
I am here to plead for Sarah's life.

385
00:25:23,902 --> 00:25:25,802
What's the trick, Chuck?

386
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,064
What's the clever plan
that gets you out of this?

387
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:31,367
I'm all out of plans.

388
00:25:35,146 --> 00:25:37,410
The woman I love is dying
and I can only hope...

389
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:40,676
that you haven't totally
become this person.

390
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:51,057
Everything you've ever said
was done to manipulate me.

391
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:53,059
You told me
my father was a monster...

392
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:56,098
and now you tell me he's
someone else, some sort of hero.

393
00:25:57,502 --> 00:25:59,697
I wouldn't say hero.

394
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:01,932
Bloody fool, more like.

395
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:07,340
I signed on for a mission
because they needed a scientist.

396
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:10,879
And then I convinced his father,
my friend, Stephen...

397
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:14,815
to let me use his computer program
to help me.

398
00:26:16,387 --> 00:26:20,551
- How did you get in here?
- I just asked to be shown to my office.

399
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:24,626
Everyone was really nice.
They all jumped up to help me.

400
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:27,059
I guess
I must have been a harsh boss...

401
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,127
and father.

402
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:39,900
I'm so sorry.

403
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:42,477
You're sorry?

404
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:45,850
You made me your succession plan.

405
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:53,986
This was my grandmother's,
her name was Vivian.

406
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:58,760
She rode horses,
and she looked just like you.

407
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:04,594
Don't you see? You're a good
person. And you come from a good family.

408
00:27:04,802 --> 00:27:06,929
You've fallen into
the wrong world and life.

409
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:09,572
- You're not a killer.
- Killed Sarah in cold blood.

410
00:27:09,774 --> 00:27:11,742
But you haven't yet, there's still time.

411
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,640
You can give me the antidote,
and I can save her.

412
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:20,649
No. I have to be Volkoff now.

413
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:25,755
I am this building, I am this company.
I can never leave, I can never go back.

414
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:33,794
- What if you could?
- How?

415
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:42,431
These are blank identities.

416
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,664
Very rare. Very clean.

417
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:48,107
You'd have to give up Volkoff Industries
but if you take these you can start over.

418
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:50,781
Anywhere in the world.
The both of you.

419
00:27:53,117 --> 00:27:54,948
Charles?

420
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:56,813
How will you escape?

421
00:27:57,021 --> 00:28:01,151
It doesn't matter. The only thing that
matters is saving Sarah at this point.

422
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,461
Vivian, I don't know you
but I'd like to.

423
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,700
If you pull that trigger...

424
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:16,204
you will lose yourself forever...

425
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:18,572
like I did.

426
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:21,438
You can still change.

427
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,851
Please, will you help me?

428
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:44,895
My brother's cutting it close.

429
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,700
The whole place is surrounded
by Decker's men.

430
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,002
Chuck's never gonna be able
to get in there.

431
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:55,907
Oh, he'll have a plan.
Chuck will come up with something.

432
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:01,713
- What the hell?
- Sorry we're late, Morgan.

433
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,547
- Egypt took longer than we thought.
- Not a problem.

434
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:08,123
I called Sarah's bridesmaids
as soon as their plane landed.

435
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:10,850
Don't give me any grief, Casey.
We're here for Sarah.

436
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:12,792
Glad you're here.

437
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:17,063
- Meet Mary, the mother-in-law.
- Hi.

438
00:29:18,302 --> 00:29:21,533
- We have a signal.
- Repeat that. What did you say?

439
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:24,503
Something is approaching by air.

440
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:49,429
I have the antidote. Let me in.

441
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:50,760
Get him out of here.

442
00:29:51,736 --> 00:29:53,067
Hey.

443
00:29:54,138 --> 00:29:55,435
Decker, let him in.

444
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:01,609
- Thanks for coming, guys.
- You're welcome, Chuck.

445
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:04,743
Hey, let him in, douche.

446
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:14,982
You're all under arrest.

447
00:30:17,128 --> 00:30:19,494
I'm kind of disappointed
in you, Bartowski.

448
00:30:19,697 --> 00:30:23,656
You thought you could get past me
with a few of your spy friends?

449
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:27,832
You should have known
I'd bring an army to stop you.

450
00:30:28,005 --> 00:30:29,973
I know the move.

451
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:32,104
But we have a move of our own.

452
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,777
It's called the magnet.

453
00:30:33,978 --> 00:30:37,880
See, while you're busy looking at me
and all of my spy friends...

454
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:40,880
you're missing something really,
really big...

455
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:43,513
care of Volkoff Industries.

456
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:57,992
Russians. So many Russians.

457
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,503
Russian special forces.

458
00:31:39,544 --> 00:31:40,738
You really are a traitor.

459
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:42,344
Just for the day.

460
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:48,682
This is a file that contains
all of Project X, the cover-up...

461
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:50,854
and your involvement in all of it.

462
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:53,580
If anything happens to Sarah,
my friends or family...

463
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:57,559
this story hits the front page
of every paper in the United States.

464
00:31:58,262 --> 00:32:00,787
- You're done.
- I quit.

465
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:02,694
Now, get out of my way.

466
00:32:15,613 --> 00:32:17,376
I do.

467
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,597
I do.

468
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,641
Sarah, hey.

469
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,209
Hey, baby.

470
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:52,775
Good, so when we do it for real,
we'll be ready.

471
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:59,249
I think we left out
one pretty important little detail.

472
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:09,733
It's not too late.

473
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,101
It's not too late. It's not too late.

474
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:14,329
Please.

475
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:18,871
Please.

476
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:21,274
Please.

477
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:52,000
Uh...

478
00:33:53,444 --> 00:33:55,742
Right, my vows.

479
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:57,881
My turn for vows.

480
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:01,448
They just don't cut it.
I'm sorry, Sarah.

481
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:05,219
How do I express
the depth of my love for you?

482
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,922
Or my dreams for our future, or the
fact that I will fight for you every day.

483
00:34:10,127 --> 00:34:12,595
Or that our kids
will be like little superheroes...

484
00:34:12,763 --> 00:34:15,561
with little capes and stuff like that.

485
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:20,826
Words can't express that.
Don't do it justice. They just don't cut it.

486
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,235
So no vows.

487
00:34:28,913 --> 00:34:33,976
I'll just prove it to you every day
for the rest of our lives.

488
00:34:36,854 --> 00:34:39,049
You can count on me.

489
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:43,383
Perfect.

490
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:49,896
Do you, Charles Bartowski...

491
00:34:51,235 --> 00:34:54,966
take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

492
00:34:57,575 --> 00:34:58,940
I do.

493
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:03,112
- And do you take this man...? Okay.
- I do.

494
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:05,009
Well, by the power vested in me...

495
00:35:05,249 --> 00:35:08,082
by the Intergalactic Federation
of Planets...

496
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:10,379
I now pronounce you man and wife.

497
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,684
You may kiss the bride.

498
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:16,187
Come here.

499
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,851
Trust me, Chuck.

500
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,220
You and I,
we're perfect for each other.

501
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,160
And I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

502
00:35:55,332 --> 00:35:58,324
Away from everyone else
and away from the spy life.

503
00:35:58,936 --> 00:36:00,426
I love you.

504
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,469
I love you, Chuck.

505
00:36:05,676 --> 00:36:07,405
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

506
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:09,808
I feel like I should be James Bond
right now.

507
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,313
The guy who's standing with you
right now, at this moment...

508
00:36:13,517 --> 00:36:17,009
I didn't fall in love with James Bond.
I fell in love with you.

509
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,722
Welcome to the family.

510
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:27,087
To the airport, my good man.

511
00:36:32,703 --> 00:36:36,730
- Morgan, what happened to the driver?
- Oh, no, I was always the driver, Chuck.

512
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:39,774
I'm having a little trouble letting go,
I suppose.

513
00:36:40,344 --> 00:36:42,244
Just roll up the partition, would you?

514
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,038
As you wish.

515
00:36:44,715 --> 00:36:46,478
As you wish.

516
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:55,949
Mrs. Chuck Bartowski.

517
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:58,755
Mr. Sarah Walker.

518
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:07,196
This is Chuck Bartowski,
happily married man.

519
00:37:07,371 --> 00:37:08,531
What do you want, Morgan?

520
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:12,699
Charles, sorry we missed the party
but we did send a little gift in our place.

521
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:15,738
- Did you get it?
- Hartley.

522
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:17,874
What are you talking about?

523
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:19,879
Look under your seat.

524
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:23,212
Just a little something
for my best friend's son and his bride.

525
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,017
Be wise with it, Charles.

526
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:30,052
Good luck.

527
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:42,262
What?

528
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,470
Oh, boy.

529
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:05,094
Hey, guys.

530
00:38:05,262 --> 00:38:08,322
Well, well, the prodigal son returns.

531
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:10,424
From my honeymoon.

532
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:13,335
Go ahead, chump.
Whistle past the graveyard.

533
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:14,663
The deal went through.

534
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:16,465
The Buy More's been sold.

535
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,437
Give it a week, we're all jobless.

536
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:20,941
Leave us alone, please?
Private conversation.

537
00:38:23,714 --> 00:38:26,842
Well, maybe just give it a little time,
fellas.

538
00:38:29,286 --> 00:38:32,221
Get the hell back to work.
The new owner might stop by today.

539
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:35,525
I am working.

540
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:04,316
Guess it's the dawn of a new chapter,
eh, boy?

541
00:39:05,656 --> 00:39:07,385
I'd watch that boy talk, redneck.

542
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:08,819
From General Beckman.

543
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:10,756
Your personal effects.

544
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:14,193
Wouldn't want you to be
without your pocket protector.

545
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:17,528
Yeah, well, I'd rather wear this
than be in business with you.

546
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:22,138
You really think
you've been fighting evil, doing good?

547
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:25,408
You're just a pawn, you always were.

548
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:27,043
What are you talking about?

549
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:29,212
You think it was all a coincidence?

550
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,249
The Intersect, Fulcrum,
the Ring, Shaw, Agent X.

551
00:39:34,418 --> 00:39:36,909
That was all just part of the plan,
Bartowski...

552
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:39,419
pieces on the puzzle board.

553
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,152
See you never, civilian.

554
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:43,451
Wait, wait. Wait, what plan?

555
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:46,354
What plan?

556
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,521
My life was changed forever.

557
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:51,224
My friends were put in danger,
my family.

558
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,561
My father was killed, Decker.

559
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,580
A plan?
Sounds more like a conspiracy.

560
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:09,379
The question is
who could control our lives so well?

561
00:40:09,586 --> 00:40:10,610
I don't know.

562
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:13,552
It doesn't matter anyway,
it's not our fight.

563
00:40:13,724 --> 00:40:15,589
You forget the CIA fired our asses.

564
00:40:17,294 --> 00:40:21,788
Okay, well, what if we went
into business for ourselves?

565
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:25,329
- And how exactly would we do that?
- Well, we have a base.

566
00:40:25,502 --> 00:40:28,733
And the Buy More
has proven to be an excellent cover.

567
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:32,137
Mrs. B?
One thing, the Buy More just sold.

568
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:34,971
Yeah, we know.

569
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:36,737
We bought it.

570
00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:41,510
Hartley turned over all of
Volkoff's assets to us, wedding present.

571
00:40:41,752 --> 00:40:45,313
Eight hundred and 77 million dollars.

572
00:40:45,522 --> 00:40:49,856
I'd like to refer to it as a cool billion
just because it's more fun to say.

573
00:40:50,361 --> 00:40:51,589
That's a lot of money.

574
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:55,094
And who better to handle
a billion dollars than me?

575
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:57,699
Us, us, us.

576
00:40:57,868 --> 00:41:00,769
Our first purchase was the Buy More
and everything below it.

577
00:41:00,938 --> 00:41:03,839
Now we have all of Volkoff's resources
at our disposal.

578
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:07,238
- If you still wanna take out the bad guys.
- Damn right we do.

579
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:08,968
- You guys want a job?
- Yeah.

580
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,806
- Hells, yeah.
- Great.

581
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:14,780
I took the liberty of buying us a
Gulf stream and new tactical equipment.

582
00:41:14,985 --> 00:41:16,543
We do have to re-outfit Castle.

583
00:41:16,787 --> 00:41:18,652
So any ideas?

584
00:41:19,823 --> 00:41:21,120
Freelance spies.

585
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:24,886
Yes, men and women of action
and adventure.

586
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:29,863
Under the radar. Above the law.
Oh, man, this is gonna be so much fun.

587
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:31,898
Just, uh...

588
00:41:34,171 --> 00:41:37,971
Oh, nice.
Slick new gig, slick new shades.

589
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:41,168
Heh-heh. What could go wrong?

590
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:58,689
Morgan. Morgan.

591
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,690
Morgan?

592
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:13,372
Morgan, did you just?

593
00:42:13,844 --> 00:42:15,505
Guys.

594
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,507
I know kung fu.
