1
00:00:02,138 --> 00:00:04,936
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few
things you might need to know.

2
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,408
Wait, wait.
Vivian Volkoff is trying to kill me?

3
00:00:07,577 --> 00:00:11,013
It appears she's going after the man
who took down her father.

4
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:13,672
Bad news. Ellie's been working
on your dad's computer.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,750
My dad was trying to figure out a way...

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,411
to input knowledge into the brain
without having to learn it.

7
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:23,081
Replace the computer's hard drive
with a blank one when Ellie's not looking.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,001
I'm great, Mom, you know?

9
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:28,139
Uh, she's sleeping
halfway through the night.

10
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:30,605
And Devon has that
breast-feeding simulator...

11
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:33,904
so I'm fine.

12
00:00:34,113 --> 00:00:39,483
You know I love babysitting my
granddaughter, but I am a trained spy.

13
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:41,475
What gives?

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,423
I didn't wanna say anything
until I had any solid conclusions but...

15
00:00:50,496 --> 00:00:52,430
Is that your father's old computer?

16
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:56,090
Yeah. I found it
underneath the seat of his Mustang.

17
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:58,429
I had a major breakthrough
a few days ago...

18
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:02,904
and then I found thousands of pages
that I've never seen before, all labeled X.

19
00:01:04,943 --> 00:01:06,467
How far into them are you?

20
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:09,205
Not very.
But there's references in here...

21
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:12,975
to you and Dad and this Agent-X.
Do you know anything about this?

22
00:01:13,485 --> 00:01:16,477
No. Did you happen to run this
by your brother?

23
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:18,282
No. I don't want Chuck involved.

24
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:21,984
I mean, obviously,
this has to do with Dad's spy life.

25
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:23,219
Look at this.

26
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:27,888
This Intersect project? Downloading
information into the human brain.

27
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:30,864
This is amazing stuff.

28
00:01:31,537 --> 00:01:32,970
I've never heard of it.

29
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:36,301
Do you think that Dad had the Intersect
running with this Agent-X?

30
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:39,344
I really don't know, honey.
I don't know.

31
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:45,372
All right.
I'm gonna go give Clara her bottle.

32
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:47,576
I'll be back.

33
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:51,088
Stephen, what did you do?

34
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:58,353
Eddard, you don't let your kids
keep a dire wolf.

35
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,225
That's a terrible idea.

36
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,368
- Are you ready to head out?
- Hmm? Mm-hm.

37
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:07,130
Will you sign these when you get
the chance? Just wedding prep docs.

38
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:08,603
Mm-hm.

39
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:13,736
"Prospective husband,
prospective wife.

40
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:16,210
Legally binding, prenuptial..."

41
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:22,919
- Prenup?
- Post-it notes on the signature pages.

42
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:30,524
- Go in. I'll get a ride from Morgan.
- Didn't shower this morning?

43
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:35,724
Just the body. Not the hair.
So now I feel dirty, smelly, European.

44
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:37,930
Okay, okay. Uh...

45
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:40,298
- I will see you there.
- Great.

46
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:45,441
Prenup?

47
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:48,102
Jeez, I thought things were going
so well.

48
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,145
It was. Is.

49
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:53,443
She's just taking precautions.
Half of all marriages go down.

50
00:02:56,788 --> 00:02:58,255
Well...

51
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:01,088
it's good to see
yours is going so well.

52
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,559
Hilarious. But you know what?
It works.

53
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:08,958
So you.
Spending a little money on the side?

54
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:10,897
Gambling debts I don't know about?

55
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:14,664
Of course not. You know me.
I don't know why she'd do this.

56
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,001
Something has got
your girl's dukes up, okay?

57
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:18,608
Get the facts.

58
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:23,139
- Smaller bites, please.
- Don't henpeck.

59
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:26,280
You overanalyze everything, Bartowski.

60
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:29,477
You talk every issue to death.
It's exhausting.

61
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:31,452
I'm exhausted just sitting here.

62
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:32,749
Wow, I really do that?

63
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:36,758
Spies have secrets. If you're gonna take
it to the next level with Walker...

64
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:39,988
you have to understand that.
Sign the papers. Be cool.

65
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,655
Yeah, Chuck. Be cool.

66
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,293
Be cool.

67
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,361
It's kind of new territory
for me, honestly. Cool.

68
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:49,131
Good advice.

69
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:52,004
I'm gonna get out of here
before I'm scarred for life.

70
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:55,070
Mail call.

71
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:57,972
Thank you, sir.

72
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:00,849
Me. Me.

73
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,321
Alex's return address.

74
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:08,118
Looks like an invite.

75
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:11,491
- No. Love letter, I think.
- Invite.

76
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:14,223
What is it, Grimes? Spill.

77
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,301
An invite to Alex's graduation.

78
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:20,900
Look, she desperately wanted
to invite you, all right?

79
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:24,906
But technically, in her mother's eyes,
anyway, you are still sort of...

80
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,374
Well, mostly dead.

81
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:29,480
She just can't.

82
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:31,713
Stupid of me to think otherwise.

83
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,651
Duty calls.

84
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:41,691
Team, as you know,
the bombs planted in Castle...

85
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,418
had Volkoff parts and design.

86
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:47,325
Langley has tagged Vivian Volkoff
as the responsible party.

87
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:50,229
- They put out a kill order.
- Off parts? What?

88
00:04:50,702 --> 00:04:53,193
- Two men dead, Bartowski.
- But it could be a rogue...

89
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:56,933
in Volkoff's organization.
- Look, I've spent time with Vivian.

90
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:58,700
She's not a cold-blooded killer.

91
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:02,077
Just give me a chance to persuade her
to come in.

92
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:05,011
- She worked for us, we owe her that.
- We don't owe her.

93
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:08,511
I'll compromise.
Set a meet with Vivian.

94
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:10,211
Casey, prep a sniper team.

95
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:12,619
She gets hostile, take her down.

96
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,951
Roger that.

97
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:18,893
No matter how much you believe in this
broad, remember, she's still a Volkoff.

98
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:22,796
Don't let him get to you.
He's just being Casey.

99
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:25,901
Sure. No, it's cool.

100
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:29,604
I know I sprung those papers on you
this morning.

101
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:32,608
So, uh, I assume
you wanna talk about it?

102
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:34,070
No.

103
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,942
Prenup. Signed, sealed, delivered.

104
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:40,412
So we better gear up, huh?

105
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:49,716
I'm in position.
She makes one wrong move, I take the shot.

106
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:53,490
Look, Chuck, a prenup doesn't mean
the end of our marriage.

107
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:58,158
Well, look, hey, you're a spy and spies
have secrets they need to protect. Cool.

108
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:00,270
No. I don't keep secrets from you.

109
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,102
- It's just, uh, family stuff.
- Got it. Done.

110
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:07,643
Yeah. Cool.

111
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:09,940
Heads up. Here they come.

112
00:06:26,832 --> 00:06:28,459
Okay.

113
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,498
I'm here
in the middle of nowhere. Why?

114
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,332
The Volkoff bombs were planted
in Castle.

115
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:37,270
Two men died
and the CIA holds you responsible.

116
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:42,871
I'd never do that. I'm a businesswoman.
I'm trying to make Volkoff Industries...

117
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:44,640
into a legitimate enterprise.

118
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:47,148
I gave a list
of every black market agent...

119
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,447
I swept out all the operatives.
I even brought you something.

120
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:54,191
From an arsenal
of my father's weapons.

121
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,327
- What is it?
- I don't know.

122
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:59,953
Look, I want nothing to do with
my father's world. Do you trust me?

123
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:06,026
- Snipers! Hit the ground!
- Casey, stand down. Stand down.

124
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:09,503
It's not us. I don't know who it is.
I can't pinpoint the shooters.

125
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:12,507
Snipers? This is a setup?

126
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:15,009
What? No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait!
Vivian, wait!

127
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,977
- No, this isn't us.
- Go, go, go.

128
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:19,781
Unh! I trusted you!
How could you do this to me?

129
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:23,820
- Aah!
- Vivian!

130
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:36,766
We couldn't determine the source
of the shot. It wasn't us.

131
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:40,234
- And the weapon Vivian offered up?
- It's not in the Intersect...

132
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:45,035
and we can't figure out what it does.
- It proves nothing. The kill order stands.

133
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:49,108
Okay, hang on.
What if she was being straight with us...

134
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:52,613
and it is a deadly weapon?
That enough to recall her kill order?

135
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:55,411
And who exactly is going to give us
that intel?

136
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:58,189
There's only one man who can tell us.

137
00:07:58,356 --> 00:08:02,383
Unfortunately, he's also
the most dangerous man in the world.

138
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:04,722
It's true.

139
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:09,456
I cut in front of William
in the cafeteria line.

140
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:11,329
I admit, I...

141
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:15,031
have entitlement issues.

142
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,336
I owe an amends.

143
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:21,704
My apologies.

144
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,874
Explore the feelings.

145
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,278
I feel...

146
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:29,079
I feel...

147
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:32,150
better.

148
00:08:32,357 --> 00:08:33,483
I feel...

149
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:37,754
Prisoner 9205, you have a visitor.

150
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:47,504
I feel like I'm about to have some fun.

151
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,490
Chuck 4x20 - Versus the Family Volkoff

152
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:33,638
- First off, we don't trust you.
- I understand.

153
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:35,970
I'm ashamed of myself.

154
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,416
There is an assassination order
out on your daughter, Vivian.

155
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,447
You can help remove it.

156
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:45,714
It's all my fault.

157
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:47,152
Absentee parent.

158
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:49,916
What's with this good-guy act?

159
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:55,397
Charles, Sarah, I've had a lot of time
to think about my life.

160
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:58,934
I'm not interested
in how the world can serve me anymore.

161
00:10:00,238 --> 00:10:02,570
I'm interested in how I can serve
my fellow man.

162
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:07,075
Sure, awesome. Well, if that's the case...

163
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:15,108
if we identify this weapon, we can
help rescind your daughter's kill order.

164
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:16,412
That's the Norseman.

165
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:19,951
It's a DNA tracker.

166
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,685
A tiny sample and a target
or a family of targets...

167
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:26,159
can be picked out of a crowd
and killed instantly.

168
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:28,899
There are two other components.

169
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,597
Where are they?

170
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,328
That's valuable information.

171
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:36,531
Now, there's the conniving,
manipulative Volkoff I know.

172
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,938
The requirement for spiritual growth...

173
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,601
is making apologies
to all the people I've harmed.

174
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:43,837
Making amends.

175
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:45,949
Most important to me is my daughter.

176
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:49,918
For five minutes with Vivian...

177
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:52,556
I'll get the other components
for you.

178
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:55,284
I see.
Let you out of jail so you can escape?

179
00:10:57,028 --> 00:10:59,223
Sorry, not falling for it.

180
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:01,826
Hey, Dad.

181
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,295
Um, I am so sorry.

182
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:08,166
Mom sent out invitations to Morgan's
new address instead of the Buy More.

183
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,397
Not an issue.

184
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:12,065
I'm meeting Mom after the ceremony
for dinner.

185
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:16,373
But I told her between dinner and the
party, I was having drinks with friends.

186
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:19,315
- You lied to her.
- Then I can come meet you...

187
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:21,975
and show you a video
of the ceremony and...

188
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:27,051
- That would be an intrusion. I really...
- I want you to be a part of this.

189
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:33,528
- You name the place, I'll be there.
- Great.

190
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:37,365
- Ah. Oh, uh, okay.
- Oh.

191
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:42,002
So, uh, I'll be in touch.

192
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:43,538
Great.

193
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:44,867
Roger that.

194
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:46,237
- Hi.
- See you later.

195
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:47,901
- Okay.
- Ugh.

196
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:50,113
Since Volkoff identified the Norseman...

197
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:53,114
Langley is putting the hunt
for Vivian on a back burner.

198
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:55,343
They want
the additional weapon components.

199
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,286
We'd be happy to, except the weapon's
not in the Intersect and the only man...

200
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,584
who can find the components is...
- Coming in right about now.

201
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,387
Say what?

202
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,234
- What is this?
- I'm not normally one...

203
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:23,778
to question authority, general...
- Not the time to start, team.

204
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,308
- Mr. Volkoff.
- Thank you.

205
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:29,543
Please brief the team.

206
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:33,914
The man who has
the Norseman targeting component...

207
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:37,584
is a well-known high seas pirate.
Ellyas Abshir.

208
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:45,933
Ellyas Abshir.

209
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:48,800
Kidnapper, vessel thief.
Last seen in Mogadishu.

210
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:52,670
- How did the pirate get the component?
- I lost it in a poker game.

211
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:54,243
He's addicted to gambling.

212
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:57,973
I'm not buying his newfound spirituality.
What's in it for Volkoff?

213
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,811
The general caved to my demands.

214
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,681
Really? No alarm bells ringing here
for anyone else?

215
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:08,348
Not getting the sense
we're being played for suckers?

216
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,460
The Norseman is extremely dangerous.
Washington wants it now.

217
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,961
Damn the risks.

218
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:17,096
Volkoff will accompany you
to retrieve the component.

219
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:20,101
For the next 48 hours,
he is your responsibility.

220
00:13:21,272 --> 00:13:22,864
So...

221
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:25,633
when do we fly?

222
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,821
My cover is a Volkoff agent.
I'm going in and I just need the layout.

223
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:48,162
Beckman uploaded a layout
of the compound by Sky Drive.

224
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,528
Only way in is through the front door.

225
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:52,329
It's a rat's nest of a hellhole.

226
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:58,798
But the gambling's good,
buffet is decent.

227
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:01,344
It should be me going in.

228
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:05,411
- That's my job.
- Then you tell him that I sent you.

229
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:08,346
It'll scare the hell out of him.

230
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:10,677
Sad, isn't it?

231
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:13,483
Why do I always choose fear
over love?

232
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:14,750
Okay, Oprah.

233
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,856
Park it. Come on.

234
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:25,735
Hey, you, uh, good? You're being awfully
cool about the whole prenup thing.

235
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,762
Yeah. It's a nonissue.

236
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:30,339
Don't you wanna know
why I asked you to sign it?

237
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:33,773
- You'd tell me when you were ready.
- It's got nothing to do with us.

238
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,037
No, I get it.

239
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:37,673
Is that cool?

240
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:39,511
Yeah.

241
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:42,851
So really, the missing link
isn't actually missing.

242
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:45,421
It's a misnomer
when a fossil shows a specimen...

243
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,582
- ...in a state of intermediary development.
- It's missing.

244
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,120
You think it's wise...

245
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:52,125
to argue in front of the baby?
- No.

246
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:54,526
The Agent-X file I showed my mom
is missing.

247
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,391
It happened after we left
for breakfast.

248
00:14:57,702 --> 00:14:59,135
My mom was here babysitting.

249
00:14:59,303 --> 00:15:02,170
Why would she delete a file
from my dad's computer?

250
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:07,108
Honey, you're going from zero to 60.
I think you just gotta calm down.

251
00:15:09,914 --> 00:15:14,078
Mom, it's me. Can you call me
when you get this, please? Thanks.

252
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:16,186
I don't know, Devon.

253
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:19,220
Something is not right.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

254
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,948
Watch him.

255
00:15:24,128 --> 00:15:26,221
Did I hear prenup?

256
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:30,766
- You overheard a private conversation.
- I think you're handling it really well.

257
00:15:30,935 --> 00:15:34,166
You're seeing her side of things.
That's so important.

258
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:37,603
You know, Dr. Nelson, the prison shrink,
he taught us...

259
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:41,302
that a major part of recovery
is seeing the opposing points of view.

260
00:15:42,246 --> 00:15:43,975
Thanks, Dr. Nelson.

261
00:15:44,148 --> 00:15:48,175
Charles, I've been thinking a lot
about your mother lately.

262
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:52,584
I owe her an amends. Do you think
if you talk to me, you might...?

263
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:55,487
You're a kind of a sore subject.

264
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:57,955
Of course.

265
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,231
- Ready?
- Okay, Charles, remember...

266
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,263
you're a criminal.

267
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:06,494
You work for me.

268
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:10,630
You work for Volkoff.

269
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:24,047
I'm looking for Ellyas Abshir.

270
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:25,313
Who are you?

271
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:27,820
I work for Alexei Volkoff.

272
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:35,630
Volkoff. Volkoff. Alexei Volkoff?
Did I not pronounce that correctly?

273
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,132
Sometimes, the Russian thing,
the W's, the V's.

274
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:40,293
Wolkoff, perhaps?

275
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:53,480
Alexei Volkoff is a powerless worm
in a U.S. Penitentiary.

276
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:54,982
He still has a little pull.

277
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:58,486
He sent me here to broker a deal
for the Norseman tracking device.

278
00:16:58,656 --> 00:16:59,680
Not for sale.

279
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:05,994
- Why didn't you tell us Ellyas hates you?
- Everyone hates me.

280
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:07,495
I accept that.

281
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:10,930
I haven't mentioned my terms yet.
We're prepared to pay...

282
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:12,160
With your life?

283
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,462
Good.

284
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:17,106
I think maybe you're putting words
in my mouth.

285
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,470
Specifically the word "life."

286
00:17:19,644 --> 00:17:21,635
Come on.
Somali pirates wanna take him.

287
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:24,440
Go in with that firepower,
it's gonna be a bloodbath.

288
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:26,849
If you wanna get Charles out alive...

289
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:29,013
I need to be there.

290
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:33,890
- Fine.
- I can't go like this. They'd laugh.

291
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:37,492
Let me get a little something
out of my prison kit. Please.

292
00:17:37,662 --> 00:17:39,721
Pick a game.

293
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:41,831
Dice...

294
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:43,330
roulette...

295
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:44,559
cards.

296
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:46,794
You win, the tracker is yours.

297
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:48,029
I win...

298
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:50,401
you die.

299
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:57,371
Do you have Uno?

300
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:03,911
Honestly, sweetheart, I copied one file
to cross-reference in the CIA database.

301
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:06,248
When I put the flash drive in,
it disappeared.

302
00:18:06,424 --> 00:18:08,358
Well, Mom,
why didn't you say anything?

303
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:10,517
I know it's important to you...

304
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:14,426
working with your dad's computer,
and I just... I felt stupid.

305
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:18,534
It's okay. The computer automatically
embeds backup files in the hard drive...

306
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:19,829
so I didn't lose anything.

307
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:21,494
- Oh, good. Good.
- Yeah.

308
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:23,435
If we're gonna make that reservation...

309
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:25,734
- ...we should get going.
- Okay.

310
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:28,005
Okay.

311
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:29,838
Okay.

312
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:32,047
Okay.

313
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:35,513
Go on.
Get out of here. Have some fun.

314
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:38,712
- All right. We'll see you in a few hours.
- Okay.

315
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:50,263
Let's drop this plan
and actually go to dinner.

316
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:52,925
The woman has the technical savvy
of Steve Jobs.

317
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:54,935
She didn't just erase a file.

318
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:57,700
We're gonna stand here,
wait for her to do something?

319
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:00,376
Oh, we didn't have to wait very long.

320
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:06,242
She's doing it.

321
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:09,811
Okay. She's spending the night,
we follow her in the morning.

322
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:12,581
- See what she's doing with the file.
- We're not spies.

323
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:17,057
Act like it. She's keeping something
from me and I wanna know why.

324
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:34,339
Sir, the tracking device.

325
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:50,616
I...

326
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:56,098
- Draw four.
- You're a cheater. You just cheated.

327
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,701
He cheated.
I saw you palm a card out of your...

328
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:01,497
Tell it to Saint Peter, dead man.

329
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:13,446
Hello, Ellyas.

330
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:15,551
You cheated.

331
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:17,516
Give him the targeting device.

332
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:20,987
You are supposed to be locked up.
What the hell is happening here?

333
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:23,319
I'll show you
what the hell's happening here.

334
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:26,453
Ooh!

335
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,531
Your morality is in a state
of development.

336
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:32,366
For once in your life,
you're gonna play fair.

337
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:35,531
The tracking device or your life.

338
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:40,000
- Take it. It's yours.
- Thank you.

339
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:43,644
We do have one problem.

340
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:48,979
- What's the problem?
- There's something I've gotta do.

341
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:51,018
And it's gonna be really painful.

342
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:54,487
- We need to get out of here right now.
- We got it. Let's roll.

343
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,421
Come on, Alexei, we gotta go now.

344
00:20:56,594 --> 00:20:59,825
You know me.
You know what I'm capable of, Ellyas.

345
00:21:00,831 --> 00:21:03,561
The time has come for me...

346
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:06,797
For me to...

347
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,332
apologize.

348
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:15,743
I want you to understand...

349
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:20,540
I, like all other men,
am still a work in progress.

350
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,412
What do you say, Ellyas?
Forgive and forget?

351
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:27,118
Um...

352
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,717
Okay?

353
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:36,225
Okay.

354
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:40,263
Go.

355
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:42,463
Okay, okay.

356
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:45,402
- I feel so free.
- Do you?

357
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:46,770
- That's...
- Ha, ha.

358
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:50,738
Thanks for your time. Such a good
feeling, isn't it? Here we go. Let's go.

359
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:53,713
Thank you, Mogadishu, and good night!
Come on.

360
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:05,021
- All that remains
- Thorium.

361
00:22:05,196 --> 00:22:07,630
- My finest piece of work.
- Where does it come from?

362
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:12,428
Far-off land. To mine it, I had to wage
war against the peaceful natives...

363
00:22:12,603 --> 00:22:16,699
and ordered the destruction
of their Hometree.

364
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:22,412
I'm just kidding.

365
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,606
They showed it
to us last week. Avatar.

366
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:27,444
- So it's rare.
- Incredibly.

367
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:30,052
And chances you don't know its location
are slim.

368
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:33,816
My grandmother always used to say
play your cards close to the vest.

369
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:37,222
And wear a coat over the vest
or you'll look like a jerk.

370
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:41,159
Team, good progress,
but Langley is getting antsy.

371
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:45,062
Well, general, we think Volkoff knows
where the killing agent is...

372
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:46,897
but he's being uncool about it.

373
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:50,805
General, I want proof you're gonna keep
your side of the bargain.

374
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:53,842
There is a classified document
on the conference table.

375
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:56,571
A communication
between Vivian and the CIA.

376
00:22:56,947 --> 00:23:00,007
It's been redacted,
but you'll get the gist.

377
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:05,783
You're just gonna have to trust us.

378
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:19,333
The thorium's in a Swiss military bunker.
The locks are coded to my DNA.

379
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:22,631
We fly at midnight. Fuel my jet.

380
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:25,001
You don't have a jet.

381
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,402
Of course.

382
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:29,506
Old thinking.

383
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,772
It creeps back.

384
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:32,939
Let's creep back to your cell.
Come on.

385
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:37,514
Okay, honey, I'll call next week.

386
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:41,317
- And if you need anything, you call me.
- Okay. Thank you.

387
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:42,857
Bye.

388
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:52,630
- Target's on the move, Hot Mama.
- Copy that, Six Pack.

389
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:55,067
I got the baby, you get the car.

390
00:24:10,588 --> 00:24:12,488
"Meet me at 8.

391
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:15,056
The shooting range to celebrate.

392
00:24:15,225 --> 00:24:16,487
Love, Alex."

393
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,684
Hmm.

394
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:22,327
Hey, I just got your text.
What's going on?

395
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:25,024
Your sister is breaking
through the firewalls...

396
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:26,601
of the Orion computer.

397
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,933
What? No, no, no.
I knew about that, but I had Awesome...

398
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:32,735
take out the hard drive and disable it.
- He didn't.

399
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:35,372
And the progress she's making
in her access...

400
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:39,209
it's as if your father intended
for her to find out about the Intersect.

401
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:41,374
- Oh, my God.
- I've taken files piecemeal.

402
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:43,213
I think I got the dangerous ones...

403
00:24:43,387 --> 00:24:45,480
but she's onto me.
She's following me.

404
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:49,590
Okay. Okay. Let's think about this.

405
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,558
Let's think about this.
What are we gonna do?

406
00:24:53,097 --> 00:24:57,898
The time has come for her to find out
what it is you do for the CIA.

407
00:24:58,068 --> 00:25:00,628
No. Mom, we've been down
that road before, okay?

408
00:25:00,804 --> 00:25:03,796
She gets the truth now,
she could resent me for all the lies...

409
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:07,136
and it'll tear us apart.
- She is finding out on her own...

410
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:09,108
which could be infinitely worse.

411
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,113
Our family has relied on secrets and lies
for way too long.

412
00:25:13,283 --> 00:25:16,480
- Bartowski, Beckman's on the monitor.
- I'll be right there.

413
00:25:16,654 --> 00:25:20,249
Not you, Bartowski. The other Bartowski.
She says it's urgent.

414
00:25:22,092 --> 00:25:23,150
We'll discuss later.

415
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:24,886
Okay.

416
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:32,464
I'd like the second file from Orion's
computer to be the last that I acquire.

417
00:25:32,636 --> 00:25:36,094
It's not gonna be easy to keep secrets
from my daughter much longer.

418
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,937
Cards on the table?

419
00:25:40,177 --> 00:25:42,839
Washington is hungry
to expand the Intersect program.

420
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:46,244
Ellie has unlocked material
our best technicians couldn't get near.

421
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,578
We've never even heard of Agent-X.

422
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:52,017
Neither have I, but that doesn't mean
it's related to the Intersect.

423
00:25:52,189 --> 00:25:57,126
Still, it seems Ellie has exclusive access.
The director wants her to keep working.

424
00:25:57,294 --> 00:26:00,786
Diane, she's not a spy.
She's my daughter.

425
00:26:00,964 --> 00:26:05,196
Mary, I'm sorry,
but it comes from the top.

426
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:10,305
Oh, Danny boy

427
00:26:10,474 --> 00:26:14,410
The pipes are calling

428
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,204
Oh, Danny boy

429
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:19,008
Volkoff is here?

430
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:20,946
What the hell is going on?

431
00:26:21,118 --> 00:26:23,985
He got a 48-hour furlough
to get us the Norseman.

432
00:26:24,288 --> 00:26:26,813
It wasn't in your Volkoff file.
Have you heard of it?

433
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,290
Just whispered about. Never laid eyes
on it, which is worrisome.

434
00:26:31,462 --> 00:26:32,895
Watch your back, Chuck.

435
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,827
Maybe he's a changed man.

436
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:40,034
- He asked to see you to make amends.
- We're talking about Alexei Volkoff.

437
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:42,035
His mind is twisted.

438
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:46,404
Never believe a word he says.
And never let him out of your sight.

439
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,678
You understand?

440
00:26:52,116 --> 00:26:53,549
Cool.

441
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:09,726
No guns, no ambush.

442
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,336
- Maybe this isn't a trap after all.
- Yeah.

443
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:16,530
Can't trust a limey with good teeth.

444
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:19,767
Well, we have Mr. Cool in there.
What do we have to worry about?

445
00:27:19,943 --> 00:27:22,434
Bartowski, we lose audio,
we're coming in.

446
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,238
- Sounds good, buddy.
- The thorium is behind this door.

447
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,744
But first, to get in,
I gotta win a game of chess.

448
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:35,553
It's fully automated, constantly evolving.
Plus, there's a five-minute clock.

449
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:37,717
I guess there's consequences
if you lose.

450
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:39,419
Oh, yeah.

451
00:27:39,596 --> 00:27:42,963
Well, you don't have to stay.
You can wait with your friends.

452
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:48,066
Alexei, as much as I like staying away
from life-threatening situations...

453
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,302
wherever you go...

454
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:53,409
I go.

455
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:57,976
Fasten your seat belt.
It's gonna be a bumpy match.

456
00:28:00,684 --> 00:28:05,383
Welcome, Mr. Volkoff.
Ready to play a game?

457
00:28:19,403 --> 00:28:21,769
Alexei, just stay cool.

458
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:25,807
Yeah, I know you don't like
Bartowski's groovy attitude.

459
00:28:25,976 --> 00:28:27,910
God knows where he gets these ideas.

460
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:30,911
Well, it kind of threw me
when he just signed that prenup.

461
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:34,778
- That's what you would've done.
- But now I see Chuck's side of it.

462
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:39,787
Flipping out about our relationship boiled
down to the contents of an envelope.

463
00:28:39,957 --> 00:28:42,790
Seeing the end
before we've even started.

464
00:28:43,293 --> 00:28:44,351
So why the prenup?

465
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:48,822
I have money socked away
in case my dad gets arrested again.

466
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,194
Well, I'm sure Bartowski
could handle it.

467
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:54,860
Any excuse to weep and hug.

468
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,007
Yeah, well, it's more about
what it dredges up for me.

469
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:02,475
My relationship with my family
and having to take sides.

470
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:04,773
Caught between your parents, huh?

471
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:06,547
Tough place to be.

472
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,378
Hardest place for a kid
is right in the middle.

473
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:12,050
Roger that.

474
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:20,186
Check, Mr. Volkoff.

475
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:26,367
Shake it off, shake it off.
You're doing great.

476
00:29:31,642 --> 00:29:33,667
You are still in check, Mr. Volkoff.

477
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,541
If this is Mr. Volkoff.

478
00:29:39,182 --> 00:29:41,582
Guns. Big guns.

479
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:43,384
Lots of bullets.

480
00:29:43,987 --> 00:29:46,182
Sort of overkill.

481
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:48,885
Story of my life.

482
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:51,721
What is going on with you?
Come on. Let's do this.

483
00:29:53,697 --> 00:29:58,157
I used to love games like this. I didn't care
whether I lived or died. Now I do care.

484
00:29:58,335 --> 00:30:00,200
I don't wanna die.

485
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,894
I'm gonna lose. I'm gonna die.

486
00:30:02,072 --> 00:30:04,905
No. You're not gonna die.
We're not gonna die right now.

487
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:07,339
I get that you're trying
to better yourself.

488
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:10,275
But would a spiritual man freeze
in the face of adversity?

489
00:30:10,447 --> 00:30:13,905
Would he choke and die so close
to fixing things with his daughter?

490
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:18,350
Would he hide under a table if his
fiancée handed him a prenup to sign?

491
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:21,749
No, he wouldn't because he'd be cool.

492
00:30:24,428 --> 00:30:25,918
- It's not working.
- Damn it!

493
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:30,965
You still have the DNA
of the world's most evil weapons dealer.

494
00:30:31,134 --> 00:30:32,396
You are a villain, sir.

495
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:36,869
Your name strikes fear in the hearts
of even the toughest of swine.

496
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,632
And that name is...

497
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:42,204
- Alexei Volkoff.
- You say it like you mean it.

498
00:30:42,746 --> 00:30:45,738
My name is...

499
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:48,350
Alexei Volkoff.

500
00:30:48,852 --> 00:30:50,752
World's biggest badass.

501
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:54,880
Killer of men, conqueror of nations.

502
00:30:55,158 --> 00:30:57,786
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Game, guns, clock.

503
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:10,164
What's going on?

504
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,509
Right into my trap.

505
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:21,011
Checkmate.

506
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:27,083
Ha, ha. Good. Now get a move on...

507
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:29,691
before the computer
changes its mind, okay?

508
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:37,196
We're losing audio.

509
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:40,164
What is that? Is that Russian?

510
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:42,796
- Yeah. Go.
- We need to go.

511
00:31:48,812 --> 00:31:51,906
The last level of security
is coded to my DNA.

512
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:08,195
I assume that's thorium.
Let's get this over with.

513
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:10,026
We'll get to that.

514
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:13,799
But first,
I have an amends to make to you.

515
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,871
Oh, yeah? Well, uh, I'm well aware
of all the bad things you've done.

516
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,237
- I'm learning not to hold it against you.
- It's not what I've done.

517
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:21,843
It's what I'm about to do.

518
00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:23,638
Chuck?

519
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:26,413
Hey. We just picked up some Russian
on the radio.

520
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,051
- How long is this gonna take?
- See, you were right.

521
00:32:29,219 --> 00:32:31,813
I'm Alexei Volkoff.

522
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,953
And always will be.

523
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,323
Wait, wait, wait. What is happening?

524
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:44,490
This is what we call the twist.

525
00:32:48,205 --> 00:32:50,673
I have a company to run.
I need leverage to run it.

526
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:53,275
Norseman is the most dangerous weapon
in the world.

527
00:32:53,477 --> 00:32:56,105
I just needed my father's DNA
to get the killing agent.

528
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,008
What? So this is a setup?

529
00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:03,245
You were shot.

530
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,525
- You two never communicated.
- Yes, we did.

531
00:33:10,894 --> 00:33:15,228
The minute you showed me
the Norseman component...

532
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:17,696
I knew it was a message
from my daughter.

533
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:20,428
You and I are gonna run
this company together.

534
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:23,638
Vivian, I owe you...

535
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:25,206
the humblest amends...

536
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:28,970
for being totally absent during
the formative years of your childhood.

537
00:33:29,146 --> 00:33:31,876
There will be plenty of time
for that, Father.

538
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:37,383
Thorium is useless
without the other components.

539
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:39,715
The other components
are what's useless.

540
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,256
They can be rebuilt.

541
00:33:43,293 --> 00:33:45,158
But you'll never have this.

542
00:33:45,328 --> 00:33:46,522
Place the grenades.

543
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:51,399
Now, Viv, darling,
get these handcuffs off your father.

544
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:54,731
- We've got a lot of work to do.
- Sorry, but here's the real twist.

545
00:33:54,905 --> 00:33:58,341
Dead by your own plasma grenades,
impossible to defuse.

546
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,506
Young lady...

547
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:05,648
you get me
out of these handcuffs immediately.

548
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:07,783
This is your father talking.

549
00:34:08,084 --> 00:34:11,747
- Trust no one. You taught me that.
- It didn't include me.

550
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:16,154
- Vivian, you are not this person.
- You don't know who I am.

551
00:34:16,326 --> 00:34:20,626
You have both lied to me,
betrayed me and shattered my life!

552
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:24,597
Vivian, darling,
I've always been on your side.

553
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:27,794
The photographs? The necklace?

554
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:30,371
Tokens from a stranger!

555
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:32,667
I don't know you.

556
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:35,703
I will never know you. Goodbye.

557
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,073
Vivian.

558
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:47,119
Vivian. Please.

559
00:34:51,328 --> 00:34:53,489
Let's get to the bombs
and see what we can do.

560
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:58,164
Maybe I can get through them.

561
00:34:58,335 --> 00:34:59,825
Gonna carry us on your back?

562
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,638
Is there any other escape
from this room?

563
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,971
She hates me.

564
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,134
Whoo.

565
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,177
No, I'm sure
she's just going through a phase.

566
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:12,542
Actually, she's not going
through a phase...

567
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:14,377
but snap out of this right now.

568
00:35:14,551 --> 00:35:16,416
- Just let me die.
- We all die.

569
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,353
What would Dr. Nelson say?
You're not seeing it from her side.

570
00:35:20,523 --> 00:35:23,515
If your recovery was real,
you'd see she's just hurt and angry.

571
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:26,059
- I failed her.
- No. You made a great first step...

572
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:29,630
in repairing your relationship.
It's just gonna take more work.

573
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:30,993
You really believe that?

574
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,260
We have 10 more seconds left.
Just forget about him!

575
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:55,756
Uh, modified directed EMP.

576
00:35:57,727 --> 00:35:59,922
This year's innovation.

577
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,731
I was gonna tell her all my secrets.
We were gonna be partners.

578
00:36:07,037 --> 00:36:08,766
Not anymore.

579
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:13,709
Welcome to the future.

580
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:26,480
Why did she do this?

581
00:36:27,057 --> 00:36:30,220
She's my daughter.
She takes after me.

582
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,552
Please, Charles, take me home.

583
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,368
Alexei.

584
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:42,433
I understand you wanted a minute.

585
00:36:42,772 --> 00:36:44,433
Mary?

586
00:36:45,575 --> 00:36:48,305
- You well?
- What is it you wanted to say?

587
00:36:51,748 --> 00:36:54,182
I have done terrible things.

588
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:56,579
I've been evil.

589
00:36:57,687 --> 00:37:00,747
But I was drawn to the goodness in you.

590
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:04,154
Alexei, this is not necessary.
- Yes, it is.

591
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:11,695
I was not worthy of your love...

592
00:37:12,135 --> 00:37:13,693
like Orion was.

593
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:16,763
Please accept my apology...

594
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,273
and know that I'm doing my best
to improve.

595
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:29,615
Thank you, Charles.

596
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:39,051
Remember, family and friends
are everything.

597
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:42,790
Money, greed and power are a dance
with Satan.

598
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:46,166
And he looks like me.

599
00:37:57,347 --> 00:37:59,542
- Dad, don't say it again.
- Mm-mm.

600
00:37:59,716 --> 00:38:03,675
We'll have dinner the day after graduation.
I don't want you lying on my behalf.

601
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:07,254
Me neither, but lying to her kind of goes
with our territory.

602
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:10,551
It's not fair for you to be torn
between two parents. Not okay.

603
00:38:10,727 --> 00:38:13,218
You're my father.
I don't mind being in the middle...

604
00:38:13,396 --> 00:38:16,160
as long as that means
I get to have you in my life.

605
00:38:16,332 --> 00:38:17,492
I mind.

606
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,669
I respect that you don't wanna tell
your mother the truth, but...

607
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:28,107
we have to come up with a
compromise. I can't be there on the day.

608
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,508
Unless...

609
00:38:33,383 --> 00:38:37,251
Unless we tell your mom the truth.

610
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,512
That I'm alive.

611
00:38:39,122 --> 00:38:41,590
Yeah. Let's tell her the truth.

612
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,625
Oh, that scares me.

613
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:53,635
- Done.
- You don't have to do that.

614
00:38:53,803 --> 00:38:56,704
Please forget that
that ever existed, okay?

615
00:38:57,073 --> 00:39:00,008
And can you please stop
being so cool?

616
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:11,116
- That is so not cool.
- Just read it.

617
00:39:18,127 --> 00:39:23,224
"I, Sarah Walker,
promise to always love Chuck Bartowski.

618
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:26,232
In return, he will always love me."

619
00:39:27,637 --> 00:39:29,468
I can't read this fine print.

620
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,901
The fine print says:

621
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:35,010
"I promise Chuck that I will not
even contemplate the word 'divorce'...

622
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:37,146
and I will never use my prenup."

623
00:39:37,313 --> 00:39:39,304
I already signed it.

624
00:39:50,627 --> 00:39:52,254
Thank you.

625
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:56,423
Thanks.

626
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:03,566
Ellie.

627
00:40:04,507 --> 00:40:08,136
Sarah, I have to talk to Ellie now
or I'll lose my nerve, I know it.

628
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:09,437
Your mother is right.

629
00:40:09,612 --> 00:40:12,308
Ellie's better off finding out from you
than on her own.

630
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:15,349
- Should I finish my wine first?
- Come on, she'll understand.

631
00:40:15,518 --> 00:40:17,986
Chuck, being a spy
isn't just what you do...

632
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:20,088
but it's about who you are.

633
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:24,493
Go and tell her.

634
00:40:24,661 --> 00:40:26,219
Thanks. Be right back.

635
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,969
Hey, EI.

636
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:37,698
Hi. Uh, Devon's putting the baby down.

637
00:40:37,874 --> 00:40:39,705
Let's, uh, go over here.

638
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:45,474
That's some look
you got on your face.

639
00:40:45,648 --> 00:40:47,309
Well, uh...

640
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:50,744
I heard that you've been
kind of busy lately.

641
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,816
Yeah. Ha, ha. A newborn'll do that to you.

642
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:57,653
Yeah, that's true. Um...

643
00:41:00,163 --> 00:41:03,428
Is there anything pressing going on?
I should get dinner started.

644
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:06,193
EI, I need to talk to you
about Dad's computer.

645
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:10,933
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

646
00:41:12,175 --> 00:41:15,542
I thought that I uncovered
some secret files.

647
00:41:17,447 --> 00:41:20,507
Turned out to be cheats
on some video game he was developing.

648
00:41:21,184 --> 00:41:24,950
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Just gibberish, really.

649
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:31,387
Chicken á la king isn't gonna cook itself.
I'm gonna get in there.

650
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:33,654
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

651
00:41:43,206 --> 00:41:45,572
My sister just lied to me.

652
00:41:45,742 --> 00:41:48,540
She's never lied to me.

653
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:51,376
Not cool.

654
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:54,306
We build the device
as quickly as possible.

655
00:41:54,484 --> 00:41:56,748
There was only one man
my father was afraid of.

656
00:41:56,919 --> 00:42:00,719
One threat to Volkoff Industries.
He went by the name Agent-X.

657
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,450
I'm gonna track him down
and kill him.

658
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:05,924
Then no one can touch me. Ever.
