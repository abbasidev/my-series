1
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:29,815
That was easy.

2
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:35,625
Yeah, too easy.

3
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:40,165
Wasn't even fun.

4
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,935
Speak for yourself.

5
00:00:42,435 --> 00:00:44,225
I like easy.

6
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:51,315
Can it! We have work to do.

7
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,925
Mac, get the panel.

8
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,645
All right, let's have a look, boys.

9
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:18,915
There's enough gold in here for
us all to retire... five times.

10
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:21,715
That gold's being used to
secretly fund terrorists.

11
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:25,395
We're under strict orders from
President Clinton to seal this place up.

12
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:29,475
While I may not like him or his
mouthy wife, those are the orders.

13
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,795
Anyone tries to open this door

14
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:36,475
I'm just saying, you know?

15
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:42,915
Hidden in a vault... hidden in our
bags, what's the difference, Casey?

16
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:45,275
The difference is that
wasn't our mission.

17
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,155
Is that gonna be a
problem for you, Packard?

18
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:51,175
Well, actually, it is a problem for you.

19
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,625
You're outnumbered, pal.

20
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:58,405
You're both with him, huh?

21
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,855
I'd like to retire young.

22
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:03,275
Maybe move to Boca.

23
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:06,425
You can't blame the boys for
thinking about their future, Casey.

24
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:45,535
You'll have plenty of time to think
about your futures... in Leavenworth.

25
00:02:56,895 --> 00:03:01,695
Casey, Jeffrey and I were feeling
nostalgic for the days of the old Buy More.

26
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:05,975
So we decided, you know what would
make this place feel like home again?

27
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:08,195
Getting the gang back together.

28
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:09,155
You in, C-note?

29
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:10,795
I was never in your gang.

30
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:13,785
So what do you say, Friday
night, a little white zin,

31
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:15,345
a little Magic: The Gathering?

32
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:20,085
If you have the mana to
battle the other Planeswalkers.

33
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,135
"Have the ma..." This guy.

34
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:28,225
You think about it, let us know.

35
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:40,515
Symmetrical thing... Guess who?

36
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,115
Okay, soft, perfumed
hands... sweet, sweet feminine voice...

37
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:47,335
Chuck? That's easy. I
would know that any...

38
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:50,365
Ah, it's Alex! Aw, that's even better!

39
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:55,845
Wait a minute. Did you...
Did you just fist bump me?

40
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:58,125
Yeah, that's right because
I blow it up with everybody.

41
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:00,925
Did you know that? I do. I get... I
get silly with that, and, uh...

42
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:06,755
I know that. I know
we're dating, you know.

43
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:11,175
Just, you know, not everybody
here knows that we're dating.

44
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:16,705
Morgan, you said that you were
gonna talk to my dad about us.

45
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:17,435
I was going to.

46
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:19,855
I was. Check this out. Such a
funny story... Morgan, I get it.

47
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:24,305
My dad, he's very
intimidating. No, not, not the...

48
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:28,835
But it's really important to me
that we're honest with him, you know?

49
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:34,985
I have to get to class in 15, but... I
will talk to you later! Absolutely.

50
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:43,325
Still haven't told Casey yet, huh? No.

51
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:46,485
Well, be careful how you
break the news to him.

52
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:48,595
He might kill you accidentally.

53
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,755
Sound advice, Chuck. Thank you.

54
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,075
Yeah, you know, anytime.

55
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:56,155
Um, buddy, can you, can you
do me a favor? Of course.

56
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:58,075
Um, could you cover for me up here?

57
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:00,885
I got a little work to do downstairs.

58
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:04,115
We just got a file from Costa Gravas
detailing all of their interactions

59
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:06,545
with the Volkoff
Organization over the years.

60
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:09,885
Volkoff? I mean, that's good. This
will lead back to your mother, right?

61
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:10,755
Yeah, I certainly hope so.

62
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:14,905
I mean, ever since I told Ellie about the search,
the pressure's really been on to find her.

63
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:18,465
Ellie deserves to know the
truth just as much as I do, so...

64
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,995
Okay, I've gone through all of these
files, Chuck, and there is nothing on your mom.

65
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:26,305
Okay, okay, so maybe there's
nothing on "Frost" per se,

66
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,755
but perhaps there's
something "Frost-adjacent."

67
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:30,595
You know, something that
could lead us to her?

68
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:33,375
What about Volkoff's
prisons? What do you mean?

69
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:35,345
Volkoff has a network of
"black sites" across the world;

70
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:39,225
Basically, a private prison system
run by extraction specialists.

71
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:44,815
And if anybody is gonna know where
Volkoff's prisoners are held, it's these guys.

72
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:50,415
Ex
Special forces escspe UNIT COMMANSER JOHN CASEY

73
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:56,165
Sarah, those guys used to
work for someone we know.

74
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,765
After I secured the
gold using my handprint,

75
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,665
I dragged my former "team"
halfway across the desert,

76
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:04,765
thereby saving their
miserable, mutinous lives.

77
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,985
Oh, okay. Then what happened?

78
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:08,655
I had 'em court-martialed.

79
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:11,725
Of course, they promptly escaped
from a maximum security stockade.

80
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:16,835
To the Los Angeles underground, where
they survived as soldiers of fortune.

81
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,175
It's like The A-Team. You never...

82
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:21,774
Have you ever seen The A-Team?

83
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,045
I was The A-Team.

84
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:27,165
They've taken a couple of
shots at me over the years.

85
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:30,255
The last time, I taught
them to stay hidden.

86
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,375
Well, is there anything you can tell us
about how we might be able to find them now?

87
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:36,745
Casey, these guys may be
the key to locating my mom.

88
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:42,415
The only place I can think of to get these three
sons of bitches back together would be my funeral.

89
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:45,495
That's it!

90
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:48,555
Casey, I know how to find your old team.

91
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:51,795
We have to kill you.

92
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,417
Chuck 4x05 - Versus the Couch Lock

93
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:39,256
Let me get this right: You
want to use government resources

94
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:42,296
to stage a fake funeral
for Colonel Casey?

95
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:46,546
Well, yes, uh, General, I believe we have
a unique opportunity here to set a trap

96
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:49,016
for Casey's old team, who
happen to be Volkoff agents.

97
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:51,116
If they think I'm
dead, they'll come for this.

98
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:53,886
My handprint's the only way they're
gonna access that Iranian vault.

99
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:57,226
Here's the plan: First, we spread the news of
Casey's death through all the back channels

100
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:59,796
that civilians don't
monitor but Volkoff does.

101
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,616
Next up, we kill the Colonel.

102
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,126
You want him to play dead?

103
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:04,136
I'll be drugged, ma'am.

104
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:06,366
When Casey's former team
sees Casey's actual body,

105
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,906
we believe they'll drop their
guard, giving us the upper hand.

106
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,426
And then we'll move in.

107
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:12,956
We will control every entrance and exit.

108
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,466
Snipers will posted and at the ready.

109
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:18,896
And the audience will be filled
with agents that we've planted there.

110
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:24,226
All right. You've clearly thought
this through. The mission is a go.

111
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:24,986
Thank you, General.

112
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:27,646
Colonel Casey, Agent
Walker, you're both dismissed.

113
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:32,206
I'd like a word with
Agent Bartowski, alone.

114
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:43,086
I'm impressed; you've
really progressed as a spy.

115
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,706
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you very much.

116
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,816
But I'm not sure if
I know what you mean.

117
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:50,076
You've put duty above emotion.

118
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:52,156
I mean, using Colonel Casey as bait?

119
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:56,526
It usually takes years before an agent is
willing to put his teammates in harm's way.

120
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:59,666
Good tactical thinking, Bartowski.

121
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:07,916
Hmm, these pesky dress uniforms get a little
tight when you don't wear 'em for a while.

122
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:10,856
Listen, Casey, just want you to know
that if you feel the mission is

123
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:12,406
a little too dangerous
and you need to back out

124
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:14,556
for any reason.
I mean, I know that you and Alex have just

125
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:16,896
reestablished this kind of
father-daughter connection right now...

126
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:19,456
Walker will be there. It'll be fine.

127
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:20,626
I'm serious, Casey...

128
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:21,776
Why don't you just stick to the mission?

129
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:24,246
Tell me about the drug you're
gonna use to kill me, hmm?

130
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:26,706
What's it
called, Fake-a-deathanol?

131
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:27,726
Cute.

132
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:31,816
No. As a matter of fact, it's
called Tetrodotoxin.

133
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:33,206
Normally it would
just kill you outright,

134
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:37,266
but we've modified it so it'll just slow down
your breathing and heart rate. Outstanding.

135
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:40,056
You will come across
as being very, very dead,

136
00:09:40,306 --> 00:09:42,786
but in actuality, you'll be
very much alive and awake...

137
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,476
however, paralyzed. I'll
show you how it works.

138
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:47,966
No, it's not like it's the first
time I ever faked my own death.

139
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:52,006
About that, because you've been exposed
to so many truth serums and tranquilizers

140
00:09:52,236 --> 00:09:55,866
and what-have-you's throughout
your very long and colorful career,

141
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:59,026
we're not exactly sure how long the
drug's effects will last in your system,

142
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:02,736
so I'm gonna take the liberty of
stashing an extra hypo on your person.

143
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:07,026
I'd like a little alone time
before I die. *************.

144
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:09,206
One more thing, one more
thing, A little thing, uh...

145
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:12,156
Because Sarah and I are gonna
be busy during all of this,

146
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,826
we're gonna need someone
to deliver a eulogy.

147
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:17,736
I was thinking... Of course I'll do it.

148
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:19,276
Oh, man, what am I gonna
talk about, though?

149
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,946
I'm getting a little nervous, actually. I
think I'm starting to sweat.

150
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:23,656
Is that normal before a mish?

151
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:25,676
Can-Can I do that?
Can I all it a "mish"?

152
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:26,876
Sure, whatever, yeah.

153
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:31,006
I just thought, given the Alex situation of
it all, this is the perfect opportunity for you

154
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:33,676
to get in Casey's good
graces. I mean think about it.

155
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:38,726
Hel have no choice but to just lie there and
listen to every nice thing that you have to say.

156
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:41,426
See? This is why you, this is why...

157
00:10:41,636 --> 00:10:42,296
Are you expecting somebody?

158
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:43,466
No...

159
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:48,606
We have news.

160
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,576
On the count of three, okay?

161
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:52,456
Ready? One... It's a girl!

162
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:55,186
Wow! Hey, wow. Amazing.

163
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,476
I
I didn't know you guys were hoping for a girl.

164
00:10:57,686 --> 00:10:59,186
Oh, we would have been happy either way,

165
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:02,306
but I'm just excited to see my
babe with a papoose strapped to her.

166
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:04,226
Is that weird that I find that hot?

167
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:06,466
I don't - yeah, it's kind of...
I don't know what a papoose is.

168
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:07,176
Papoose. It's a good
time for them to drink.

169
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:08,876
I can't do that, obviously, but
why don't you guys...

170
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,496
Oh, yeah! Yeah, pop it up!
Let's do it, let's do it.

171
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:13,026
Congratulations. Thank you, thank you.

172
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:14,776
Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah.

173
00:11:17,856 --> 00:11:20,656
Uh, well, it's-it's about Mom.

174
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:23,836
I know that I said I was worried about
you looking for her, but I changed my mind.

175
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:27,136
I... I want to know
what happened to her.

176
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:30,986
Uh, what-what made you change your mind?

177
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:35,066
I just got to thinking, you
know, I'm having a little girl, and...

178
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:38,246
is she ever going to
know her grandmother?

179
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:44,636
Uh, well, I just found a promising lead.

180
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:48,316
So if it goes anywhere, you'll
be the first to know, okay?

181
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:49,726
Okay.

182
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,236
All right. Let's have some champagne.

183
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,116
Great. Well, I'll have a drink.

184
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:54,416
You will, for me. You
can have some water.

185
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,526
He looks so peaceful.

186
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:07,976
Oh, whoa! That's freaky.

187
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,016
I didn't know he could do that.
Did you know he could do that?

188
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:11,116
I knew he could do that.

189
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:13,436
Stop doing that. Don't stare at me.

190
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:16,746
Okay, I got to go over
my notes. Listen to me.

191
00:12:17,056 --> 00:12:18,266
Don't you worry about a thing.

192
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:20,866
I am gonna eulogize the
hell out of you, buddy.

193
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,096
Right. Got this.

194
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:31,506
Snipers are all in position. We're set.

195
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,216
Hey, Alex, it's me, Morgan.

196
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,146
In case you don't
recognize my voice yet.

197
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:40,576
That's my voice.

198
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:42,956
Just wanted to call you
and let you know that, uh,

199
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:45,436
I'm going to tell your
dad about us today.

200
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,346
I got the perfect spot for it.

201
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:50,366
Do you find it kind of sad that
the only people who showed up

202
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,406
for Casey's funeral are the
agents that we planted here?

203
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:56,566
That's not true.

204
00:12:57,606 --> 00:12:58,826
Is it?

205
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,466
No, no, you're right.

206
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:12,356
There are people here who also hate him.

207
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,976
Target one is in position.

208
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:28,056
What?

209
00:13:30,246 --> 00:13:31,666
He just stabbed him with a pin.

210
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,366
He can still feel pain, you know.

211
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:35,226
Yeah, he's gonna be okay.

212
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:46,586
Just let him know,"Casey, I'm
dating your daughter."End of story.

213
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:50,056
Uh-uh, end of story."Take charge.

214
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:55,336
Showtime.

215
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:01,356
Please be seated.

216
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:02,806
Whoa, sorry.

217
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,956
You're sitting.

218
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:10,166
You know, if there was one word
I'd choose to describe John Casey,

219
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:13,856
that word would be: "forgiveness."

220
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:18,106
Big, gun-loving, Commie-hating
forgiveness.

221
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:22,566
There was something I wanted to
tell John before he, before he passed.

222
00:14:22,776 --> 00:14:24,626
There's something I
need to get off my chest.

223
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:33,106
Oh, no... I - I know John is somewhere out there...
beneath the pale moonlight, listening intently.

224
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:38,836
I wanted to tell him
how handsome he was.

225
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:40,476
And I never got a chance, darn it.

226
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:42,086
That man could fill out a uniform.

227
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:43,736
That's not a physique
of a middle-aged man.

228
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:46,856
Am I right or am I right
or, uh, or am I right?

229
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:49,726
'Cause.
It's hot in here, isn't it?

230
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:56,336
But so what else is there to
say about, about John Casey?

231
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:57,966
Well, he was a big man.

232
00:14:58,186 --> 00:15:00,016
Big biceps, big hands.

233
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:00,946
I used to call them mitts.

234
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:05,336
You know, they were like giant mitts that
could fit all the way around my neck, anyway.

235
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:09,136
And I once, I actually saw
him palm an entire watermelon.

236
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,536
Just one of his many strange hobbies.

237
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:15,916
Also, he has very large feet.

238
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,936
Should we maybe move in before
someone takes a blowtorch to his face?

239
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:20,926
No, we still have to
wait for the other guy.

240
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:24,426
I could use them as-as a
kayak, in case of an emergency.

241
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:25,606
2012 and all that.

242
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:27,756
It's okay; Casey's
been through much worse.

243
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:31,676
His neck was always very, very thick.

244
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,776
And I was always very jealous
of it, 'cause I think, uh,

245
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:37,476
in Roman times, it was a sign of a
great warrior to have a neck like that.

246
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:38,196
Uh, don't quote me on that.

247
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:42,926
That's Wikipedia, so it's
probably, uh, at best, spotty...

248
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,946
Uh, where am I going with this?

249
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:49,006
Uh, well, maybe a better question is where
John Casey would want me to go with this.

250
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,296
They're getting up. Be
ready to move on my mark.

251
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:56,616
But, alas, we shall never know, for he
no longer walketh among the living.

252
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,856
We miss you, J-Case. That's for sure.

253
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:05,916
And, uh, please, come back soon.

254
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:08,536
In song and limerick.

255
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:09,986
Is he crying?

256
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:12,666
I'm done. Good-bye.

257
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:22,936
Did you really think we'd come
to Casey's funeral unprepared?

258
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:25,046
- You're all under arrest.
- Give up now.

259
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:26,866
We have every exit covered.

260
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,626
I think you missed one.

261
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:43,956
Has anyone got them?

262
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:46,496
Anyone?

263
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,346
I lost Casey.

264
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:09,446
I can't believe this.

265
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:11,456
I got Casey to fake his own death.

266
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,826
And now he can't defend
himself. This is all my fault.

267
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:17,916
Call Tactical. I want a hundred men locked
and loaded, ready to go on my command.

268
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,746
- Did you find him yet?
- I'm working on it.

269
00:17:23,436 --> 00:17:25,696
Got it, got it. Tracker's engaged. We
have a lock on his location.

270
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:26,946
Okay, I'll call the strike team.

271
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,256
Please be alive, Casey.

272
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,726
This is Agent Bartowski. Target
needs assistance ASAP.

273
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,726
Move in right now. Do you copy?

274
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:36,376
This is Tactical. We're at the location.

275
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:37,716
Do you have him?

276
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:46,646
They put his tracker on a what?

277
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:49,836
No, God, no! No, don't shoot it!

278
00:17:52,146 --> 00:17:53,546
They took off his tracker
and put it on a cat.

279
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:55,616
Then where's Casey?

280
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,876
All right, so we got to chop his arm off.

281
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:00,186
It's the left one, right?

282
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:01,676
I was planning on doing it with this.

283
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:05,226
Not with a knife, no. Too dull.

284
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:07,026
What we need is a surgical saw.

285
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:08,386
I got one in the other room.

286
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,956
Yeah, you mess up his hand, you
won't be able to open the vault.

287
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:26,596
Move... Move, damn it.

288
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:28,456
Move.

289
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:35,906
- Mac, you look like Dr. Frankenstein.
- Now we're talking.

290
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:45,216
Like cutting into a
bird on Thanksgiving.

291
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:52,956
Doorbell. Mackintosh.

292
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:55,296
Get your guns.

293
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:59,016
Come on, come on, come
on, come on. Check it.

294
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:04,196
Hey, buddy, is there anything I can
do? Anything at all to be useful?

295
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:08,146
Um, you know, right now, Morgan, the best thing
you can do is help keep Casey's cover, all right?

296
00:19:08,326 --> 00:19:11,326
So if anyone asks about him
upstairs, just say he's on a delivery.

297
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:14,876
I should get back upstairs, right?

298
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,616
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

299
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:19,806
Sarah, there's got to
be some way to find him.

300
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,666
You had to order a pizza.

301
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,146
What, do you want to eat pizza
after we cut the guy's arm off?

302
00:19:44,386 --> 00:19:46,336
- I want to eat pizza now.
- Now is the time to eat pizza.

303
00:19:46,556 --> 00:19:47,926
Right, you're right.

304
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:02,096
Looks like John Casey ain't so dead.

305
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:44,876
Casey. Code red. I've been drugged.

306
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:49,536
Don't know how long... stay conscious.

307
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:55,086
Need extraction. In an alley.
4th and Hill.

308
00:20:55,626 --> 00:20:58,636
I'll be in a Dumpster.
Don't worry, Casey.

309
00:20:58,866 --> 00:20:59,476
I know that Dumpster.

310
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,626
Wait, who is this? Where's Chuck?

311
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:03,096
We're on the way.

312
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:08,406
Lester. Nerd Herd emergency. Man
down. Meet me at the Herder.

313
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:17,376
We track Casey's cell to
this alley. Stay alert.

314
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:26,716
- Damn it. He's not here.
- Yeah, well, he was.

315
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:28,346
Well, he can't have gotten far.

316
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,396
There's got to be a clue or something.

317
00:21:31,496 --> 00:21:33,896
- Like an open window.
- He could be inside. I'll call ctical.

318
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:34,976
No, no, no. We don't he time to waste.

319
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:36,906
We're here right now. Let's go.

320
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:42,296
Always the straitlaced ones.

321
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:45,106
I told you, everyone needs to
get their freak on sometime.

322
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:47,966
What's with the uniform, you
think? I got one, too.

323
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:50,806
Sometimes I like to feel official.

324
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:56,196
- Go for Lester.
- Hey, where the hell did you guys go, man?

325
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:58,346
I got a line of customers
heading out the door right now.

326
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:03,206
- Man down, man. Man down. We
had to go get Casey. - What?

327
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:04,336
You're with Casey?

328
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:05,826
Yeah, I guess his install went sideways.

329
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:10,386
Luckily, we intercepted his SOS, 'cause from
the looks of it, he's been hitting the OG kush.

330
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:12,516
Lester... Lester, what
does that even mean?

331
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,486
Look, never mind.

332
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:16,196
Whatever he did, he did too
much of it, cause he can't move.

333
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,386
Yeah, he's got couch lock.
Bad.

334
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:19,366
Listen to me.

335
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:20,446
Forget coming back to the store, okay?

336
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,886
Can you just get Casey to
my apartment in Echo Park?

337
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:24,226
There's a key under the mat.

338
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:25,906
Yeah, nono, no, we got keys.

339
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:29,356
What? I... All right.

340
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:32,316
What?

341
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:34,946
Morgan... Morgan, that is fantastic
news. You stay put. We'll be right there.

342
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:38,036
Casey's safe. He's
back at our apartment.

343
00:22:38,246 --> 00:22:39,726
What? What happened?

344
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:43,756
Oh, my God. Don't move.

345
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:45,026
Not moving.

346
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:53,476
Okay, don't move.

347
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:57,106
Yeah, I heard you the first time,
and I'm... and I'm-I'm not moving.

348
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:05,846
Careful, careful, careful.

349
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,396
Uh-oh? You don't
say "uh-oh."

350
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:25,866
You step out of that laser
beam, and this goes off.

351
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:33,595
Okay, um, I think I can try
and bypass the circuit.

352
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:35,475
Sarah, I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

353
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:36,575
What are you talking about?

354
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:39,515
I was so set on trying to find my
mom that I let my emotions take over,

355
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:42,955
and now I've-I've-I've put everyone
that I care about in danger.

356
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,505
First Casey, and now you.

357
00:23:44,685 --> 00:23:45,885
Oh, my God, this is complicated.

358
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:47,805
I can't bear the thought
of you getting hurt

359
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:51,075
if this thing goes
off, so... I want you to go.

360
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:52,295
Now, please. Save yourself.

361
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:55,675
Okay, you know what? You could have told me
that before I climbed under those lasers.

362
00:23:57,045 --> 00:23:58,615
I... when I... I didn't...

363
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:00,695
Chuck, you're being ridiculous-
come on-even for a man

364
00:24:00,895 --> 00:24:03,945
who is trying to free himself
from high-tech explosives.

365
00:24:04,035 --> 00:24:05,025
Casey and I know the risks, but,

366
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:06,795
of course, we're going to help you.

367
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:08,765
This is your mom.

368
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:10,545
I love you. You know that?

369
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:13,695
And I... and I'd say that even if you weren't
in the process of saving my life right now,

370
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:18,515
which does, by the way, make you
20% to 25% sexier in my book.

371
00:24:18,755 --> 00:24:20,325
All right, 50.

372
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:21,585
Okay, all right. Listen, uh,

373
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:23,645
Chuck and Sarah are going
to be here any minute.

374
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:25,815
Right? All we got to
do is wait for them.

375
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:29,025
Do you understand what I'm saying?

376
00:24:30,895 --> 00:24:32,315
You're blinking a lot.

377
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,905
I hope you know I don't
understand Morse code.

378
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:37,775
That could be them.

379
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:39,425
Why would they be knocking?

380
00:24:40,135 --> 00:24:41,465
No.

381
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:42,915
One minute!

382
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:44,695
What do I do with you?

383
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:49,095
Okay. Okay.

384
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:52,385
Work with me. That's a good fit.

385
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,985
Hi, you. Hi.

386
00:24:58,155 --> 00:24:59,235
What are you doing here?

387
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:00,775
Can I come in?

388
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:02,145
Sorry.

389
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:04,315
You know what? I.
I had this, uh...

390
00:25:04,555 --> 00:25:08,275
this Halo tourney last
night, and it just got crazy.

391
00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:10,455
I'm going to come outside and
talk to you, if that's okay.

392
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,325
Yeah. Good, good, good, good.

393
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:20,445
Anything I can do to help?

394
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,565
What, you getting bored or something?

395
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:23,865
A little.

396
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:27,405
Suddenly not so bored.

397
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:29,125
It just powered down.

398
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,865
Okay. Why are you saying
that like it's a bad thing?

399
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:34,535
Because I didn't disarm it.

400
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:36,775
I did.

401
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,545
Looks like you're in a bit of a pickle.

402
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:43,735
We set that trap for Casey.

403
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:46,605
But you two are almost as good.

404
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:58,215
So, anyway, I just came by to
see how it went with my dad.

405
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:02,215
Well, it didn't, uh... exactly go.

406
00:26:02,415 --> 00:26:04,985
You know, it's a little complicated.

407
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:08,045
I'm confused, Morgan.

408
00:26:08,685 --> 00:26:13,635
You called me to tell me that you'd talk
to my dad, and now it's "complicated?"

409
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:17,815
Do you want to tell me, like, what's
actually going on here?

410
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:22,945
But... can you... can
you do me a ge for?

411
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:24,475
Can we talk about this later?

412
00:26:24,705 --> 00:26:25,575
No.

413
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,905
Right now is the option
I prefer, actually.

414
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:31,085
Okay. Then...

415
00:26:31,315 --> 00:26:33,495
I'm going to need you to leave.

416
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:36,055
What?

417
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:40,295
Are you breaking up with me?

418
00:26:41,245 --> 00:26:42,735
I just need you to go.

419
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:46,405
Fine. I get it.

420
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:50,625
Have fun playing Halo
for the rest of your life.

421
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:55,105
I'm sorry.

422
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,685
- Hey, eulogy guy.
- Oh... okay.

423
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:04,455
I'm looking for Casey.

424
00:27:04,715 --> 00:27:06,225
Uh, Casey who?

425
00:27:09,285 --> 00:27:10,655
That Casey.

426
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:14,685
I've got a message for him.

427
00:27:14,895 --> 00:27:16,615
We've got his friends.

428
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,305
We're taking them on a
little gold-digging trip.

429
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:20,915
Casey knows where.

430
00:27:21,215 --> 00:27:25,355
You tell him he's got
24 hours to show, alone,

431
00:27:25,595 --> 00:27:28,425
or he's going to have two
more funerals to go to.

432
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:41,095
Morgan. What's up, hombre?

433
00:27:41,345 --> 00:27:41,965
It's Jeff.

434
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:44,115
Okay, he-he took too much...

435
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:45,235
I don't know what.

436
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,585
Now he's come down with... couch lock?

437
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:51,805
Couch lock. He overmedicated.

438
00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:53,515
Yes, exactly. He's overmedicated.

439
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,545
Now, how do I wake him up from this?

440
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:57,205
Morgan, do you need
me to come over there?

441
00:27:57,395 --> 00:27:59,735
No. No. No. Man, come... Awesome, please.

442
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,765
You're busy saving
lives. This is nothing.

443
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:04,765
This is an average day
for Jeffrey Barnes, okay?

444
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:06,975
But listen, back to couch lock.

445
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:08,405
How do I wake him from this again?

446
00:28:08,635 --> 00:28:11,045
Well, first of all, don't
panic. Jeff is still in there.

447
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:12,815
Now, just get his heart rate up.

448
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,565
You know, scare him or get him angry.

449
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:16,015
If he doesn't wake up, give me a call.

450
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:16,965
That's awesome.

451
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:19,165
Thank you so much, Awe... some.

452
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:20,855
No. Okay, that's weird.

453
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:24,155
Okay.

454
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:27,715
I'm sorry for this, sir, but
it is for your own good.

455
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:34,045
Man, it's like slapping a car.

456
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:35,675
Okay.

457
00:28:35,945 --> 00:28:38,695
Think, Morgan. How do I get
him angry? How do I get him...

458
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:42,075
Oh, crap.

459
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:46,385
Okay, Casey.

460
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:51,205
I know you can hear me, and I have
something very important to tell you.

461
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:54,865
I've been dating your daughter.

462
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,375
Technically, we're on the
rocks right now, kind of,

463
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:05,775
but, you know, things were
getting pretty serious.

464
00:29:06,015 --> 00:29:07,655
Hol... holding hands.

465
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,215
And, uh... and the kissing
was just out of control.

466
00:29:10,455 --> 00:29:11,775
But I've been a perfect gentleman.

467
00:29:11,995 --> 00:29:14,795
I need you to know.
Always a perfect gentleman.

468
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:19,555
Although it definitely
felt like, pretty soon...

469
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:24,395
she'd be spending the night.

470
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:33,135
I will kill you.

471
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:42,565
Yes! Welcome back, sir.

472
00:29:42,785 --> 00:29:44,315
See? I knew that would work.

473
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:45,875
Bring it in. Come on.

474
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:50,495
Too soon. I see that now.

475
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:56,003
We're going to Iran, Morgan.

476
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:57,823
There's no American presence there.

477
00:29:58,013 --> 00:29:59,393
We're going under the radar.

478
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:03,033
Which means no chance
of anyone rescuing us.

479
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,453
We are the mission.
Just you and me.

480
00:30:06,063 --> 00:30:09,623
Right. Yeah, which is why I think that we
should clear the air, talk about Alex and me.

481
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:11,133
You're not getting it, Morgan.

482
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:13,683
I'm not discussing this with you
because you are not dating my daughter.

483
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,803
You, Alex-nothing to see here.

484
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,023
What is your problem, anyway?

485
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:20,213
Okay? I'm a good guy.

486
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:23,003
All right? Not to mention, stupid
me thought me and you were friends.

487
00:30:23,063 --> 00:30:24,463
Were friends.

488
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:25,933
Oh, right.

489
00:30:26,143 --> 00:30:28,383
Or-or maybe it's that you
don't have any friends.

490
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:33,233
Okay, I happened to notice at your funeral, the
only people who showed up wanted to see you dead.

491
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:39,873
Sorry about that one. That
was probably not my place.

492
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:42,803
If you'd like to choke me now, that's
fine, or we could wait for the plane ride.

493
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:44,393
It's a 19-hour flight to Iran.

494
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:46,633
Bring a book. We ain't talking.

495
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:00,973
So you guys are pretty much going to
kill us no matter what Casey does, right?

496
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:03,533
Mind if I ask you a few questions, then?

497
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:04,773
Sure.

498
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:08,553
I assume you've dealt with
many of Volkoff's prisoners.

499
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,983
Did you ever come
across one named Frost?

500
00:31:13,903 --> 00:31:15,683
Frost isn't a prisoner.

501
00:31:16,623 --> 00:31:18,103
She's our boss.

502
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:35,613
I'll set the computer, all right?

503
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:41,393
Now, they're down there; we're up here.

504
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:42,793
Now what?

505
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:46,253
We got water,

506
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:49,493
Yeah. Sewer, electronics,
security camera.

507
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,073
Guts of the bunker.
We'll tap in right here.

508
00:31:56,563 --> 00:31:57,703
We can control the bunker from here.

509
00:31:57,933 --> 00:31:59,373
This will give us the upper hand.

510
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:00,063
Shift-eight?

511
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:01,003
Six, six, six, six.

512
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:03,443
I got... I got it. I got it.

513
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:06,133
Ugh. There they are.

514
00:32:06,863 --> 00:32:10,813
So, uh, Frost.
She a tough boss?

515
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:12,943
She's Volkoff's right hand.

516
00:32:13,193 --> 00:32:15,593
When he has a problem, he sends in Frost,

517
00:32:16,173 --> 00:32:19,153
and that problem disappears.

518
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:24,803
Sarah, I'm kind of starting to think
that my mom might be one of the bad guys.

519
00:32:30,003 --> 00:32:30,813
Here, put these on.

520
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:31,873
Oh, it's so hot. Put them on.

521
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,123
Do I really have to wear these, really?

522
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:35,223
Only if you don't want
to get electrocuted.

523
00:32:37,073 --> 00:32:39,083
They actually breathe surprisingly well.

524
00:32:39,343 --> 00:32:41,473
Sorry, yeah. Wait for my signal.

525
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:44,723
When you hear the word "security," you
hit this switch, knock out the lights.

526
00:32:45,073 --> 00:32:46,593
Got it? Absolutely. "Security."

527
00:32:46,823 --> 00:32:48,823
- Hit the switch.
- No, no, no!

528
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:50,653
The word "security," wait for it.

529
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:51,903
Just testing you.

530
00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:53,333
Wait a minute, turn off the lights?

531
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:55,933
It's three-to-one
down there, Casey.

532
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,633
Just the way I like it.

533
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:00,943
Heads up.

534
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:02,343
We got company.

535
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:12,993
That's how it is, huh?

536
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:16,243
You can't get to me for 11 years, so you
come up with the idea of kidnappinthese two?

537
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:19,973
If you hadn't been such a hard-ass, Casey, we
wouldn't all be here right now.

538
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:23,293
We'd be on a beach earning 20%.

539
00:33:23,623 --> 00:33:25,253
Unless we invested in real estate.

540
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:27,253
Now drop your weapon, Casey.

541
00:33:32,883 --> 00:33:34,483
All your weapons, Casey.

542
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:50,813
I would've come unarmed, but I wasn't
sure what kind of security I'd run into.

543
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:52,183
That's the signal.

544
00:33:56,123 --> 00:33:57,373
What?!

545
00:33:58,883 --> 00:33:59,763
Damn it.

546
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:03,023
I said, I would've come unarmed, but I wasn't
sure what kind of security I'd run into.

547
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:04,473
Yeah, we heard you the first time.

548
00:34:04,703 --> 00:34:06,033
We're right here, pal.

549
00:34:10,123 --> 00:34:11,353
What the hell's going on?

550
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:16,583
Grimes.

551
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:18,553
Sorry, sorry. One second. One second.

552
00:34:20,163 --> 00:34:20,973
Okay.

553
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:22,823
Let there be darkness.

554
00:34:28,253 --> 00:34:29,973
Don't worry about it. Get
the gold. Let's get the gold.

555
00:34:30,243 --> 00:34:32,853
Any more surprises, Colonel?

556
00:34:42,683 --> 00:34:44,753
Holy Goldfinger.

557
00:34:46,193 --> 00:34:49,443
Topside there are 15 of the most hardcore
Special Forces soldiers you've ever seen.

558
00:34:49,543 --> 00:34:51,353
Come on, come on.

559
00:34:52,753 --> 00:34:54,433
They got 10,000 rounds of ammo,

560
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:58,253
a squadron of F-15
fighters a radio call away.

561
00:34:58,443 --> 00:34:59,553
Your move.

562
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:01,783
Well, maybe I'll get lucky.

563
00:35:08,723 --> 00:35:10,303
Is that a little girl?

564
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:12,653
That really stings!

565
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,903
Whoever you are, we have
Casey and the others.

566
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:19,413
Surrender or we will kill them.

567
00:35:22,063 --> 00:35:23,323
So you got lucky, you hit one.

568
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:24,673
Still 14 left.

569
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:27,023
And they'll never surr.
I surrender!

570
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:30,183
I'm still surrendering.
Please do not shoot me.

571
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:34,383
I'm out, just me all alone. No
one else knows we're here.

572
00:35:34,873 --> 00:35:37,293
So much for your Special Forces.

573
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,373
You move and you're dead.

574
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:41,773
Let's get the gold.

575
00:35:45,503 --> 00:35:47,173
Casey, couch lock.

576
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:50,933
- What?
- The cable.

577
00:35:57,163 --> 00:35:59,393
Oh, good Lord. Lift your feet up.

578
00:35:59,603 --> 00:36:00,523
Do it, do it now.

579
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:01,783
He's gonna try and shock them.

580
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:03,213
Morgan!

581
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,483
Morgan, no!

582
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,323
Morgan.

583
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:25,043
Morgan, can you hear me?

584
00:36:26,243 --> 00:36:27,493
Wake up, moron.

585
00:36:34,973 --> 00:36:35,953
What happened?

586
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:37,493
What hap.
What happened?

587
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:39,703
You just took 10,000
volts is what happened.

588
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:42,963
You went into cardiac arrest and we
actually lost you for a moment there.

589
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:44,883
You lost me? You lost me?

590
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:47,323
You mean, I, uh, I died?

591
00:36:47,543 --> 00:36:48,903
Yeah, for, like, three seconds.

592
00:36:49,113 --> 00:36:50,033
What about the bad guys?

593
00:36:50,273 --> 00:36:52,413
Oh, they're alive, a little crispy.

594
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:55,333
Buddy, that was the single bravest
thing I've ever seen anyone do.

595
00:36:57,253 --> 00:36:58,453
Don't ever do it again.

596
00:36:59,043 --> 00:37:01,063
No. No.

597
00:37:01,593 --> 00:37:02,933
Can we go home now? Yeah.

598
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:05,013
On your fe. What? Okay.

599
00:37:18,173 --> 00:37:20,125
Um, Casey.

600
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:28,175
Now that we know that you're "cool," you should
know that we do "installs" like that twice a week.

601
00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:30,125
Count yourself in.

602
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:36,765
We wake up in some of the
best Dumpsters in the city.

603
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:46,525
Just want to make sure
that we're, uh, we're good.

604
00:37:47,855 --> 00:37:50,485
Oh, good, good.

605
00:37:51,365 --> 00:37:54,505
Uh, also, you don't have to
worry about Alex and me.

606
00:37:54,945 --> 00:37:56,425
We're pretty much over.

607
00:37:56,925 --> 00:37:58,595
I can tell you're heartbroken over it.

608
00:37:58,785 --> 00:38:01,785
So... I'd also just
like to give you this.

609
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:06,085
What is it? It's an invite.

610
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:07,515
To my party.

611
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:11,515
You know, being dead for three
seconds made me miss my friends.

612
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:15,765
So, you know, just think of it as
people who'd actually be there.

613
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,465
If there was ever a real funeral.

614
00:38:23,415 --> 00:38:24,765
You should come.

615
00:38:44,165 --> 00:38:46,335
Hey, buddy.

616
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:52,825
You look great, you guys. Beautiful.

617
00:38:54,975 --> 00:38:56,835
Let me get you a beer.

618
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:04,255
Alex. I didn't know you were coming.

619
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:06,765
Please, come in. This is good.

620
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:12,205
You look lovely. Uh, so, look,

621
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:14,335
I'm really sorry I said some stupid
things the other day and, uh...

622
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,525
I already talked to my dad, Morgan.

623
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,085
I know what happened.

624
00:39:18,345 --> 00:39:22,545
He said that you dumped me
because he told you you had to.

625
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:28,625
He also said that you stood up to him

626
00:39:28,845 --> 00:39:30,155
and changed his mind,

627
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:32,745
which could not have been easy.

628
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:35,835
So maybe I was wrong about you.

629
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:38,325
You are brave.

630
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:43,615
Look, Alex, you know that I'm
really sorry about all that.

631
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:48,645
And, uh, this may come as a surprise,
but I don't care what your dad thinks.

632
00:39:48,835 --> 00:39:50,125
Really. I like you.

633
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,945
And I want to be with you.

634
00:39:52,795 --> 00:39:54,265
If you want to be with me.

635
00:39:55,245 --> 00:39:56,575
You do, right?

636
00:39:56,825 --> 00:39:58,325
That's.
You almost said no.

637
00:39:58,555 --> 00:39:59,885
Of course I do.

638
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:02,205
That's good for the confidence.
Come on, let's get a drink.

639
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:07,455
All right.

640
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:14,665
Alex is here.

641
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:16,105
Okay.

642
00:40:24,235 --> 00:40:25,375
She looks beautiful, huh?

643
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:29,395
Casey... thank you.

644
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:37,595
You break her heart, I
break your everything.

645
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:46,755
There you are.

646
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:51,885
Is this the part where I'm supposed to
ask you what you're thinking about?

647
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,575
My mom.

648
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:02,125
I thought she was a prisoner
who needed to be saved.

649
00:41:02,345 --> 00:41:07,215
And... and I come to fi out
she's just one of the bad guys.

650
00:41:07,405 --> 00:41:09,245
Chuck, we don't know
what side your mom is on.

651
00:41:09,455 --> 00:41:10,645
Maybe not.

652
00:41:12,415 --> 00:41:14,415
But there's one thing I do know:

653
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:20,965
In order to find the one
person who... left me,

654
00:41:21,185 --> 00:41:29,155
I've endangered the lives of everyone who
would never leave me: Morgan, Casey, you.

655
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:32,145
I'm going to stop looking for my mom.

656
00:41:32,385 --> 00:41:34,585
Oh, Chuck... No, it's okay.

657
00:41:35,305 --> 00:41:38,825
I thought I had to bring my
family back together, but I don't.

658
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:44,685
You guys, Awesome, Ellie you're my family.

659
00:41:48,365 --> 00:41:51,225
I love you. I love you.

660
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:54,695
I'll see you inside.

661
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:11,995
Hello. Hello, Chuck.

662
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:14,515
It's your mother.
