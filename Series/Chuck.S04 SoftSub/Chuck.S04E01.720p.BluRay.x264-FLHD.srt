1
00:00:03,316 --> 00:00:07,456
And the king was freed, and
the castle was restored,

2
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:10,826
and the Frost Queen
returned home once more.

3
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:13,246
This time, she was a hero.

4
00:00:13,486 --> 00:00:15,766
And the Frost Queen
promised her children

5
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:20,006
that she would never
ever leave them again.

6
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:22,566
- Good story?
- I liked it.

7
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:25,026
- The prince was cool.
- Yes, he was.

8
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:28,336
Just like my little Chuck.

9
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:30,936
- Mom?
- Yeah?

10
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:33,486
Are you going away again?

11
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:37,826
Just for a few days, then
right back to you and Ellie.

12
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:39,596
Good night, honey.

13
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:45,306
Love you.

14
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:51,006
Not nearly as much as I love you.

15
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,696
My mom was a spy.

16
00:00:57,326 --> 00:01:01,166
After she disappeared, my father spent
the rest of his life trying to find her.

17
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:06,806
Ellie and I thought she left us, that she
just walked away, but what if we were wrong?

18
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:09,836
I need your help.

19
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:13,226
I need you to help me find my mom.

20
00:01:14,236 --> 00:01:16,986
Holy cow!

21
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,586
I cannot belie this
was beneath your house.

22
00:01:19,806 --> 00:01:21,236
This is nuts!

23
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:25,436
A secret spy base. I mean, it's
got lasers and gadgets and...

24
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:27,566
neatly organized files.

25
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:29,206
Listen, why don't you
just tell Casey and Sarah?

26
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:30,256
Because I know what
they're gonna try and do;

27
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:31,296
They're gonna try and stop me.

28
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:32,586
They cannot.

29
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,616
I have to find the
truth, Morgan why my mom left,

30
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:36,196
why she never came back.

31
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:40,616
- This is my search.
- No. It's our search. I'm in.

32
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,626
Thanks.

33
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:46,046
- Are you flexing?
- What? No, I was just kinda...

34
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,896
- I'm excited.
- Okay, good, good.

35
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:49,976
I can't even tell you how much
I appreciate your help on this.

36
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,446
But listen, one
very, very, very important thing

37
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:54,516
we cannot tell anyone, not a soul.

38
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:57,516
Not Sarah, not Casey, not
Awesome, not Ellie.

39
00:01:57,696 --> 00:01:59,216
- Not Ellie.
- I get it, I know.

40
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:01,256
You promised her you weren't
gonna be a spy, you know?

41
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:04,276
So she clearly cannot know
about our little rogue spy team

42
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,766
- Buddy.
- Yeah?

43
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:14,496
This is not the opening of a TV show.

44
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:16,886
This is real life.

45
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:27,036
Sarah, honey, is this the
gun you were looking for?

46
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:28,986
- Yes, thank you.
- I got everything, dude.

47
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,846
- You ready to go?
- She's still here?

48
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:32,146
Hurry up.

49
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,256
Yeah?

50
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:37,356
You're the best. Thank you so much.

51
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:42,266
- A spy mission without me.
- Couples do this all the time, right?

52
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:44,196
It's just a business trip.

53
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:47,506
- Are you okay with this?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm, you know.

54
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:50,326
I' got job interviews and Morgan
and I are gonna spend quality time.

55
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:53,406
He signed us up for a go
cart racing league, so...

56
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:55,276
Come home soon.

57
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:04,186
I'm gonna be sick. Come
on, Walker, we got real work to do.

58
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:05,406
Like se the free world.

59
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:07,156
Enjoy your retirement, Bartowski.

60
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:12,506
What am I, what do I say? What do we...?

61
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:14,876
- I love you.
- That's good. I love you. I like that.

62
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:16,446
I love you, too.

63
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:19,826
Be safe, okay?

64
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,796
Nothing is gonna keep me
from coming back to you.

65
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:26,556
- Better not.
- Bye.

66
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:33,436
Mr. Carmichael, we're all set.

67
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:36,226
I have our tickets, cloned
passports, money belts.

68
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,986
Let's do this. Back in the
game. Me and you, real spies.

69
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:43,026
Sunblock. We need sunblock.

70
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:58,306
Excuse me.

71
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:01,276
Very sorry. Pardon me.

72
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:28,302
I knew it. I was right.

73
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:30,192
My mom's safe house.

74
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:32,472
This is where she got all of
her missions when I was a kid.

75
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:34,712
You know, speaking as the bookkeer
for our int checki account,

76
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:37,832
it mightave been a bit more affoable iwe
started here and then traveled e world.

77
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:41,412
We, we dn't really kw
about re, now did we?

78
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:44,272
- You got the code, buddy?
- Yeah.

79
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:47,262
Yeah, code, code, code. Here you go.

80
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,692
And if we t second, we need to he a lile
bit of a bget conversation just because...

81
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:53,412
Morga not now.

82
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:56,432
This is it.

83
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:00,252
My dad never made it this far.

84
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:06,602
Okay, Mom, where are you?

85
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:16,202
And it's not empty right? Please

86
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:18,562
tell me that it's not empty.

87
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:25,442
I don't get it. I don't get it. All
the intel led right back here.

88
00:05:25,902 --> 00:05:27,292
No. No, no, no, there's got to be something.

89
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:29,702
There's got to be something.
There's got to be a... a...

90
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,192
a secret compartment, you know?

91
00:05:31,402 --> 00:05:36,972
Or a passageway or some clue
that finally leads us to my mom.

92
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,442
- Yeah.
- Come on. Come on! Come on!

93
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:46,122
There's nothing.

94
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:51,682
Okay, so we didn't find your mom, but,

95
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:54,822
maybe we found a new dumpling house, huh?

96
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,082
All right, I don'know.

97
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,772
Let's pack it up, head home.

98
00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:06,702
Fuel up on some dumplings and
start again from scratch, okay?

99
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:09,092
Now we can do this, you and I...

100
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:14,642
All right.

101
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:18,082
We got close this time.

102
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:20,402
I know we're going to find her.

103
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:34,602
Chuck.

104
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:43,243
Chuck 4x01 - Versus the Anniversary

105
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:18,405
Talk to me, buddy, you know?

106
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,585
Let it out. You want to cry? Go
for it. I got two good shoulders.

107
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:23,295
What are we doing?

108
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:25,805
Why are we even bothering
looking for my mom?

109
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:27,705
My dad ruined his life
trying to find her.

110
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:30,175
She could have come back any
time she wanted to, you know?

111
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:33,075
We're easy to find. Her, not so much.

112
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,255
I'm done, man. I think I'm done.

113
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:38,195
Listen, you had to try, right?

114
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:40,435
- Don't move, Chuck.
- Get over here!

115
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:42,815
Morgan. Morgan, Morgan. Coming, coming.

116
00:07:43,115 --> 00:07:44,205
Give me them keys.

117
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:47,335
Yeah, here you go, sir. Here
they are. Here are your keys.

118
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:49,405
Just don't, please
don't shoot me or Chuck.

119
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:52,795
Look, if this is has anything to do
with my mom or or Albania or Tangiers,

120
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:55,315
- or that that cafe in Budapest which was...
- Oh, that was not even...

121
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,635
Anyway, the point is we have
explanations for all of that.

122
00:07:57,855 --> 00:08:01,665
What are you talking about? I'm
here for the car. I'm a repo man!

123
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,985
- Repo man. Morgan?
- Right.

124
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:08,005
- We haven't made a payment in four months.
- The car cost $900.

125
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,565
Yeah, but we're $43,000
in debt. I was gonna..

126
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:14,615
- What? What?43 what?
- $43,000 debt, and that's...

127
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:16,905
that's above the CIA money you
had saved up because being a spy,

128
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:18,685
apparently is really expensive.

129
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,365
Why didn't you... why
didn't you tell me?

130
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:23,485
- Well, you were so busy looking for your mom...
- Enough chitchat.

131
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:25,015
Get away from that car.

132
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:28,225
Just, Chuck, give him a little, you
know what I mean, Intersect style.

133
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:29,725
I don't do kung fu anymore, buddy.

134
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:31,715
You got some chop socky, boy?

135
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:34,505
No, no chop socky here, sir. Fresh
out of chop socky.

136
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:37,265
- Take the car.
- That's what I thought.

137
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:42,395
*****get a job!

138
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:44,095
Working on it.

139
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:49,375
You know, Chuck, this does
not happen to real spies.

140
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:51,825
HONG KONG, CHINA

141
00:08:58,025 --> 00:08:59,935
I'm cornered. What do I do?

142
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:01,635
Use the device.

143
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:07,775
Make a move and you're dead, Marko.

144
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,765
Please, make a move.

145
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:29,435
I thought you said the EMP was a fake.

146
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,245
I was wrong. Beautiful, isn't it?

147
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:36,885
Volkoff Industries'
handheld EMP generator.

148
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:40,545
Will fry every electric
circuit in a three klick radius.

149
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:42,225
Volkoff's upping the ante.

150
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:44,815
The building's elevators
are knocked out.

151
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:47,625
Mr. Volkoff's agents
will be here in minutes.

152
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:49,585
You're trapped.

153
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:52,205
Put down your guns.

154
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,585
You know, he really should be here.

155
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:14,495
Chuck's the Intersect. We could
use him on a mission like this.

156
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:16,105
I hate cracking into computer systems.

157
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:18,365
Well, he made a promise to his sister.

158
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:20,995
Chuck doesn't want to be a spy
and have to lie about it, too.

159
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:22,865
Your boyfriend needs some big boy pants.

160
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:25,275
He's a spy, he's good at it.

161
00:10:25,485 --> 00:10:30,565
- I know, Casey. You miss him, too.
- What? I don't miss him.

162
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:37,305
- By the way, good idea to bring the chutes.
- Thank you.

163
00:10:57,055 --> 00:11:00,955
Yes. Nice. I like this. But I less back.

164
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:02,375
Maybe just kind of a...

165
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:05,615
Hold that. Hold that. Right there, this
whole sleepy confusion thing.

166
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:08,135
- That's digital sex right there, my friend.
- Morgan, what are you doing?

167
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,445
I'm putting the spark back in
your relationship, dude. Trust me.

168
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:12,145
- Sarah's going to love these.
- What?

169
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:15,195
Good. Yeah. Actually, if you don't
mind, I'll hit the peck deck a little bit.

170
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:18,265
And put baby oil, please. Lube it up.

171
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:21,875
- What? Ba ba... What? No, no, no.
- Lube it up. Grease it up.

172
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:24,635
- Whatever you're doing, please stop.
- Okay. Okay.

173
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:26,325
I know you're down about your mom, Chuck.

174
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:29,515
Let's you and I have a little
talk right now, man to man.

175
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:32,025
Okay. Okay. Man to man talk.

176
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:34,165
What are you doing in
my room with baby oil?

177
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:35,785
More importantly, you and Sarah, okay?

178
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,465
'Cause every morning you're
waking up missing her,

179
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:38,725
acting like a sad sack.

180
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:40,385
I mean, I I understand
a little bit, you know,

181
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:43,575
you're you're stuck in this long distance
relationship right now that's short on intimacy.

182
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:44,615
That's okay. It's all right.

183
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:48,395
But what you need to do is open
your mind to what sex truly is.

184
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:50,705
It's sexting.

185
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:54,175
Short for sext writing.

186
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,445
It's intimacy for
people in your situation.

187
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:57,995
Sexting.

188
00:11:58,695 --> 00:12:00,125
Sex... sexting.

189
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:02,625
- Sexting.
- Sexting. Buddy.

190
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:06,255
Now that the terrible ids are t of the
way, I told Ellie about the job hunt,

191
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:09,145
and she's already lined up
five interviews for today.

192
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:10,965
Okay. I'll grab our bus passes.

193
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:13,095
But, remember, sexting?

194
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,645
Yeah, sex talk? No, not going to happen.

195
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,545
Good luck on the job hunt.

196
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:19,985
Fine. Do it myself.

197
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:24,785
{a6}Vandalay Industries
I am so glad you could come in.

198
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:28,275
You know, with a like this
and a degree from Stanford,

199
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:29,885
it's astounding you haven't
been snatched up already.

200
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:31,305
Snatch me up.

201
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:33,655
I'm 100% snatchable.

202
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:36,395
I'm sorry, I don't use the word snatch
very often for a myriad of reasons.

203
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:37,665
Relax.

204
00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:39,295
Why are you so nervous?

205
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:41,805
You know, I'm not normally.

206
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:45,055
I I'm normally... I'm
normally a smooth operator.

207
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:47,325
Like Sade. But..

208
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:51,515
Today has been a
strange, day of interviews.

209
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,885
Really? Well, how?

210
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:58,785
Well, for starters, have you ever had
anyone fall asleep in an interview?

211
00:13:00,795 --> 00:13:04,625
Just after that, the person sitting
in your position got a little ill.

212
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:10,935
Just after that, the interviewer
started going into convulsions...

213
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:16,185
The last interview I just came from, they they
told me they were going for a cup of coffee,

214
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:18,045
and then they never came back.

215
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,845
I mean, how long does
it take to get coffee?

216
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:23,475
- That's really crazy.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:26,925
Well, I think, Chuck, that I
have some good news for you.

218
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,355
- Good.
- Yeah.

219
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:30,675
How would you like to join...?

220
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:33,135
I thought I told them to hold my calls.

221
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:35,635
I I... I... I don't think it's a
good idea for you to answer that.

222
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,915
Hello.

223
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:38,265
Yes.

224
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,415
It's about you.

225
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:41,375
What?

226
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:44,735
Is... is everything okay?

227
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:48,175
What's happening? Who is that?

228
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:55,935
Unfortunately, Mr. Bartowski, the
position's been filled.

229
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,145
What's happening? Who was that?

230
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,385
And I'm going to have security
escort you from the building.

231
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,385
Wait. I'm s... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

232
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,935
Hang on a second. What did I
do? Who was that on the phone?

233
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:07,235
Perhaps I could explain
whatever the situation is.

234
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:09,675
Gentlemen, this is
completely uncalled for.

235
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:10,925
Look on the bright side, Chuck.

236
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:13,045
The bus has much more
legroom than the hatchback.

237
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:17,225
- There's a conspiracy against me.
- I don't know. I...

238
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:19,065
always feel that way
after a bad interview.

239
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,545
Except, with me, the conspiracy
has been going on a lot longer.

240
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:22,665
You know? Like,

241
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,955
- kindergarten.
- Morgan, what am I supposed to do now?

242
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:27,875
These were Ellie's best leads. Where
am I going to find a job?

243
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,615
Well, there's... always one place.

244
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:35,875
Where?

245
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:39,945
I can't believe it's back, Chuck.

246
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:01,095
It's beautiful.

247
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:03,525
I can't believe how
fast they rebuilt it.

248
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:08,015
Oh...

249
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:10,575
...my...

250
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:14,615
Lord.

251
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:17,605
Welcome to the Buy
More. We're not open yet

252
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:22,435
but we are currently accepting
rsums. Are you interested?

253
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,585
For what?

254
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:25,355
A job.

255
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:26,795
Maybe.

256
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:29,625
What what, types of
positions are available?

257
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:32,125
I'm sure the store manager
can help you with that.

258
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:33,345
Have at it.

259
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:34,825
Good luck.

260
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,055
So nervous.

261
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:39,265
Do you want me to show
you around the store?

262
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:42,045
Yes, please. That would be
delightful. Should I hold your hand?

263
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,305
- No, you should not.
- Okay. Lead on.

264
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:52,255
Hello.

265
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:56,585
My name is Chuck Bartowski, and,

266
00:15:56,865 --> 00:16:01,185
- it's funny, I used to work here.
- You still do work here.

267
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,145
Hello, Chuck. Welcome back.

268
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,717
Beckman had kittens when
I told her about the EMP.

269
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,927
She wants us to find out where Volkoff's
building it so we can blow the place up.

270
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:30,657
Another mission? We've been at it for
months, and I haven't seen Chuck in...

271
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,047
- forever.
- There's something else.

272
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:37,847
Beckman wants Chuck to come down here, take
a look at the EMP, see if he flashes.

273
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,227
Chuck is a civilian now.

274
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,867
We can't force him to be a spy, can we?

275
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:45,077
You might want to tell
Beckman that yourself.

276
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:49,877
Chuck.

277
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:53,787
As you can see, we spared no
expense recreating the Buy More.

278
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:59,637
- Yeah, General, I I appreciate the tour and all...
- It's no longer simply a retail store.

279
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:03,847
It's now a full fledged
CIA NSA substation.

280
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:08,027
We can patch into security
cameras all over the world.

281
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:12,317
Satellite relays
NORAD, NASA, Strategic Air Command.

282
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:15,427
Hit that red button, we go to DEFCON 1.

283
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:21,747
Is that, is that really the safest
place to put that out in the open?

284
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,997
There's a new laser
based security system.

285
00:17:24,237 --> 00:17:25,837
General, this is crazy. You
realize this is crazy.

286
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:30,227
No, it's not. After the success
of Operation Bartowski,

287
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,447
- the president made you a priority.
- I beg your pardon.

288
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:35,297
The the the president president?

289
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:39,177
Like, the actual... You're
being totally serious.

290
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:41,497
General, I am out of the spy game.

291
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:43,027
You're out when I say you're out.

292
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:47,547
If memory serves, you actually
said, Chuck, you are out of the spy game.

293
00:17:47,757 --> 00:17:51,257
I changed my mind. You're
back. Discussion over.

294
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,177
And don't think you're
going to find another job.

295
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:56,517
Why...?

296
00:17:57,237 --> 00:18:00,857
You... you... you. That was
you on the phone, wasn't it?

297
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:02,817
You tanked my interviews, didn't you?

298
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:11,307
- Sarah. Back in town? - Chuck, listen to me.
You do not have to be a spy.

299
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:14,627
No, no. I know. Yeah. Beckman
just offered me a position,

300
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:16,147
and I turned her down.

301
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:18,667
How did she react?

302
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:19,797
Well, she...

303
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:22,737
Chuck, hello?

304
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,337
That went well, I think.

305
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,377
I'm... I'm sorry. I should
have called, but we just got in.

306
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:47,097
No, it's fine 'cause you're
here, and I'm here, and...

307
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:48,917
and I miss you a lot.

308
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:52,627
I missed you, too.

309
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:55,777
- This is the mission that just won't end.
- I get it. It's important work, okay?

310
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,777
But you're here now at least
for a little while, right?

311
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:02,797
- Few weeks? Days? Hours? Enough sap.
- Sarah, what...

312
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:05,747
- Let's take a look at the mission at hand.
Flash. - What are you...?

313
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:13,287
Well?

314
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,157
Thanks, Casey.

315
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:20,087
EMP, manufactured in Venezuela
at the Corta Verona facility,

316
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:24,007
which is a subsidiary of Volkoff
Industries. Who's Volkoff? Don't tell me.

317
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:26,837
Alexei Volkoff arms dealer, recluse.

318
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:29,397
He's like the Russian Howard Hughes.

319
00:19:29,657 --> 00:19:32,527
We've been chasing after him for
months, and with that single flash,

320
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,597
we might just be able to take him down.

321
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:36,037
Good to have you back.

322
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:37,637
- I'm not staying.
- I think he misses you.

323
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,087
I know he does.

324
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:44,367
This is nuts, man. The Buy More
is being run by the CIA. Amazing.

325
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:46,257
Which would make you a spy?

326
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:49,527
- You are very perceptive, Mr. Grimes.
- Guilty.

327
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:53,107
I got to say, the new Castle
is pretty freaking sweet.

328
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:56,357
And it's nice to be
back down in here with u.

329
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,717
- Chuck, can we talk?
- Of course. Anytime. About what?

330
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:02,277
Well, I know this is awkward, but,

331
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:04,277
I just have to ask about the picture.

332
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:08,157
What, what picture?

333
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:12,537
Chuck, do you want to sext with me?

334
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:17,527
No! I don't... I mean... I...

335
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:23,307
No. No, no. No, this isn't my
idea. Cleary not my idea.

336
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,067
This was Morgan's doing.

337
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,197
Well, don't worry. I...
I thought it was cute.

338
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:29,267
Here's the thing I don't
know if you know this, but,

339
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:32,187
I actually was an agent myself
for a little while last year.

340
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:35,947
What if we got together, maybe...
show each other a few moves?

341
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:39,277
You know, I... I have a trip
to Thailand in the morning.

342
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:40,587
Sure. Sure.

343
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:43,867
- It's a new mission.
- Of course. It's the life of a...

344
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,647
I could show you something right now.

345
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:47,447
- Really? Yeah.
- You know.

346
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:51,167
So, six nine month
anniversary. What do you think?

347
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:55,227
Well, I I have to go away again, but when
I come back, we will celebrate in style.

348
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,707
Fantastic. No phones necessary.

349
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:00,607
Unless you want. I don't
know what that means.

350
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:02,537
Forget I even said anything.

351
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:08,267
- What is... what is this?
- The emblem? That's Volkoff's.

352
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,437
He is not afraid to advertise.

353
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:13,457
Well, I have to go debrief with
Beckman and Casey, but we'll talk later?

354
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:14,807
Yeah, great.

355
00:21:27,057 --> 00:21:29,077
New Buy More rules.

356
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:32,277
Slides and trap doors and the
new superspy Nerd Herder, Greta.

357
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:33,877
Be still, my beating heart.

358
00:21:34,107 --> 00:21:36,417
- She digs me. I can tell.
- Morgan.

359
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,737
We need to get the car back.

360
00:21:41,737 --> 00:21:43,387
With the creepy guy?

361
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,587
Okay, I'm sorry. Again, tell
me why we're here.

362
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,517
I mean, this menu's
linked to an arms dealer?

363
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:54,247
Look, I thought the last
mission was a bust, okay?

364
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:57,017
But the menu could be the
link that brings us to my mom.

365
00:21:57,227 --> 00:21:59,347
Maybe she was after Volkoff
just like Casey and Sarah.

366
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:01,737
Okay, listen, I get the menu
we get out of here quietly.

367
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,777
Yes, yes, quick and quiet.

368
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:05,507
There it is.

369
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:12,067
You young, oversexed, underworked kids.

370
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,837
You don't mess with a repo man.

371
00:22:15,107 --> 00:22:17,867
Not ever! Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr. repo
man, sir.

372
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,957
We are not here to mess with you. We just...
Morgan, get the... get the... get the menu!

373
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:23,177
Repo man, Excuse me for one second.

374
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:25,747
I'm just going to just, very
slowly... I'm just going to kind of...

375
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:27,517
He's just reaching...
Here we go. Perfect.

376
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:29,967
Please, this is all we want and then
we're leaving. We're out of your hair.

377
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:31,507
You want a menu, for what?

378
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,467
- Chinese.
- Dumplings.

379
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:36,097
Yeah?

380
00:22:36,477 --> 00:22:38,017
A good place?

381
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:44,087
- No. It's... No.
- I like good Chinese.

382
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:45,447
Hard to find.

383
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:47,427
Hand it over.

384
00:22:47,957 --> 00:22:50,297
Buddy, you remember how we got
out of that jam in Tangiers?

385
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:51,147
Tangiers? Think it'll work?

386
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:52,897
Tangiers? What does that mean?

387
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:55,777
It means that we need
to run! Run! RunRun! Run!

388
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:57,097
Damn you!

389
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:01,067
I love dumplings.

390
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:04,977
It's really weird.

391
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:06,987
Most of these are just
your run of the mill dishes,

392
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:09,567
but a few of these I
haven't even heard of before.

393
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:12,707
Which ones? Which dishes?

394
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:16,547
For example, this. Shimira Chicken.

395
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:27,877
Shimira. Okay, Shimira is
actually a nav system for spy subs.

396
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:31,347
This is not a menu for ordering
food. This is a menu for ordering weapons.

397
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,877
Why would your mom have that?

398
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,367
Let's call and find out.

399
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:38,177
Use your dad's encrypted phone.

400
00:23:47,697 --> 00:23:48,797
Who is this?

401
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:50,417
Identify.

402
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:52,347
This is Carmichael.

403
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,777
I work for the Ring.

404
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:55,557
The Ring was eliminated.

405
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:58,697
We are an offshoot of the Ring.

406
00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:01,487
The New Ring.

407
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:04,717
I'm the head of security.

408
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:08,157
I'll need to see your organization
firsthand if we agree to work.

409
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,697
Then you'll have to come to
Volkoff Industries in Moscow.

410
00:24:10,937 --> 00:24:12,477
Moscow, Russia.

411
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:15,777
Not a problem. The New
Ring has very deep pockets.

412
00:24:16,017 --> 00:24:17,077
We're going to Russia.

413
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:20,287
Okay. I'm going to have to
sell my Millennium Falcon.

414
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:21,787
And God bless you.

415
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,717
- Are you still ther?
- Yes, I'm here.

416
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:28,407
Just tell me when and
where. We have a jet on standby.

417
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,927
Okay, so we I. D. Volkoff's facility

418
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:38,627
and we can take it out
with a single drone strike.

419
00:24:39,137 --> 00:24:42,407
Have you ever been in a
long distance relationship?

420
00:24:44,197 --> 00:24:45,327
No.

421
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:47,797
I either leave or they die.

422
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:50,617
I'm going to the head.

423
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,307
Please fasten your seat belts. We're
heading into a bit of turbulence.

424
00:25:43,563 --> 00:25:47,807
Release the gas. I'll
reroute the flight to Moscow.

425
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:11,029
Moscow, Russia.

426
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:20,326
Where are we?

427
00:26:22,036 --> 00:26:24,706
Desolation, frostbite.

428
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,126
Must be Russia.

429
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:30,616
Welcome to Volkoff Industries.

430
00:26:31,186 --> 00:26:33,346
I'm glad you could finally make it.

431
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:34,706
Take a load off.

432
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:36,226
Relax.

433
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:40,166
And think about all the
terrible things I will do to you.

434
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:41,706
We're pros, Marko.

435
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:43,326
Your methods won't work on us.

436
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:46,886
Remember, I work for Volkoff.

437
00:26:48,636 --> 00:26:50,656
I must break you.

438
00:27:09,446 --> 00:27:10,886
Remember the plan.

439
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:14,736
We have to access the Volkoff computer
system to see what they have on my mom.

440
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:16,636
- Does that make sense?
- Completely.

441
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:19,186
Although I think my
face is still frozen.

442
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:20,286
Hello.

443
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,046
We're with the Ring.

444
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:23,306
The New Ring.

445
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:26,386
This is Charles Carmichael.

446
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,426
I'm Michael Carmichael.

447
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:31,006
So, if you wouldn't mind...

448
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:34,106
Frigid in here, as well.

449
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:39,776
The plan was for me to be Carmichael
and you to be Sven, my mute assistant.

450
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:42,396
See, here's the thing. These
people respect a beard.

451
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:45,206
And that whole assistant thing... I
don't know. I see us more as brothers.

452
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:46,286
Is that so?

453
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:47,186
Okay, okay, fine.

454
00:27:47,436 --> 00:27:52,466
What parents in their right mind would name their
child Michael if their last name was Carmichael?

455
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:54,356
That's crazy. What were
your parents thinking?

456
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,716
What were our parents thinking?

457
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:59,336
You know. It's what people in
the movie business call improv.

458
00:28:07,516 --> 00:28:09,526
Nice photo.

459
00:28:13,646 --> 00:28:15,326
Good work, Walker. Get the phone.

460
00:28:23,026 --> 00:28:24,316
Former Kgb Facility

461
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:29,206
I know where the server is.

462
00:28:29,436 --> 00:28:30,506
It's actually not far from where we are.

463
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:32,826
If my father's codes still
work, we should be able to get in.

464
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:34,046
What do you think?

465
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:36,666
Maybe you drop a little
Intersect style on these fools.

466
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:38,276
Karate chop your way in.

467
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:40,336
I will hide behind
the receptionist desk.

468
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,756
You know, that, or we could
just run really fast.

469
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:44,686
Tangiers? Here?

470
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:46,666
Tangiers. Exactly.

471
00:28:46,906 --> 00:28:48,006
Could work.

472
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:51,526
The case. One, two, three. We go.

473
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:57,436
Come on.

474
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,416
Come on.

475
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:04,416
I almost got it.

476
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:14,606
I've never run so fast
in so many layers before.

477
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:19,586
- Game time.
- Yup.

478
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:28,566
- This place is nuts.
- Yeah, it's a Cold War relic, buddy.

479
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,406
Dude, what is this?

480
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:41,116
Morgan, that's an EMP, so
I wouldn't touch that.

481
00:29:41,366 --> 00:29:44,006
- This is an EMP?
- Yes, it is.

482
00:29:44,406 --> 00:29:47,356
No touching, Morgan. Got ya. Got ya.

483
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:50,086
Good work, Walker. Call Beckman.

484
00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:55,206
No, I can't call. It's gonna be too
loud. I'll text Chuck. I was texting before.

485
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:58,966
- Your phone.
- Yeah, I'm kind of busy right now.

486
00:30:02,346 --> 00:30:03,166
Sarah.

487
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:05,956
- She's sexting you.
- Not now, Morgan.

488
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:10,716
Got ya. Go on... my lady.

489
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:14,676
What does he say?

490
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:17,026
- He thinks we're sexting.
- What?

491
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:19,966
What does that even mean?

492
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:24,256
SOS. SOS.

493
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:26,546
Skin on skin.

494
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:28,676
Yes, please.

495
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:32,036
- Come on.
- Filthy.

496
00:30:33,786 --> 00:30:37,306
- He still thinks we're sexting.
- You kiss your mom with those thumbs?

497
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:40,176
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

498
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:44,526
Daddy likes. you're in
trouble. Daddy likes.

499
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:48,156
Someone's coming.

500
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:51,856
We're inside Volkoff. Subbasement
four. Tell him!

501
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:54,686
Got it. Bypassed their security. I'm in.

502
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:56,816
Awesome. Awesome. Anything?

503
00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:59,016
Well, there's nothing coming up with
her name, but I'm checking aliases,

504
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:02,266
missions my dad thought she
went on or weapons she was after.

505
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:07,326
Wait a minute. Frost.

506
00:31:08,696 --> 00:31:09,966
Frost.

507
00:31:11,256 --> 00:31:12,366
The Frost Queen.

508
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:16,906
My mom used to tell me a stories when I was
a kid about the Frost Queen. That can't be it.

509
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:18,796
Well, either way, let's download
it and get out of here.

510
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:20,806
It's encrypted. It's encrypted.

511
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:24,086
But I have a program that can hack it,

512
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:28,256
- and then we can download it. Right.
- Quickly.

513
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:34,846
Wait a minute.

514
00:31:35,136 --> 00:31:36,426
- Crap.
- What?

515
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:40,226
It's Sarah, but it's... I I
thought she was sexting, dude.

516
00:31:40,496 --> 00:31:43,896
She's here with Casey, and
they're in trouble.

517
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,736
Dude, what do we do? Call Beckman.

518
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:48,936
I'll call Beckman, or CIA, or the
Marines, because someone's got to save 'em.

519
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,426
Who's gonna save 'em?

520
00:31:54,951 --> 00:31:56,216
We are.

521
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,393
Enough with the toes.

522
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:07,223
No one's coming.

523
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:15,023
I would love nothing more than
to put bullets in both your heads.

524
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,083
Yeah, go ahead and do
it. Don't jabber. Just do it.

525
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:26,433
The problem is you're not the
two agents I'm looking for.

526
00:32:26,753 --> 00:32:32,983
In the past six months, two CIA agents have gotten
closer to Volkoff Industries than any other spy.

527
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:34,433
They're ghosts.

528
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:39,203
They expertly use public
transportation to avoid being tracked.

529
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:42,633
So tell me...

530
00:32:44,123 --> 00:32:46,933
who are these master spies?

531
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:50,073
- No idea.
- Never seen 'em.

532
00:32:50,323 --> 00:32:51,663
Morgan, this way.

533
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,973
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.

534
00:33:00,903 --> 00:33:03,723
- We've got them they're in the building.
- They're here.

535
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:05,433
They must have come for you.

536
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:08,603
Well, that's their first mistake.

537
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:13,843
This entire building... is a trap.

538
00:33:14,713 --> 00:33:18,583
So, buddy, how rusty is your kung fu?

539
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:21,343
I haven't used it in months.

540
00:33:21,653 --> 00:33:22,663
Great.

541
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:26,983
So... do you want to
speak to your friend?

542
00:33:27,593 --> 00:33:29,923
Chuck, what's going
on? What are you doing here?

543
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:34,933
Sarah, I know you must have a lot of questions for me
right now, and I promise I will explain everything later.

544
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:37,133
Listen, you've got to flash, okay? You've
got to get out of here.

545
00:33:37,373 --> 00:33:39,513
- I've heard enough. - No, please,
this is a big mistake. He's not a spy.

546
00:33:39,753 --> 00:33:41,583
- Kill them.
- No, please, no.

547
00:33:54,193 --> 00:33:58,193
Well, it all seemed a bit anticlimactic.

548
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,323
I'm gonna tear you limb
from limb from limb.

549
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:02,453
Okay, I got it.

550
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:04,843
Somebody please shoot this guy?

551
00:34:04,903 --> 00:34:06,143
Hello?

552
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:09,233
Yes, who is it?

553
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:13,993
Look, you clearly have no idea who I am since
you only sent ten of your men to take care of me,

554
00:34:14,273 --> 00:34:17,613
so let me break it down for you if
you touch one hair on Sarah's head,

555
00:34:17,863 --> 00:34:19,893
I will do to you what
I've just done to your men.

556
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:21,613
Do you understand?

557
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,593
I'm coming down there right now.

558
00:34:24,653 --> 00:34:25,933
Scary enough?

559
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:28,923
I'm scared. I was scared when you...

560
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:31,503
You are not rusty at
all, Chuck. You are limber.

561
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:35,813
I suggest you start
running... right about now.

562
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:37,723
Follow me.

563
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:53,833
That hurts. I'm so out of spy shape.

564
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,313
What the hell are you doing here?

565
00:34:58,073 --> 00:35:01,093
Saving your lives, okay? Let's
just call it that for now.

566
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,143
- I'm good.
- Cut me free.

567
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,593
I got some Russians to kill.

568
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:09,543
Not yet there's one
more thing I have to do.

569
00:35:11,663 --> 00:35:15,543
I'm waiting for you, and
I don't like to wait.

570
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:18,483
Boss, the Americans have escaped.

571
00:35:24,013 --> 00:35:25,983
Chuck, why are we here?

572
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:28,423
What, the computer? This
is what you came here for?

573
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:31,053
Look, Sarah, I have to tell you the truth.

574
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:32,843
I took over my father's
search for my mom.

575
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:34,633
She's a spy, she is a spy, I I don't know.

576
00:35:34,923 --> 00:35:37,113
I thought I could find her, I could
save her, I could bring her home.

577
00:35:37,413 --> 00:35:39,443
- You should have told me.
- You would have tried to stop me.

578
00:35:39,633 --> 00:35:41,493
Of course I would have. I
don't want you to get hurt.

579
00:35:41,713 --> 00:35:45,573
Sarah, I have to do this. This is my
mom, okay, I need to know the truth.

580
00:35:45,753 --> 00:35:47,743
No lying that was our rule.

581
00:35:47,983 --> 00:35:52,563
In all fairness, I was just, you
know, keeping a secret. I wasn't lying.

582
00:35:52,843 --> 00:35:55,033
New rule no secrets, no lies.

583
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:57,433
- Starting now.
- Starting now.

584
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:59,923
Great, you've made up. Now, how
do we get out of here?

585
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:01,783
You can't get out.

586
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,633
This is a living
building, totally automated.

587
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,093
The security system is activated.

588
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,333
If you die, you die.

589
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:11,003
That sounds ominous.

590
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:13,483
Hope the file was worth it, Chuck.

591
00:36:13,743 --> 00:36:15,173
We're sitting ducks in here.

592
00:36:21,363 --> 00:36:22,593
Sorry, Mom.

593
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:25,423
Chuck, what are you doing?

594
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:28,953
If I set off the EMP, it disables
the building and we walk out of here.

595
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:32,693
But, Chuck, the computer. You'll lose
the file. You might never find your mom.

596
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:34,663
Yeah, well, it's not worth losing you.

597
00:36:36,873 --> 00:36:38,273
Any of you.

598
00:36:39,993 --> 00:36:41,963
Yeah, we get it. Pull the trigger.

599
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:52,153
Okay, great, great plan. Now what?

600
00:36:52,403 --> 00:36:56,593
Now we employ the best commie
rifle ever invented Comrade AK 47.

601
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:14,213
Move it. Let's go. Let's go.

602
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:17,853
- Everybody alive?
- I'm okay, I'm okay, a little cold

603
00:37:18,053 --> 00:37:19,723
- but...
- Anyone that matters?

604
00:37:19,953 --> 00:37:21,723
Where's the getaway car?

605
00:37:37,613 --> 00:37:39,053
Happy anniversary?

606
00:37:40,403 --> 00:37:42,473
Happy anniversary.

607
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:53,815
So that's it.

608
00:37:55,265 --> 00:37:56,775
That's the whole story.

609
00:37:57,065 --> 00:37:59,325
Well, I'm just peeved you
didn't ask us for help.

610
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:00,855
I'm sorry.

611
00:38:02,535 --> 00:38:04,935
Will you help me find my mom?

612
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,865
Yes.

613
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,655
Yes, of course.

614
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:13,425
But, Chuck, you know what this means.

615
00:38:13,695 --> 00:38:16,565
You're going to have to
rejoin the Agency and be a spy.

616
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:17,815
I know.

617
00:38:18,075 --> 00:38:20,405
The question is do we
tell Beckman about my mom?

618
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,375
No, not yet.

619
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:25,205
Chuck, what about your sister?

620
00:38:25,395 --> 00:38:27,185
What are you going to tell Ellie?

621
00:38:30,345 --> 00:38:32,395
I have to tell her the truth.

622
00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:37,655
I have to tell her that I am a spy.

623
00:38:47,815 --> 00:38:48,905
Chuck.

624
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,715
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

625
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:51,605
That's okay.

626
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:53,665
How are you?

627
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,885
The interview didn't go well?

628
00:38:57,135 --> 00:39:00,515
No, none of 'em, really, but there's
something that I have to do, Ellie.

629
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:01,965
It's okay, Chuck.

630
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:03,835
I know.

631
00:39:05,055 --> 00:39:06,355
What?

632
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:08,425
I saw the new Buy More.

633
00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:12,895
Right, yeah, I did get a job there.

634
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,475
- Ellie, I'm not that's not what I...
- It's okay, Chuck. It's a job.

635
00:39:16,725 --> 00:39:19,235
Those are really hard to
come by these days, so...

636
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:21,835
My turn.

637
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:23,605
Let's sit down.

638
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,015
Okay.

639
00:39:27,295 --> 00:39:28,635
What's up?

640
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:32,425
I'm pregnant.

641
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,195
What?

642
00:39:35,395 --> 00:39:37,195
Are you what, seriously?!

643
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:40,415
I I was going to wait
until Devon got home, but I,

644
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:43,355
- I saw you and I had to tell you.
- Oh, my God.

645
00:39:44,345 --> 00:39:47,215
Oh, my God, I'm so, my God, I'm hugging you.

646
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:49,245
I am I did I hurt the baby?

647
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:50,845
I hurt the child.

648
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:52,135
Chuck.

649
00:39:52,415 --> 00:39:54,185
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

650
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:56,615
I'm really happy right now, Chuck.

651
00:39:57,335 --> 00:40:02,655
I mean, I'm starting a family a new family
and you have Sarah and you're safe and...

652
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:06,645
just I'm really so happy right now.

653
00:40:09,955 --> 00:40:12,295
I couldn't tell her, not now.

654
00:40:13,535 --> 00:40:15,665
She doesn't want me to be a spy, but

655
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:19,615
our dad gave me this mission to
find our mom, to know the truth.

656
00:40:19,905 --> 00:40:21,945
I can't not do this.

657
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:23,495
I have to do this.

658
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,975
That's not being a
spy, that's being a brother.

659
00:40:30,315 --> 00:40:35,405
I cracked into the deep database for
your mom and this is all I could find.

660
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:38,405
Look at the top of the page.

661
00:40:45,245 --> 00:40:46,595
She was captured?

662
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,915
Yeah, and there's
nothing else after that.

663
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:54,155
This whole time, Ellie and I
thought that our mom left us

664
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:57,705
because she didn't care
about us, but she was taken.

665
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,795
Are you going to tell Ellie?

666
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,125
No.

667
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:06,905
No, not yet.

668
00:41:08,475 --> 00:41:12,125
If my mom is still alive, I'm going
to find her and bring her home.

669
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:16,065
Why did you bring me here?

670
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:20,435
I found out some interesting
information about you.

671
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:22,305
Someone is looking for you.

672
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:23,845
Who?

673
00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:26,765
Your family.

674
00:41:32,765 --> 00:41:35,075
Have you told Volkoff anything?

675
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:37,995
No, I told him nothing.

676
00:41:38,275 --> 00:41:39,615
That's good.

677
00:41:40,145 --> 00:41:44,935
