1
00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:03,392
Hey, I'm Chuck. Here's a couple of things

2
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:05,412
you might need to
know, maybe you just forgot.

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:08,222
We spared no expense
re-creating the Buy More.

4
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:12,002
It's now a full-fledged
CIA-NSA substation.

5
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:13,882
New Buy More? Rules.

6
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:17,452
Slides. Doors. And the new
super-spy nerd Herder Greta?

7
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:18,592
Be still, my beating heart.

8
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:20,222
I think you have earned this.

9
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:21,412
The keys to the Buy More.

10
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,962
I'm making you store manager, Mr. Grimes.

11
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:28,212
Maybe Awesome's right.

12
00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:30,962
Marriage, a baby...

13
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:35,312
Who knows? Maybe we're next.

14
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:52,392
When's food? I'm hungry.

15
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:54,102
Shut it, convict!

16
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:56,562
Talking my ear off.

17
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:10,772
We can get ten miles, max, but no
way we'll make Yucca Mountain.

18
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:15,512
We're being redirected.

19
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:18,192
New top-secret facility.

20
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,642
We're going where?

21
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:26,112
Attention, gamers! Your
patience is appreciated.

22
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:29,812
The midnight release of "Spy
Attack"is less than two hours away.

23
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:32,762
Somebody restack these DVDs players.

24
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:35,012
And I need a lot more blank CDs.

25
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:36,582
No, not.
Get these consoles out of there!

26
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:38,942
Guys, I need a lane going through here.

27
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:41,852
All right? I-I blogged about
listening skills last night.

28
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:44,262
Did anybody watch? No!

29
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:46,482
And it shows.

30
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:48,462
I don't think you're taking
this seriously enough, buddy.

31
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:50,262
Oh, I'm serious. I'm De Niro serious.

32
00:01:50,272 --> 00:01:51,942
Listen, the Buy More is CIA,

33
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:55,112
and as the manager, I am the
front line of the Buy More.

34
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:58,012
If things don't run smoothly up
here, well, it's a national security issue.

35
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:00,392
I need a sidearm. Preferably
like a Desert Eagle or some big...

36
00:02:00,402 --> 00:02:03,012
You're beyond De Niro. This
is Russell Crowe serious.

37
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,142
Okay, but listen, Chuck,

38
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:05,762
biggest game of the year drops tonight,

39
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:07,952
and these fan boys have
been camped out for a week...

40
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:10,402
A week. Without their
consoles and simulated killing.

41
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,302
You could cut their
bloodlust with a knife.

42
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:17,142
But that means I know
what they're thinking.

43
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:20,272
And they expect a full-blown, high-tech
launch presentation.

44
00:02:20,282 --> 00:02:22,442
All right, look, with just me at the helm,

45
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:25,402
this is it, dude; my
managerial Bushido test, okay?

46
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:26,992
And I'm ready. I want it.

47
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:28,552
And I don't need any help.

48
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:29,992
Well, you know, if
something was to go down,

49
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:32,172
there is a CIA presence lurking
about in the form of John Casey.

50
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:36,002
- Oh! And the new Greta.
- The new Greta?

51
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,172
Hello, Greta.

52
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:45,832
We're all set for the
game launch, Mr. Grimes.

53
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:48,592
- Ah, perfect.
- Any further tasks for me?

54
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:51,012
Filter, filter.

55
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:54,572
Nope. Nope. Carry on, well done.

56
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:56,902
Lovely to meet you.

57
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:59,342
What?

58
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:01,262
Where was I? I'm the manager.

59
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:04,202
I am the manager, national
security, all that, yadda yadda.

60
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:05,702
And as much as I wish
I could stay around

61
00:03:05,722 --> 00:03:08,322
and see how this all plays out, I
have to catch a flight in an hour.

62
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:10,702
- Oh, you don't say.
- Private jet to Monaco.

63
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:14,532
Wow. Good for you, a whole week
chasing some lazy oligarch down

64
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:17,472
the French Riviera with
your stunning girlfriend.

65
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:19,542
Did I mention that, too?

66
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:20,912
Buddy, it's gonna be the mission...

67
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:23,692
Of a lifetime; I-I-I think
you mentioned that, as well.

68
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:25,312
But hold on one second here.

69
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:28,162
What is with the unbridled
enthusiasm? I love it,

70
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:30,282
but where's the Chuck
relationship neurosis?

71
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:32,572
Where's the hand-wringing
and the, uh, mishegas?

72
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:34,772
Well, I'd never speak for Sarah.

73
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:40,012
But, if forced to, I'd say that she's
really, finally starting to settle down with me.

74
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:44,022
Wow. Let's pause. Be very still.

75
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:47,082
You are in a happy relationship, I'm
peaking professionally...

76
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:49,552
let's savor it.

77
00:03:54,162 --> 00:03:56,102
Smells like victory.

78
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:01,242
What's eating you, Walker?

79
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:02,732
Fighting like a pit bull, huh?

80
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,002
Did it change anything?

81
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:06,352
Finding out that you had a kid?

82
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:08,552
They say that your priorities change.

83
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:13,682
My priorities are the same:
God, country, duty, Corps.

84
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:18,322
Huh, all right, yeah.

85
00:04:18,332 --> 00:04:20,132
Sometimes I think about calling,

86
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:22,652
but... Alex has her own life.

87
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,642
I just don't know what
my role is. We done now?

88
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:26,302
What's with the interrogation?

89
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:28,862
Chuck let something slip last night.

90
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:31,182
About the future.

91
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:33,722
Oh, yeah? What?

92
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:36,032
Kids? With you?

93
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,472
Huh. Bartowski's the king of cool, huh?

94
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:41,552
I'm a spy.

95
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:43,502
I can't even process the
idea of having kids right now,

96
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:45,172
and I need to say something to him

97
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:47,242
before he runs away with the idea.

98
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:49,862
Yeah, he's probably already measuring
for drapes, wouldn't you say?

99
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:51,562
We're going on this
romantic trip to Monaco,

100
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:53,542
and he's gonna know
that something's wrong.

101
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:56,812
Yeah. You know, he's gonna keep
digging at you, too, till you give it up,

102
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:59,772
and then he's gonna spend
the rest of the trip moping.

103
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:04,582
Harness your fury, Agent Walker.

104
00:05:04,602 --> 00:05:08,882
Your mission to Monaco with Agent
Bartowski has been canceled.

105
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:11,372
Subtle, Walker.

106
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:15,712
Prisoner transport headed to our Yucca
Mountain Supermax was redirected to Castle.

107
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:20,482
The prisoners are ours until the transport
is repaired or a chopper frees up.

108
00:05:20,502 --> 00:05:22,662
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. What, canceled?

109
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:23,922
Monaco canceled?

110
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,212
Sarah, it was supposed
to be the mission...

111
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:28,182
Of a lifetime, I know, Chuck, but
there is a silver lining.

112
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,132
We get to stay in and
have a quiet night,

113
00:05:30,142 --> 00:05:32,802
and, um... and chat.

114
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:35,112
I don't know if I'd exactly
call that lining silver

115
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:38,332
as much as copper, or zinc, or manganese.

116
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:40,132
I mean, we were supposed
to be in St. Tropez

117
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:43,172
as Lord and Lady
Carmichael, all expenses...

118
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:46,242
paid...

119
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:49,532
Unless there's something we
needed to talk about, is there?

120
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:52,032
Lock and load, Chuck.

121
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:54,282
Sarah, hang on. This chat...

122
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:57,282
I mean, are we talking
about, like, like a chit-chat?

123
00:05:57,292 --> 00:06:00,612
Or... FDR fireside chat?

124
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:04,172
No, everything is fine. I just thought
that a night in might be nice.

125
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:07,572
A night in. At the Buy More.

126
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:11,202
Well, there's nothing I
love more than... a night.

127
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:13,792
Together. With you.

128
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:33,192
Gentlemen.

129
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:39,852
Carmichael.

130
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:43,892
Back off of him!

131
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,942
Yeah, nice quiet evening.

132
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:48,722
At least it can't get any worse.

133
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:52,482
Well, well, Jennie Burton.

134
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:55,872
My old high school punching bag.

135
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:59,332
Love your dungeon. Can't
wait to catch up.

136
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:09,307
Chuck 4x03 - Versus the Cubic Z

137
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,250
Guys, we've got 40 minutes
to the game launch.

138
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,050
Time to move some units, boys, all right?

139
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,380
Now, in the meantime, please
do me a favor: Fix this.

140
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,010
You know, shower,
shave, toothpaste, hair gel...

141
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,460
anything, okay, just...
try not to embarrass me.

142
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,700
Huh. You talk like you got
a lot of brass in your pants.

143
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,810
What...? For a dead man.

144
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,150
- He's here.
- Who's here?

145
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,810
The man whose job you stole: Big Mike.

146
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,590
- Move.
- All right.

147
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,830
I knew this day would come.

148
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,210
I specifically avoided my mother's
house so I didn't have to see him.

149
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,140
But I can handle this.

150
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,910
I can handle anything. Right? I am Cobra.

151
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,400
Son, I'm bursting.

152
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,360
With pride, seeing you in that suit.

153
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,280
I never wanted anyone else to wear it.

154
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,210
But if it's family, it's okay by me.

155
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,400
So, Mr. Panzer.

156
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,620
Hugo.

157
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,310
You on a new diet?
New workout... regimen?

158
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,170
'Cause you're looking pretty fit.

159
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,490
- Can I just...
- Nope.

160
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,360
- Just one thing.
- Not interested.

161
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,870
Oh, you're acting awful bitchy, Burton.

162
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,570
Or whatever it is you go by.

163
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,190
Sarah Walker.

164
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,830
And don't forget it.

165
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,240
All set.

166
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,420
You done with that newspaper?

167
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,000
Look who thinks he can read.

168
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,760
Sudoku fan, huh?

169
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,720
Go ahead.

170
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,850
Well, enjoy your new accommodations.

171
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,180
There's no room in my heart for anger.

172
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,930
Love, though? I'm full up!

173
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,780
I spent the past few
months out on the sea,

174
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:44,060
hunted with my bow, looking for my.
My inner Big Mike, my happiness.

175
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,570
I discovered the source of it.

176
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,900
- Good.
- Your momma.

177
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,630
And I want to do right by her.

178
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,310
I want to make her... an honest woman.

179
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,590
Let's stop talking.

180
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,210
All right? It was good seeing you.

181
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm really glad you came
by, actually, and, you know, we'll...

182
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,800
What is that?

183
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,330
That's a full half-caret
pear-cut cubic zirconium.

184
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,470
I came by here to ask
your permission to marry.

185
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,400
Bologna Garcia Bougainvillea Grimes.

186
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,630
Think on it.

187
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,430
Give it back to me when you think
I'm worthy of your mother's love.

188
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,160
Keep it on your person if you could.

189
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,110
I don't trust the
scoundrels working the store.

190
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,430
Nor should you.

191
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,770
But on that note, actually, I
should probably get back to work...

192
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,060
You and me both.

193
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,720
Know what I mean?

194
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,850
I intend to support
your momma as best I can.

195
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,380
But man-to-man, I'm
between gigs.

196
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,980
Hear there's a game launch.

197
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,270
You can always use an
extra hand there, am I right?

198
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,290
Especially when it's a
close relative asking?

199
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,220
Yeah, I'd... it's...

200
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,330
I won't let you down, son.

201
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,950
Ah! Boss.

202
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,840
Hey-ey. All right.

203
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,370
Grimes. Manager. Speak.

204
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,200
What?

205
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,270
What do you mean, we're only
getting six copies of "Spy Attack"?

206
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,690
I got 300 customers
waiting for this game...

207
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,940
Yes, I'll hold.

208
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,010
So, chat time?

209
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,120
Sure.

210
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,150
- Here?
- Yeah, okay.

211
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,610
Look, it's not a big deal.

212
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,750
I mean, well, it is... maybe.

213
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,700
Wh-What, it is a big
deal, Sarah? What is?

214
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,330
I love you, Chuck, that's the first thing.

215
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,870
I love being with you.

216
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,640
Ditto. Right back at ya.

217
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,950
It's just, um... Can
we, please, just for a second...

218
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,740
Did you just flash?

219
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,860
Heather Chandler is
in the Intersect 2.0.

220
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,940
She was connected to Frost.

221
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,620
I think she knows my mom.

222
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,690
I have to talk to her now, because
the transport will be here soon.

223
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,890
Chuck, unless you want Beckman to
know that we're looking for your mom,

224
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,910
we don't have the authority
to interrogate Chandler.

225
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,740
Well, we don't have the authority to use the
supply closet for what it is we use it for,

226
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,670
but we do it anyway, don't
we? Look, she knows my mom.

227
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,780
Okay, fine. But you can't just
start whipping questions out

228
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,130
to somebody like Heather Chandler.

229
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,830
It's, it's just not gonna work.

230
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,360
This needs to be a real interrogation.

231
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,350
Good cop, bad cop.

232
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,060
How about tough cop, silent cop?

233
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,980
Okey-dokey, which one am I?

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,250
Right, right, got it.

235
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,020
Oh, hey, uh, real quick though:

236
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,330
Time machine.

237
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,940
In case things go south,

238
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,170
use "time machine" in a sentence.

239
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,930
That'll be code to back off and regroup.

240
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,710
Okay. Just remember:
Tough cop. Silent cop.

241
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,120
Of course.

242
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,720
We need information on an
arms deal you were involved in,

243
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,260
with Alexei Volkoff and an
agent whose code name is Frost.

244
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,560
And coming my way is...?

245
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,630
Optimal placement at Yucca Mountain,

246
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,110
and favorable parole review.

247
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,980
How about a unicorn, too?

248
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,090
I'm as likely to get that as
the crap you just offered up.

249
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,920
You know, sarcasm is
the lowest form of...

250
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,940
- Sorry.
- You want to offer me something?

251
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,730
Witness protection.

252
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,120
For that, I'll spew on Volkoff
and Frosty the Snow Bitch.

253
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,970
But we both know that's
handled by WitSec,

254
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,600
who I'd be happy to talk with.

255
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,900
Not some wispy man-boy and a
bottle blond with a daddy complex.

256
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,180
You-you got a lot of nerve
talking to her like that.

257
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,780
Burton can handle a little
ribbing from an old pal.

258
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,670
You're her partner, Chuck, not
her boyfriend.

259
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,190
Wait.

260
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,360
You two are actually together?

261
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,360
Uh-us? We? No.

262
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,690
- We're not, no.
- Oh, get out!

263
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,750
You kids are an item! He's
not just your partner.

264
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,580
Isn't spy sex great?

265
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,730
- Heather, we were discussing your.
- So. How deep are you? Shacking up?

266
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,520
Doing the dog thing
first, or straight to babies?

267
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,260
One?

268
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,930
Five?

269
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,540
- Time machine.
- Time machine? Really?

270
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,970
Right. Okay...

271
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,190
When I said use it in a sentence,

272
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,480
I was thinking more along the lines of,

273
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,270
"You want to relive your
past, honey?"Then get a time machine."

274
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,100
You know, we really
need to take this slow.

275
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,700
Absolutely. Look, I'm
sorry I lost it in there,

276
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,100
If you let her get under your skin,

277
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,030
about the living
together thing, and about...

278
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,100
the other thing that she
mentioned-we're not gonna get anywhere.

279
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,180
The other-other thing?
What is that other thing?

280
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,680
Remember: Tough. Silent.

281
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,360
Do not let her get under your skin.

282
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,890
She's, she's not. She won't.
What? Hey.

283
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,420
Okay.

284
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,840
Food, Panzer.

285
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,770
We can contact WitSec...

286
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,290
So when did you two
start dating for reals?

287
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,580
But first we need a good faith offering.

288
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,520
You know why she won't
talk about this, Chuck.

289
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,840
Because it makes her edgy. I get it.

290
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,490
You met my so-called
husband/con victim, right?

291
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,220
I toyed with normal life.

292
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,420
Played happy homemaker for a while.

293
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,820
And as soon as he got
serious, I robbed him blind.

294
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,020
My advice? Pull the ripcord
before you get fried.

295
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,110
The only thing getting
pulled is a rope...

296
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,220
Hey, look at my time
machine! We have an appointment.

297
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,840
I'm gonna handle this.

298
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,540
I can handle multiple stressors at once.

299
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,370
Angry mob? Of course.

300
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,910
Lifetime of calling Big Mike...

301
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,140
"Dad"?

302
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,260
I really do not like that woman.

303
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,290
Yeah. Yeah, that's clear.

304
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,600
What's not is why this topic of
you and me is such a hot button.

305
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,120
What's going on?

306
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,610
Uh, Chuck, we have a problem.

307
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,950
We do? Is that what you
wanted to chat about?

308
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,530
- 'Cause I thought we were en fuego.
- No, we have a serious problem.

309
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:17,664
If he's trying to escape, why
doesn't he just run?

310
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:21,194
This might be about me. I kicked
his ass on an airplane once.

311
00:16:21,204 --> 00:16:22,314
Hey, Chandler.

312
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:25,384
Mr. Volkoff says hello.

313
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:27,764
You send her out
now, and no one else dies.

314
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:30,434
Don't open that door.

315
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,994
Heather? What is going on?
What is this about Volkoff?

316
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:37,494
This morning, I got a transfer to
Yucca Mountain, out of the blue.

317
00:16:37,504 --> 00:16:40,014
I get in the transport, and that
monster's in the other cage.

318
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:41,644
Volkoff engineered the transfer?

319
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:42,914
He's capable of it.

320
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:45,264
Wh-Why would he want
to? What did you do?

321
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:47,884
Nothing. He's being petty.

322
00:16:48,694 --> 00:16:50,504
I blew a
half-a-billion-dollar deal.

323
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:51,984
The F-22 plans were for him.

324
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:53,514
I guess he's mad.

325
00:16:53,524 --> 00:16:55,954
Come on, Casey. Pick up.

326
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,644
Come on, Casey. Real
fast, you just inform the...

327
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:01,904
anxious horde that the
game distributor made

328
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:03,764
a slight error and there's going
to be a delay in delivery time.

329
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,114
You know, two weeks.

330
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,234
Sounds like a job for the manager.

331
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:08,994
No games.

332
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:11,464
- Casey.
- Casey, a prisoner has escaped in Castle,

333
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:14,364
- and we're trapped in cell six.
- On my way.

334
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:17,384
Colonel, I know I'm
supposed to be upstairs,

335
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:19,534
but Doc Bollywood was
staring down my shirt

336
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:22,144
and those losers in line
are just freaking me out.

337
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:24,314
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just
get to the cell block...

338
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:34,274
Greta! Greta, what's happening?

339
00:17:34,474 --> 00:17:37,334
She's indisposed.

340
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:46,464
Uh, uh. Guys, guys,

341
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,954
uh, Panzer's on the computer right
now, but I can't see what he's doing.

342
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:50,824
Buying patio umbrellas.

343
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,984
He's trying to get to us, you dope.

344
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:55,644
Boy, you're a charmer.

345
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:10,794
PERIMETER LOCKDOWN

346
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:13,224
Walker, you're going to have to
override the Castle lockdown.

347
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:15,184
- Can't get in.
- I didn't put the system into lockdown.

348
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,844
I just locked the door to cell six.

349
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,584
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Panzer
locked us in?

350
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:20,214
This is not good, people, okay?

351
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,564
I've been locked in enclosed
spaces with this guy before.

352
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:25,234
I handled it fine, but he got very edgy.

353
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:33,734
He's using the mainframe
to open each cell door.

354
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:35,614
There's a fire override. I'm
going to have to access it.

355
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:37,664
Hold on.

356
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:41,094
Come on, come on.

357
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:45,464
Door two's open.

358
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:49,754
Hello, Colonel Casey. Welcome to
the new Castle override mainframe.

359
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:50,844
How can I help you today?

360
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:54,584
- You got to be kidding me.
- I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

361
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:58,394
And door three.

362
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,114
Location of fire emergency override.

363
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:04,674
Did you say "hire nursery overhige"?

364
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,604
Why would I say "overhige"?
It's not even a real word.

365
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:10,024
I'm sorry. I didn't get that.

366
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:12,464
Door five.

367
00:19:14,924 --> 00:19:18,194
Fire emergency override.
Where is it? Or you die.

368
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:21,554
The fire emergency override
is behind my monitor.

369
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:24,584
Just press control, escape...

370
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:30,474
Thank you, Casey.

371
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:32,784
Okay, ladies, let's go. Move out.

372
00:19:33,364 --> 00:19:34,794
You go first. Scare the rats.

373
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:37,884
No, you go first so I
can keep an eye on you.

374
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:41,104
Sarah. You. Me. Go now. Come on.

375
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:50,584
Dude, we're totally screwed.

376
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:53,064
No. No. This is a positive.

377
00:19:53,074 --> 00:19:55,484
Okay? Today, we get to be challenged.

378
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,864
So I'm going to make a phone call

379
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:58,714
and I'm going to get us the
games that we were promised.

380
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:01,584
Now, you will handle
the launch presentation.

381
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:03,624
At midnight, we will settle the crowd.

382
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:04,714
You will read from the script.

383
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:07,074
And you'll read from the script slowly.

384
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:12,504
You don't just drop a role in a man's
lap, and say, "Go, seal, clap for your fish."

385
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:17,154
I must make this my own
if I am to undertake it.

386
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:19,514
Whatever.

387
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:21,954
This is no big deal. I can handle this.

388
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:24,354
I can handle multiple stressors.

389
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:28,874
What monkey flung this? No.

390
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:39,874
You know, I was thinking about how some of
my favorite movies wind up in air ducts.

391
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:42,864
Like Aliens and Die Hard.

392
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:46,574
Although, generally speaking, it doesn't
wind up well for the duct crawlers.

393
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:48,964
Thanks for that, movie dork.

394
00:20:48,974 --> 00:20:51,063
I bet you have, like, a
Tron poster in your room.

395
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:54,524
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep
crawling, sister.

396
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,313
- Walker, where are you?
- We're just passing coupling duct 5A.

397
00:21:19,673 --> 00:21:21,422
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

398
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:23,843
In ten feet, turn left, straight
on into the junction room.

399
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:26,293
- Heading there to unlock it now.
- Any sign of Panzer?

400
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:30,523
Not at Castle. But he's
after you. So watch your back.

401
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,232
That's fantastic. You hear that, Chuck?

402
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:36,302
Stay alert, as in, don't distract
yourself, staring at my tail.

403
00:21:36,303 --> 00:21:40,593
- Looking at your-no, no. Thank
you, no. - I'm kidding.

404
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,103
Jenny-Sarah, how did you
end up with such a goofball?

405
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:45,562
Masculine goofball, thank you very much.

406
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:48,762
Oh, you're sweet. I did
the sweet guy thing, too.

407
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:49,943
I know how it ends.

408
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:54,303
Sorry. Foot slipped.

409
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:57,242
Ooh-ooh, touchy.

410
00:21:57,243 --> 00:22:00,563
Must be hitting home. Of course I am.

411
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:05,773
We're almost at the junction.

412
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,833
Three, two, one.

413
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:11,423
{a6}Game launch.

414
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,143
Attack.

415
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,933
Nice and orderly. You are in
for the night of your lives.

416
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:22,623
Don't get your hopes up.
There's not enough games.

417
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:26,462
Hey, hey. Don't say that. Everything's
fine, everybody. Everything is great.

418
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:28,393
Go get your.
Listen to me. Stretch it out.

419
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:30,193
Stretch it out just a
bit longer for me, guys,

420
00:22:30,194 --> 00:22:31,803
'cause we are almost out of the woods.

421
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:35,032
- Easy, sister. We've got this covered.
- Okay.

422
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:37,073
- We've got this covered.
- All right.

423
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:40,643
What do we hear? Oh, yes.

424
00:22:41,983 --> 00:22:44,293
Jerry. What's going on, my
man? What did you score me?

425
00:22:44,294 --> 00:22:45,693
How many you got? What
do you got? How many games?

426
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:48,962
Yeah. Yeah. Two? Two games.

427
00:22:48,963 --> 00:22:52,273
That's-I-That's not enough, Jerry.
I gots to have more games, brother.

428
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:55,513
Hello? Jerry? Jerry? Come on.

429
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,023
Son, your crowd is surly.
And you got no product.

430
00:23:00,473 --> 00:23:02,093
I don't want to tell you
how to do your business,

431
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:05,243
- but the sheep need a shepherd.
- Yeah.

432
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,473
They sure do. Sheep, huh? Sweet
little sheep?

433
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:27,033
Okay, Casey's going to
have to unlock this for us.

434
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:29,083
- Until then.
- I'll finish what I was saying.

435
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:31,213
Running your mouth is not going
to get you witness protection.

436
00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:33,053
You were never going to
call witness protection.

437
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:35,243
So let's just call
this payback for lying.

438
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:39,292
What do you mean, payback?

439
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:43,943
I got hitched to a dork, just like you.
Sweet, dumb,

440
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,913
loyal, a mutt.
And that was attractive.

441
00:23:47,223 --> 00:23:50,272
I thought,"This schmuck is
going to make me a better person.

442
00:23:50,273 --> 00:23:54,282
" And for ten minutes, I convinced myself I
didn't mind movie night or dinner at 6:00.

443
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:56,412
But then my true nature kicked in.

444
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:58,803
And the reason this
conversation has Burton so upset

445
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,333
is because it's doing the same for her.

446
00:24:01,763 --> 00:24:03,643
- We're the same.
- Not going to dignify this.

447
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:06,302
Right, yeah. Because
we are professionals.

448
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:10,453
- And we cannot hear a word that you are saying.
- She's all spy.

449
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:15,192
White weddings, rug rats in a
minivan? It's not in our wiring.

450
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:17,823
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Heather, guess what?

451
00:24:18,263 --> 00:24:21,142
- You talk too much.
- Burton? Be kind to him.

452
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:23,503
He's too sick in love to see the truth.

453
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:28,122
Just remember, she keeps
secrets for a living.

454
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:30,152
Tell me, why are we
saving your life again?

455
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:32,272
Because of my connection with Frost.

456
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:34,543
And my time with her in Burma.

457
00:24:35,263 --> 00:24:36,193
Casey?

458
00:24:37,063 --> 00:24:39,632
I'm right, and she can't face it.

459
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:42,702
- That's why she's upset.
- She's not upset, Heather. Okay?

460
00:24:42,703 --> 00:24:45,993
- I know what she looks like when she's
upset, and it's more like - Look out!

461
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,133
No!

462
00:24:58,553 --> 00:25:02,233
- Help me! - Sorry, kitten. You're on your own.
You know you'd do the same. Slipping again. Slipping. Sarah!

463
00:25:10,271 --> 00:25:13,703
No, no, no. Not the tie. Not the tie.

464
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:34,103
- Sarah, help me!
- Chuck!

465
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,693
Carmichael!

466
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:03,853
Sarah, help me!

467
00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:06,033
Chuck! Come on.

468
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:16,282
That felt good.

469
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:21,723
You know, they wanted me
to read you this trash.

470
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:24,203
But you deserve better.

471
00:26:24,204 --> 00:26:30,003
We, as a people, deserve better.

472
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:36,313
So brace yourselves for a free-form

473
00:26:36,593 --> 00:26:40,043
no-holds-barred
a-poetry slam.

474
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:45,432
And a kung fu demonstration of
moves in the game Spy Attack.

475
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,892
Can we just buy the dumb game?

476
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:50,933
No, you cannot!

477
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:58,353
How far down did he go?

478
00:26:58,553 --> 00:27:01,433
- Could you see the bottom of the duct?
- It was too dark.

479
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:05,193
And I was kind of concentrating
on his fists flying at me.

480
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,613
You're a real tough guy, Chuck.

481
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:13,232
This morning, I was going to Monte Carlo.

482
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:15,713
But instead, I spent the
night as a canned good.

483
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,893
It's funny the way that life can suck.

484
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:23,453
Move and you die, tunnel rat.

485
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:25,613
All right, got him.

486
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:28,453
Transport on the roof in two minutes.

487
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:43,783
About Frost, last chance to deal.

488
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:46,883
You're just a dog with a bone. No dice.

489
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:51,793
Good luck. I'm rooting for you.

490
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:54,703
- But I'm certainly not betting on you.
- Shut it, convict.

491
00:27:55,063 --> 00:27:57,263
You're not letting
Heather get to you, are you?

492
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,943
No, of course not. I'm all good.

493
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:03,713
I know your "all goods" and
that was not a real "all good."

494
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:07,623
It was a fake "all
good."I'm just curious why

495
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:10,293
what she said got under
your skin like that.

496
00:28:10,543 --> 00:28:14,763
Well, once we get rid of these
guys, we will have our chat.

497
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,023
What are you smiling at?

498
00:28:25,473 --> 00:28:26,753
This doesn't smell right.

499
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:31,423
They're not CIA. They're Volkoff's men.

500
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:33,973
Down, down, down, down!

501
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,900
Volkoff must have
intercepted our transport.

502
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,680
Chuck, we'll handle the gunfight.
You go after the prisoner.

503
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,250
You go for the exit. I got you covered.

504
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,320
Casey!

505
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,790
I'm all right.

506
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,510
Your man's wounded, pinned down.

507
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,540
Give us Chandler and you both live.

508
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,870
Hand me over. Save your ass.

509
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,900
We both know what you're
gonna do, so just do it.

510
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,779
You kept me alive for information,
but it's not worth dying over.

511
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,400
I know you, Walker.

512
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,450
I know what you're going to do.

513
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,159
You don't know who I am or what
I want or the thoughts in my head.

514
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,080
We have nothing in common.

515
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,370
On the count of three, two, one.

516
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,960
That was my last bullet.

517
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,649
The flea-ridden masses infest my house.

518
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,859
Do I cry, perchance to die? No, McFly!

519
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,410
This game launch will not be televised.

520
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,319
Enough, man, just give us
the game! We want the game!

521
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,910
We want the game! We want the game!

522
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,450
We want the game! We want the game!

523
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,299
We want the game! We want the game!

524
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,949
- We want the game!
- Guys!

525
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,430
- We want the game!
- Guys!

526
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,790
The games didn't show.

527
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,510
- So shut up and let the poetry slam you.
- Thank you.

528
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,980
- Freeze, Panzer.
- Look awful shaky with that pea shooter, boy.

529
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,270
- How's your aim in tight quarters?
- Perfect.

530
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,679
'Cause that's the gas line. You hit that
instead of me, this whole building goes.

531
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,220
So it is. But that doesn't
matter, because you're trapped.

532
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,180
Yeah, I don't think these air ducts
were meant to hold 400 pounds,

533
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:41,570
and since most of that is
you, I need you to back up now.

534
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,760
You're losing them, son.
They're going to rampage.

535
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,569
Hey! Hey, hey, don't!

536
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,189
Halt! Halt! Halt!

537
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,330
Everybody just.
Whoa.

538
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,799
Oh, no. Oh, no!

539
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,640
Oh, Morgan, Morgan!

540
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,280
Back up.

541
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:06,070
- You back up.
- You back up.

542
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,890
The engagement ring!

543
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,030
Look, this is a call to arms.

544
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,560
I brought my black case
for just such an occasion.

545
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,549
It's in my car. Go get it for me.

546
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,500
I don't work for you. I do work for you.

547
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,530
REPAIRED

548
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,199
- Get on your feet, son.
- I can't.

549
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,490
I can't.
The-the-the.

550
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,559
- There's a riot going on.
- Right, right.

551
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,030
But your engagement ring.
It fell out of my pocket.

552
00:34:06,031 --> 00:34:07,410
I've looked everywhere. I can't find it.

553
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:09,050
I screwed up, okay? I need your help.

554
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,870
- You find the ring, I'll take care of the riot.
- Yes, sir.

555
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,810
Excuse me, fools. I said excuse me, fools!

556
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,520
That's not fair.

557
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,670
What is this madness?

558
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:47,380
Yes, we promised something
we couldn't deliver.

559
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:52,540
Yes, had we delivered, you
would have been overcharged.

560
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,890
Is that any reason to behave like this?

561
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,949
You got to ditch your
lives and spend a full week

562
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,060
with your dorky friends
talking video games,

563
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,030
which no sane person would
have ever done with you.

564
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,010
And because we came up
a little short on supply,

565
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,870
there's a riot?

566
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,920
Hell no!

567
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,820
- This ain't no video game.
- It's not.

568
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,109
- This is real life.
- The truth of life.

569
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,359
- This violence ends now!
- Not later.

570
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,329
- Peacefully!
- With peace.

571
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,690
- Quietly!
- With a whisper.

572
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,520
- All civil like.
- Like a civilian.

573
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,830
- Move it. Get out of my way.
- Excuse me, son.

574
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,180
You'd best stop.
Or I will come down there

575
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,319
and make an example of you.

576
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,900
- Try and stop me, fat man.
- What? Who's this?

577
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,560
Give me the Disco
Stick. That boy is family,

578
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,560
and my name is Mike.

579
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,240
Big Mike.

580
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,380
Mr. Big Mike.

581
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,140
- All right?
- Well done.

582
00:36:27,074 --> 00:36:30,125
- Another Purple Heart, Casey.
- I'm fine.

583
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:32,175
Gonna be laid up for a while.

584
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:34,395
- Paid vacation.
- Yeah.

585
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,775
I can't stand the silence.

586
00:36:37,715 --> 00:36:41,655
Well, maybe you could use the
time to meet up with Alex.

587
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:45,495
Figure out what your
role is in her life.

588
00:36:47,745 --> 00:36:49,485
You should do the same for Bartowski.

589
00:36:49,885 --> 00:36:51,685
So we can get back to
normal around here, hmm?

590
00:36:53,005 --> 00:36:54,645
Whatever that means.

591
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:09,165
Operation Beacon.
That's where I met Frost.

592
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:13,155
What's Beacon?

593
00:37:13,695 --> 00:37:15,595
It was supposed to be an
underground arms pipeline,

594
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:17,515
but I lit out before it was active.

595
00:37:17,955 --> 00:37:19,865
Frost was always around Volkoff.

596
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:24,194
Doing what exactly? What does that mean?

597
00:37:24,195 --> 00:37:26,565
I couldn't get the full
gist of their relationship.

598
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:27,875
But she was there.

599
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,815
Maybe she had to be.

600
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:32,615
That's all I know.

601
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:36,085
Hugo's ready to roll.

602
00:37:38,145 --> 00:37:38,905
Let's go.

603
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:41,935
Thank you.

604
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,875
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we aren't alike at all.

605
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:52,975
Maybe you are capable of
love, affection and vulnerability.

606
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:54,715
I hope so.

607
00:37:54,945 --> 00:37:57,095
Chuck seems like a really nice guy.

608
00:37:57,835 --> 00:37:59,545
And he's really in love.

609
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:01,775
Are you?

610
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:04,455
Good-bye, Heather.

611
00:38:38,055 --> 00:38:41,445
I looked everywhere, Big Mike.
I couldn't find your ring.

612
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:43,955
But I did find this.

613
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,145
Don't give me this because
you think I'm upset.

614
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:51,354
The assistant manager's
vest is a sacred vestment.

615
00:38:51,355 --> 00:38:53,284
No, I know. Believe me.

616
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:56,704
But you're the best.
You can handle anything.

617
00:38:56,705 --> 00:38:59,214
And I would be proud to have
you as assistant manager.

618
00:38:59,215 --> 00:39:04,175
Although I understand if you
couldn't quite forgive me yet.

619
00:39:05,075 --> 00:39:07,315
I just want you to know that
I'm really sorry about the ring.

620
00:39:07,316 --> 00:39:09,075
Marriage isn't about a ring.

621
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:14,405
It's a lifelong commitment of
compassion and understanding.

622
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:18,175
Especially for your
spouse's idiot relations.

623
00:39:18,905 --> 00:39:20,285
All is forgiven.

624
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:23,915
Here. This is yours.

625
00:39:24,715 --> 00:39:25,775
And for what it's worth,

626
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:30,475
you have my permission
to... marry my mom.

627
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:33,515
Son.

628
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:57,695
So Beacon.
It's a... it's a place to start.

629
00:39:58,635 --> 00:40:01,474
Bringing us to the... long-delayed

630
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:05,535
and much-anticipated... chat.

631
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:10,854
The other night when you repeated

632
00:40:10,855 --> 00:40:14,735
what Awesome said about
us being next having kids

633
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:19,834
- it scared me.
- Okay.

634
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,954
And I wanted to tell you
earlier, but, um, I didn't,

635
00:40:22,955 --> 00:40:24,875
and I've been thinking
about it all day long.

636
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:28,395
And Heather kept poking
the topic with a needle.

637
00:40:30,655 --> 00:40:32,125
You're nothing like her.

638
00:40:33,425 --> 00:40:36,355
For a long time, I was exactly like her.

639
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:41,535
And it took me a night in the guts of the
building to realize that I'm not anymore.

640
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:45,575
At all. And I don't want to be.

641
00:40:47,935 --> 00:40:52,074
But I-I do need to take things slow.

642
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,255
I'm not ready for parenthood either.

643
00:40:56,235 --> 00:41:00,664
One day, hopefully, but
not now, not yet anyway.

644
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:04,365
Who are we kidding? I'm
barely on solid food myself, so.

645
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:09,225
Okay So, slow.

646
00:41:11,475 --> 00:41:14,235
Super slow. Really slow.

647
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,195
Let's start small.

648
00:41:29,785 --> 00:41:33,385
- You tell me ready or not ready.
- Okay.

649
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,975
We're on a trip. One of
us forgets our toothbrush.

650
00:41:40,455 --> 00:41:43,985
- Do we share?
- I am ready to share your toothbrush.

651
00:41:44,945 --> 00:41:46,415
Oh, oh, using the bathroom.

652
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:50,674
- Door open or shut?
- Door shut. Always.

653
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:54,935
- Preferably with the sink
running or the radio on. - Yes.
