1
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:17,633
Good year.

2
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:55,202
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

3
00:01:58,444 --> 00:01:59,468
Mm.

4
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:01,644
Chuck, are you feeling okay?

5
00:02:01,814 --> 00:02:04,544
Fine. Good. Great. I'm great.

6
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:07,982
- Heh, great. Why do you ask?
- You seem a little nervous.

7
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:09,382
Me nervous. No, I'm not.

8
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:11,682
I don't feel nervous at all,
I don't think.

9
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:15,349
Just... It's just this is a very...
It's an incredibly romantic restaurant.

10
00:02:15,528 --> 00:02:18,224
- I'm just taking it all in.
- Chuck, you can talk to me.

11
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:20,627
- Is this about your mom?
- No.

12
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,735
Um, I've realized something.
After all the stuff...

13
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:26,531
with my mom and Volkoff and...

14
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:31,268
I realized that, you know,
I haven't really been thinking about us.

15
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:33,069
You and me, heh.

16
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:36,371
I've been so wrapped up in all the things
I couldn't control...

17
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,610
that I forgot to focus on the things
that I could.

18
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,012
Like tonight.

19
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:46,550
What about tonight?

20
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:48,554
Um...

21
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:52,425
I've been dragging my feet on this.
I've been waiting for the right moment...

22
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:56,034
to talk about what it's gonna be like
for us and our future and...

23
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:59,603
Chuck, don't even worry about it.
I know you've got so much going on.

24
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:03,208
You've had so much happen to you
in the last few months.

25
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:06,209
Uh, besides, I've got such a bad history
with proposals.

26
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:12,015
No. No, not me.
My parents had a nightmare proposal.

27
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:16,009
- I'm sure it can't have been that bad.
- No, it was bad.

28
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:21,052
My mother's family had a restaurant.
It was similar to this and they loved it...

29
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:23,218
so my dad wanted to propose there.

30
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,657
God, he had the champagne
and the flowers...

31
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,926
and the band and the balloons and...

32
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:33,333
I mean, it was chaotic.
It was so over-the-top...

33
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:36,508
and in all the confusion,
somebody knocked over a candle...

34
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,803
and it lit the rug on fire.

35
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:42,004
Luckily, my mother and her family
got out with only minor burns.

36
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,308
- Minor burns. You don't say.
- Yeah.

37
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:48,920
So please take your time, Chuck.
Heh, no rush.

38
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:58,287
Um, that's an awful story.
I mean, that's really, really awful.

39
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:01,797
I'm sure they had a great laugh about it
on their wedding day, right?

40
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:06,131
No. They took it as a sign
and they postponed the wedding.

41
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:09,866
My dad always said it was the beginning
of the end of their relationship.

44
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:19,184
Can you hear that?
I thought I told you about that.

45
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:21,047
When we're kissing or whatever?

46
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,450
If you would just excuse me,
I'm just gonna, ha, ha...

47
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:25,351
I'll be right back.

48
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:29,854
- Morgan, Morgan, abort.
- Damn it, I knew it.

49
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:32,862
- Not enough balloons.
- You bought the whole store. No.

50
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:34,659
No balloons. The proposal is off.

51
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:38,463
- We can't have it in an Italian restaurant.
- Is she on a no-carb thing?

52
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:42,573
No, we can't have it in any restaurant.
That's how her parents' proposal went.

53
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:45,006
We gotta shut it down,
gotta shut it down now.

54
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:47,839
- I can't shut it down.
- Why? What are you talking about?

55
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:50,743
The champagne, the string quartet,
the caballeros.

56
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,407
- The caballos?
- Whatever, man. It's all in motion.

57
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:55,280
We are in too deep here.

58
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,151
Excuse me. Hey. Hi.

59
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:03,022
The champagne, let's cancel that.

60
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,493
The bottle's already open.
Um, who's gonna drink it?

61
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:08,656
I... Ugh, this lovely couple.
Please, my treat.

62
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,927
- Oh, no, we don't indulge.
- Says who?

63
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,366
What?

64
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:17,174
- Get out. Go.
- All right.

65
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,709
Oh, Beckman called.
We've got a mission.

66
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,908
Oh, gosh. That's really a bummer.
I wanted to...

67
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:28,315
Well, duty's duty, right?

68
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:30,916
No. Take a hike.

69
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,923
Let's take the side exit.
It's really scenic, huh?

70
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:35,856
My balloons.

71
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,530
Chuck 4x11 - Versus the Balcony

72
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,550
Agent Rosenbaum, one of our finest...

73
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,883
was gunned down earlier today
while transporting a nanochip...

74
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:26,388
containing the secret locations
and blueprints...

75
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,756
of our CIA black sites in Europe.
This is the chip.

76
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,724
A nanochip can be injected
into an agent if in trouble.

77
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,561
And then extracted back at Langley.

78
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:37,726
None of that sounds very pleasant.

79
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:39,064
I'm sorry, general.

80
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:42,264
Some moron was clogging up Ventura
with a horse and carriage.

81
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:43,999
At ease, colonel.

82
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:46,269
Agent Rosenbaum's body
was returned to us...

83
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:49,505
yet our tests show no trace
of the nanochip's presence.

84
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:53,243
We believe the chip is somewhere
within this chateau.

85
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:56,116
Uh, don't tell me this mission
is in France.

86
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:58,814
Pierre Melville,
a French radical turned terrorist...

87
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:01,391
is also searching for the nanochip.

88
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:02,994
Um, one of Volkoff's men?

89
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:06,029
Not every criminal works
for Alexei Volkoff, Chuck.

90
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:07,663
Agents Walker, Bartowski...

91
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,126
you'll attend the wine-tasting gala
at the chateau tomorrow.

92
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:15,138
Colonel, you will be posing as
Agent Bartowski's personal manservant.

93
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:20,542
Colonel in the Marine Corps
demoted to manservant for a nerd.

94
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:25,511
Hey, um, I'm sorry about dinner.

95
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:29,849
Hey, no, it's just dinner, you know, heh.

96
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,157
I should, uh, go check in with Morgan.

97
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:45,296
General, I know why Chuck was asking
about Volkoff.

98
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:46,995
He's concerned for his family.

99
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,869
And I wanna make something
absolutely clear.

100
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,738
I will do anything
to help bring back Chuck's mother...

101
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:55,176
and to eliminate Volkoff
and his organization.

102
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:59,006
I understand your commitment,
Agent Walker, and I commend it.

103
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:03,211
But we must wait
for the right opportunity.

104
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:07,256
It was just dinner.

105
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,894
It's hard enough asking a super spy
to marry you...

106
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:13,031
but I have to propose to a super spy
with proposal issues.

107
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,531
Hey, buddy, we will bounce back.
I was thinking...

108
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:17,328
No, we're not gonna bounce back.

109
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:21,439
What happened to Sarah's parents
became a symbol for everything in life.

110
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:24,906
I need the perfect proposal.
And, of course, we have a new mission.

111
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:27,875
You are going to a chateau
in the French countryside.

112
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:30,106
Moats and wine
and the woman of your dreams.

113
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:32,273
- What are you proposing?
- What am I...?

114
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:34,976
Come here. Sub-mission.

115
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:39,246
To ask Sarah Walker
to marry you in the Loire Valley.

116
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:41,950
It is known as the Garden of France.
You know that?

117
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:45,291
The best part of this whole idea
is the CIA is footing the bill.

118
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:47,762
I need to think about my team
and the objective.

119
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,128
Not to mention
I'm a horrible multitasker.

120
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:52,198
- No sub-mission.
- I respect that.

121
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:53,599
And respectfully disagree.

122
00:08:53,773 --> 00:08:56,071
We have exhausted
all Burbank proposal options.

123
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:59,143
What we need is a marital miracle,
and I think this is it.

124
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:01,506
Why is everyone so obsessed
with marriage?

125
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,444
I don't wanna talk about it.

126
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:09,815
- You should take care of that.
- Me?

127
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:13,048
No, no. That's why I have my fixer.
Uh, Michael?

128
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,283
Talk to me, Patel.

129
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,624
You seem more angry and unhappy
than usual, which is tough.

130
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:20,595
You're a curmudgeonly little guy.

131
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:26,500
I just wanna be free, Big Michael.
But my control-freak parents...

132
00:09:26,672 --> 00:09:28,196
have arranged a marriage for me.

133
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:31,668
First generation woes. Tough stuff.

134
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:35,007
They're stuck in the ways
of the old country. Dated traditions...

135
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:37,843
obsolete dietary restrictions.
I keep telling them...

136
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,416
I live in the United States
of America now.

137
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:42,747
I'm not in Canada anymore.

138
00:09:44,323 --> 00:09:45,950
You mean India, right?

139
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,422
What? No.

140
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:50,426
No, I'm from Saskatchewan.
The Hinjews of Saskatchewan.

141
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:52,996
Some believe
that we were a cult of sorts.

142
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:54,962
- I see.
- Anyway, they don't get it.

143
00:09:55,134 --> 00:09:57,796
I've embraced America
and its great traditions...

144
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,437
like online dating.

145
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:00,799
Which, FYI...

146
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:02,600
I am killing it.

147
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:04,174
Ha, ha, I've been there.

148
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:06,436
I've had three dates already today.

149
00:10:07,313 --> 00:10:09,304
- During work?
- They come to me, man.

150
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:12,883
Not great, uh, individually,
but solid fours.

151
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:14,985
Three fours? That's a 12.

152
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:18,884
Exactly, man. No Saskatchewan bride
could ever top that.

153
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:24,393
And the worst part is,
my parents are sending her here.

154
00:10:24,897 --> 00:10:26,797
What the hell am I gonna do?

155
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:31,130
How about the truth, son?
The truth shall set you free.

156
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:35,567
Brilliant. But let her down easy.

157
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:38,869
The truth can be harsh.
Let's... Let's be kind about this.

158
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:40,837
Thanks, bud.

159
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:46,715
The nanochip emits an encrypted signal
that only our CIA trackers can detect.

160
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:49,218
Need to get close enough
to pick up the signal...

161
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:51,549
recover the chip
before Pierre and his men.

162
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:54,659
- Check. Let's go.
- Yeah.

163
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:59,553
Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going?

164
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:01,757
Time for the real mission.
The sub-mission.

165
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:04,425
No, no, Morgan,
we've talked about this.

166
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:09,597
Listen to me. Everything is in place
for a perfect proposal, okay?

167
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:12,710
I've pinpointed
potential proposal locations.

168
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:15,005
Here, balcony overlooking
the countryside...

169
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:16,944
rose garden, quaint stone bridge.

170
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:20,676
When searching for this nano-whatever,
choose whichever location you like.

171
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:24,050
I don't care, but watch Sarah.
She'll show you to the spot.

172
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:27,090
And remember something.
You can do this.

173
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:29,420
Morgan, I've already told you,
no sub-mission.

174
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:32,462
Well, at least you're keeping
an open mind about it, so...

175
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:51,982
No sign of Pierre yet.

176
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:53,913
Keep your eyes open.

177
00:11:54,086 --> 00:11:56,077
Right. I'm on it.

178
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:06,665
Is this place amazing or what?
It feels so...

179
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:08,231
- Romantic.
- Yeah.

180
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,231
I know.

181
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:23,012
- Chuck.
- Morgan.

182
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:26,309
- You were so right. This place is magical.
- I knew it. I knew it.

183
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:29,511
Listen, you can do this.
I put the ring in the right pocket...

184
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:32,691
earpiece in the left pocket,
and then mints in both pockets.

185
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:35,088
And also, listen,
I will be here at base...

186
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:38,492
quarterbacking the whole way.
So you are good to go, bro.

187
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:41,428
- This is crazy.
- But you're still gonna do it, right?

188
00:12:44,503 --> 00:12:46,994
Look sharp.
This nanochip isn't gonna find itself.

189
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:51,131
I wanna be out of this French hellhole and
back stateside for lunch tomorrow, hmm.

190
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:54,810
All these fancy frogs.

191
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:58,444
Forget it. I'm not gonna be able to do
anything with Casey being...

192
00:12:58,617 --> 00:12:59,948
well, Casey.

193
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:03,816
Chuck, bubbeleh, come on,
Casey is your manservant.

194
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:06,253
Let him man-serve you.

195
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:10,785
You there. Jonathan.

196
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:16,826
Have you unpacked
the lady's luggage, yet?

197
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:20,298
- Call me Jonathan, I'll break your leg.
- Cover.

198
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:22,372
Remember your cover.

199
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,135
You are supposed to be searching
underground...

200
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:29,771
while Sarah and I search above ground
with all the wine and cheese.

201
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:35,480
Oh, one more thing, Jon-Jon...

202
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:38,054
could you put my slippers out
for tonight?

203
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:41,386
That'd be very helpful. Thanks so much.
Off you go. Chop-chop.

204
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:43,527
Heh.

205
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,864
What was it we were do...?
Oh, yes, this is where we were.

206
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:57,739
We should be looking
for the nanochip, huh?

207
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,002
Yes. Yes, we should.

208
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:03,172
Not getting a signal here.
Search upstairs?

209
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:05,214
Shall we?

210
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:14,047
- Still no signal.
- Where is this thing?

211
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,288
Wow!

212
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:20,530
Chuck, look at where we are.
It's beautiful.

213
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:26,564
We're gonna have
a sub-mission location confirmation.

214
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:28,730
- Western-facing balcony. I'm in.
- Yes.

215
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:32,570
I knew you could handle a mission
with a sub-mission. All right, let's go.

216
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:46,715
Bartowski.
Good call on sending me down to the cellar.

217
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:48,883
I got a signal on the nanochip.

218
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,670
- Hold up, hold up.
- Is everything okay, Casey?

219
00:15:01,507 --> 00:15:04,999
Pierre's down here. Looks like
he's using the party as a cover as well.

220
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:08,311
Sir.

221
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:10,815
I found this beneath the racks.

222
00:15:11,316 --> 00:15:12,943
Blood.

223
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,516
Excellent year.

224
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:22,751
It's an '86 Chateau Le Franc.

225
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:25,192
Must have injected it
into one of these bottles.

226
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:27,092
Find every bottle of that vintage.

227
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:30,895
The nanochip is in a bottle
of '86 Chateau Le Franc.

228
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:39,600
Signal is weaker. Bottle's on the move.

229
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:41,405
Okay, Casey. We're on our way.

230
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:47,783
Someone is here.

231
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:50,717
No one leaves this room alive.

232
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,881
- You told Casey to go to the cellar?
- Yeah, yeah.

233
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,713
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm picking up a signal.

234
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:13,384
- I think the bottle's outside.
- Okay. You get the wine, I'll get Casey.

235
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,848
How's it going, buddy?
What is the sub-mission status?

236
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:21,982
On hold, buddy. I'm busy chasing
a priceless '86 Chateau Le Franc.

237
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:35,736
Oh, Morgan, flag on the play. I've lost it.

238
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:39,138
- I've lost the bottle.
- Right. Right.

239
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:44,141
Chuck, the '86 Chateau Le Franc
is a peppery Pinot...

240
00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:47,479
- stable on the label, stork on the cork.
- Copy that.

241
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:50,520
Wha...? What?
It was a peppery Pinot, right?

242
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:53,089
With cork on the stork
and label on the stable?

243
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:56,160
No. It's a stable on the label
and a cork on the stork.

244
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:58,387
Dude, it's... No, it's not.
What did you say?

245
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:13,108
Casey, I'm outside the cellar door.

246
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,715
This place
is crawling with French bad guys.

247
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:37,732
Oh, it's so bright.

248
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:43,906
Hello? Anyone here?

249
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:47,974
Oh, God. I'm... Heh, oh, God.

250
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:50,638
I'm so sorry, I've, um...

251
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:55,116
I'm just a little bit lost.
I've had just a bit too much wine.

252
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,948
I'm so embarrassed. I just... I...

253
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:58,954
I broke my heel and my...

254
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,061
My ankle,
it just kind of really hurts right now.

255
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:15,137
I can't stand this country.

256
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:29,379
A stable on the label
and a stork on the cork.

257
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:30,579
Oh.

258
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:33,249
Gotcha.

259
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:42,460
It's a fine vintage, isn't it?
It's peppery.

260
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:45,201
Well-structured for aging.
Lots of tannins.

261
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:47,566
Chuck, Casey's okay.
Do you have the bottle?

262
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,176
Uh, the nanochip has been poured
into somebody's glass.

263
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:53,106
Find the right glass. I'm on my way.

264
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,713
Fine. I'm all over it.
Meet you on the balcony.

265
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:58,982
Looks like Pierre is MIA.

266
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:01,375
Come on.

267
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:12,463
Sir. Hi. Sir, hi.

268
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,030
Excuse me. Um...

269
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,828
I'm sorry,
but there's been a mixup downstairs.

270
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:20,699
You received the wrong glass of wine.
That's the burgundy from Bordeaux...

271
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:23,899
with the coil on the foil
and fork on the cork.

272
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,202
Does not make sense,
they are both regions.

273
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:29,176
This is the peppery Pinot...

274
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:32,715
with the stable on the label
and the stork on the cork.

275
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:37,913
In fact, I have been waiting to taste
this exact bottle...

276
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:41,149
for two decades.

277
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:43,719
Don't...

278
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,192
I didn't wanna have to tell you this,
but there is something in your wine.

279
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:53,099
Yes, there is something in the wine.

280
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:56,241
Two hundred years of French history.

281
00:19:56,408 --> 00:20:02,108
The blood and sweat of my ancestors.
The pride of lords and peasants alike.

282
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:06,615
You, sir, wouldn't know the difference
between this...

283
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:09,948
- ...and a glass of Two Buck Chuck.
- First of all...

284
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:13,224
I happen to like Two Buck Chuck.
Great bang for your buck.

285
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:16,725
Second of all, you are danger-close
to becoming a walking cliché, sir.

286
00:20:16,895 --> 00:20:19,523
Goodbye. My pinot.

287
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,568
Stop. Give me the glass of wine.

288
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,080
You mean this glass of wine?

289
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:10,741
What's happening? Talk to me.

290
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,440
I've got the nanochip.

291
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:15,342
- Sub-mission on?
- The sub-mission is so on.

292
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:20,925
Yes. Fantastic.
FYI, sunset is in three minutes, okay?

293
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:23,459
And everyone looks good at golden hour.
Everyone.

294
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,497
- Where's Casey?
- Getting the car. Nanochip?

295
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:34,537
One peppery Pinot
with a hint of nanochip in the finish.

296
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:37,638
Good work, Chuck.

297
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:41,806
Look at that.

298
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:44,282
Just in time for sunset.

299
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:51,948
It's amazing, isn't it?

300
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:54,817
It's perfect.

301
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:57,685
Good.

302
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:02,762
There's, uh...
There's something I've wanted to...

303
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:08,162
- What the...?
- Chuck, Sarah. Move it.

304
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,069
That's our ride. Let's go.

305
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,938
Huh?

306
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,192
General Beckman?

307
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,665
I have decided to debrief the team
in person.

308
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:43,574
The CIA has analyzed the nanochip.
The secret locations and blueprints...

309
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:47,303
of our European black sites
are now safe.

310
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:50,676
But your mission isn't over.
You're going back to France.

311
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:53,745
- Not again.
- Not you, colonel.

312
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,479
A couple in love
are more believable turncoats.

313
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:58,088
Agents Walker, Bartowski...

314
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,157
using back channels,
we have contacted Pierre Melville.

315
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:05,228
He now believes you're rogue CIA agents
who want to sell the chip back to him.

316
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:08,264
Pierre believes we're traitors.
But how does that help us?

317
00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:11,494
- You're gonna sell him a different chip.
- Spot on, colonel.

318
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:17,435
The chip suspended in this liquid
is a long-range tracking beacon.

319
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:20,601
Return to the chateau,
swap cases with Pierre...

320
00:23:20,813 --> 00:23:25,409
then our Paris office will track him
and root out the entire terrorist cell.

321
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:27,842
- Is that clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

322
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,045
Good, because you leave tonight.

323
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:33,723
Agent Walker, a word.

324
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:42,398
I want you to be the one
to make this drop.

325
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:45,969
This operation is highly sensitive.
It must go smoothly.

326
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:47,400
Of course, general.

327
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,032
Dismissed.

328
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:55,880
Stick to the plan.
Jinsana should be here any minute.

329
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:08,551
Damn.

330
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:13,861
Lester Patel, you lucky little Canadian.

331
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:25,269
Oh, my God. She's a 12.

332
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:28,413
It's the stuff of legend.
A flawless Hinjew specimen.

333
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:31,910
I want her as my own.
Change of plans. Marriage is on.

334
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:36,885
Stop Big Mike then stall her.
I got three fat girls to break up with.

335
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:42,487
You must be Jinsana.

336
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:45,895
Yes, I am.
Do you know where Lester Patel is?

337
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:49,023
Uh, look, Jinsana.
I know you've traveled a long way...

338
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:51,795
but I'm supposed to give you
some bad news.

339
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:57,374
Uh, hi. Mr. Patel
needs to, uh, reschedule.

340
00:24:57,543 --> 00:25:00,671
His calendar has him free in, uh...

341
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:02,510
half-hour?

342
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:07,616
Okay. Guess I'll come back.

343
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:08,878
Let me...

344
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:11,215
Come on, Chuck, it's okay.

345
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:14,017
It was so perfect. Everything.
The sunset, the balcony.

346
00:25:14,192 --> 00:25:16,660
You cannot beat yourself up.
You were on a mission.

347
00:25:16,828 --> 00:25:20,525
There were distractions, things out
of your control. Let's move past that.

348
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:23,793
What is the only thing better
than a sunset?

349
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:27,137
- Things going right for a change?
- No, no.

350
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:28,796
Moonlight, okay?

351
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:31,534
Don't give up on me.
You know the perfect spot now.

352
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,544
You're going back to the chateau
with Sarah. Come on, this is fate.

353
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:38,205
The proposal is gonna work, dude.

354
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:41,011
It's lovely to see you again, Jinsana.

355
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:45,452
Mr. Lester Indira Golda Patel awaits.

356
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:50,484
Thank you.

357
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:52,527
This way, please.

358
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:56,023
Welcome to my domain.

359
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:58,860
Jinsana Gupta, please come, sit.

360
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:00,698
Sit.

361
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:04,837
- Look, Lester, I'm just a normal...
- Shh.

362
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,068
I accept you.

363
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:12,182
It is written. Jeffrey, please.

364
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:14,842
With the poutine
and the Manischewitz.

365
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:21,853
Lester, you're obviously
much more traditional than I am.

366
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:25,190
And the truth is,
this is freaking me out a little bit.

367
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:28,390
Just, please, Jinsana.
Just look, I, ugh...

368
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:31,367
I am not traditional at all, actua...

369
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:36,864
Look, this isn't the real me.

370
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:40,910
All right? Please just give me a chance
to show you who the real Lester Patel is.

371
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,775
I promise, I make a fantastic...

372
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:50,644
third impression.

373
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,221
So this wasn't really you?

374
00:26:57,396 --> 00:27:00,763
No, no. I was trying to impress you.

375
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,601
Aw, that's kind of cute.

376
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:09,439
- Okay. We can give it another shot.
- So it is written.

377
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:12,941
Ha, ha, no, no, it's not written, Jeffrey.
Not written.

378
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:15,577
Maybe we pencil it in.

379
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:25,680
- Hi, Morgan.
- Oh, Sarah, mental.

380
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:27,347
We need to have a conversation.

381
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,325
You just scared me to death. I thought
you could've been somebody deadly.

382
00:27:31,496 --> 00:27:32,554
- I am somebody deadly.
- Hmm.

383
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:33,755
And I know everything.

384
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:36,958
The balcony, the moonlight.
Does that ring a bell?

385
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:39,763
These bearded lips are staying shut.
I know nothing.

386
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:43,430
Chuck is planning on proposing
at the chateau and I want your intel.

387
00:27:46,978 --> 00:27:49,606
Okay. Don't you wanna be surprised?

388
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:51,442
I'm a spy. I hate surprises.

389
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:53,982
Okay. Chuck told me
about your parents' proposal.

390
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:55,619
It'll be better than that.

391
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:58,517
Oh, God. I should never have told him
that stupid story.

392
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,021
Probably not. Probably not.

393
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:03,457
But you did and it's the reason
we called off our restaurant proposal.

394
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:05,721
What? Wait.

395
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:08,661
Chuck was planning on proposing
at the restaurant?

396
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:11,302
What is wrong with me?
I cannot keep my mouth shut.

397
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,836
No. No, it's good.
It's good that you told me.

398
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:17,507
Look, Sarah, the whole reason
Chuck is doing this proposal...

399
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:21,009
is to wipe the slate clean, all right?
It's all for you.

400
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,010
And it's gonna be amazing
and romantic.

401
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:25,411
- It's gonna be everything that you want.
- Okay.

402
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:30,312
I am taking control
of this operation now.

403
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:33,322
Morgan, you will now be working
for me.

404
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:37,921
Okay. Kind of like a, uh...
Like a double agent.

405
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:42,032
Exactly. We're gonna make
this proposal happen for Chuck's sake.

406
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:44,628
- Yeah.
- And for mine.

407
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:00,808
We got a couple of French terrorists...

408
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:03,181
a briefcase full of cash,
and a nanochip...

409
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:06,586
so no more terrifying than usual.

410
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:10,250
Although, if we get done early,
we take a stroll around the chateau.

411
00:29:10,662 --> 00:29:13,028
That does sound lovely, Chuck.

412
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:15,996
But, ugh, listen, I have this weird feeling
about this mission.

413
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:20,036
I don't know, I just can't shake it.
Something feels off.

414
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:26,443
Sarah, it's
Morgan. We're totally on a secure line.

415
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:32,547
Okay, listen, up, the proposal is a go
on the western balcony.

416
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:36,915
All right, lunar calculations are complete.
We are banking on a full moon proposal.

417
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,420
That is a full moon proposal.

418
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:41,889
Copy that.
Now listen, if anything goes wrong...

419
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,119
you are to tell me about it
immediately.

420
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:46,423
Of course. I am on it.
You can count on me.

421
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:48,966
- Morgan.
- Oh, hold on a second.

422
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:52,592
I have to scram
because, uh, Chuck is on two.

423
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:56,465
Hey, Chuck, how's the man?
How's the myth? How is the view?

424
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:59,940
Does Sarah seem jumpy to you?
I mean, do you think she's on to us?

425
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:03,410
What? No. No. Sarah? Onto us?
Come on, buddy, get real.

426
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:05,573
Keep your head in the game, though.
Focus.

427
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,877
If I can give you one piece
of fatherly advice, I'd...

428
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:10,721
You futzing with the ring box?

429
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:15,825
- No.
- I can hear you futzing with the ring box.

430
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:18,427
Keep futzing with the ring,
you tarnish the sheen.

431
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:20,656
Are you nervous? You get all sweaty.

432
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:23,892
Relax, okay? Okay? Buddy, I got it. I...

433
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:26,469
Yeah. I gotta go, I gotta go.
We got company.

434
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:32,541
Please go smoothly.
Please go smoothly.

435
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:35,106
It rains in Paris, ma cherie.

436
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,475
But only in the spring.

437
00:30:45,657 --> 00:30:47,090
It's done. That was easy.

438
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:49,659
We're done? Seriously?
Great. Good, we're done.

439
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:51,455
Bravo. Excellent work. Fantastic.

440
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,363
Um, meet me at our balcony
and we'll celebrate with a glass of wine.

441
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,464
I'll meet you there.

442
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:09,437
It's time to come clean.

443
00:31:09,614 --> 00:31:12,276
This girl is about to meet
the real Lester.

444
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,213
And Jeff.

445
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:17,150
Let's just keep the focus on me,
okay, buddy?

446
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:22,588
Hey, Jinsana, listen.

447
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:26,897
I am sorry that I pretended to be
somebody that I'm not.

448
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:30,197
So behold the real Lester Patel.

449
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:34,634
Uncut, unabridged, in living color.

450
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:37,798
- Should we go get a drink or something?
- Something.

451
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,034
Jeffrey, hit it.

452
00:31:47,152 --> 00:31:49,620
Hey, Patel, what are you doing?

453
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:53,849
This one's for the lady.

454
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:57,554
I find I spend my time

455
00:31:57,729 --> 00:31:59,720
Waiting on your call

456
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:05,235
How can I tell you, baby
My back's against the wall...

457
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:08,763
Shake out the butterflies.

458
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,534
Shake them out, shake them out,
shake them out.

459
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,734
Sarah...

460
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:17,003
Is this love

461
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:20,242
I know that you have some issues
with proposals.

462
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:22,850
Is this the love

463
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:27,014
What am I talking about? I can't...
I can't mention her parents.

464
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:30,457
Don't talk about the parents.
Clean slate. Here we go, start over.

465
00:32:31,196 --> 00:32:32,993
This must be love

466
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:35,530
Do a knee thing?
Probably have to do a knee thing.

467
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,565
- Which knee...?
- Chuck, how's it going?

468
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:40,227
The mission went great.
They never go this smoothly.

469
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:41,531
It's got to be a sign.

470
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:43,965
God, Chuck.

471
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:53,209
Did you think I would let you two
walk away with my money?

472
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:12,630
Holy... Who was that guy?

473
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:14,829
- Dude, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

474
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:18,908
Yeah, buddy, I'm fine.
I got my jacket a little dirty, though.

475
00:33:19,077 --> 00:33:22,308
Right. Tide to Go sticks,
left jacket pocket.

476
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,011
Morgan, you are genius.

477
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,652
All right, you hide
the bad guys, I'll check in on Sarah.

478
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:37,951
Is this the love
That I've been searching for

479
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:53,442
- Lester, that was...
- Shh.

480
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:57,880
I know, baby. I know.

481
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,882
- The most uncomfortable five minutes
of my life.

482
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:06,387
But wait, wait, wait.
I wanna get married.

483
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:09,259
Try the Internet.

484
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,461
- Is that the chateau security feed?
- Maybe.

485
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,661
Well, in case you hadn't heard,
the mission is over.

486
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,034
They made the exchange.

487
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:28,036
Wait a minute.
Are you conducting a sub-mission?

488
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:32,582
He's gonna pop the question
to Walker, isn't he?

489
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:35,818
- How'd you know that?
- Because I'm a spy, not a moron.

490
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:38,854
But you're right,
he's gonna need all the help he can get.

491
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:51,099
Sarah, you just stopped.
What's the matter?

492
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:52,360
I don't know.

493
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:56,537
I think,
for the first time in my life, I'm...

494
00:34:57,208 --> 00:35:01,076
nervous.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

495
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:03,578
You got butterflies.
She has butterflies.

496
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:07,013
That's completely natural, it's...
Everybody gets butterflies.

497
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:09,915
- I don't get butterflies.
- That's not what I'm saying.

498
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:13,615
What I'm saying is that's
Chuck Bartowski out on that balcony.

499
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:17,192
You know, he is the best friend
that I've ever had.

500
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:19,358
No offense.

501
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:23,059
I know you aren't,
uh, asking and maybe it's a little silly...

502
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:26,203
but, uh, you have my permission
to marry him.

503
00:35:26,538 --> 00:35:28,267
He's all yours, so...

504
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,932
Take care of him.

505
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,434
Thank you, Morgan.

506
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:39,276
Uh-oh.

507
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,748
- We have a problem.
- No. Sarah just has butter...

508
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,855
Look, moron. Look. The ring.

509
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:48,350
Walker, check your 6, by your feet.

510
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,423
Bartowski dropped the ring.

511
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:56,065
Oh, my God. Pick it up, pick it up.

512
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:58,432
Look at the moon, Chuck.

513
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:10,073
It's perfect.

514
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:33,396
I've been to so many places
around the world...

515
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:37,997
but never been to a place
as beautiful as this.

516
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,904
I have.

517
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:43,604
Every day.

518
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:47,810
Every morning I wake up
and I look at you.

519
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:52,514
When we brush our teeth,
tandem style.

520
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:56,987
When we watch TV together.
Whatever, anything, always...

521
00:36:57,161 --> 00:36:59,288
every time I look at you...

522
00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:02,024
it's the most beautiful place
I've ever been.

523
00:37:05,303 --> 00:37:08,136
I just... I feel I should be James Bond
right now, you know?

524
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:11,503
The guy who is standing on this balcony
with you in this moment...

525
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:14,577
I didn't fall in love with James Bond.
I fell in love with you.

526
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:16,873
- Here we go. Yup, yup.
- She is good.

527
00:37:24,956 --> 00:37:26,947
Sarah, I'm...

528
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:31,224
I'm gonna ask you a question right now,
so please don't freak out, okay?

529
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:32,488
I won't.

530
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:36,060
I wanna spend the rest of my life
with you.

531
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:39,428
Going on missions
and saving the day and being heroes.

532
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:42,732
But mostly, though,
I just wanna be with you.

533
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,369
At your side, always.

534
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:55,844
Sarah...

535
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:58,480
will you...?

536
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:03,024
Freeze. Don't move. CIA.

537
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:05,924
Whoa, whoa, what's going on here?

538
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:08,395
- We're on a mission. Stop. No.
- It's legit.

539
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:10,466
Agent Sarah Walker, you're under arrest.

540
00:38:10,635 --> 00:38:12,296
- For what?
- Treason.

541
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:15,734
- What?
- What? No. No.

542
00:38:15,907 --> 00:38:17,033
- No, hey, hey.
- Chuck.

543
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:19,301
- Wait.
- Stop. This is all wrong.

544
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,772
Chuck?

545
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,948
How could anyone possibly think
that Sarah is a traitor?

546
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:34,887
I mean, look at this stuff.
Look at this stuff, Casey.

547
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:37,220
She was making the drop
That was our mission.

548
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:39,693
Sit down, Bartowski.
You're making me dizzy.

549
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:48,132
I was gonna propose to her, Casey.

550
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:57,413
You know, I proposed once.

551
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:05,613
To Kathleen.

552
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:10,789
We had plans to go to Niagara Falls.
I was about to ship out.

553
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,497
We were young, and I was stupid,
and things got screwed up.

554
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:19,158
So I ended up proposing
in a Buffalo bus station.

555
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:22,996
Not exactly the most romantic spot
in the world.

556
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:28,769
But I'll always have that day.
I'll always have that look on her face.

557
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:32,313
There's no such thing
as a perfect moment...

558
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:34,781
or a perfect spot.

559
00:39:35,686 --> 00:39:38,746
So forget about the balcony,
Bartowski.

560
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:41,489
All you need is the girl.

561
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,904
General, please, please, please.

562
00:39:57,542 --> 00:40:01,444
Go ahead, Chuck.
You two have some things to discuss.

563
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:15,485
I don't need a balcony, a sunset.
We have each other...

564
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,151
and that's all that matters.
- Chuck, I'm leaving.

565
00:40:23,734 --> 00:40:25,224
What?

566
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,695
What? Where are they taking you?

567
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:31,338
They're not taking me, Chuck.
I'm going.

568
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:35,812
Beckman never thought
that I was a traitor. It was a setup.

569
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:42,078
The perfect opportunity to establish
my cover as a double agent.

570
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:47,681
Chuck, we have so much together.

571
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:51,919
We have a real life and a future.

572
00:40:52,096 --> 00:40:54,656
But I need to go back to being
the old me...

573
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:56,766
just for a little while longer...

574
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:58,868
if I plan on surviving this.

575
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:01,061
Surviving what?
Where are you going?

576
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:04,103
I'm going undercover
into Volkoff Industries.

577
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:06,209
- Take them down from the inside.
- No.

578
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:09,244
No. No, you're not.
That's exactly how I lost my mom.

579
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:12,439
That's how you're gonna get her back.
I'm doing this for you.

580
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:14,175
I'm doing it for us.

581
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:17,850
- Why does it have to be you?
- Chuck, you have to trust me.

582
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:20,786
For Beckman's plan to work,
it has to be me.

583
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:22,084
I'm sorry.

584
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:26,259
Agent Walker, it's time.

585
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:32,728
I love you.

586
00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:35,236
I love you too, Chuck.

587
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:37,767
I'm not gonna come back
without your mom.
