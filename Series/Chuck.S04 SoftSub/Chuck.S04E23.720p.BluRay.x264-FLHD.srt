1
00:00:02,789 --> 00:00:04,491
Here are a few things
you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,492 --> 00:00:06,653
That Intersect project
Dad was working on?

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,702
- I've been trying to figure it out.
- It's in my head.

4
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:11,619
From what I can piece together...

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,419
Dad used this program
to input a new identity into an operative.

6
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:18,153
But once he went undercover,
the program took over.

7
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:19,796
He became his cover identity.

8
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:23,526
- Agent X is Alexei Volkoff?
- I have a company to run. I need leverage.

9
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:27,160
The Norseman's the most dangerous
weapon. Rebuild the device quickly.

10
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,899
That way no one can touch me. Ever.

11
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:45,371
Right this way, Miss Volkoff. M

12
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:48,107
Sorry it's taken so long
to reassemble the Norseman...

13
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:51,275
but we've finally done it.
- I should hope so.

14
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:53,318
Miss Volkoff's patience has worn thin.

15
00:00:53,522 --> 00:00:58,016
Whoever has been trying to sabotage
the operation won't find their way here.

16
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:11,300
Let me, Vivian.

17
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:19,942
If I may ask,
who's the first subject going to be?

18
00:01:27,756 --> 00:01:29,951
God, that noise!

19
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:35,288
Amazing.

20
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:38,126
It located the correct DNA. It works.

21
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,461
You really should do
some of this dirty work.

22
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:43,799
You know, the head of Volkoff Industries
needs a public face...

23
00:01:43,972 --> 00:01:46,600
that spreads fear and respect.

24
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:50,643
Thank you.
I appreciate your guidance.

25
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,205
Of course, dear.

26
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,474
After you.

27
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,893
I think the proper word
right now would be "freeze."

28
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:09,791
- Hello, Riley.
- Vivian...

29
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:13,799
meet the woman
who betrayed your father for 20 years.

30
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:16,798
Frost, welcome back.

31
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:28,415
Good morning.

32
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:32,318
You know what we have to do today?

33
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:33,749
Mm.

34
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:36,083
- Hunt someone?
- No.

35
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:38,749
- Blow something up?
- No again.

36
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:44,528
Mm, crawl through sewers or rat holes...

37
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,760
or underground lairs
filled with sewage and/or rats?

38
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,269
No, no and no.

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,899
Today we have a day off
from the CIA.

40
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,905
Today is about you and me
and our wedding.

41
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,343
God, that's good.

42
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:18,265
No. That's totally understandable.
I mean, you know, coups take time.

43
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:22,733
Anyway, uh, Awesome and Morgan
and Ellie have basically taken over...

44
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:25,395
every chore we have.
- Your family is so sweet.

45
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:28,873
Bending over backwards to protect us
from anything that's stressful.

46
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:30,272
I know.

47
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:32,436
There is one little thing I have to do...

48
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:36,141
that you don't get to know about
because I am adorable.

49
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:38,047
Heh, heh. Yes, you are.

50
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,450
Everything is perfect.
Nothing can go wrong.

51
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,957
Oh, Sarah, you didn't.

52
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:47,088
- Chuck!
- Why...?

53
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:49,560
Why would you say that?
Do you not watch movies?

54
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,928
- Well, I finally watched Mannequin.
- Oh, yeah? Did you like it?

55
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:54,728
Not good. Little help.

56
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:58,202
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Honey, get him down.

57
00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,635
- I got him.
- Yo!

58
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:02,242
Okay, bud. All right, just go limp.

59
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:05,778
- Fall into my arms.
- "Go limp." You go limp. Chuck!

60
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:10,076
Morning. Everything's fine here.
Nothing to worry about.

61
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:11,810
Chuck, do something.

62
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:14,421
All right, everybody calm down.
I got this.

63
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:19,050
Ooh.

64
00:04:26,802 --> 00:04:28,963
Here we go. Here we go.

65
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:31,028
- You all right?
- Yeah, all good.

66
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:33,037
- Face is a little flush.
- Well, it's...

67
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,640
Coming down.

68
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:40,474
- Awesome.
- Impressive, isn't it?

69
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,713
- You don't do any core work?
- Just sitting up to reach the remote.

70
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:46,114
- Bitching, dude.
- Right?

71
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,689
Chuck, Sarah, that was great,
but, seriously, back inside.

72
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:53,294
I don't want you doing any work today.
Go do something romantic, okay?

73
00:04:53,462 --> 00:04:56,397
Right. Romantic, got it. Thank you.

74
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,524
- Morgan?
- Yes, ma'am?

75
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:01,692
We have more twinkle lights, don't we?

76
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,065
- Yes, ma'am.
- This place has to be magical.

77
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:06,832
- Yes, ma'am.
- Magical, Morgan.

78
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,669
Yes, ma'am.

79
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:10,071
Honey, you're scaring me.

80
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:12,703
Just keep it moving.

81
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:16,813
I hear you.
I'll take care of it, I promise.

82
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,145
Thank you, Dad.

83
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:22,219
Guys, I'm sorry.
But I need a little help here.

84
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:25,360
I just told Ellie
that I have all these extra twinkle lights.

85
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:28,690
I don't have actual twinkle lights
and she could yell at me.

86
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:31,332
Do you want me to just go out
and get some for you?

87
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,899
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

88
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,400
You're the best. You are wonderful.
Come here.

89
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,006
And did I tell you how very excited I am
to have you...

90
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:41,039
as my hot date
to Chuck's wedding?

91
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,200
I was figuring
I'd be taking my mother.

92
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:46,814
Well, your mom is gonna have to get
her own date because you are mine.

93
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:48,506
Oh.

94
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:52,210
Well, I don't mind, I just...
Breakfast of champions, right?

95
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,520
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no," what?

96
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:01,753
What, what, what?
Do we have a mission? Today?

97
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:05,128
- I have a mission.
- Oh.

98
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,666
I'll tell Ellie she's gonna have
to do without us.

99
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:09,394
Not you.

100
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:13,739
What's that about?

101
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,613
No. No, Casey. No way.
We have the week off.

102
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:28,483
You better be here to talk mimosas
or wedding.

103
00:06:28,657 --> 00:06:30,056
I am.

104
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:33,361
- Your mom might not be able to make it.
- Why? What happened?

105
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:36,387
She's been taken by Vivian Volkoff.

106
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:46,516
Chuck 4x23 - Versus the Last Details

107
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:21,116
I don't understand any of
your mom's reports.

108
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:23,660
Why was she working on Volkoff?
That was our case.

109
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:27,026
She must be taking Vivian off our plate
so we focus on the wedding.

110
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,360
Look how she went in.
No backup, contingency.

111
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,696
- Have you spoken?
- Haven't gotten a chance...

112
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:34,772
to ask her about Dad and Agent X,
if she knew about it.

113
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:35,999
Where is she, Sarah?

114
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:38,332
This is her last communiqué.

115
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:52,451
A mine in Colombia.
A lot of bad-guy traffic there.

116
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,957
Good, so we start there.
It's a quick flight.

117
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,561
We'll have your mom back
for the rehearsal dinner.

118
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:00,529
I need my best man.

119
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,168
You need your best man.
Let's go get your mom.

120
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:04,530
Time to save the day.

121
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:08,697
No. Morgan, Morgan. Uh, I actually...
I need you to save the day...

122
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:13,868
in a different way by creating
a very romantic video montage...

123
00:08:14,046 --> 00:08:15,911
of me and Sarah
for our rehearsal dinner.

124
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:17,208
Oh. Ha, ha.

125
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:20,875
Not quite as Superman as I'd like,
but, uh, of course, anything you need.

126
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:22,179
Thank you so much.

127
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:25,916
Sarah doesn't have any old pictures.

128
00:08:26,092 --> 00:08:29,687
Maybe Photoshop her into some
of the different places that she's lived.

129
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:34,196
- Something kind of cute.
- Totally cute, okay. I get it. I'm on it.

130
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:37,268
- Done. I'm on it. Of course.
- Thanks, buddy. My best man.

131
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:39,700
- Means a lot to me. All right.
- Yeah. I know.

132
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:43,035
- Best man. You are the best man.
- Come on. I am, aren't I?

133
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:44,938
Jeffrey, our time has come.

134
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:53,247
Need some footage of Sarah, do you?

135
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,547
Why? You don't have any, do you?

136
00:08:56,722 --> 00:09:01,887
We have over 1250 hours
of Sarah-related footage.

137
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:06,361
My clients have been exploring
their options as filmmakers...

138
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:10,764
ever since realizing that Jeffster
may not be as lucrative as expected.

139
00:09:10,936 --> 00:09:14,030
- No way.
- I've had a camera running for years.

140
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:18,074
We have voyeur, we have candid,
we have nip slips of Chuck.

141
00:09:18,244 --> 00:09:20,542
All right, good, great. Listen, all right...

142
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:25,412
Ahem. Cannot express to you the rage
that is actually building up.

143
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:28,075
On the other hand,
I really could use that footage...

144
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:32,782
to complete this present for Chuck.
So, ahem, may I have this footage?

145
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:38,225
Grimes, I am a montage artist.

146
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:44,825
- I am gonna need first and final cut.
- I'm fairly certain it will turn out terrible.

147
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:47,666
- I can hear you.
- But I do need the footage. So...

148
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:51,137
you may have first cut,
he will hand it over to me...

149
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,073
and then I will make it good.

150
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:56,472
Yes.
My clients will attach themselves...

151
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:59,450
under those terms.
- Agreed.

152
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,284
Casey. Good news.

153
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:13,159
Best-man chores are off the plate,
so I am fully avail for the mission.

154
00:10:13,332 --> 00:10:14,594
Let's go save Chuck's mom.

155
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:16,667
Howitzer.

156
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:18,469
All right.

157
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:22,333
I don't know.

158
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:25,944
- I like the ones that make me look big.
- You're not coming.

159
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:28,444
Can't believe how much you worry.
Listen to me.

160
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:30,775
The wedding stuff
is gonna get taken care of.

161
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,144
Ellie is on it.

162
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:33,808
I need to be here for my team.

163
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:36,546
- You're not part of any team.
- How could you say that?

164
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:40,214
I have been doing a ton
of really, like, bigtime stuff lately.

165
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:43,827
You're not coming. So why don't you
just focus on your twinkle lights?

166
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:46,528
Twinkle lights.

167
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,857
Ouch.

168
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:12,050
Oh, God.

169
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:17,056
A lot of chickens and stray dogs,
and not a lot of top-secret holding cells.

170
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:19,490
Where do we even start looking?

171
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:22,895
How many mines have security
like that?

172
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:36,340
Let's find out
what these guards are up to, huh?

173
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:53,722
I hope you boys are hungry.

174
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:56,060
Looks like there's two entrances
to the mine.

175
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:58,567
The miners go in one.

176
00:11:58,737 --> 00:11:59,863
Guards go in the other.

177
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,973
Bet you Volkoff is down in that one.

178
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:05,599
If your mom is still in the area,
she's probably being held down there.

179
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:07,905
What are we waiting for?
Let's do this.

180
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:26,422
- Guards are leaving. We gotta move.
- We can't just waltz in after them.

181
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,999
Look at the traffic.
We might be way outmanned.

182
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:31,966
Why don't we leave the table
before this thing attacks us?

183
00:12:32,137 --> 00:12:33,764
Yeah. Agreed.

184
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:00,523
Move it along, Chewie.

185
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,327
Chewie?
Why are you calling him Chewie?

186
00:13:03,502 --> 00:13:06,596
He didn't even eat anything
off that disgusting platter.

187
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:09,104
Honey, it's a reference to Star...

188
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,334
Oh, I love you.

189
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:18,481
I got a bad feeling about this.

190
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:31,488
Prisoner transfer from Pueblo facility.

191
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:34,592
- Do you have documentation for that?
- It was a verbal.

192
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,497
Which cell is available?
We'll take our man back there.

193
00:13:37,803 --> 00:13:39,896
I don't know how you ran things
in Pueblo...

194
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:43,940
but you're not getting back there
without the proper paperwork.

195
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:50,245
This happens when you draw your plans
from Star Wars. Gotta get bloody.

196
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,941
Just hang on. Hang on a minute.
Hang on.

197
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,284
Uh, excuse me, sir.

198
00:13:55,454 --> 00:13:57,445
Look, I don't mean to bug you...

199
00:13:57,623 --> 00:14:00,649
but look at the cute little number
that came in with me.

200
00:14:00,826 --> 00:14:03,021
Not the large man.
Real pretty one. Blond.

201
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:06,961
Girls like that are pretty few
and far between in Pueblo.

202
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:09,362
Know what I mean?
Two of us have kind of had...

203
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:12,629
this will-they-won't-they
burgeoning office romance going.

204
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:15,672
I'm trying to impress her,
so could you help me out a bit?

205
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:18,268
Beat your man.

206
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:24,047
- Sorry?
- Once, I snapped a guy's neck for a girl.

207
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:25,513
She melted all over me.

208
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:27,843
Is that right? I can kind of see that.

209
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,783
Okay, locking that one away.

210
00:14:31,623 --> 00:14:33,113
Oh, now. Right now.

211
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:37,820
You want me to do that now. Okay.
Now would be the appropriate time.

212
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:47,665
Really?

213
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,205
Do you want to die alone?

214
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:52,936
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:55,680
Okay.

216
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:57,941
I did that. Wasn't that sexy?

217
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,642
So sexy.

218
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:04,053
All right. You two crazy kids
take him back to Cell 24.

219
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:08,990
But I think this girl has already been
to Cell 24.

220
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:12,062
She looks like a dirty one. Heh, heh, heh.

221
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:15,689
Ha, ha. Oh, I get it. Yeah, like Cell 24.
Dirty one.

222
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:20,502
- Ah.
- That's sweet. You defended my honor.

223
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:23,539
We're getting married in a week.
Let's get rid of this body.

224
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:26,075
I'll get rid of it.
You go find your mom.

225
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:29,214
I'll be right there
as soon as I get this guy's pants off.

226
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:33,012
Oh, shut up. Move.

227
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:34,243
Come on, let's go.

228
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:38,222
Looks like your mom's in Cell 13.

229
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:45,058
Okay. Let's go.

230
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,936
Chuck.

231
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:57,932
You're about to get married.
What are you doing here?

232
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,806
Exactly, which is why
we're getting you out of here now.

233
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:03,311
Oh, no, honey, I'm sorry.
I can't leave yet.

234
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:05,613
But you should go.
I can handle myself.

235
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:08,582
No offense, but that's the attitude
that got you captured.

236
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:11,621
Vivian's team has reassembled
the Norseman down here.

237
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:13,414
I can't leave without it.

238
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,617
I'll endure a couple rounds of torture...

239
00:16:15,794 --> 00:16:18,092
then I'll find a way to break out
and get it.

240
00:16:18,263 --> 00:16:20,322
- Uh, no.
- We're not leaving you to get tortured.

241
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:23,296
- We have a wedding to get you to.
- Come on, we gotta move.

242
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:25,130
- Let's go.
- Sweetheart...

243
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:28,899
I know the wedding is important,
but so is the nation's safety.

244
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:32,237
If I leave now, they will move
the weapon and we'll never get it.

245
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:34,675
Don't be stubborn.
We're here to extract you...

246
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:37,543
not finish a failed mission.
- Failed?

247
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,178
- Stubborn?
- Okay, okay.

248
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:41,512
I'm gonna go with Casey
to get the Norseman.

249
00:16:41,687 --> 00:16:43,348
Sarah, you're gonna stay with Mom.

250
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:46,319
- I don't need backup.
- Why can't Casey stay with your mom?

251
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:47,754
No. I'm going with Chuck.

252
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:53,790
Okay, great, that's the plan.
See you soon.

253
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,797
I'll be outside.

254
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:03,604
Interesting choice.
Choosing your mom over your fiancée.

255
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:05,936
Oh, I was just trying
to make everyone feel...

256
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:08,272
Wait a minute.
Is that really how it looked?

257
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:11,974
Yeah. Just remember, Bartowski,
Sarah is the one you sleep next to...

258
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:15,450
at the end of every day.
She's the one you protect.

259
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,217
Where's the Norseman?

260
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:26,897
I don't know why Chuck felt
it was necessary to come and get me.

261
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,159
Chuck wouldn't have felt it necessary
if you had any backup.

262
00:17:31,203 --> 00:17:34,036
Chuck knows
that I can take care of myself.

263
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:36,800
Chuck and the rest
of his family are in harm's way...

264
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:38,909
two days before his wedding.

265
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:45,983
The food here is really ghastly.

266
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,317
Where's the guard?

267
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:54,553
It's been moved. I don't know where.
Vivian is planning a meet to sell it.

268
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:57,889
- Gotta get to that meet.
- Gotta get out before Vivian finds out...

269
00:17:58,063 --> 00:18:01,260
we know about it.
- Let's go before your girls kill each other.

270
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:03,526
You don't have to tell me twice.

271
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,238
Everything is locked down.

272
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:15,145
- Hold your fire. They'll never kill me.
- You don't know that.

273
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,377
No interruptions, guard.

274
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:27,753
Hello again, Frost.

275
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:31,954
Weapon has been moved.

276
00:18:32,164 --> 00:18:35,964
Vivian is selling it. If she turns up,
keep her alive so the meet still happens.

277
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:39,734
- What do you want with me?
- I really just want to see you dead.

278
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:43,465
And I've been waiting
for my young friend here...

279
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:45,905
to be ready to do it.

280
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,444
Vivian, surely this is one trigger
that you'd like to pull yourself.

281
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:55,280
Vivian, I know you won't do this.

282
00:18:56,755 --> 00:18:58,552
Do it, Vivian.

283
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:05,692
Don't.

284
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:08,990
Everybody against the wall right now.
Move.

285
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:10,498
- Sarah?
- Now.

286
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:13,335
I'm sorry, Frost has somewhere to be.

287
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:14,597
Hey.

288
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:19,202
- Mom, it's time to go.
- Mom?

289
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,940
The woman who betrayed my father...

290
00:19:22,114 --> 00:19:24,810
is the mother of the man
who betrayed me? Makes sense.

291
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:27,918
There is so much you don't know
and we need to talk about.

292
00:19:28,086 --> 00:19:30,179
No, I'm done talking to you.

293
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:32,516
The guards could be here any second.
Come on.

294
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:36,127
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

295
00:19:45,137 --> 00:19:48,595
Guards! Guards!

296
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,354
Since we're not on a long plane ride
with my mom now, we should talk...

297
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:06,991
about what happened in the mine.
- Okay. Talk.

298
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,222
So first of all, I know I messed up,
but I was trying to get us out of there.

299
00:20:13,398 --> 00:20:15,662
- The place was crawling with bad guys.
- I know.

300
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,860
But sometimes it feels
like you can protect me from anything...

301
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:21,130
except your mom.
- No, you're right.

302
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,371
You're right, but I can protect you.
Even from my mom, I promise.

303
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:34,850
- Beckman needs us at Castle.
- No need to unpack.

304
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,850
Team, it looks like Vivian Volkoff
is indeed planning...

305
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:41,584
to auction off the Norseman device
in Moscow in 12 hours.

306
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,058
We must strike now. It's up to you.

307
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:47,865
Uh, but can't someone else go?
I mean, our rehearsal dinner is tomorrow.

308
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:51,093
I'm afraid we don't have time
to train a new team.

309
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:52,668
Oh. And thanks for the invite.

310
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:56,701
- Oh. No, um...
- I'm not serious.

311
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,003
Vivian knows all of our faces,
so how are we supposed to get in?

312
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:02,203
Agent Bartowski, if you don't mind.

313
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:06,313
An agent will impersonate
one of the buyers...

314
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:09,045
outbid all of the others
for the Norseman device...

315
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:12,122
and walk out the door. No bloodshed.
- Okay.

316
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,589
Except, like Sarah just said,
Vivian knows all of our faces.

317
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:17,991
I'm not sure
how to avoid the bloodshed.

318
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:22,031
Luckily, one of the buyers Vivian invited
was just detained by Interpol.

319
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,930
Italian arms smuggler Etorre La Barba.

320
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:29,173
- Remind you of anyone we know?
- Morgan?

321
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:33,277
General, Grimes is not prepared
for an operation like this.

322
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:36,312
We don't have time to argue.
He fits the profile.

323
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:39,109
You have your orders.
Good luck, team.

324
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:43,218
Etorre La Barba, huh?

325
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,552
Spaghetti pizza.

326
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:49,756
Mamma mia, it's me, Mario.

327
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:51,828
I sell the arms to the bad guys.

328
00:21:51,997 --> 00:21:53,589
This is a horrible idea.

329
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:58,600
Buddy, are you absolutely sure
that you feel comfortable doing this?

330
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,967
Don't you worry about me, huh?
I take care of everything.

331
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,268
- Whatever you need, bada boom.
- You have to stop that.

332
00:22:05,977 --> 00:22:07,342
Morgan will be fine.

333
00:22:07,846 --> 00:22:10,212
Casey, you and I will provide
plenty of backup.

334
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:15,981
And you two will just stay here
and get ready for the wedding.

335
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:18,987
Stay here? What?
You're taking us off our own mission?

336
00:22:19,157 --> 00:22:21,955
I appreciate you trying to protect us,
Mom, I do.

337
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:25,255
Morgan is my best friend,
and we've been on Vivian for months.

338
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,523
In which time
she's gone from harmless coed...

339
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:29,428
to one of the top weapons dealers.

340
00:22:29,601 --> 00:22:32,661
Which is why I had to step in,
to fix your mistake.

341
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:34,931
Our mistake?

342
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,801
- Uh...
- I don't mean to be critical...

343
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:39,876
but you've been very busy
getting ready for the wedding.

344
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:42,343
- Your minds are elsewhere.
- Like on the fact...

345
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:45,711
that Dad turned an innocent man
into Alexei Volkoff.

346
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:48,045
Mom, did you know about Agent X?

347
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:50,721
Chuck,
I could not afford to let the CIA know...

348
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:52,516
that I knew about Agent X.

349
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:55,216
Neither should you.
Something else we have to clean up.

350
00:22:55,393 --> 00:22:57,224
We don't have time for this right now.

351
00:22:57,395 --> 00:22:59,727
Chuck and I are going.
You're providing backup.

352
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:02,230
- That's the way it's gonna be.
- I don't think so.

353
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,197
I agree with Sarah.

354
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,464
Thank you.

355
00:23:06,905 --> 00:23:08,463
- That is...
- Sorry, sorry, guys.

356
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,734
I need to borrow the big guy.
Best-man stuff just dawned on me.

357
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,468
I have to...

358
00:23:13,778 --> 00:23:16,246
- Thanks. It was getting tense in there.
- No problem.

359
00:23:16,414 --> 00:23:20,908
The errand you gave me to take care of,
I can't get to it now, but not a problem.

360
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:23,577
Got my top people on it,
so not to worry.

361
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:27,019
Couldn't we just watch this at home?
I have things to do.

362
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:30,093
Yeah. I love popcorn and massages
as much as the next guy...

363
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:34,095
but can we just get this started?
- Moviemaking is a collaborative art...

364
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:37,393
even for an auteur.
I have many people I'd like to thank.

365
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:41,335
My rep, Big Mike, Jeffrey,
my parents-ish...

366
00:23:44,876 --> 00:23:46,810
and, uh, my main man upstairs.

367
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:48,537
Anything is possible.

368
00:23:49,848 --> 00:23:52,749
Let's get this puppy started,
shall we, Jeffrey?

369
00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:08,924
Heart.

370
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:10,726
Pancreas.

371
00:24:12,237 --> 00:24:13,329
Cockle.

372
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:15,635
My cockle.

373
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:21,073
- America.
- Stop, stop, stop.

374
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:24,272
- Please, make it stop. Oh, God.
- Dude, that is just unholy.

375
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:25,741
Thank you.

376
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:28,147
I'm gonna need the footage
from your clients.

377
00:24:28,353 --> 00:24:29,820
I'm gonna be taking over.

378
00:24:29,988 --> 00:24:32,980
Wait. Does that mean
Big Mike doesn't get his 10 percent?

379
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:35,149
- We weren't even paying them.
- What?

380
00:24:36,494 --> 00:24:38,826
Then what was I doing all day?

381
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:41,930
How do you guys feel that went?

382
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:51,941
What do you think?
I finally got the accent down.

383
00:24:52,243 --> 00:24:58,182
Don't move
or I will kill you where you stand.

384
00:24:58,383 --> 00:25:02,376
And not even your madre
will recognize your corpse.

385
00:25:03,121 --> 00:25:06,284
If I had my druthers,
you'd stay topside selling microwaves.

386
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:09,621
That's great,
that's great. Let's figure this out.

387
00:25:09,794 --> 00:25:13,594
I thought we were past this. We're
roomies. You've been training me hard.

388
00:25:13,765 --> 00:25:15,426
I've been in danger a ton of times.

389
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,932
You love the Snack Packs I bring
on missions.

390
00:25:18,103 --> 00:25:22,130
So why, suddenly,
are you being this big jerk to me?

391
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:25,306
It's Alex.

392
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:27,536
She's worried about you.

393
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:29,680
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.

394
00:25:29,848 --> 00:25:31,509
Okay, okay.

395
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:35,915
You're telling me you are being a jerk
because you care?

396
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:41,459
Yeah. Fat load of good it's done me too.
I promised Alex I'd keep you safe.

397
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:44,493
There are times on every mission
when things go sideways.

398
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:46,654
That happens, I can't protect you...

399
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:48,992
then I've broken a promise
to my daughter.

400
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,533
- I see your dilemma.
- Yeah.

401
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:56,364
Everything is gonna be fine, trust me.
Nothing will go wrong.

402
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,634
- Why did I just say that?
- Mm.

403
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,378
You know,
you can wait in the van if you want.

404
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:09,645
No, it's all right.

405
00:26:09,821 --> 00:26:12,984
I think I'll give Chuck and Sarah
a little space on this one.

406
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:17,253
It's hard to have kids.
Can't always protect them.

407
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:20,091
Yeah. Or their idiot boyfriends.

408
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:23,492
- We're in position. Is Grimes ready?
- Just a second, Casey.

409
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:26,831
I don't know if I can do this, uh, guys.

410
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:30,065
Been thinking about it. Um,
what do I know about being a bad guy?

411
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:32,766
Plenty, buddy. Plenty.
Look at that suit.

412
00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:35,342
- Part Goldfinger, part Drax.
- You noticed.

413
00:26:35,513 --> 00:26:37,003
You got nothing to worry about.

414
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:39,878
We're gonna be with you the whole time
on the comms.

415
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:41,279
Not to mention the fact...

416
00:26:41,486 --> 00:26:45,047
that we will be monitoring
the video feed through these glasses.

417
00:26:45,223 --> 00:26:48,090
Casey will be on the opposite rooftop
with a sniper rifle.

418
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:50,284
You know he likes to shoot
from far away.

419
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:51,553
I do, yeah. Ha, ha.

420
00:26:52,063 --> 00:26:54,554
You can do this.
You can totally be a bad guy.

421
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:57,395
Okay. Yeah. It's gonna be great.

422
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:43,814
This better not take long.

423
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:46,542
I already tried to kill three people
at this table.

424
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:54,550
Yes.

425
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:56,117
What do you mean?

426
00:27:56,294 --> 00:27:59,593
No, you heard me the first time.
Shoot the puppy.

427
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:01,565
I'm so sick of feeding him.

428
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,267
Kill the puppy.

429
00:28:07,338 --> 00:28:11,069
So hard to get good henchmen
nowadays. Hmm?

430
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,878
Thorium signature detected.

431
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,174
Looks like they're bringing in
the Norseman. Casey?

432
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:28,959
Welcome, gentlemen.
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

433
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:30,856
You're all here for the same reason:

434
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:34,123
A chance to purchase one of
the deadliest weapons ever created.

435
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:36,164
The Norseman device.

436
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:38,128
By locking on to a target's DNA...

437
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:41,238
it can kill a single person
in the middle of a crowd...

438
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,374
with 100-percent accuracy.

439
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:46,101
There's no way to run...

440
00:28:46,277 --> 00:28:50,338
even on the other side of the world.
Whoever ends up with it has an advantage.

441
00:28:50,515 --> 00:28:51,607
But truth is...

442
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:55,947
it's an advantage I intend to keep.

443
00:29:12,904 --> 00:29:16,635
Morgan, you have to die
or they're gonna kill you. Do it.

444
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:19,002
Oh, no!

445
00:29:20,645 --> 00:29:22,010
Morgan...

446
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,273
whatever you do, stay calm.

447
00:29:29,153 --> 00:29:31,485
Don't panic.
We're gonna get you out of this.

448
00:29:31,656 --> 00:29:34,420
- Tell me you got a line on him.
- I got him in my sights.

449
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,753
If it gets hot, I'll take them all out.

450
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,326
Don't feel bad, Vivian.

451
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:41,488
Every man in this room
would have killed you...

452
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:45,261
without a second thought.
That's why we collected their DNA.

453
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,906
This one,
he killed all the families of his rivals.

454
00:29:49,073 --> 00:29:50,199
Sick.

455
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:51,967
This one...

456
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:55,712
he gassed an entire village
of innocents...

457
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,748
just to eliminate one enemy.

458
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:01,044
Sicker.

459
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:03,717
This one right here with the beard...

460
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:06,516
Stop.
These are dangerous men, I get it.

461
00:30:07,191 --> 00:30:11,924
Vivian, I'm not trying to turn you
into someone you're not.

462
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:15,697
I'm trying to turn you
into who you need to be.

463
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:20,360
- You may still get your chance.
- What do you mean?

464
00:30:20,738 --> 00:30:24,504
There is a man in this room
who isn't actually dead.

465
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:28,137
Someone who has infiltrated
our organization...

466
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:31,043
by pretending to be someone
we invited here today.

467
00:30:31,215 --> 00:30:33,274
He's merely feigning death.

468
00:30:33,451 --> 00:30:34,543
Riley left my scope.

469
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:35,811
I do not have Riley.

470
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,920
Morgan, Morgan, don't move.

471
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:42,960
So, friend, are you gonna get up?

472
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:49,033
The name's Carlisle.

473
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:51,091
Sebastian Carlisle.

474
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:54,796
Carl to my friends, which you are not.

475
00:30:54,973 --> 00:30:57,601
I take it you're MI6?

476
00:30:57,775 --> 00:31:00,608
I've been tracking you since Munich.

477
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:03,277
It was actually rather clever.
You see, first...

478
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:10,948
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

479
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:13,181
Next one is yours, promise.

480
00:31:17,128 --> 00:31:21,030
Chuck, Sarah, Norseman is on the move.
You're on it, go.

481
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:23,463
Copy that.
Looks like they're taking it out.

482
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:25,761
I'm gonna help him
secure the weapon.

483
00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:28,098
You stay here
and keep Alex's boyfriend safe.

484
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:30,269
Roger that.

485
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,103
The weapon is leaving the building.
Ready?

486
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:36,838
Yeah. Always wanted to say this:

487
00:31:37,015 --> 00:31:39,142
Fasten your seat belt.

488
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:42,619
- Literally. Fasten your seat belt now.
- Okay, sure.

489
00:31:46,691 --> 00:31:49,285
Guys, I haven't heard anything in a while.

490
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,825
Tell me it's okay to move.

491
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,121
Wait, wait, wait.

492
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:58,359
Okay, okay, go.
Quick. I'll cover you. Move.

493
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,531
Somebody is coming.
Somebody is coming.

494
00:32:16,254 --> 00:32:17,846
Oh, Casey, they got acid.

495
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:20,320
Like in that disgusting scene
from Breaking Bad.

496
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:24,259
- Never seen Breaking Bad.
- What? You'd love it, it's great.

497
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:26,488
- The perfect counterprogramming...
- Shut up.

498
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:28,598
They closed the curtains.
Can't see them.

499
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:31,394
I can't protect you
if I can't see the targets.

500
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,833
- Run.
- Okay.

501
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:39,407
Hey. Just one second.

502
00:32:43,147 --> 00:32:45,638
Your glasses.
Show me the targets with your glasses.

503
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,076
And try not to move.

504
00:33:06,037 --> 00:33:07,902
Morgan?

505
00:33:09,674 --> 00:33:11,198
Morgan, can you hear me?

506
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,911
Morgan, can you hear me?

507
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:18,571
Morgan.

508
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,441
Yeah. Yeah.

509
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:26,486
Oh! Casey, I think you shot me.

510
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,755
What about the rest?

511
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:33,928
Yeah. They're all dead.
Casey, that was amazing.

512
00:33:34,098 --> 00:33:35,395
Oh, Lord, I feel faint.

513
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:39,197
Just breathe. Get to the elevator.

514
00:33:39,504 --> 00:33:43,463
- I'll meet you outside.
- Yeah. Yeah.

515
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,844
Looks like they're leaving the building.

516
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,301
The weapon is in the trunk.

517
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:19,306
I'm gonna get something to open it.

518
00:34:20,545 --> 00:34:21,978
You all right?

519
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:24,679
Don't pretend to care.

520
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:29,879
I'm sorry for everything that's happened,
but there is so much you don't know.

521
00:34:30,288 --> 00:34:32,222
I know enough. I know you're Agent X.

522
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,550
No, Vivian, I'm not.

523
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:36,886
Agent X is your father.

524
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:40,055
He was an MI6 agent.
He was going undercover.

525
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:42,323
He let the CIA perform an experiment
on him.

526
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,062
One that changed him into the man
we know now as Alexei Volkoff.

527
00:34:47,471 --> 00:34:49,996
But before that, he wasn't evil.
And neither are you.

528
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:51,664
This...

529
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,302
This is crazy.

530
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:56,206
Don't move.

531
00:34:56,714 --> 00:34:57,874
Riley, is this true?

532
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:01,347
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

533
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:03,479
But, first...

534
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:08,822
are you gonna tell her who turned
her father into Alexei Volkoff?

535
00:35:08,993 --> 00:35:12,190
It was Stephen J. Bartowski.
Chuck's father.

536
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:15,560
He and Frost manipulated your father
to give up his own identity...

537
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:18,031
so they could further their careers.
- A lie.

538
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:19,863
No, it's the truth.

539
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:23,097
And I will not have you lie
to Vivian anymore.

540
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:24,899
No!

541
00:35:28,412 --> 00:35:29,709
Chuck.

542
00:35:30,581 --> 00:35:31,741
You saved me.

543
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,350
Always.

544
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:37,820
Where's Vivian?

545
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:43,050
- We have to find her.
- No.

546
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:47,326
We should go.
You two have somewhere to be.

547
00:36:01,545 --> 00:36:02,671
What is it?

548
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:05,611
I totally dropped the ball
on Chuck's present to Sarah.

549
00:36:05,783 --> 00:36:08,980
- Fell asleep in the middle of cutting it.
- You did what you could.

550
00:36:09,287 --> 00:36:10,379
It'll be okay.

551
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:13,849
Look. There they are right now.

552
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:17,190
Guys, wow.

553
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:19,420
The courtyard, it looks unbelievable.

554
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:21,861
I can't believe you did all this for us,
Ellie.

555
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:24,058
Thank you so much, sis.

556
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:27,068
I promised myself
that I wasn't gonna cry.

557
00:36:27,238 --> 00:36:28,933
Mascara.

558
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:36,713
- You ready for this?
- Absolutely.

559
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:05,769
Hey.

560
00:37:05,943 --> 00:37:08,776
Man, does Big Mike need
this brandy Alexander.

561
00:37:08,946 --> 00:37:11,642
- Had another deal blow up in my face.
- Oh.

562
00:37:11,816 --> 00:37:14,011
But I do love the game.

563
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:15,982
What happened to your arm?

564
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:17,613
Wii tennis.

565
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:20,586
Son, it's amazing you're not single.

566
00:37:24,795 --> 00:37:27,593
Casey.
How's the Sunshine Band, buddy?

567
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:31,565
Heh, heh. It's K.C. And the Sunshine Band.
No one's ever used that on you, huh?

568
00:37:31,836 --> 00:37:32,962
Really?

569
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:36,334
Seriously, there is one more thing
I wanted to talk about.

570
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,475
I shouldn't be out there in the field.

571
00:37:38,642 --> 00:37:43,807
Not if it's gonna make the woman I love
worry, so you tell Alex I am out.

572
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:46,646
Why don't you stand tall
and tell her yourself?

573
00:37:46,817 --> 00:37:51,015
- No. It's better coming from you.
- No, no. Why don't you tell her yourself?

574
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:54,081
Thank you.

575
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:57,085
I love you.

576
00:37:58,162 --> 00:37:59,891
I love you.

577
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,498
Is he watching? He walked away?

578
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:24,912
Many of you might not know me,
but I'm Chuck's and Ellie's mom.

579
00:38:25,823 --> 00:38:26,881
Truth be told...

580
00:38:27,758 --> 00:38:30,090
I was gone for a long time.

581
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:35,665
Now that I am back in their lives,
I sometimes overcompensate.

582
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:40,232
But lucky for me,
my soon-to-be daughter-in-law...

583
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:42,395
is very forgiving.

584
00:38:43,441 --> 00:38:45,602
She's never heard me say it...

585
00:38:45,776 --> 00:38:48,404
but Sarah is one of the strongest...

586
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:52,208
and one of the most amazing women
that I have ever met.

587
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:57,948
So I would like to propose this toast
to her.

588
00:38:58,155 --> 00:39:01,386
Sarah, thank you for taking care
of my Chuck.

589
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:05,391
May you have
many more adventures together...

590
00:39:05,563 --> 00:39:08,396
and may you always
keep each other safe.

591
00:39:11,702 --> 00:39:13,169
Thank you.

592
00:39:13,804 --> 00:39:15,465
- I love you.
- I love you.

593
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:18,867
Now for the little surprise
I've been cooking up for you.

594
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:26,874
Excuse me. Hi.

595
00:39:28,419 --> 00:39:32,549
Chuck, there's something
I need to tell you about the video. It's...

596
00:39:32,723 --> 00:39:34,953
What about the video?

597
00:39:52,676 --> 00:39:55,110
This is the first day of my life

598
00:39:57,381 --> 00:39:59,315
I swear I was born right in the doorway

599
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:02,509
Lester never let you see my version.

600
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,812
Hope you like it.

601
00:40:03,988 --> 00:40:05,717
- Everything changed

602
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:10,725
They're spreading blankets on the beach

603
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,560
Yours is the first face that I saw

604
00:40:17,735 --> 00:40:20,898
Think I was blind before I met you

605
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:25,175
Now I don't know where I am
I don't know where I've been

606
00:40:25,643 --> 00:40:27,008
What is this garbage?

607
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:29,475
- Where I want to go

608
00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:34,576
And so I thought I'd let you know

609
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:40,847
That these things take forever
I especially am slow

610
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:47,955
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

611
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:04,011
- Hello?
- Hello, Chuck.

612
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:06,649
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

613
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:08,045
Vivian, what do you want?

614
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:12,052
To make you feel pain.
The way I feel right now.

615
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:14,349
I've lost everyone important to me.

616
00:41:14,525 --> 00:41:16,755
And I have you and your family
to thank for it.

617
00:41:16,927 --> 00:41:18,918
Wait, wait, wait.
We can talk about this.

618
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:23,055
Or how about you look around the room
at all your family and friends...

619
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:27,430
and ask yourself
which one am I gonna take from you?

620
00:41:29,974 --> 00:41:32,238
Yous see,
I still have another Norseman device.

621
00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:34,672
Please, please.

622
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:38,781
Vivian, this is not you, okay?
You don't do things like this.

623
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:41,008
Please don't do this.

624
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:42,343
I already have.

625
00:41:45,723 --> 00:41:46,815
What's going on?

626
00:41:47,858 --> 00:41:49,826
I think Vivian is gonna try
and kill my mom.

627
00:41:51,195 --> 00:41:52,423
God, what is that noise?

628
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,467
Sarah?

629
00:42:00,671 --> 00:42:02,468
Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. No, no, no.

630
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,107
No, no, no. Sarah!

631
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,034
Help me!

632
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:08,075
Help me, help me. Somebody help.

633
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:10,713
Call 911. Are you calling 911?

634
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:12,041
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

635
00:42:12,216 --> 00:42:13,740
Oh, my God. Baby, baby, baby.

636
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:17,114
Baby, hey. Baby? Oh, my God.

637
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:18,447
Hey, hey.
