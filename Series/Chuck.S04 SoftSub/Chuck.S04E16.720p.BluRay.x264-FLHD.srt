1
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:53,089
Good.

2
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,243
- Oh, yeah. Rose petals. Nice touch.
- Really? You don't think it's too much?

3
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:09,779
It's me and Alex's first Valentine's Day,
and I don't wanna overdo it.

4
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,308
Nah.

5
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:22,018
- Is that a bearskin rug?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it at Big Lots.

6
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:23,220
Had to buy it in bulk.

7
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:25,228
If you know anyone
who wants a bearskin rug...

8
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,798
I got eight.
- Oh, that's good.

9
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:31,035
Okay, here we go, 8:00 sharp.
So game-plan review.

10
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:34,572
You take the living room
while Sarah and I are in our bedroom.

11
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:39,110
Then at precisely 9:30,
Alex and I will saunter off to our room...

12
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:42,248
leaving you and Sarah ample time
to watch Love Actually.

13
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,044
Ah, yes, a hit with ladies
around the world.

14
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:47,644
- And men.
- Hmm.

15
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:51,382
Don't worry about your soufflés.
I will make sure they rise to perfection.

16
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:54,554
- Alex. Okay.
- Good luck.

17
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:56,889
You too. Okay.
Oh, wait. Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

18
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:58,429
Just one more thing.

19
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:01,766
It's Valentine's Day.
We both have girlfriends.

20
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:04,130
- I know.
- Ha, ha.

21
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:05,896
- Okay, go.
- Okay, okay, go.

22
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:08,400
We did it.

23
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:11,544
Thank God. I haven't slept in three days.

24
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:15,910
You know what else we haven't done
in three days, or three months?

25
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,415
Are you saying it's time
for Mommy and Daddy...

26
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:20,348
to celebrate Valentine's?

27
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,182
Can we not call ourselves
Mommy and Daddy in the bedroom?

28
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:26,849
- How about "Who's your daddy?"
- Still no.

29
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,027
Oh.

30
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:37,762
Let Clara cry it out.
It'll prepare her for the real world.

31
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:40,372
- Or at least the nursery.
- You're such a good dad.

32
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,633
And you're a good mom.

33
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:54,077
- I can't do it.
- I can't do it either.

34
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:56,882
What do you need, little baby?
Come on.

35
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:05,691
Ha, ha. Oh.

36
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:09,064
I'm gonna treat you so good,
you're never gonna let me go.

37
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:11,898
- Pretty Woman reference.
- Isn't that about a prostitute?

38
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:15,007
Yeah, but Julia Roberts
is so delightful, isn't she?

39
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:19,339
Mm-hm. Wait for it.
Boom. Homemade, baby.

40
00:04:19,513 --> 00:04:22,949
Well, I have a surprise for you
underneath this, you know.

41
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:25,710
- Do you really?
- Mm-hm.

42
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:31,518
They're in the fridge.

43
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:36,729
- Morgan and Alex have the living room.
- What do you mean, "have"?

44
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:39,695
Like in college when you gotta
hang a sock on the door...

45
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:43,324
- A sock? Why would you do that?
- Doesn't matter. I'm gonna go out there.

46
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:46,563
It's only been five minutes.
Not a lot could have happened.

47
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:20,431
- Did you hear that?
- I did.

48
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:24,139
It was like our souls are so close,
they're vibrating.

49
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:25,805
- That's what it is.
- Yeah.

50
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,412
That's exactly what it is.

51
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:38,616
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

52
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:41,522
Throw the chocolate sauce on me.
Get in there.

53
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:44,391
- Make that happen. It's working.
- Ah. Okay.

54
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:47,590
Squirt it again. We have to be in sync.

55
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:51,594
- I'm stuck.
- Ah. Ah. What does it mean?

56
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:03,907
Surprise.

57
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:07,144
I agree, general.

58
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,915
There better be a damn good reason
why they're not picking up the phone.

59
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,423
I'm going to get them right now.

60
00:06:26,306 --> 00:06:28,001
What was that?

61
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,505
Oh, my God.

62
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:33,310
Dad, hi. What are you doing here?

63
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,971
- What are you doing here?
- I was...

64
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,346
Sarah had these chocolate-covered, uh...
So I was...

65
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,579
Come on, Chuck, you said I have
the living room for 90 minutes.

66
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:44,656
"Have"?

67
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:47,316
What do you mean, "have"?

68
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:50,827
- Have in a biblical way, like...
- We were, um...

69
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:55,991
- Not a biblical way, in a spiritual way...
- Beckman. Mission. Now.

70
00:07:02,576 --> 00:07:05,067
Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.

71
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:12,049
Chuck 4x16 - Versus the Masquerade

72
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:49,946
We were just transferring energy, okay?
It's not a physical thing.

73
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:53,782
- You know, it's an emotional exchange.
- Drop it, Grimes.

74
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:55,981
- We're having company?
- Hey, what the?

75
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:57,957
Who are those guys?

76
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:02,086
NCS. They're making some additions
to Castle.

77
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:05,462
Ooh. Maybe they got my comment card
about the eucalyptus steam room.

78
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,296
They're covert ops, Bartowski.

79
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,370
Nothing to do with your mission.

80
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,667
Tonight there was supposed to be
a joint CIA-NSA-Interpol bust...

81
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:15,470
of Alexei Volkoff's
three most trusted lieutenants.

82
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,545
We tracked them down...

83
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:20,841
but by the time we located them,
they were already dead.

84
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:24,544
And we believe the killer was this man,
Boris Kaminsky.

85
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,780
Boris may be trying
to take control of Volkoff Industries...

86
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:30,391
by eliminating anyone
who could claim power.

87
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,892
- Is there anyone left to make a claim?
- Possibly.

88
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:36,463
Volkoff left information on every contact
in the Hydra Network...

89
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:38,793
except for a woman
named Vivian McArthur.

90
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:41,869
- I never heard of her when I was there.
- Doesn't surprise me.

91
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,836
We believe that Volkoff
was purposely hiding her...

92
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,872
because she is his chosen successor.

93
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:49,011
Which means Vivian is Boris' next target.

94
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:50,611
Do we know anything about her?

95
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,546
The only connection between her and
Volkoff is a manor in Somerset, England.

96
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:57,811
There's a party there tonight.
Perfect time for Boris to attack.

97
00:08:57,987 --> 00:09:01,582
You need to get to Vivian before he does
and bring her back to Castle.

98
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,855
Uh, quick question, uh, G.B.

99
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:06,756
This party, is there a theme
we should dress towards?

100
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,298
Sarah, I gotta tell you,
masquerades really creep me out, okay?

101
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,240
It's like Eyes Wide Shut,
but, you know, not so boring.

102
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:25,437
Don't get me wrong,
I'm a huge Kubrick fan.

103
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:28,448
- It's just a bunch of socialites.
- Yeah, it could be that.

104
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:32,110
Or it's a sex-crazed orgy where
they don't want you to see their faces...

105
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:33,482
or know their secrets.

106
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:36,351
I've been to those parties.
It doesn't look like this.

107
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:39,723
- What? What? Really?
- Come on, Chuck, don't be ridiculous.

108
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:41,727
We gotta find Vivian before Boris does.

109
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:44,833
Know what that means?
Time to mingle. Good luck.

110
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,596
Huh? No.
Don't you think we should stay together?

111
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:51,968
Wow. Do I taste a hint of pear?

112
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,439
Elderflower liqueur
with some muddled thyme.

113
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,046
You're an impressive bartender.
It's like you were born to do this, no?

114
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,744
- Hmm.
- Thanks for the drink.

115
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:08,955
She's right. This is fantastic.
It doesn't surprise me.

116
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,754
With Chuck being a full-blown agent
and he and Sarah always taking point...

117
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,954
leaves you stuck here, behind the bar.

118
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:17,759
- I am an integral part of this team.
- Excuse me.

119
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:19,765
- Might I have an extra lime?
- Ah. Yes.

120
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,596
Thank you, dear.

121
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:27,003
And look who's talking.
You live in Charah's apartment.

122
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,340
That is our apartment, okay?

123
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:32,970
And Chuck and Sarah like having me there.
We have a special dynamic.

124
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:37,747
Good evening.

125
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,788
I am Charles Carmichael
of the Worcester Carmichaels.

126
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,483
- Who might you be?
- I'm a heart.

127
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,322
- Hors d'oeuvre?
- Don't mind if I do. Cheers.

128
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:57,199
- Hello. Enjoying the party?
- I am now.

129
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,371
So how do you know Vivian?

130
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,875
We share a mutual friend.

131
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:04,137
Wake up.
You live with an engaged couple.

132
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:07,612
- It's like you're their kid.
- What? Pfft. That's ridiculous.

133
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,843
Yes, living with a couple
has its hiccups, you know?

134
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,488
But things are really good
at the apartment, so...

135
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:15,317
They won't be that way for long.

136
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:17,959
You gotta grow up sometime.
Know what I'd do?

137
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,652
I'd go out on top
before the situation gets worse.

138
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:26,200
So tell me,
do you know where to find Vivian?

139
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:30,831
Honestly, I don't even know
what she looks like.

140
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:35,341
- It's the first party she's ever thrown.
- Interesting.

141
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,815
Aah. Hot, hot, hot.

142
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:45,249
Oh, good show, good show.
Hot. Hot but good, very good.

143
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,321
Aah. Yes, some wine would do good.

144
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,785
Please, help yourself.

145
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:57,055
I'm sorry. I can get you another.

146
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,666
It's okay. I've probably had enough.

147
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:03,103
Ahh. I can't stop thinking
about Eyes Wide Shut.

148
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:06,435
- Yes. Right?
- And I like the idea of a theme party...

149
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:09,237
but you put these people
behind masks, and it gets...

150
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:10,436
- Creepy?
- Yeah.

151
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,410
- And a little sexual.
- Yeah.

152
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:16,209
So Vivian,
do you know where she is, by chance?

153
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:18,148
I haven't had the opportunity
to say hello.

154
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,412
I'm sorry, I don't.

155
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:22,580
But if you do find her,
please, be sure to let me know.

156
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:26,387
I'd like to thank her
for this exquisite party.

157
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:35,795
So how do you, uh...?
How do you know Vivian?

158
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,472
I don't think anyone really knows her.

159
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:42,938
If this was her attempt
to get to know the neighbors...

160
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:45,273
she's failed miserably.

161
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:49,714
Well, at least there's an open bar.
I mean, she got that much right.

162
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:53,220
Uh, do you know where I could find?

163
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:56,916
Hey. I found Boris. Casey, Boris is here.

164
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:59,425
- He's wearing a green mask.
- We're on it.

165
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:02,393
- We need to find Vivian.
- I may have just met her.

166
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:10,161
Hi, sweetie.

167
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,330
Good boy. Shh.

168
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:15,102
- Vivian.
- Vivian McArthur?

169
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,505
What are you doing here?

170
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:19,339
Whoa, what's going on?

171
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:22,279
We know you're an associate
of Alexei Volkoff.

172
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,476
Alexei Volkoff?
What are you talking about?

173
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:34,155
- We're CIA. We're here to protect you.
- Protect me from what?

174
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,156
- Get in the stable.
- Stop. Don't move.

175
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,967
Take her alive. Kill the others.

176
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:44,370
We need to lose these guys.

177
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,337
- What's the best way out?
- I don't know.

178
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,101
Um, the house is back that way.

179
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:50,370
Casey, we're trapped
in one of the stables.

180
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,377
Copy that. We're on our way.

181
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:55,415
Some things never change.
Come on, Grimes, let's go.

182
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,348
Let's do this.

183
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,184
What the hell was that?

184
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:04,224
This can all end now.
Just give me the key, Vivian.

185
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,195
- What is he talking about? Key?
- I don't know.

186
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:10,332
I have nothing to do with Alexei.
I haven't seen him in years.

187
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:12,899
Then why does he pay
for the manor you live in?

188
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,036
Because I'm his daughter.

189
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:19,738
Vivian, if you want to live,
give me the key.

190
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:22,673
Look, can you please tell me
what this is all about?

191
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:26,645
Your father is an arms dealer and murderer
and all-around bad guy, okay?

192
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,051
- No, my father is an oil executive.
- We'll explain it later.

193
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,710
I have an idea. Chuck, get ready to flash.

194
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:42,728
They're trapped in the back stables.
Come on.

195
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,165
- What are you doing?
- Saving you.

196
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,736
No, we're saving you. Get in.

197
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:56,074
You are amazing. You are the best spies.
That was so awesome.

198
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:15,525
Good Lord. What happened to you two?

199
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:19,423
- You smell like vomit and Cheerios.
- We had a baby.

200
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:23,095
We need help.

201
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,299
Follow me.

202
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,800
Luckily, we have
a sleep-slash-baby aisle.

203
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:30,070
Ah.

204
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,441
You need the new Sleep Sheep.
Look at this.

205
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:36,881
It says it can record
Mama's soothing voice for the baby.

206
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:38,577
So there you go.

207
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:40,745
On my way

208
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:42,322
On my way

209
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:43,822
On my way

210
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:45,350
I would like to...

211
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,051
What is that?

212
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:53,463
I'm sorry, Jeff and Lester got their hands
on one of these and did some recording.

213
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:57,163
Jeff has some strange nap habits.
I'll have them shut it off.

214
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:00,331
No, no, no. Thanks for your help.

215
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:04,603
- That's exactly why I got myself snipped.
- Huh?

216
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,080
I may see you, I may tell you to run

217
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:10,275
On my way

218
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:13,080
- Babe, that song.
- We need that.

219
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:14,984
Okay, I'll just go ask them for it.

220
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:18,354
- Wait, wait, wait. What if they say no?
- They can't say no.

221
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:19,755
We should take it.

222
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,988
- Are you sure about this?
- Oh, yeah.

223
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:24,359
Good, because I have a plan.

224
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:26,625
I would like to...

225
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:34,439
- Eleanor Bartowski-Woodcomb.
- Hillary Rodham Clinton.

226
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:38,536
- Oh, are we not playing that game?
- We are not.

227
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,477
I came in here to breast-feed.

228
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:42,981
Maybe I could go somewhere else
to nurse.

229
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:45,177
Perhaps the backroom?

230
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:48,647
We should follow her.

231
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:10,341
Well, I believe her.
Everything she says checks out.

232
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:14,175
I do too. It seems like she has no idea
who her father actually is.

233
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,215
I think he lied to her her entire life.

234
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,410
Then why does Boris think
she has this key?

235
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:21,920
Hi. I was wondering, um,
is it possible I could stay with you tonight?

236
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:23,353
No, no, everything's fine.

237
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:26,551
They didn't get to enjoy
their Valentine's Day either...

238
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,253
and it's their apartment too.

239
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,093
Listen, I'll handle the paperwork again
if you guys take care of that.

240
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,492
Since you two got engaged...

241
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,696
Mr. Sensitivity might be feeling
a little irrelevant.

242
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:41,335
- I'll go talk to him.
- No, no, let me talk to Morgan.

243
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,534
You debrief Vivian.

244
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:46,670
Maybe he feels like a third wheel because
we only hang out when you're around.

245
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:50,080
You know, Morgan and I could use
some one-on-one time.

246
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,715
It'll be fun.

247
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:55,880
Okay. Have fun.

248
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:02,294
Let me ask you a question.

249
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:05,823
You and I don't usually do
this kind of thing...

250
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,903
so I was just wondering
if there's a reason that you're here.

251
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:16,307
No. No, no. I was just looking to hang.

252
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,640
Cool, cool. Let's hang. Ha, ha.

253
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:21,408
- Yeah.
- Okay.

254
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:29,924
So, uh, I know you guys
like having these toys around.

255
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:33,754
- Toys?
- Yeah. Maybe we can play with them.

256
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:36,755
Bang, bang.

257
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,826
Yeah, uh, sorry, sorry.

258
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:44,462
No offense, please, but these, um...
They're not toys.

259
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,902
They're collectibles.

260
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,440
- They're not for playing.
- Oh.

261
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:50,510
Chuck and I had to pool all our money
to get these guys.

262
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,240
- Original 1977 Kenner line.
- Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

263
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:59,078
They're really fun to look at.

264
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,119
The trick is...

265
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,919
Chewie always goes
on Han's right side.

266
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:10,295
So... Anyway, I've been arranging them
this way since I was about 13...

267
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:12,627
if you can believe that.

268
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,838
They're toys.
They're just toys, aren't they?

269
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,274
- They're just toys.
- No, they're collectibles.

270
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:28,507
- It's different. They have value.
- No, no, no. Wait a minute.

271
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:32,017
Wait, you're not here to hang.
You're here because I'm a third wheel.

272
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:34,985
Casey was right.
Oh, my God. I play with toys.

273
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:39,184
I live with a couple. I am a child.
Oh, I'm like your child.

274
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,825
You guys are like my parents.
Oh, my God.

275
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:43,828
It's okay. Calm down. It's fine.

276
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,491
I mean, look at this. I can't...
I can't do this anymore.

277
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:49,660
I have to grow up.

278
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:53,170
I have to move out.
That's what I have to do.

279
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:55,310
I have to go.

280
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:59,914
So my father, he actually killed people?

281
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:04,083
- Did you spend much time with the man?
- Honestly? No.

282
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:07,347
He put me into schools,
sent me on trips all over the world.

283
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:10,686
He made sure every minute
of every day was occupied.

284
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,622
But he was never a part of my life.

285
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:16,662
Or, uh, he was trying to protect you...

286
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:19,926
from the very dark and dangerous world
that he was a part of.

287
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:22,332
Yeah, maybe.

288
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:25,673
And now you have a chance
to do what you want.

289
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,473
Right.

290
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,374
Now I just have to figure out
what that actually is.

291
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:36,541
After the party, I'm sure we can safely
cross being a socialite off the list.

292
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:41,648
I can't believe I still don't know
what to do with my life.

293
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:50,356
Can I not be a spy for a second?

294
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:51,692
- Oh, please.
- Okay.

295
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:56,028
You should've seen my life
a few years ago.

296
00:20:56,205 --> 00:21:00,164
I was working a dead-end job,
I was living with my sister...

297
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,639
and then something...

298
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:07,178
An opportunity just fell in my lap.

299
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:11,278
Afternoon, colonel.

300
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:13,786
Paperwork, bartending...

301
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:15,924
Any chance your skills are being wasted?

302
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,388
You were at the bar.

303
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:21,885
- What are you doing in Castle?
- Director Jane Bentley, NCS.

304
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,158
I was in England to observe.

305
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,632
I'm not like Agents Bartowski or Walker,
or even General Beckman.

306
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:29,828
I see your true potential.

307
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:31,666
You started working for the NSA...

308
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,900
because you were America's
best sharpshooter, and now...

309
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,511
You're so much more than this.

310
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,772
It seems your team
doesn't need you anymore.

311
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:41,973
When are you gonna accept that
and move on?

312
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,174
Getting to a point?

313
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:46,913
I'm putting together a new team,
and I want you to lead them.

314
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:52,751
- What's the directive?
- You're curious. Good.

315
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:54,293
I'll be in touch.

316
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,131
I never expected this to be my life.

317
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:08,003
But here I am...

318
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:10,777
and I'm happy.

319
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:12,971
And if you give it some time...

320
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:17,676
I'm sure that you can find that
for you as well.

321
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:23,181
So, what happens now?

322
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:28,125
Okay, well, now the best thing to do
is get you into a CIA safe house.

323
00:22:28,297 --> 00:22:31,164
I've spent my entire life
being hidden away by my father.

324
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,665
This is serious.
This is very serious business.

325
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:38,101
Boris has gone after your father
and is taking out everyone close to him.

326
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,740
He knows where you live.

327
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:43,002
Wait, okay, so why don't we use that
to our advantage?

328
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:44,907
- What do you mean?
- Use me as bait.

329
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,446
- No.
- This is the first opportunity I've had...

330
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,140
to take control of my life.

331
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:51,709
I can't let it slip away.

332
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:55,516
Charles, I know it's asking a lot,
and I know that I'm a Volkoff.

333
00:22:58,226 --> 00:22:59,853
But will you help me?

334
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:04,195
Please?

335
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,609
Yes.

336
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:20,507
Yes, I'll help you.

337
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,986
I may say to run

338
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,386
- On my way
- I may tell you to run

339
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,821
On my way

340
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:34,725
On my way

341
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:36,955
Oh, honey, I think I'm losing my mind.

342
00:23:37,132 --> 00:23:40,465
I know. I used to love this song.

343
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:43,399
Okay, it's been two hours.

344
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:46,564
If I turn it off,
do you think Clara will stay asleep?

345
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,203
It couldn't hurt to try.

346
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:04,718
Babe, it could be worse.

347
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:07,919
- Really? Could it be?
- Hey, we're doctors.

348
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:11,924
We've gone without sleep before.
We were born for this.

349
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,660
Okay. You're right.

350
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:20,905
Well, pick me up with a golden hand

351
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:22,976
I may see you

352
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:24,237
I may tell you to run

353
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:26,074
I may see you

354
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:27,681
On my way

355
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:29,009
On my way

356
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,282
Hey, Morgan, buddy, hey,
I gotta pack for the mission...

357
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,419
but Sarah said you were moving out,
so I told her that was, of course...

358
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:43,621
completely ridiculous.

359
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:48,626
No, she's right. I'm doing it.
I'm gonna move out.

360
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:50,999
No, but, see, that's totally ridiculous.

361
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:55,041
Morgan, I'm so sorry about busting in
on you and Alex on Valentine's Day...

362
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,643
with the rug and the...

363
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:59,303
The point is,
you had the living room for 90 minutes.

364
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:01,608
We had a deal, I broke it. I'm so sorry.

365
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:04,980
I am not moving out because of
what happened on Valentine's Day.

366
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:09,715
No, I'm moving out because it's just...
It's been a long time coming, you know?

367
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:12,621
Neither of us wants to admit it, but...

368
00:25:12,794 --> 00:25:14,489
Admit what? What do you mean?

369
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:19,396
Heh. Chuck, do you realize you and Sarah
are gonna be married in a few months?

370
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:22,503
My friend, married. Heh.

371
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:25,295
You should have your own place.

372
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:27,738
It's ridiculous.
You should have your own place.

373
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:32,573
I have a serious girlfriend now,
who, by the way, takes me seriously.

374
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:36,511
I just think it's time we both grow up.

375
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:39,980
We are grown up. Come on.

376
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:42,316
Why wouldn't you wanna live
with your friends?

377
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:44,925
- Aren't you happy? I'm happy.
- Of course I'm happy.

378
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:46,321
But we were both happy...

379
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:50,898
when your father let us build a fort
in the attic and sleep there all summer.

380
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,328
- That was a great summer.
- That was a good summer.

381
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:58,897
But things change and...

382
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:03,834
It's not really a bad thing.
I think it's gonna be okay.

383
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:10,579
- Where are you gonna go?
- I don't know.

384
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:13,949
I gotta finish packing up,
and then I'm gonna head out that door...

385
00:26:14,122 --> 00:26:17,114
and I'm just gonna open myself up
to the universe.

386
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:22,059
- So moving to your mom's?
- Yeah. Yeah, pretty much straight over.

387
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:28,531
Come on, this is okay. This is okay.

388
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:31,729
Bright side, this is not gonna be hard
to split up, okay?

389
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:32,965
I've done most of it.

390
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:38,135
From what I can figure, the original
Super NES with "Donkey Kong," yours.

391
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:39,575
Right, sure.

392
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:43,206
And you'll be taking
all of the Hong Kong wire fu...

393
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:45,580
and Miyazaki flicks, I assume?

394
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:48,018
You know what happens
when you assume.

395
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:51,755
- You're usually correct.
- Yeah.

396
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:56,427
I guess really all that's left
to take into consideration is our, uh...

397
00:26:56,898 --> 00:27:02,097
Han Solo and Chewbacca original '77
Kenner line collector's edition.

398
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:10,108
- We went in on these together, buddy.
- Sure did.

399
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,273
So we just each take one?

400
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,938
No, no, that's crazy talk.
We can't split them up.

401
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:16,777
You can't separate Han and Chewie.

402
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:20,479
Chewie's Han's first mate
and constant companion.

403
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:22,486
- What up?
- Ha, ha.

404
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:25,820
Plus they're worth more, ahem,
as a set, so...

405
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:29,921
So we should sell them.

406
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:31,963
We don't need to decide right now.

407
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:34,192
We can sleep on it.
We can decide tomorrow.

408
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:36,462
- Totally.
- I got a big mission ahead of me.

409
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:38,435
Right, sure you do. And you know what?

410
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:41,576
I have so much more packing
to do and...

411
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,104
So I'll just sleep with him tonight, then,
in my room.

412
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,840
Not sleep with him.
But he's gonna be in my room.

413
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:51,179
And, you know,
Chewie will just stay with me.

414
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:54,516
- For the night, obviously.
- Obviously, obviously.

415
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:05,492
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

416
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:28,515
- Chuck, is everything okay?
- Yeah.

417
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,021
Ahem. Yeah. Ahem.

418
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:33,416
I was just resting. Stretching.
I was stretching.

419
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,723
I find the wall to have...
It's a lower-lumbar thing. Mm-hm.

420
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:40,356
- I'm fine, I'm good.
- I'm sorry about Morgan.

421
00:28:40,535 --> 00:28:42,526
It's fine. I'm fine. He's fine.

422
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:46,202
We're fine, so... How's the...? Ahem.

423
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:49,571
How's the packing for the mission going?
You ready?

424
00:28:49,744 --> 00:28:51,041
Yeah.

425
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:56,774
If we're gonna use
Boris' knowledge of you to our advantage...

426
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:58,851
we're gonna need to know the details.

427
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,853
Walk us through a day. We need
to figure out when you're vulnerable.

428
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:04,617
Odds are Boris is doing
the exact same thing right now.

429
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:05,851
I wake up at 6:00.

430
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:09,226
I make breakfast, get dressed...

431
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:12,799
and then I take Artemis out
for a morning walk.

432
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,896
Well, hello, Vivian.

433
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:21,272
How do I look?

434
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,877
- You said the details are important, right?
- Mm-hm.

435
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:25,774
Here.

436
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:27,915
I always wear this.

437
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:31,446
Perfect.

438
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:35,716
- Are you okay?
- Shouldn't I be the one that goes?

439
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,450
Absolutely not.
You should stay here, where it's safe.

440
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,561
Everything's gonna be fine.
Sarah's had years of training.

441
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,960
And Casey will be watching
my every move.

442
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:51,402
I'm at the north gate.
If Boris attacks, he'll do it here.

443
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:53,998
This is it.

444
00:29:57,746 --> 00:29:59,941
Are you sure she'll be all right?

445
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:03,349
She always is.

446
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:18,622
Everything looks clear.
I've got a mile until the gate.

447
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,131
I'll be waiting.

448
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,770
It's time.

449
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:01,608
Whoa, whoa.

450
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:07,072
- Casey, something's wrong.
- I'm coming to you.

451
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,050
Whoa, whoa. Easy, boy.

452
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:19,421
Whoa, whoa.

453
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:21,488
Whoa, whoa!

454
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:27,859
I'm coming, Walker.

455
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,443
Sarah? Casey, what's wrong?
What's happening?

456
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:44,609
Is everything okay?

457
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:46,913
Stay inside.
You shouldn't be out here. Go.

458
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:49,852
Casey, where are you? Where is Sarah?

459
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:53,357
Sixty seconds out.
I'm on my way. Stay with Vivian.

460
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,653
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm not doing this.

461
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:00,460
I'm not letting anyone die for me.
I have spent my whole life hiding.

462
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:03,433
It ends today.

463
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,736
All right, let's do this.

464
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,470
- It's not Vivian.
- Then kill her and find Vivian.

465
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:17,110
She's the only one
who has what we want.

466
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,427
Walker. Walker.

467
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:38,564
There's too many of them.
Go and get Chuck, okay?

468
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,231
Shut up.
You know I'm not leaving you here.

469
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:45,610
Let's get you under cover.

470
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:50,073
The road's up ahead.
You okay back there?

471
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:52,776
Yeah, yeah.

472
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,282
We got company.

473
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:01,059
I didn't spend 10 years
in equestrian school for nothing.

474
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,958
Hyah! Hyah!

475
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,348
- Do you think we lost them?
- I don't know.

476
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:33,820
I know. No, we haven't.

477
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:36,186
Hyah!

478
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:40,967
- Go, Artemis, go.
- They're gaining on us.

479
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:42,864
Come on. Go, go.

480
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:45,938
Listen, it's only a matter of time
till they catch us.

481
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,597
We're carrying too much weight.

482
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,938
- Well, what do you suggest?
- Plan B.

483
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,306
Don't stop for anything.

484
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:24,607
Well, that was kind of cool.

485
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:27,247
Sarah, Casey, where are you?

486
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:18,826
Sarah. Hey.

487
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:21,629
Sarah.

488
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:23,100
Where's Vivian?

489
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:29,609
I've reached the stables.

490
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:32,473
Good. Stay there. We're on our way.

491
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,346
Vivian.

492
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:45,119
What do you know?
Alexei Volkoff has a daughter.

493
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:49,419
Must have taken a lot of work
to keep you under wraps.

494
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:53,829
Now just give me the key
and I'll make it painless, I promise.

495
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:57,164
- My father never gave me any key.
- Yes, sweetheart, he did.

496
00:35:57,338 --> 00:36:00,205
When you were young.
A token of his affection.

497
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:04,610
So think hard, Vivian. Where is it?

498
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,610
I don't know. None of this makes sense.

499
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:09,078
My father didn't want me
to be involved in this.

500
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,744
Really? You were skeet shooting at age 7,
had your black belt at 13...

501
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:18,984
and by the time you graduated,
you were fluent in five languages.

502
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,186
Your whole life,
your father's been grooming you.

503
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:25,832
You are his succession plan.

504
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,367
But he was wrong about you.

505
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:31,505
See, he couldn't recognize
what you really are:

506
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:36,666
An indecisive, weak little girl.

507
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:07,739
Look, I know what you did was hard,
but you had no choice.

508
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:10,241
- Boris would have killed you.
- But now he's gone.

509
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:12,538
And the rest of the lieutenants are dead.

510
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:16,274
There's no one left to put the pieces
of Volkoff Industries back together.

511
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,610
What happens to it now?

512
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:21,915
Without a leader, your father's empire
is just an empty office in Moscow.

513
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:24,523
Vivian, did Boris tell you anything
about the key?

514
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:26,626
What he was looking for?

515
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:30,056
No, he didn't. Sorry.

516
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:32,430
Time to go.

517
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,697
- You sure you'll be all right?
- Yeah.

518
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:40,864
I can't thank you enough.
For your advice, for everything, Charles.

519
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:44,572
I think it's time I figured out
what to do with my life.

520
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:47,714
Well, I'm sure you'll think of something.

521
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:50,574
Bye.

522
00:38:12,006 --> 00:38:14,474
So this is, uh?

523
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:18,879
This is it, huh?

524
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:23,281
Yeah. Yeah, this is it.

525
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,748
Buddy, I know you're committed
to moving out, and I get it...

526
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:32,017
but I can't tell you enough
how much Sarah and I love you.

527
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:33,455
And love having you here.

528
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:37,997
Ahh. Dude. I love being here.

529
00:38:38,165 --> 00:38:41,328
It would be easy to leave
if things sucked, though, you know?

530
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:44,597
And I need to grow up.

531
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:48,208
Maybe that means leaving behind
something that's great too.

532
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,036
The end of an era.

533
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:52,446
It is indeed.

534
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:57,117
- We'll still have game night, though.
- Every Monday.

535
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:00,685
So, what's gonna happen
with Han and Chewie, huh?

536
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:03,517
Where are they?
Did you sell them already?

537
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:09,288
Well, I mean, Chewie is Han's first mate
and constant companion.

538
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:11,556
It just didn't seem right to separate them.

539
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:16,362
More importantly,
I thought they should stay in the family.

540
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:33,012
You moved her into the nursery?
You think she's ready?

541
00:39:33,187 --> 00:39:36,714
Honey, she's 3 months old.
It's time for Clara to be in her own room.

542
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:39,359
Besides, she's not alone in there.

543
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:43,224
- Which means that we can be all alone.
- I am way ahead of you.

544
00:39:43,397 --> 00:39:46,560
I already have our outfits laid out
and ready to go.

545
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:50,033
I've been waiting for this
since Clara was born.

546
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,906
- I love you.
- I love you too.

547
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:58,538
I'm not leaving my team.
What I have here is good.

548
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:00,544
But you've been here for four years...

549
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:02,945
longer than any other assignment
you've had.

550
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:05,108
- Yeah.
- These people mean a lot to you.

551
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:07,880
For God's sake,
you saved Agent Walker's life today.

552
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:11,218
But you're not gonna spend the rest
of your career with this team.

553
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:13,758
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to move on.

554
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:17,022
Why not today,
when you can go out on top?

555
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,260
I'm not leaving Burbank.

556
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:22,599
You won't have to.

557
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:26,801
The mission's right here.

558
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:46,920
Huh.
