1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,321
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things
that you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:07,071
We spared no expense
recreating the Buy More.

3
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:11,091
It's now a full-fledged
CIA-NSA substation.

4
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,191
I'm pregnant.

5
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:14,081
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

6
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:15,821
Alex, I'm your father.

7
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:19,581
If Volkoff has any intel on my
mom, we need to try and find it.

8
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:20,721
Someone is looking for you.

9
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:22,341
- Who?
- Your family.

10
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,961
- Have you told Volkoff anything?
- Told him nothing.

11
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,411
That's good.

12
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:31,121
MILAN

13
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:09,421
Okay, we're a man down, so you three really need
to step it up while Ellie's out of commission.

14
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:11,451
Devon, I'm 13 weeks pregnant.

15
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:13,641
Exactly-we've already lost 13 weeks,

16
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:15,971
and there are a lot of
decisions that need to be made:

17
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:19,271
Natural or water
birth, Ergo or BabyBj rn?

18
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:21,801
Spanish or French as a second language,

19
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:23,901
or are we gonna blow it
wide open and go Japanese?

20
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:26,041
Devon, the baby's not due
for another six months.

21
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:27,411
You still have a little lead time.

22
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,551
Exactly, thank you, and besides,

23
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:33,061
tomorrow is Chuck's first
day back at Buy More.

24
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:36,021
- And, and Morgan's.
- Thank you.

25
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,361
A little acknowledgement
goes a long way.

26
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:38,721
You know, Ellie, it's not that big a deal.

27
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:42,011
Morgan and I, after all, have
worked for the Buy More before.

28
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:45,141
Well, it's still exciting, and it's safe.

29
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:49,091
- It's safe and exciting.
- You tired, babe, huh?

30
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,551
I know you haven't been sleeping
well. Is the baby resting on your spleen?

31
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:53,571
Okay, Devon, seriously, you have to relax.

32
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,611
The baby is like the size of a walnut.

33
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:57,561
Watch your tone.

34
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,681
Eardrums develop in week 12.

35
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,511
Our little walnut can
hear everything you say.

36
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:04,041
- What is happening?
- I have no idea.

37
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:05,721
You guys should be taking
some notes over here.

38
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,271
You could be next.

39
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:12,651
Well, I don't know, Sarah would have to
unpack first for them to even think about

40
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:14,611
starting a family.

41
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:21,891
Snow pea?

42
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,811
I mean, you know, it's
only been eight months.

43
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:39,341
Right, and, uh, and I've been on missions practically
the entire time and I have to go away again soon.

44
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:41,751
Totally, I get it, you know that I get it.

45
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:42,941
Look, don't listen to Morgan.

46
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,171
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

47
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:45,691
The guy eats cereal with a fork.

48
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:47,331
So you're okay with it?

49
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:49,681
You're here.

50
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:52,471
That's all that matters to me. Okay?

51
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:56,231
It's not weird at all.

52
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:58,531
- It's totally weird, right?
- Of course it is.

53
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,801
I mean, she won't put one thing in
her side of the closet, not a thing.

54
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:06,321
It's like she'd rather be on a
mission than, than back home with me.

55
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,111
Well, it's just when everything seems
great and everything seems perfect,

56
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:12,241
- that's usually when you find it, man.
- Find, find, find what?

57
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:13,371
The Achilles' heel.

58
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:18,571
Chuck, every relationship has one the singular problem
that cannot be overcome even in the greatest romances

59
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,831
Romeo and Juliet, Tristan
and Isolde, Anakin and Padm.

60
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:27,341
Are you saying then that Sarah not
unpacking is our Achilles' heel?

61
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:29,981
Take my advice, buddy: keep
your feelings to yourself, okay?

62
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:31,941
You don't want to give her
any more reason to bolt.

63
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:34,861
Chuck Bartowski, please report
to the manager's office.

64
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,491
- Duty calls. Thanks for the talk, buddy.
- Of course.

65
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:43,251
Roger that. Gentlemen, you're dismissed.

66
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,121
How you guys doing?

67
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,311
So, I'm Agent Grimes.

68
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,761
You're Special Ops.

69
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,491
I know you guys are
all undercover spies,

70
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,081
but I'm pretty familiar with
the old girl-Buy More, you know.

71
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,681
If you have any
questions, feel free to ask.

72
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:02,281
- Take a little coffee break, we'll
just kind of go? - We're working.

73
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:04,111
We don't take breaks.

74
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:08,271
You're a very tiny man, aren't you?

75
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:09,871
Have you looked in a mirror lately?

76
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:14,261
You're, just quite impressive, to
be honest with you.

77
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,251
I mean, it's really just
the physical specimen.

78
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:20,681
I used to be like that, but, You're
just gonna one-arm that thing?

79
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:25,411
Okay, that's. I used to do that
myself, but I just forgot my weight belt.

80
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:31,001
One of our agents was killed in Milan
last night while he was tracking this woman

81
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,911
Sofia Stepanova.

82
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:36,081
Who do we have taking
our surveillance pics?

83
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,221
Because those are tremendous.

84
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:40,231
Can you see the way??

85
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:41,681
What? No, no, no, no.

86
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,621
I'm just saying, clearly?
Is she in a bathing suit?

87
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:44,841
I didn't even notice
that the first time.

88
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:50,721
We can all acknowledge that
Ms. Stepanova is quite fetching.

89
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:52,681
But don't be fooled by her appearance.

90
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:57,121
We believe she's the executor of
Volkoff's most important weapons deals.

91
00:04:57,361 --> 00:05:00,621
She uses her cover as a runway
model to travel the world,

92
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:05,261
get access to the most powerful
people, and deliver weapons like this.

93
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:13,191
Stepanova stole an ammunition clip containing smart bullets
from a weapons development facility outside Paris.

94
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:16,981
- Mr. Bartowski.
- What are smart bullets?

95
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:18,341
Microchip controlled.

96
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,871
They have a built-in GPS.

97
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:22,371
The bullet guides itself to the target.

98
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:24,621
Something a good spy would never need.

99
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:25,801
Maybe you should get some.

100
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,871
Actually, that's exactly
what I need you to do.

101
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:32,171
Stepanova plans to sell the weapons
at a party during Milan Fashion Week.

102
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:35,181
I'm sending you two to intercept them.

103
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:39,121
Colonel Casey? After the
Yves St. Laurent incident,

104
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:41,421
you will obviously have
to sit this one out.

105
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,441
Stab one guy with a stiletto?

106
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:46,661
Bartowski, Walker, you'll
need to leave immediately.

107
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:49,081
Packed and ready to go, General.

108
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:53,411
Now, there's a woman in love.

109
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:57,691
No one loves a mission more than Walker.

110
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,741
You need to be on your guard out there.

111
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:09,041
Volkoff and his people they're serious.

112
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:13,961
Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I got it, but the
closer I get to finding Volkoff,

113
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,921
the closer I get to finding my mom.

114
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,891
Well, I won't be there
to rescue your ass.

115
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:19,431
I'll be stuck here.

116
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:24,601
Stuck here. Come on, Casey, you
know you like Burbank a little.

117
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:29,041
Okay, granted, we'd all rather be on the Amalfi
Coast or Bora-Bora or something like that,

118
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:31,151
but don't you feel a
little bit at home here?

119
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:36,181
Yeah, I guess, about as much as
Darfur or that cave in Afghanistan.

120
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:42,751
Okay, but then, supposing there was
someone could there be someone,

121
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:47,531
a person who makes you feel even
a little more at home, like Alex?

122
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,861
I mean, you see her a lot, right?

123
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,111
- No.
- No? She's your daughter.

124
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,841
Spies don't put down roots.

125
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:56,221
That's the rule.

126
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,221
Rule. It's not a rule.

127
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:02,731
It's a, it's a notion or
a suggestion or guideline.

128
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:06,471
It's about that Achilles'
heel thing, isn't it?

129
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:09,551
- Achilles-how do you
know?- Grimes told me.

130
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:12,611
That pipsqueak will talk to
anyone he thinks is listening.

131
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:16,751
Chuck, beautiful women
have a lot of baggage.

132
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:19,641
You should be happy
Walker's is just a suitcase.

133
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,320
Chuck 4x02 - Versus the Suitcase

134
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:07,165
MILAN

135
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:13,671
Any sign of Sofia?

136
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:18,551
No, not yet. Strapless
Versace? Very daring, Agent Walker.

137
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:21,195
How much Project Runway
have you been watching?

138
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:29,125
There she is.

139
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:31,075
It's got to be in the purse.

140
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:32,465
The smart bullets?

141
00:08:32,685 --> 00:08:34,695
All right, I got this one.

142
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,965
Excuse me.

143
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:47,945
Who do you think you are?

144
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:49,865
Nobody, I'm nobody, this is nothing.

145
00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:54,075
No, I wasn't ting to do that
put my hand on your bottom.

146
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:57,405
Your hand is still
touching my perfection.

147
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:58,785
So it is.

148
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,635
So sorry about that. That was an accident

149
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:03,055
a happy accident, kind
of, I guess, not really,

150
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:05,715
but I'm not a weirdo pervert by
any stretch of the imagination.

151
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:08,975
- Then what are you doing here?
- I'm here with, uh...

152
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:11,465
I see.

153
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,435
No harm done.

154
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:22,815
- Did you get it?
- Not exactly, no.

155
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:24,525
Had a little awkward
moment there, actually.

156
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:28,125
- What happened? - I went for the purse and
then she turned and then my hand was very

157
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:32,185
I mean, very lightly on her kind of you
know, really it's not that important.

158
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:36,035
She's still at the bar. ***.

159
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,715
He's taking her purse.

160
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:40,515
What, who is?

161
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:42,155
The bartender.

162
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,225
She's already made the drop.

163
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:52,485
Hand it over.

164
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,295
Please don't hurt me.

165
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:58,075
A woman left her purse at the bar...

166
00:09:58,235 --> 00:10:00,625
I just want to return it.

167
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,045
Okay.

168
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:06,225
Sarah.

169
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:08,235
She knew we were coming.

170
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:09,785
Let's go.

171
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:13,765
Okay, remain calm remain
caremai? Should I throw it?

172
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:18,235
Why did it click? Clicks are bad.

173
00:10:18,415 --> 00:10:19,685
Okay, it must have a pressure sensor.

174
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:21,275
If you let go, it'll explode.

175
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:28,075
Oh, go quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. Do
what you do.

176
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:34,245
Sarah, listen, I cannot die without you knowing
that I accept you for who you are, okay?

177
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,085
Your weird unpacking
habit-it doesn't matter to me.

178
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:38,395
Nothing matters. I still love you.

179
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,465
You still love me?

180
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:51,305
Sorry, what, what?

181
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:56,735
Did I? Those weren't the
best last words, were they?

182
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:04,555
Top three things you
can do with a Roomba.

183
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,025
Number three. Go.

184
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:11,495
Okay, this new Buy
More has changed a lot,

185
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:14,315
- and I don't think it's for the better.
- Shut up, Grimes.

186
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:19,255
Dude, what is up with the Buy More?

187
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:20,825
Everyone is, like, scary efficient.

188
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:23,155
- Hadn't noticed.
- Hadn't noticed, either.

189
00:11:23,605 --> 00:11:24,875
Bull's-eye.

190
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:30,065
25 feet. I can do better.

191
00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:33,295
Okay, tell me not
everyone in here is a spy.

192
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:36,215
Chuck promised Ell he's not
working for the CIA anymore.

193
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:38,465
I'm worried about her
she's not sleeping as it is.

194
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:41,605
- If she even thought that Chuck was still a spy?
- Bartowski's out.

195
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:43,505
Buy More's still my cover, though.

196
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:45,605
Sadly, that hasn't changed.

197
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:48,835
No.

198
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:54,105
- Something about this place still seems a lile?
- Off.

199
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:57,905
30 feet. That's more like it.

200
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,775
Where is Chuck?

201
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:05,095
You know, we make a great team, you
and I. You are such a day-saver.

202
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:07,995
I am super proud of you. I really am.

203
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,775
Proud of us, really, you know, and
how well we work together.

204
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:13,935
- Any sign of Sofia?
- No, no. Are you mad at me?

205
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,725
If the weapon wa't iner purse, then she
certainly didn't have it with her at the party,

206
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:20,265
because that dress didn't conceal much.

207
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:22,745
I wasn't? I wasn't looking.

208
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:26,095
Hey, I wasn't looking, first of all, and second
of all, it's a very stressful situation,

209
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:29,065
watching one's life flash
before one's eyes like that.

210
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:32,485
And at the end of the day, and you
have to admit this, I disay, I love you.

211
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:34,295
That's what should matter, right? We
can both agree on that.

212
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,015
Chuck, if we hadn't stopped that bomb,

213
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:39,575
your last words to me would have
been about my weird unpacking thing.

214
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:40,685
You're right, and I'm sorry.

215
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:43,535
I should never have done that. And the
crazy thing is, I don't even care. I don't.

216
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:44,995
Spies pack light; I get it.

217
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:48,445
Yes, we do pack light, because we have
to be prepared for the next mission.

218
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,915
And right now, we really need
to focus on this mission.

219
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:55,145
Let's go, Chuck.

220
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:07,605
- Can I help you, Mr. Grimes?
- Yes.

221
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:12,057
Actually, I'd like to talk to you about how
well things are going here at the Buy More.

222
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:15,457
- Things do seem to be running quite smoothly.
- Exactly.

223
00:13:15,617 --> 00:13:17,647
Yeah, uh, that seems to
be the problem to me.

224
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:20,507
It's too right that it's? It's wrong.

225
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:23,717
And tell me, Mr. Grimes,

226
00:13:23,897 --> 00:13:27,567
- what do you know about running a CIA base?
- Nothing.

227
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:30,307
But I do kn how to run a Buy More.

228
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:34,547
And with all due respect, General, this
is? No longer a Buy More.

229
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:38,397
- You have five minutes.
- I'll only need two. Walk with me.

230
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:42,147
You see, one of the defining characteristics of
the old Buy More was its inattention to detail.

231
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:47,177
For example? Take this generic
yet? Tasty chocolate drink, right?

232
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:50,257
Now, a year ago, this would have sat,

233
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:54,107
for about a week until Jeff came
along and lapped it up off the floor.

234
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:57,357
Here, this one's fresher.

235
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:58,757
Enjoy.

236
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:02,807
My people were trained to
be observant and efficient.

237
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:04,357
It's the CIA way.

238
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,237
Ah, but it's not the
Buy More way, you see?

239
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:12,327
Now, if customers don't have hazardous spills,
mislabeled product, surly employees to distract them,

240
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:14,257
well, they may start to
enjoy their time here.

241
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,757
Let's continue.

242
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:19,047
I don't want to be an
astronaut anymore, Mommy.

243
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:21,457
I want to work at the Buy More.

244
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:23,857
First you got to stay
in school, little man.

245
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:28,227
No one should ever, ever
want to work here.

246
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,087
See, you have to look
at the big picture here.

247
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:32,237
A pleased customer's gonna want
to stay in the store longer,

248
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,487
he's gonna want to bring his
friends, maybe, bring his family,

249
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:40,747
tying up valuable CIA resources, not to mention?
Encouraging them to look a little deeper.

250
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:41,827
And what happens, General?

251
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:43,647
What happens when they
do look a little deeper?

252
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:48,667
Maybe, maybe just one customer
discovers what's really going on here.

253
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:57,017
General, look? If even I can
see through this Buy More cover,

254
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:59,527
what's an enemy spy gonna think?

255
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:02,537
What do you propose?

256
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:11,617
You look really pretty right now.

257
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:17,387
I'm just saying, with all the blood rushing to
your head, it brings out the color in your cheeks.

258
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:20,267
Spiderman kiss?

259
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:21,597
No.

260
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:23,377
Okay. Maybe later.

261
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,517
If I could just? There we go.

262
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:33,277
I see Sofia stays in
the Presidential Suite.

263
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:36,067
And they say crime doesn't pay.

264
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:57,627
What?

265
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:00,027
It's nothing. Nothing.

266
00:16:00,147 --> 00:16:01,547
No, please, say it, Chuck.

267
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:04,497
It's just, it's not a spy thing, per se.

268
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:08,067
- What's not a spy thing?
- Unpacking. Not a not a spy thing.

269
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:14,397
I mean, not every spy has issue with
it, like some spies? Do, you know, clearly,

270
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:20,697
because Sofia felt comfortable enough to
settle herself in, and it's only a hotel room.

271
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,307
Just thinking out loud.

272
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:23,957
Thank you for that.

273
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:27,487
There's a safe in the corner here.

274
00:16:28,357 --> 00:16:29,597
Nice. Good eye.

275
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:41,567
Everything looks secure here, ma'am.

276
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:46,687
Miss Sofia, could we
have a moment to talk?

277
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:48,537
Just stand guard.

278
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,267
That's what you're here for.

279
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,022
What do we do now?

280
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:21,022
We can't leave without the weapon.

281
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:31,552
Can you see anything?

282
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:34,962
- Are you serious?
- Am I serious?

283
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:37,832
What? Who do you think I am?

284
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:41,542
If we can't see anything, then she
can't see anything, either, right?

285
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:45,202
Right. Okay, well, I'll get the
card, and you get the safe.

286
00:17:45,392 --> 00:17:46,582
Break.

287
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:11,862
Miss Sofia?

288
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:13,632
Don't turn around.

289
00:18:14,112 --> 00:18:18,502
I have something I need to
tell you. Miss Sofia, I love you.

290
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:32,572
Don't move.

291
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:39,572
Look at me.

292
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:48,612
Okay, you should know
that I have a girlfriend.

293
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:51,142
For so many years I've been your muscle.

294
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:56,262
But, you know, the strongest
muscle in my body is my heart.

295
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:59,262
And now it belongs to you.

296
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:02,622
Sorry.

297
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:06,352
Who do you work for, and
how did you find me?

298
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:07,522
I would love to get into this.

299
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:11,772
Is it? Is it at all possible for you
to cover yourself with maybe a towel?

300
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,322
Is she naked?

301
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:17,752
Who?

302
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:19,762
Yes. Yes, she is.

303
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:22,342
Chuck, run!

304
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:29,482
Did you get the weapon?

305
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:30,942
You bet I did.

306
00:19:31,442 --> 00:19:32,612
Stop!

307
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,492
Put some clothes on.

308
00:19:44,295 --> 00:19:47,773
Right. Understood. I will
put a team on it tomorrow.

309
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:52,363
Yes, and thank you for
shopping at the Buy More.

310
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:56,973
- So, everything going well upstairs?
- Too well.

311
00:19:57,203 --> 00:20:00,753
Unfortunately, I can't say
the same for things down here.

312
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:04,523
Your work in Milan was excellent,

313
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:07,403
but we've analyzed the
chips you brought back.

314
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:09,313
They're not functional.

315
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:12,093
- What do you mean, they're not functional?
- They're fakes.

316
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:13,853
Sofia was one step ahead of us.

317
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:16,283
She must have hidden the
real chips somewhere else.

318
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:19,503
Interpol and FSB are
looking for her now, so

319
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:24,163
all we can do is sit tight until
she pops back up on the radar.

320
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:26,503
General, sorry to disturb you,

321
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:31,933
but there's a man from the Better Business Bureau here
to bestow the Buy More with an award for excellence.

322
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:35,373
He needs the manager
to formally accept it.

323
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:37,113
I'll be right there.

324
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:39,353
We need new blood upstairs.

325
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:43,743
Hopefully, your? Woolly
friend, Mr. Grimes, will come through.

326
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:46,823
Will, um? Come? What? Come
through with what?

327
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:50,493
Let's just say? He's recruiting.

328
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,053
Day 184.

329
00:20:56,743 --> 00:20:59,183
Still running from the po-po.

330
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:04,943
Sweet Buy More, why and
how did we ever burn you?

331
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,123
It's been, dark days.

332
00:21:09,313 --> 00:21:15,913
We've been taking gigs at the Whisper
Lounge in exchange for scraps of tapas, which.

333
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:27,583
And we live here now in the wild?
With my van? Where no one can find us.

334
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:30,593
It's not all bad.

335
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:33,663
I've been? Expanding my
understanding of the universal mind.

336
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:36,263
Jeff has a new pet rock named Bruce.

337
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:41,303
I asked him why Bruce, and he said
when he hits it it doesn't bruce.

338
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,563
Why do you even bother
with these idiots?

339
00:21:45,753 --> 00:21:48,743
They may be idiots, but
they're my idiots.

340
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:51,693
The Buy More's been my home for eight
years, so without Jeff and Lester,

341
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:54,543
I think it would just feel like
another electronics store, you know.

342
00:21:57,623 --> 00:22:02,333
- Do you ever miss Ace of Base?
- Always.

343
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,613
Jeffrey, we've been made!

344
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,143
Get the suicide pills.

345
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,343
We are going down
like Thelma and Louise,

346
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:12,073
just like we practiced-Thelma
and/or Louise.

347
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:16,053
- They're everywhere!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got this. I got this.

348
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:17,483
We are not the boys you are looking for.

349
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:19,033
These are not the boys
that we're looking?

350
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:19,903
Cut it out.

351
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:23,273
Listen to me. We just came here
to give you your jobs back.

352
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,253
- What job?
- Your old jobs.

353
00:22:26,423 --> 00:22:29,733
Guys, the Buy More's been rebuilt, and nobody
thinks that you burned it down. It's okay.

354
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:30,743
What are you talking about?

355
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:32,933
Cars have been following us for months.

356
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:36,273
How do you know they weren't
just driving behind you?

357
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,593
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

358
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:43,543
You came all this way just
to offer us our jobs back?

359
00:22:43,703 --> 00:22:46,753
- You're seven minutes from Burbank with traffic.
- No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

360
00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:50,333
I see what's happening
here, Jeffrey. For some unknown reason,

361
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,233
they need us.

362
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:57,233
- We have leverage.
- It's time to negotiate. All right.

363
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:59,593
If we take our jobs back?

364
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,703
We want a raise and perks.

365
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:10,163
The company car and three
kilos?? gluten-free biscotti.

366
00:23:14,053 --> 00:23:16,773
I think my water just broke.

367
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:36,843
This is truly one of the most
degrading things I've ever done.

368
00:23:37,003 --> 00:23:38,473
Look, I know you'd rather be on
a mission with Chuck and Sarah,

369
00:23:38,643 --> 00:23:40,573
but your whole life
doesn't have to be missions.

370
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:44,043
I was talking to Alex the other day, and she
said she hadn't heard from you in a while.

371
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:46,363
Why are you talking to my daughter?

372
00:23:46,513 --> 00:23:50,063
More importantly, why
aren't you talking to her?

373
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:57,793
Well, she has her mom, friends, whole
life. I just don't fit in.

374
00:23:57,973 --> 00:24:00,133
You're not gonna if you don't try.

375
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:15,493
Devon. Need some help?

376
00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:17,303
No. No, no, no, I'm good.

377
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:20,553
Just shopping, but I was in the Buy More.

378
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:23,673
Everyone there was
super-attractive and highly skilled.

379
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:26,413
It was like I work there.

380
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:29,263
But why would I work in the Buy More?

381
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:32,783
Unless I was a spy.

382
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:36,333
Devon, you know that Casey
and I are still spies,

383
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:39,203
and the Buy More is still a cover, but
Chuck has nothing to do with it.

384
00:24:39,423 --> 00:24:41,903
Exactly. I'm out, bro.

385
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:45,493
I know. I know, man. I'm
sorry I questioned you.

386
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:51,023
And I know I've been going a little overboard
lately, but it's just really important for Ellie,

387
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:55,363
you know, to know that everyone who
is here is really here for her now.

388
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:56,993
Okay, that everything's normal.

389
00:24:57,193 --> 00:25:01,803
Yeah, tot? Totally normal.

390
00:25:02,073 --> 00:25:04,673
Normal, as the Spanish would say.

391
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:09,243
- Not irregular.
- Thank you. All right.

392
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:17,163
- Let me help.
- No, babe, I got it.

393
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:18,923
You don't lift a finger.

394
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,973
- What is all this?
- Just a few sleep machines.

395
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:25,463
You know, rain forest sounds, white
noise, dolphin chatter, the yoozh.

396
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:28,763
That's very sweet of you, honey, but
you've already done so much already.

397
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:31,443
I mean, look at the
apartment. You have two bassinets,

398
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,563
we have a kitchen full
of baby vegan food.

399
00:25:34,773 --> 00:25:36,763
Sweetheart, we are not vegan.

400
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,363
But we could be.

401
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,023
I just want to know what's
really going on here.

402
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,363
We both know that you're not
good at letting people help you.

403
00:25:44,573 --> 00:25:47,963
Oh, you've practically raised
Chuck on your own since your mom?

404
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:53,323
- So this is about my mom?
- No! What? No.

405
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:56,333
Devon, you are the
worst liar in the world.

406
00:25:56,533 --> 00:25:58,493
Just tell me. Is this about my mom?

407
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:01,443
Yes.

408
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:04,713
I just don't want you to feel
like anyone or anything is missing.

409
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:06,303
Well, I don't want you
to be worried about me.

410
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:08,893
I don't feel like anything is missing.

411
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:12,813
I didn't need my mom when I was a
teenager, I didn't need her in med school,

412
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:15,413
and I don't need her now, okay?

413
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:20,883
You and Chuck are the
only family that I need.

414
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:22,373
Okay.

415
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:25,303
So let's make a deal.

416
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:29,783
I will let you help me, but you
have to let me pitch in, too.

417
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:32,963
We're better as a team.

418
00:26:37,093 --> 00:26:38,523
Don't do that.

419
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:40,033
What?

420
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:42,223
Don't unpack, please.

421
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:44,983
If you do it now, it's only gonna
be because we were talking about it,

422
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:46,503
and I don't want you to
do it because of that.

423
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:49,703
I want you to do it when you feel
comfortable here, when you feel at home.

424
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,263
I do feel comfortable here.

425
00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:55,333
It just? It doesn't come
naturally to me, putting roots down.

426
00:26:55,593 --> 00:26:56,983
I know.

427
00:26:57,503 --> 00:26:58,893
You were always on
the run with your dad,

428
00:26:59,113 --> 00:27:03,183
and being a spy doesn't make
it easy to make a home anywhere.

429
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,793
I understand.

430
00:27:04,983 --> 00:27:06,823
It's just what you're used to.

431
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:11,263
But I love you because we're different.

432
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:17,983
And one dress is not
going to make or break us.

433
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:24,393
One dress.

434
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:26,723
What?

435
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:30,633
Sofia unpacked everything except
for that one sequined dress.

436
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:32,623
Right, she put it in a suitcase.

437
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:34,243
Haven't we seen that dress before?

438
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:35,533
On the security cam footage.

439
00:27:35,743 --> 00:27:39,343
Why would a model wear the same dress
twice when she has a closet full of options?

440
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:41,633
Because maybe it's not just a dress.

441
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:44,403
Beckman said the technology was
in the microchip, not the bullet.

442
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:45,433
What if the chips??

443
00:27:45,653 --> 00:27:46,953
Are hidden in the dress.
The sequins?

444
00:27:47,153 --> 00:27:49,483
And when Fashion Week ends, she's
gonna slip the dress through customs.

445
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:51,903
Through one of the collections. That
means she's still in Milan.

446
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:53,703
Closing night is tomorrow night.

447
00:27:53,813 --> 00:27:55,553
We need to get back there right now.

448
00:27:55,818 --> 00:27:57,703
Well, it's a good thing
we're already packed.

449
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:19,340
If Sofia is hiding the dress
in one of those collections,

450
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,500
it should be in one
of the backstage areas.

451
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,220
Yeah, I'm gonna guess it's that one.

452
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,610
Those look like our men.

453
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,830
- You think this plan will really work?
- Absolutely. Watch me.

454
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:36,930
Signore, signore. Buona sera.

455
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,250
It's a pleasure to meet you.

456
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,710
It's a pleasure. Pleasure.

457
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,050
My name is Charles Carmichael, and I know that's
got to be very confusing for you right now,

458
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:44,990
so let me explain.

459
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,330
I'm actually the guy that you're
looking for, and unfortunately for you,

460
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,680
I'm gonna need the dress
that's right behind that door.

461
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,960
And good night.

462
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,130
Well, that went better
than I thought it would.

463
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,460
What?

464
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,550
You don't have any faith
in my tranq gloves? Come on.

465
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,190
I'm pretty proud of them.

466
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,600
Okay, you take that side.

467
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,290
The rack, okay. And you go? Okay.

468
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,190
Excuse me.

469
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,550
Okay, we need to be quick, remember.

470
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,080
Going as fast as I can. There's
a lot of dresses here.

471
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,330
None of those.

472
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,540
- Bingo. Bingo. Check it out. Found it.
- Good

473
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,150
I just got to say this
this was a great idea.

474
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,380
I mean, as far as missions. Best ever.

475
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:42,680
- Zip?- Of course, yes. You hold, and I
zip bada-bing. Slip it back into this.

476
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,830
And Bob's your uncle.

477
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,550
- Bra. - Of course. Strapless dress.
What was I thinking? Okay.

478
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,030
- Let's go home.
- Shall we?

479
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,510
Try in here.

480
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,820
Okay, slight problem.

481
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,240
Here, go.

482
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,080
I love you, Sarah.

483
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,650
Chuck!

484
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,010
I think you got something of mine.

485
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,440
Drop it.

486
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,840
Five on one. Five on
one. Yeah, not the greatest odds.

487
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,000
I get it. I get it.

488
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,260
You messed things up with Miss Sofia.

489
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,260
No, I didn't mess up anything
with Miss Sofia, okay?

490
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,920
You really didn't stand a chance.

491
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,490
She's cold and distant
and-and? Here we go.

492
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,190
That's not? Could you hold
that just for a second?

493
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,980
That's what I'm looking for.

494
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,490
You slapped me.

495
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,250
Well?

496
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,050
Red is a good look for you.

497
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,470
It distracts from your face.

498
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,846
I assure you, General, my
cover is still intact.

499
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:46,046
I know.

500
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:48,646
The two of you acted
quickly and intelligently.

501
00:33:48,846 --> 00:33:49,876
And because of your efforts,

502
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:55,386
we recovered the smart bullet guidance chips
and put one of Volkoff's key sellers behind bars.

503
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:02,016
It feels good to be back at work.

504
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:03,996
Feels good to be home.

505
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:11,796
I made you a protein
shake with baby boost, babe.

506
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:12,796
Thanks, honey.

507
00:34:12,986 --> 00:34:14,476
I'm actually headed out, though.

508
00:34:14,676 --> 00:34:18,026
My husband bought sleep
machines in excess the other day,

509
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:19,836
so I'm heading to the
Buy More to return them.

510
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:21,326
No!

511
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,516
I mean? It's totally my fault.

512
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:24,386
I should return them.

513
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:26,186
Honey, I think I can handle it.

514
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:29,956
We're a team, remember?

515
00:34:31,026 --> 00:34:32,866
Right, absolutely.

516
00:34:32,886 --> 00:34:35,636
Don't feel like you got to
spend a ton of time there.

517
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:37,546
- Hurry home.
- All right.

518
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:45,306
Devon.

519
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:47,676
Dude, the hen has left the nest.

520
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:51,296
- The hen? What?
- Ellie is en route to the Buy More.

521
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:54,626
- Okay. - Bro, I know we talked about
this, and I know you're not a spy.

522
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:58,046
But is Ellie going to believe
that when she sees the new Buy more?

523
00:35:00,116 --> 00:35:01,386
Electronics, roll left.

524
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,196
Entertainment, right.

525
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,046
Okay.

526
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:33,546
- Welcome to the new Buy More. - Yeah, what's going on?
This place seems so strange.

527
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:34,976
You know what it could be? The,

528
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:37,786
the current corporate restructuring
that's going on right now.

529
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:39,376
Everybody's just kind of, you know?

530
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:40,866
Excuse me. Sorry.

531
00:35:41,046 --> 00:35:44,146
The restructuring has
actually been restructured, so.

532
00:35:44,296 --> 00:35:48,536
Although it may appear a bit off, I
can assure you that the Buy More is,

533
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:50,466
well, the Buy More.

534
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:27,806
Can one of you help me?

535
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,266
No.

536
00:36:31,696 --> 00:36:33,636
We're on break.

537
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,806
Rumor has it you're pregnant.

538
00:36:40,986 --> 00:36:43,786
- Is there room in that womb for two?
- Run along, Jeff.

539
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:45,476
Let me know.

540
00:36:46,476 --> 00:36:48,206
Some things will never change.

541
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:50,006
Well, I'm still here to help.

542
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:52,276
Told you. Just like normal.

543
00:36:54,786 --> 00:36:57,436
- Mr. Grimes.
- Diane.

544
00:36:58,866 --> 00:36:59,586
General.

545
00:36:59,746 --> 00:37:02,776
My superiors have been monitoring
the Buy More since it reopened.

546
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:06,906
And they believe your additions
have made for an airtight cover.

547
00:37:07,086 --> 00:37:09,066
I think you have earned this.

548
00:37:09,316 --> 00:37:11,486
Thank you so much.

549
00:37:11,716 --> 00:37:12,506
Yeah.

550
00:37:13,716 --> 00:37:16,676
- What have I earned, exactly?
- The keys to the Buy More.

551
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:19,996
I'm making you store manager, Mr. Grimes.

552
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:20,976
Wait. I'm sorry.

553
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,566
I think what you meant to say
was assistant store manager.

554
00:37:23,756 --> 00:37:25,566
Don't make me regret this.

555
00:37:28,656 --> 00:37:30,076
I'm manager?

556
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:33,396
I'm manager?

557
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:35,896
Congratulations, Grimes.

558
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:41,966
- Guys?
- What, Morgan? We're trying to relax here, man.

559
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,486
Drinks on me tonight!

560
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:47,176
- Thank you, buddy! Thank you!
- Well drinks. Well drinks.

561
00:37:47,386 --> 00:37:48,796
And-And happy hour.

562
00:37:49,176 --> 00:37:50,536
Same old Morgan.

563
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:54,046
Do you want to come get
a drink with us, big guy?

564
00:37:54,246 --> 00:37:56,366
No, I have some mission
prep I have to take care of.

565
00:37:56,616 --> 00:38:03,626
Casey? How's Burbank ever going to feel
likeome if you don't give it a chance?

566
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:08,906
Yeah. The Buy More may be
your home, but it's not mine.

567
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:16,646
Alex?

568
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:18,566
It's me.

569
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:20,046
Dad.

570
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:24,536
Good to hear your voice, too.

571
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:56,806
So I'm mixing it up a bit
tonight, and we're going sparkling.

572
00:39:57,676 --> 00:39:59,066
It's official.

573
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:00,576
What's official?

574
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:05,286
- You didn't have to?
- I wanted to.

575
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:09,716
I've never had a real home, and
I wanted this to feel like one.

576
00:40:10,896 --> 00:40:12,286
Let me help you.

577
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:18,456
What's this?

578
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:23,956
That's just something that I like
to keep in my suitcase at all times.

579
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:35,476
Whether I'm in Portugal, or Russia, or
Burbank, this, makes me feel comfortable, safe.

580
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:39,126
Look, I know that it's probably
taken me longer than a normal girl,

581
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:43,786
but you should know that
you're my home, Chuck.

582
00:40:44,906 --> 00:40:47,346
You always have been.

583
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:12,946
What?

584
00:41:13,836 --> 00:41:15,166
Nothing.

585
00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:17,486
Nothing. Just some?

586
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:22,746
Some stupid thing that
Morgan said, that's all.

587
00:41:23,396 --> 00:41:25,026
What did he say?

588
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:27,166
You can tell me.

589
00:41:29,006 --> 00:41:32,176
He said that just when you think
your relationship is perfect,

590
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:38,406
then you find your Achilles' heel, the
thing that's going to destroy it.

591
00:41:39,136 --> 00:41:41,966
- You thought ours was the suitcase?
- It's a stupid theory.

592
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:43,606
It's-It's nonsense. It's Morgan.

593
00:41:43,806 --> 00:41:45,086
Who are we kidding?

594
00:41:45,446 --> 00:41:47,286
We don't have an Achilles' heel.

595
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:52,776
We have a real future ahead of us.

596
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:07,146
Maybe Awesome's right.

597
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:10,086
You know, marriage, baby?

598
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,676
Who knows? Maybe we're next.
