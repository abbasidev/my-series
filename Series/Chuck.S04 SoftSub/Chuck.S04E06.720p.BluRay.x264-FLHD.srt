1
00:00:01,882 --> 00:00:04,173
Hey, I'm Chuck. Here are a few
things that you might need to know

2
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:05,473
or maybe you just forgot.

3
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:08,434
I have to find the truth, Morgan.
Why my mom left, why she never came back.

4
00:00:08,435 --> 00:00:09,823
This is my search.

5
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:11,893
This is all I could find.

6
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:14,823
I thought she was a prisoner
who needed to be saved.

7
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:17,554
Then I come to find out she's
just one of the bad guys.

8
00:00:21,174 --> 00:00:26,634
- Hello.
- Hello, Chuck, it's your mother.

9
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:33,564
VOLKOFF INDUSTWERIES Tow Weeks Ago.

10
00:00:50,494 --> 00:00:53,384
What are you doing back
here? This is a secured area.

11
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:58,493
Oh, I-I'm sorry, I was just
looking for the, uh, fitness center.

12
00:00:58,494 --> 00:01:00,563
I'll, I'll just be on my way, then.

13
00:01:00,564 --> 00:01:02,484
You're not going anywhere.

14
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:04,233
Show me your security ID..

15
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:08,824
No need to be rough, I... Aah!

16
00:01:13,714 --> 00:01:14,624
What is this?

17
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,794
I see your hands are shaking.

18
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,534
That means the toxin is taking effect.

19
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:28,383
It's flooding your brain now, turning your
entire consciousness into one gigantic nightmare.

20
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:35,024
The only difference is, this
nightmare you never wake up from.

21
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:44,403
As you can see...

22
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,753
my toxin is fully functional.

23
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:49,264
Impressive, isn't it?

24
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:54,534
Very impressive, Dr. Wheelwright.

25
00:01:56,884 --> 00:02:02,894
I believe I have a buyer in Los Angeles
who will be very interested in this.

26
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:06,704
ECHO PARK, CA Tonight.

27
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:15,894
- Hello.
- Hello, Chuck, it's your mother.

28
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:19,354
I want to see you in person.

29
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:21,054
Is this a joke?

30
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:23,603
Griffith Park, one hour.

31
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:25,373
Is this, is this, is this a joke?

32
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:30,213
Mom, you have any idea how long I've been
looking for you these last couple of months?

33
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:32,253
Where have you been since
I was nine years old?

34
00:02:32,254 --> 00:02:34,463
Chuck, now is not the time.

35
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:40,334
Just meet me. Tell no one. Come alone.

36
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:43,624
Okay, bye.

37
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:49,833
Hey, Ellie's putting out dessert.

38
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:53,134
If you don't come in soon, I'm
gonna eat it and blame it on Morgan.

39
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:56,874
What's the matter? You look
like you've seen a ghost.

40
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,864
I just talked to one.

41
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:15,594
I had a feeling you wouldn't show up.

42
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:28,654
I had to make sure you came alone.

43
00:03:30,474 --> 00:03:31,554
I did everything you asked.

44
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,363
Why all the secrecy?

45
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:34,914
I know you've been working for Volkoff.

46
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,653
You afraid the bad guys are going to
see you hanging around your own son?

47
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:41,584
Oh, it's much more
complicated than that, Chuck.

48
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:43,744
Meet me at the playground.

49
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,044
You just hate saying good-bye
like a normal person, don't you?

50
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:05,264
Okay, Chuck, I'm in position.

51
00:04:09,154 --> 00:04:11,834
And who are you?

52
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:14,474
Wow.

53
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:17,984
I didn't even hear a twig snap.

54
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:21,673
You must have been doing
this for a long time.

55
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:23,944
Are you calling me old?

56
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:25,764
Not old.

57
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:29,513
Just slow.

58
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,403
Government-issued sidearm.

59
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,524
What are you.
CIA, FBI?

60
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:38,693
My story is not as interesting as
yours, so we'll start with you first.

61
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:40,094
Why did Volkoff send you here?

62
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:42,643
Oh, jumping to conclusions, are we?

63
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:45,613
Oh, I think my conclusions
are pretty justified.

64
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:47,293
I am here because I need to see...

65
00:04:47,294 --> 00:04:50,934
Whoa, hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey
there.

66
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:52,794
How you guys doing?

67
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:55,033
You brought someone. I
told you to come alone.

68
00:04:55,034 --> 00:04:57,093
No, no, no, no, technically
not just someone.

69
00:04:57,094 --> 00:04:59,854
Okay, Mom, this is my girlfriend Sarah.

70
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:04,254
Sarah, this is my mom Mary.

71
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:08,464
I don't know how to say this
exactly, but please don't kill each other.

72
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,310
Chuck 4x06 - Versus the Aisle of Terror

73
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:59,225
Great, great. See, I can see
the connection already.

74
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,535
BFF. Facebook buddies.

75
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,139
I'll shut up now. I'll shut up.

76
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,850
Did you honestly think
he wouldn't come alone?

77
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:07,629
I thought maybe he would trust me.

78
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,720
Okay, you know what? Considering
that you left me when I was,

79
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:13,019
oh, I don't know, nine years old, and I
still don't know if you're good or bad,

80
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,540
I think I have every right to have
a mother issue or two right now.

81
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,480
You're right.

82
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,459
You are absolutely right.

83
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,669
Thank you, thank you. No
shooting necessary.

84
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,029
None whatsoever. Great, good, here we go.

85
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,200
Fully hanging out. What should we do?

86
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:32,290
Should we... should we sit down?

87
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,320
- I know a wonderful bakery, actually...
- Chuck...

88
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:35,630
Or we could just hang out here in a...

89
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:37,919
in a creepy, dark playground.

90
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,269
Where to start? Ooh, ooh, I
know, I got a story.

91
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,519
Tenth birthday-you
haven't even heard this one...

92
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,290
I ate so much chocolate cake, I
had frosting coming out of my nose.

93
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,650
- I could smell it for a year...
- Chuck, Chuck, stop!

94
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,220
I don't want to know anything about you.

95
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,929
- Excuse me? - I am deep undercover
in the Volkoff organization.

96
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,779
And if my cover is blown, they
will torture me for secrets.

97
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,219
I don't want to know one thing about you
or your sister that could put you in danger.

98
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,869
So just leave it at that.

99
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,410
You're undercover?

100
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,119
That's funny, because we didn't find
any files on you in the CIA database.

101
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,699
No, you wouldn't.

102
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,879
When I went undercover
my records were expunged.

103
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,460
That's convenient.

104
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,040
And how do we know that
you're not making this up?

105
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,310
Because I brought you this.

106
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,180
Atroxium.

107
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,709
A nerve gas that causes extreme
terror in its victims and,

108
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,149
within minutes, drives
them completely insane.

109
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:36,559
The scientist Wheelwright who created it wants
to meet Volkoff's must trusted weapons buyer.

110
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,729
Chuck, I need you to pose as that buyer.

111
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,919
Atroxium is dangerous, far too
dangerous to be on the open market.

112
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,849
One warhead of this could
debilitate an entire army.

113
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,240
I had to break cover so that I could
make sure that the CIA gets hold of this.

114
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,269
Okay, fine. Why me?

115
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,390
Because I thought I could trust you.

116
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,260
- Just say you flashed on him.
- Did I...?

117
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,610
I'm sorry, what? You know
about the Intersect?

118
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:04,619
I may not know anything about you, Chuck,

119
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,450
but I know everything there is
to know about Charles Carmichael.

120
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,230
We're done here.

121
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,620
Set up the meet.

122
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:17,540
I'll make sure the
CIA gets the nerve gas.

123
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,910
Good-bye, Chuck.

124
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,140
Good-bye.

125
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,599
Hello. Welcome to the Buy More.

126
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,309
And be sure to stop by this weekend and check
out our Halloween haunted house spectacular.

127
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,789
It's going to be scary.

128
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,680
Good scary, though. Like
pumpkins and ghosts.

129
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:43,910
Not bad scary like war and bears.

130
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,320
You know, 'cause I
find... Oh, good day, sir.

131
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:47,880
Welcome to the Buy More.

132
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,010
Coming in a little hot
today, aren't you, Grimes?

133
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:53,480
It's tough. Once I turn on the charisma, I
can't turn it off. It's my curse.

134
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,449
Listen - that little incident
in Iran showed me something.

135
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,480
You're either exceptionally
smart or incredibly stupid.

136
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,450
My father used to say
the exact same thing.

137
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:04,940
Without the smart part. But you get it.

138
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:07,750
The whole situation has
me thinking that maybe...

139
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,440
just maybe, you do have
something to offer as a spy.

140
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,320
This is what I've been
telling you guys. I-I...

141
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:15,000
Come on. Bartowski has
something to show us.

142
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,260
Thanks.

143
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,330
Sarah, you know I have a
huge blind spot with my mom.

144
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,970
I mean, are we crazy for doing this?

145
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:28,750
Should we even be getting involved?

146
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,260
I know that you've been looking for
answers about your mom for a long time,

147
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:38,760
and we're going to find some, okay? We
just have to be very cautious.

148
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,270
Thank you.

149
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,260
Just got your message. What's happening?

150
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:45,159
Good. You're all here.

151
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,529
Bartowski, your flash on
Wheelwright was 100% correct.

152
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,740
He is currently in Los
Angeles to sell the Atroxium.

153
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,039
I'm sorry. What is Grimes doing here?

154
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,789
Oh, uh, he's with me, General.

155
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,770
I felt that he could be
of some use to the team.

156
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:00,759
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

157
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,489
Apparently I'm quite the hot
commodity in the spy world.

158
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,659
Morgan Grimes.
Not just for the ladies anymore.

159
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,729
Silence.

160
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,459
- Of course.
- Good.

161
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,929
Now we need to focus.

162
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,349
Atroxium is extremely dangerous.

163
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,939
Uh, General, Sarah and I
were discussing a plan.

164
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,829
Um... if I were to pose as the buyer, not only would
I be able to get the Atroxium off the market,

165
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,339
I could also flash on any Volkoff
operatives that were involved.

166
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,099
So it's a... it's a win-win.

167
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,279
Very impressive, Bartowski.

168
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,810
We'll set up the meet.

169
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,400
Good work, Chuck.

170
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,460
I smell a rat.

171
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,339
- I found her-I
found my mom. - What?

172
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,539
You found your
mom? That's fantastic, dude.

173
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,630
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thanks. Thanks so much, man.

174
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:46,769
- I still can't believe it myself.
- When? Where?

175
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,870
Well, she actually came to
me with the Wheelwright info.

176
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,800
Chuck, your mother works for Volkoff.

177
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:52,469
Which is her cover, Casey.

178
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,790
- She's legit. - Better run it by Beckman.
Make sure it checks out.

179
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,299
I've checked, and it's a dead end.

180
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,500
Her CIA credentials were
erased to protect her cover.

181
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,600
We have to keep this to ourselves. Okay?

182
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:03,680
If Beckman goes digging, she
could put my mom in danger.

183
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:05,310
You just have to trust me on this.

184
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,920
Devon, your two little ladies are home!

185
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,910
Hey, babe...

186
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,589
Little babe. What are you doing, huh?

187
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,469
We rushed home early so we
could get a few moments of peace

188
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,050
before your mother gets here
and makes my life a living...

189
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,799
- Hello!...
- Heaven.

190
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,029
It's just a heavenly visit
every time she's here.

191
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,249
- Ellie!
- Hi, Honey! It's really good to see you.

192
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,380
What were you doing back there?

193
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:39,559
Oh, just a little dusting.

194
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,399
We have to keep this place clean
for my little granddaughter-to-be.

195
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:49,469
Aw. So I just thought I'd try
tidying up a bit... as a surprise.

196
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,649
- Surprise.
- Mom has another surprise for us, too.

197
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,650
She cancelled the room that
we booked for her at the W.

198
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:56,430
And she's gonna spending
the whole week with us.

199
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:59,899
The whole week! That, that's great!

200
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,769
I know! I can't believe it either.

201
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,319
Oh, here, darling, let
me take that from you.

202
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,159
Okay.

203
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,570
Are you sure you're okay with this?

204
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:11,179
Because if not, I can bite the bullet
and I can ask her to stay at the hotel.

205
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,939
Uh, no, you don't have to
do that. She should stay.

206
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,030
- You sure? Y.
- Eah. Yeah.

207
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,180
I felt the baby kick on the way home.

208
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:20,809
- Oh, my God, really?
- Yeah.

209
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,690
It's starting to feel so real, you know?

210
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,160
I'm gonna be a mom.

211
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,940
I don't know how to be a mom.

212
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:27,590
Of course you do.

213
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,849
You know, your mother and I aren't best
friends, but it might be nice to have her around.

214
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,440
You know, I could use a
little motherly advice.

215
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,530
- I'll go make up the guest room.
- Okay.

216
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,690
I could stay at the W.

217
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,380
You wanted to see me, boss?

218
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:51,960
One second, buddy.

219
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,810
Everything okay?

220
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:03,000
Just a bit overwhelmed
right now, you know?

221
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,080
Work stuff, and, uh...

222
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:07,380
I promised Chuck that I would
help him with something...

223
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,510
Can I ask you a
question? How do you do it?

224
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:11,970
How do you balance the Buy More
and your regular life?'Cause I...

225
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:16,199
Son, in my 12-and-a-half weeks at
the El Segundo School of Finance,

226
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,659
I learned one very important
word: Hmm?"delegate.

227
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,379
" That word is the key to
being a successful manager.

228
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,579
There's even a catchy phrase
for when you got too much to do:

229
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,549
"Get it off your plate, give
it to other people."

230
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,189
I think what you mean to say is:
"Get it off your plate, delegate.

231
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,339
" No, I do not.

232
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,759
You are not a rhyming
monkey, you are a manager.

233
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,729
You're right. Of course, you're
absolutely right.

234
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,150
And thank you for the offer.

235
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:43,700
I would love for you to dress
the Buy More for Halloween.

236
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,119
No, no, I do not have time for that.

237
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,659
I am knee-deep in this
new Danielle Steele novel.

238
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,580
Anyway, Big Mike isn't nearly scary
enough to build a haunted house.

239
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,070
And you need to put some
real crazies on that...

240
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,870
if you want it done correctly.

241
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,559
Good afternoon, Mr. Carmichael.

242
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,229
I'll show you to your table.

243
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,020
That would be perfect, thank you.

244
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,340
We just got word that
Wheelwright is en route.

245
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:30,919
Remember, cool, calm and collected.

246
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,640
You are Volkoff's top weapons buyer.

247
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,240
Just one question: can we get one of
those hostess outfits for back home?

248
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,949
Focus, Bartowski. The grownups
are trying to work here.

249
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,420
So sorry I'm late.

250
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,039
- You weren't here
already? - Ha-ha. Nice.

251
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,260
I love our little
give-and-take.

252
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,759
Classic Ross and Rachel.

253
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,509
Okay, what can I do to help?

254
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,290
- Grimes?
- Yeah?

255
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,719
A good spy is trained
in the art of silence.

256
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,840
Silence. Got it.

257
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,570
Chuck, don't fill up on bread. You're
gonna ruin your appetite.

258
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,900
Sorry. Don't...

259
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,680
Target is approaching. Give the signal.

260
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,549
Uh... Mr. Carmichael?

261
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,070
Please, sit. Make yourself comfortable.

262
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,230
So, um...

263
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,830
do we talk price?

264
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,819
Dr. Wheelwright, relax.

265
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,120
I'm about to make you
a very, very rich man.

266
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,730
Would you care for a
drink to calm the nerves?

267
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,710
Toasting already?

268
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,380
What's going on there, Walker?

269
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:56,789
That's Chuck's mother.

270
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,460
What's she doing there?

271
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,880
You must be Mr. Carmichael.

272
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,050
Chuck, remember, keep your
cover and make the deal.

273
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,280
I am Mr. Carmichael. And who might you be?

274
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,440
I work for Volkoff.

275
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:15,869
It's my job to ensure
a smooth transaction.

276
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,749
Smooth? Smooth? Is that right?

277
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,440
Well, this transaction
couldn't be going smoother.

278
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,769
It is chock full of smoothness.

279
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,499
Yes, the transaction was
progressing just fine.

280
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,040
Well, it may appear that way, but sometimes
appearances don't tell the whole story.

281
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,719
I've done some digging
on Mr. Carmichael here,

282
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,790
and unfortunately his
story doesn't check out.

283
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,139
It's a CIA trap. He's a spy.

284
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,450
What?

285
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,220
Man down! Man down! Walker, get in there!

286
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,729
Whoa! Holy...

287
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,920
Chuck, you okay? Chuck?

288
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,080
Chuck!

289
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,230
- Chuck, are you okay?
- Sarah...

290
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,570
My mom shot me.

291
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:37,955
My heart hurts.

292
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,225
I know. I can't believe your
mom betrayed you like that.

293
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,034
No, no, my heart actually hurts.

294
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:43,844
She shot me in the heart area.

295
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:45,154
Oh, okay. Here.

296
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:50,004
Thank you. Ah!

297
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:51,844
Oh, I'm such an idiot, Sarah.

298
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:56,594
After everything I knew about my mom, everything I
learned about my mom, I still trusted her anyway.

299
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:58,975
That's really great spy work.

300
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:04,004
You know, Chuck, even in the spy world
where everything is run by deceit,

301
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:07,484
you still manage to somehow
genuinely trust people.

302
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,655
You know what? That's
what I love about you.

303
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:13,135
That's what you love about me?

304
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:16,724
Not my dashing good looks or
the giant computer in my brain?

305
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:20,325
And you're funny, even if your
mom has shot you in the heart.

306
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,285
Oh, two fugitives and a
dangerous weapon on the loose.

307
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:25,385
Go, team.

308
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:29,214
Well, you know, we could go back to the
restaurant, see if they left any clues behind.

309
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:31,684
No, no. We got this.

310
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:34,064
Dude, you just got shot by your mom, okay?

311
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:36,465
Take a break. Have a little Chuck time.

312
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,065
Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe I should.

313
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:41,504
Sorry.

314
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:42,455
Spy work or the Buy More?

315
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,545
HELP

316
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:45,435
Nah.

317
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:49,414
I don't know. What about there?

318
00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:52,064
And then it could come swinging
and screaming at everybody.

319
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,334
Oh, Morgo, hey.

320
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:57,464
Um, listen, we have a few questions
regarding these Halloween decorations.

321
00:18:57,465 --> 00:19:00,565
Um, what are we allowed to show?

322
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:01,875
What do you mean?

323
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:05,844
I know a really good morgue that gives
discounts on unclaimed merchandise.

324
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,444
Maybe we could sprinkle
some cold, dead ones in here.

325
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:10,554
Right. No, I'm gonna say
no on the dead bodies.

326
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:13,614
- So, what, I just lose my deposit?
- Shh...

327
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:16,105
Okay, look, here's the thing: I put
you in charge of decorating the store

328
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:19,634
so I can get it off my plate, so you're just
gonna have to figure it out for me, okay?

329
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:20,805
Make it big, make it fun.

330
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:23,665
But most importantly, let's
make it scary, okay?

331
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:28,475
Morgan's right.

332
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:34,284
We gotta tap into a place
that is so scary, so demented,

333
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:37,134
that it'll change
Halloween as we know it.

334
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,455
We gotta tap...

335
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:43,285
into your head!

336
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:45,635
Okay.

337
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,565
Yeah, you gotta start using
conditioner. Your hair feels like hay.

338
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,825
- Get in.
- Are you crazy?

339
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:07,614
You know, I didn't think you could top abandoning
me for the last 20 years, and then you shot me!

340
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:13,705
And I will do it again, if you
don't get in this car right now.

341
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:23,214
That's every bus station, subway platform and traffic
light camera within a mile radius of the restaurant.

342
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:26,774
We have no lead on where Wheelwright and
Chuck's mom fled to after the shooting.

343
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:28,514
Come on.

344
00:20:28,515 --> 00:20:30,415
What rock are you two hiding under?

345
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:35,055
Chuck just activated
his tracking device.

346
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:52,614
Mom, you hit one pothole and this
ride gets very messy very quick.

347
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:56,754
Oh, I'm sorry. Have to
keep up appearances.

348
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,114
Oh. Oh, is that all?

349
00:20:58,115 --> 00:21:00,214
What the heck is going on here, okay?

350
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:01,085
This is crazy.

351
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:07,784
Chuck, when I left you and Ellie, I was embedded
into a secret operation called Project Isis.

352
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:11,345
My mission was to destroy the
Volkoff Organization from within.

353
00:21:12,225 --> 00:21:13,754
But I got in way too deep.

354
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:16,984
And I was forced to close
the door on my old life.

355
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,614
But then you came looking for me.

356
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:20,545
And that set off the alarm bells.

357
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,494
Right. So you shot me?

358
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:26,544
I knew that you were wearing a vest.

359
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:29,414
Volkoff was tapped into the
security footage of the cafe,

360
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:33,044
so he thinks that Charles
Carmichael is dead.

361
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:35,255
And that means you and Ellie are safe.

362
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:40,005
You did this to protect me and Ellie?

363
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:46,515
Chuck, you and your sister are and
always have been my only concern.

364
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:53,475
Not being in your lives has pained
me more than you could ever imagine.

365
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:55,985
But you had a mission.

366
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:08,424
I constantly relive that day
when I walked out the door.

367
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:09,814
Over and over.

368
00:22:09,815 --> 00:22:15,785
And I want you to know that if I could
do it over again, I never would have left.

369
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:19,855
I would still be there, with my family.

370
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,584
But that's all in the past.

371
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:24,804
So come with me.

372
00:22:24,805 --> 00:22:29,285
'Cause I never got you a
present for your tenth birthday.

373
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:31,495
Come on.

374
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,165
Come on.

375
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:46,355
See, I knew that if I shot you, Wheelwright might
panic and try to unload the weapon on his own.

376
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:53,284
But Atroxium is far too dangerous, so
I just went ahead and handled it.

377
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:56,235
Handle-Handle-How did
you handle it, exactly?

378
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,105
This is Wheelwright's mobile lab.

379
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:05,754
He's tranq'd up inside, and the
Atroxium's ready for extraction.

380
00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:08,994
And, Chuck, sorry I shot you.

381
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:12,595
Hey, it's okay. No harm, no foul.

382
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:16,904
- Oh, God. Mom...
- I know.

383
00:23:16,905 --> 00:23:20,044
You activated your tracking
device when you got in the car.

384
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:21,275
Good boy.

385
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:33,835
Okay, come on, Chuck's signal
is coming from in there.

386
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,194
Agents will be here any second.

387
00:23:37,195 --> 00:23:38,935
You're going to vanish
for good now, aren't you?

388
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:41,174
I did what I came here to do.

389
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:44,664
And now you and Ellie are safe, and
I've got to go back undercover.

390
00:23:44,665 --> 00:23:45,815
Okay, okay, fine.

391
00:23:45,816 --> 00:23:50,354
But, listen, before you disappear, please, go
and talk to Ellie, just for a second.

392
00:23:50,355 --> 00:23:53,184
Just-Just tell her what you
told me about why you left us.

393
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:54,615
200 meters.

394
00:23:58,165 --> 00:23:59,615
I'm sorry.

395
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:02,865
I'm sorry, Chuck.

396
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:09,965
Mom, Ellie's pregnant.

397
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:13,735
She's pregnant, and you're
going to be a grandmother.

398
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:21,825
We're getting closer. 80 meters.

399
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:47,505
Chuck, how'd you get here?

400
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:51,915
My mom dropped me off.

401
00:25:00,661 --> 00:25:05,302
Well, she may be a bad mom, but
she makes a great spy, right?

402
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:09,147
Either way, I guess it
doesn't matter. She's gone.

403
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:11,616
- You okay?
- Yeah.

404
00:25:11,617 --> 00:25:14,326
I...I'm just wondering
what to tell my sister.

405
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:17,196
I mean, do I casually drop
that Mom came back to town to

406
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:20,466
shoot me in the chest and hand
over a deadly chemical weapon?

407
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:23,187
Well, I know that you'll figure
out the exact right thing to say.

408
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:33,396
Lucky for me, I know the foremost
authority on all things Ellie Bartowski.

409
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:35,527
I'm gonna be right back. You
save some of that fun for me.

410
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:37,267
I will.

411
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:40,857
I don't trust her.

412
00:25:41,047 --> 00:25:44,126
If Bartowski's mom's working for
the good guys, then why disappear?

413
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,616
I don't know. But Chuck believes her.

414
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:47,876
Yeah.

415
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:51,796
I know a decommissioned NSA
agent, specializes in expunged documents.

416
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:54,906
Unsavory character, but I think
he can get us what we need.

417
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:56,437
You want backup?

418
00:25:57,917 --> 00:25:59,097
No.

419
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:00,427
I got someone.

420
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:02,986
I knew it. I knew Mrs. B
wasn't a bad guy. You know why?

421
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:04,717
Bad guys don't make such
delicious lemon bars.

422
00:26:04,718 --> 00:26:05,677
Killer brownies, too.

423
00:26:05,678 --> 00:26:09,616
Look, I need your advice for this Mor.
Hey, ah!

424
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:14,087
Oh! Oh! What the...?

425
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:24,366
Wow.

426
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:26,257
They did it. Jeff and
Lester pulled it off, man.

427
00:26:26,258 --> 00:26:27,227
This looks great.

428
00:26:27,228 --> 00:26:30,486
Guys, hey, excellent work with
the Halloween decorations.

429
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:31,977
The store looks incredible.

430
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,146
This garbage? No, no, no.

431
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:38,216
This is just to whet your
appetite for the main event.

432
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:44,787
Gentlemen, prepare yourselves
for the Aisle of Terror.

433
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:50,047
Prepare... to be terrorized!

434
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:53,427
Fernando, not now! I mean...

435
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:05,326
We got the idea from an experiment that the UCLA
psychology department did on our friend Jeffrey.

436
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:08,066
Nothing I won't do
for $30 and a sandwich.

437
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,926
Um... Or just a sandwich.

438
00:27:10,927 --> 00:27:14,696
You see, there's this world-renowned
professor at UCLA, Professor Schofield,

439
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:19,156
who specializes in examining the
subconscious of the mentally disturbed.

440
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:20,877
- He gets right up in there.
- Shh!

441
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:24,666
So using Jeffrey and a bunch
of other nut bags as test cases,

442
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:30,797
he discovered that there are certain images
that can cause terror in even the most...

443
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:35,527
fearless lunatics. Let's do this.

444
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:38,267
So now...

445
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:45,367
get ready to see some of the
scariest things in the world.

446
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:49,667
Old people.

447
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:53,146
Public showers.

448
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:54,847
What's going on, Chuck?

449
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:00,336
- Interspecies relationships.
- Okay. What-Stop now, stop.

450
00:28:00,337 --> 00:28:02,276
Uh, I'll be honest with you.

451
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:06,387
This might be one of the
worst things I've ever seen.

452
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:07,787
One of the best things?

453
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:09,137
I think he said "best." Yeah.

454
00:28:09,138 --> 00:28:10,527
I don't want any customers in here.

455
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:14,006
Guys, it's scary, but
just in a really bad way.

456
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:16,487
I give up. I give up.

457
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:23,836
- Babies in costume.
- Really?

458
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:27,827
Is it a baby... or is it a snail?

459
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:31,347
- I don't know.
- 'Kay.

460
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:41,636
So, Honey, you have any parenting tips?

461
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:45,466
I mean, Devon turned out so good, I just
figured you could give me some inside scoop.

462
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:48,636
Well, you know, Devon was
amazing right from the start.

463
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:50,506
Really great genes, I guess.

464
00:28:50,507 --> 00:28:52,046
I guess.

465
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:56,337
But don't you worry, this little
wonder is already halfway there.

466
00:28:57,707 --> 00:29:03,917
You know, we really have to make sure that
this baby has positive female influences.

467
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:07,317
So I'm here to help.

468
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:09,266
Thanks, Honey.

469
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,786
Babe, is this not the most
adorable thing you've ever seen?

470
00:29:11,787 --> 00:29:14,327
- It's adorable.
- Plays the "Chicken Dance.

471
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:19,997
" Devon, like this stuffed bear is going
to teach this baby how to read and write.

472
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:23,846
Here.

473
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,587
Babies love dictionaries.

474
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:30,637
I'm gonna see if they
have an encyclopedia.

475
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:35,087
- You okay, hon?
- I'm fine.

476
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:39,956
Your, uh, your mother
might be a bit much, but

477
00:29:39,957 --> 00:29:42,737
underneath it all, she just wants
to be a part of the baby's life.

478
00:29:43,597 --> 00:29:45,807
It's more than I can say for my mom.

479
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:08,947
I've been thinking about my mom.

480
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:12,707
It's weird, though.

481
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:15,597
The woman that I found is nothing like
the one I remember from my childhood.

482
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:17,977
You're trying to justify
not telling Ellie?

483
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:20,436
Am I that transparent?

484
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:23,387
No. But you don't want to hurt her.

485
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:30,167
Okay, let's get started on the detonator.

486
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:34,797
That's not good.

487
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:39,577
Wheelwright. Quick, quick.

488
00:30:41,617 --> 00:30:43,286
Why is the device counting down?

489
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:44,386
Oh, that?

490
00:30:44,387 --> 00:30:47,546
Well, just a safety measure
to protect against tampering.

491
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:50,886
It counts down until I verify that
the weapon is in my possession.

492
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:52,556
Okay, tell us how to turn it off.

493
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:54,556
Well, you'll need this.

494
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:57,027
But why should I help you?

495
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:03,527
Remember, if the device
goes off, you'll be exposed.

496
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,357
So be a good boy and turn it off.

497
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:07,926
Well played.

498
00:31:07,927 --> 00:31:11,257
Get out. Come on.

499
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:23,076
There. I deactivated the safety check.

500
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:24,806
It shouldn't bother you again.

501
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:27,296
Okay, good. I'll get the handcuffs.

502
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:29,777
Keep him close while we
continue to work on this.

503
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:30,987
Yeah, hurry up.

504
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,247
Here, you, sit.

505
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:44,007
Aah! What have you done?

506
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:52,660
Sarah, get back!

507
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,860
Chuck, no! Chuck!

508
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,440
Your hands are shaking.

509
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,180
That's how it begins.

510
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:08,539
You exposed both of
us? Why? Why would you do that?

511
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,080
Well, I developed this nerve
gas by testing it on myself.

512
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:19,339
It was a long, terrifying
process, but after a while, I gave in.

513
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,239
I surrendered to my insanity.

514
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,070
And now I'm not scared of anything. So...

515
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,510
What scares you, Chuck, hmm?

516
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,889
Everything! Everything! Everything!
Almost... Almost everything!

517
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,529
Make it stop. Make it stop. Somebody
turn it off. Turn it off.

518
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,960
Chuck, listen to me, it's all in
your head. You need to fight it.

519
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,719
I'm trying, but it's horrible.

520
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,160
This is exactly why I don't see scary
movies, and I stick mainly to the PG-13 region.

521
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,790
Let's go.

522
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,360
Come on.

523
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:04,470
If you get me out of here, I will
consider taking you to the antitoxin.

524
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,450
Anything. Anything you want.

525
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,320
Now I'm going to kill that bitch
Frost who double-crossed me.

526
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:19,030
No, no, I can't let that happen.

527
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,859
Did you just lock us in here?

528
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,580
- Oops.
- Oh... look who's the comedian now.

529
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,520
Chuck!

530
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,430
Sarah?

531
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,899
It's getting worse.

532
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,959
These are your deepest fears.

533
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,279
No, please make it stop!

534
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,800
There's no escape. We're
both locked in here.

535
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,150
No!

536
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,190
Come on, Casey, pick up.

537
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,950
Okay.

538
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,449
Our informant should be here soon
to give us an update on Project Isis.

539
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,449
This is so cool. "Our informant,"
that is so cloak-and-dagger.

540
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,049
I love it. What does that make me.
The inside man?

541
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,139
The mole?

542
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,499
You're the magnet.

543
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,089
The magnet. I love that. Yeah!

544
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:42,499
Spies have the coolest names.

545
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,909
Okay, what do you need the magnet to do?

546
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,560
You already look like a spy.

547
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,880
Now all I need you to do is stand
here by the Vic and act like one.

548
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,510
Yeah?

549
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,800
Done.

550
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,580
How was that?

551
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,500
Wonderful.

552
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,190
Boo! Found you.

553
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,779
Oh, look. Aisle of Terror.

554
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,510
An unfortunate place
for you to be trapped.

555
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,940
Now do you feel like
getting us out of here?

556
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,709
Aisle of Terror...

557
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:33,450
Images that can cause terror in even
the most... fearless... lunatics...

558
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,939
What the hell is this?

559
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,900
- Public showers?
- That's peculiar.

560
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,909
Reminds me of Professor
Schofield's work.

561
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,330
That hack. Thought he knew about fear.

562
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,239
A baby in a snail costume.

563
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,480
It... it is Schofield's
work. That's crazy.

564
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:05,040
Is it a baby... or a snail?

565
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,809
Old people.

566
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,679
Oh, get it out of my head!

567
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,880
Interspecies relations.

568
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,589
The terror.
The terror. It's... It's all flooding back now.

569
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,630
Black licorice!

570
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:25,769
Please, please make it stop!

571
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:29,850
Man feet! Otters!

572
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,329
This can't be happening.

573
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,050
Schofield!

574
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,540
- Chuck. Chuck, are you okay? What happened?
- No...

575
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:45,920
Sarah, I don't want to.
I... I don't want to see you like this

576
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:49,779
so I'm just going to keep my eyes
closed until we get the antidote. Okay?

577
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,810
- Okay, okay, bye.
- Let's get up. Come on.

578
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,380
Oh, God!

579
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:12,622
Give me your gun.

580
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:16,031
No, but it's not a real gun.

581
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:19,991
It's-it's just a heavily-modified
paint ball pistol.

582
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:21,902
Which I know paint ball's
still very, very dangerous,

583
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:24,942
but what I'm trying to explain
is that it's not real...

584
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:26,712
I'll take that folder.

585
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:31,752
Casey, Casey, what is going
on? Why is there a gun to my head?

586
00:37:31,822 --> 00:37:37,152
I'm the magnet. I'm the magnet
for bad guys? Are you kidding me?

587
00:37:38,362 --> 00:37:40,951
Come on, man. I can't believe you.

588
00:37:40,952 --> 00:37:44,041
I cannot believe that you would bring
me here and use me as a human target.

589
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,082
- What nerve.
- Grimes...

590
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,402
No, no, no, I need to finish.

591
00:37:46,403 --> 00:37:48,382
And this may sting, but
you need to hear it.

592
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:51,621
You, sir, are not very
thoughtful. Not one bit.

593
00:37:51,622 --> 00:37:54,171
I mean, am I alone here? Well... yeah.

594
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,592
What, are you agreeing with
him? Whose side are you on?

595
00:37:56,593 --> 00:37:59,452
- Can I go?
- Yeah, run along.

596
00:38:00,392 --> 00:38:03,031
Oh, not cool, man. That is just not cool.

597
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:05,891
- You did good, Grimes.
- Really? Thank you.

598
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:09,332
- I tried to really kind of sink into
the role, you know, and... - Huh.

599
00:38:10,572 --> 00:38:12,991
Oh, I know that "huh." Why.
What does it say?

600
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,601
Chuck's mom's story checks out.

601
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:16,272
She's totally clean.

602
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:18,522
Perfect.

603
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:21,461
Oh, that was not a fun trip.

604
00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:24,011
Well, thank God we got Wheelwright
to give up that antitoxin

605
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:27,111
before he went completely
off the reservation.

606
00:38:27,112 --> 00:38:29,992
Thank you, Sarah. You're
the greatest partner ever.

607
00:38:40,782 --> 00:38:43,301
- Oh, my God.
- What?

608
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:44,432
My mom.
She left a message.

609
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:47,592
She wants to see Ellie tonight
before she goes back undercover.

610
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:53,812
I honestly thought Ellie
would never see my mom again.

611
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:55,022
Uh, I'll come with you.

612
00:38:55,023 --> 00:39:00,352
No, no, no. Hey, I-I appreciate your
concern, Sarah, but trust me, it's my mom.

613
00:39:22,512 --> 00:39:24,002
Hi, sis.

614
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:26,462
Brushing up on your vocab, huh?

615
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,902
I was just trying to get away
from Honey for a few minutes.

616
00:39:33,722 --> 00:39:34,442
It's ironic, isn't it?

617
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:39,352
The mother that I wish would disappear
is here to answer all of my questions.

618
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:46,112
And the mother that I wish I could
talk to has disappeared forever.

619
00:39:50,362 --> 00:39:54,102
Hey, Ellie, you, uh.
You got plans tonight?

620
00:40:08,592 --> 00:40:09,872
What's with all the secrecy?

621
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:13,201
I needed to get away from Castle, in
case Grimes was hanging around.

622
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,362
If he knew the truth, he'd
go running to his BFF.

623
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:20,761
Everything about Bartowski's
mother's life is a fake.

624
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:25,212
Project Isis.
It ended 20 years ago when Frost went rogue.

625
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:29,802
So what, she's a double agent? She's
working directly for Volkoff?

626
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:34,232
I should have grabbed her before
she dropped off the map again.

627
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:40,072
What? What is it, Walker?

628
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:45,112
So what do we do when she
walks through the door?

629
00:40:45,502 --> 00:40:49,471
I mean, part of me wants to be reserved.
Show her that I'm an adult

630
00:40:49,472 --> 00:40:53,062
and I've been just fine since she left.

631
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:55,882
The other part of me
just wants to hug her.

632
00:40:57,212 --> 00:40:59,262
Do whatever feels right.

633
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:04,092
- I'm gonna go take a look outside.
She might have got lost. - Okay.

634
00:41:10,932 --> 00:41:12,932
Chuck.

635
00:41:19,632 --> 00:41:22,052
Mom... No!

636
00:41:24,142 --> 00:41:28,861
- Chuck!
- Stop! No! No! Let her go!

637
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,562
Stop! Stop! You have no
idea what's going on!

638
00:41:30,563 --> 00:41:32,572
Your mom isn't the spy you think she is.

639
00:41:32,942 --> 00:41:34,832
Sarah?

640
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:37,362
I'm protecting your blind spot.

641
00:41:39,432 --> 00:41:40,932
Sarah!

642
00:41:57,232 --> 00:41:58,872
Chuck, what is it?

643
00:42:02,092 --> 00:42:04,822
Ellie, I'm sorry, but Mom is not coming.

644
00:42:07,022 --> 00:42:09,742
Why does she keep doing this to us?

645
00:42:12,772 --> 00:42:15,212
Because she's a spy.
