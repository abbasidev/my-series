1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:04,955
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things
that you might need to know.

2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:08,590
Is it strange that all of the new employees
have been named Greta?

3
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:12,500
This is one of my father's laptops.
How did you...?

4
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:15,642
There's something on it.
Some memory problem Ellie figured out.

5
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:18,740
What's going down there in Castle?

6
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:21,279
Are you leveraging me
to stay in my apartment?

7
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:23,609
- Let's say I was.
- You can stay at my place...

8
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:27,743
as long as you keep quiet.
Don't tell anyone, especially Bartowski.

9
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:39,109
I hope you didn't think
this interrogation was over.

10
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:42,685
We know about your involvement
with the CIA.

11
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:45,847
I have no idea...
No idea what you're talking about.

12
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,858
We know that you work with John Casey.

13
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:51,553
Just admit it. This can all be over.

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,166
I don't know what you... I don't know.

15
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:58,895
Okay. Okay. Hold on a second.

16
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:02,802
I admit it.
I have worked with John Casey.

17
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:07,172
We worked together
for the last four years now.

18
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:10,474
We started in large appliances
and then I worked up to manager.

19
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:12,844
Think this is funny?

20
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:17,546
You're really willing to sacrifice
your life to protect John Casey?

21
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,755
My only regret
is that I have one life to give.

22
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:24,188
You go ahead. You do your worst.

23
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:31,534
Okay. Ha, ha. That was tough.

24
00:01:31,737 --> 00:01:34,672
You didn't wet yourself
this time. That's an improvement.

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,570
- I didn't drink any water today.
- Welcome to the team.

26
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:42,112
Thank you, sir. Glad to be part of it.

27
00:01:44,283 --> 00:01:45,944
Whoa.

28
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:48,018
So where you going there?

29
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:50,246
- Super-secret spy mission?
- Don't do that.

30
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:52,856
I'm just goofing around with you, buddy.

31
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:55,755
Roomie. First rule of Team Casey.
Don't ask, don't tell.

32
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:59,363
- What about Chuck and Sarah?
- Especially not Chuck and Sarah.

33
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:02,124
Sir.

34
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:08,268
You really care about your best friend,
you'll lock it down, Morgan.

35
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:15,312
Pfft. Morgan Grimes, you are a badass.

36
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:18,943
Oh, no, I peed a little bit.

37
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:20,142
Fifteen seconds.

38
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:24,919
- Ten.
- Sarah, stop yelling.

39
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,923
You know I don't work well
under pressure, okay?

40
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:33,525
God, no, no, no.

41
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:38,226
- Damn wishbone. Your turn.
- I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,302
"Final Fantasy II."

43
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,878
Morgan and I spent an entire summer
devouring this one.

44
00:02:51,383 --> 00:02:53,783
What is the point of being a spy
if there aren't any missions?

45
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:59,454
Casey.

46
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,786
- What are you doing here?
- Did Beckman call?

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,825
No, I'm just, ahem, returning something.

48
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:07,162
A 50-cal sniper rifle?

49
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,630
Why are you checking weapons out?

50
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:13,498
I was plinking on the range. Don't want
a weapon like this to feel neglected.

51
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:16,971
What about us? Do you think Beckman
has secretly sidelined our team?

52
00:03:17,142 --> 00:03:19,610
- Why else would our missions dry up?
- I don't know.

53
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:23,111
Maybe the Intersect's made the world
a more peaceful place.

54
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:25,341
- Hmm.
- What is that about?

55
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:27,678
You think we're stir-crazy,
think about Casey.

56
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:29,946
I mean, he hasn't shot someone
in two weeks.

57
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:32,181
That we know of.
Casey is up to something...

58
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:37,659
and I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.
- Sarah? Sarah.

59
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,011
This is so weird.
I didn't know this hallway even existed.

60
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,817
Maybe it's a part of all the new construction
that's been going on.

61
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:11,152
- Ahh.
- Huh.

62
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,198
Well, allow me. It's not like they're gonna
deny the one and only Intersect. Ha, ha.

63
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:22,369
Okay, so maybe you're not
being completely paranoid.

64
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,510
I haven't seen much of Casey
in the last couple of weeks.

65
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:27,770
- You think he's gone lone wolf?
- That's it.

66
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,437
Prowling the streets
administering vigilante justice?

67
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,117
Come on...
Actually, that's entirely plausible.

68
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:37,221
It's time for a spy intervention.
We need to put our partner on the spot.

69
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:40,222
Nope. I have a better idea.

70
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:42,584
Hey. What's up, man?

71
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,592
Hey, buddy. Um...

72
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,954
Mind if I come in?

73
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:50,692
You know what? I do mind,
because, uh, I just waxed my floors.

74
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:53,303
Really? Cooked that one up
on the spot, did you?

75
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:55,940
What's your new spy partner
been up to these days?

76
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:58,372
You must be referring
to my domestic partner...

77
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:01,376
for I am not privy
to Casey's spy life.

78
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:04,379
Have you seen your new roommate
disappearing at odd times?

79
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:06,483
- No.
- Coming home with fresh injuries?

80
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:09,153
- None that I'm aware of.
- Receiving solo missions...

81
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,948
from one
General Diane Beckman?

82
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:12,488
Can't say that I have, chief.

83
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:15,258
One more little question.

84
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:18,419
Where have all my missions gone?

85
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:24,229
Because either all the bad guys are on
vacation or Casey's up to something.

86
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:31,573
Or maybe the Intersect has just made
the world a more peaceful place.

87
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:39,984
Good seeing you, pal.

88
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:43,145
I can't believe Morgan would lie
to my face like that.

89
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:46,189
I can't believe Casey would lie
to my face. My old partner.

90
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:49,850
Wait. Didn't Casey say that Beckman
had him working on something new?

91
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:53,020
Do you think Beckman is sending him
out on missions without us?

92
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,426
Why would Beckman do that?
We're Casey's team.

93
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:57,360
Wait. He's on the move.

94
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:00,800
Oh, oh. Are we really doing this?
Spying on our own partner?

95
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:02,599
- Isn't that icky?
- Think about it.

96
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:06,938
If Casey is going out on missions,
then he is doing so without the Intersect.

97
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:10,377
You're right. What if he gets in a jam?
What if he needs our help?

98
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:13,746
I mean, we're not spying on Casey,
we're watching his back.

99
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:15,411
Duh.

100
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,799
It was nice of Devon to let us borrow his
new Sienna. It is the perfect tail vehicle.

101
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:36,202
Think about it, dual screens,
Bluetooth, 10-speaker sound system.

102
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,639
- And it's so comfy.
- Well, it's unassuming.

103
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,404
That's why it's the perfect tail vehicle.

104
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,843
Oh. Did I mention the automatic doors?

105
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:47,579
It's like I'm using the Force.

106
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,487
Okay. Ahem.

107
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:53,987
It's time to find out
what kind of game Casey's playing.

108
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:03,230
Easy. Your boss is expecting me.

109
00:07:03,402 --> 00:07:07,270
I wasn't expecting you,
I was expecting Dragan.

110
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,374
And I wasn't expecting him
for two days.

111
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:13,943
- Slight change of plans.
- Wasn't part of our arrangement.

112
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:16,208
Oh, all right.

113
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:19,817
My employer would be happy
to do business elsewhere.

114
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,177
Please...

115
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:27,223
excuse my lack of hospitality.

116
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,769
He's all alone. What's he trying to do,
get himself killed?

117
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:44,702
Don't you wanna open it?

118
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:48,638
I would trust Dragan with my life.

119
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:54,913
You, on the other hand, John Casey...

120
00:07:55,086 --> 00:08:00,353
NSA agent, not so much.

121
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:04,156
What exactly was your plan?

122
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:07,593
You just walk in here and arrest me?

123
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:10,200
All alone? Heh, heh.

124
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:12,233
He's not alone.

125
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:15,799
He wouldn't go undercover
without his team.

126
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:18,807
Yeah.
Honestly, who do you take him for?

127
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:20,308
What are you doing here?

128
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,106
Saving your life, partner.

129
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,804
Don't need saving, idiot.

130
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:25,950
Oh, really, I'm the idiot?

131
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:28,608
Please. Let me settle this.

132
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:36,290
You are all idiots.

133
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,042
You're under arrest.

134
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:01,480
Good work, colonel.

135
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:05,183
Wait, so this was all a sting?

136
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:08,856
Hang on a second.

137
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:12,519
Is that Greta and other Greta?

138
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:16,289
Chuck, Sarah...

139
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:19,466
meet my new team.

140
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:33,137
Chuck 4x18 - Versus the A-Team

141
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,542
Look at those two.

142
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:12,013
First they take over the Buy More,
then they steal our partner...

143
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:14,050
now they're taking over our spy base.

144
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:16,016
I can't believe Casey replaced us.

145
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:19,019
- I can't believe the CIA replaced us.
- Come again?

146
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:21,192
Who do you think
is taking our missions?

147
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:25,491
Honey, please. Look, I have something
irreplaceable in this little head of mine.

148
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:27,863
So let Casey have his new team.

149
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,195
You still got the Intersect, baby.

150
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,998
Let's go introduce ourselves, shall we?

151
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:37,535
So I said to him, you can keep
your larger magazine capacity...

152
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,702
when it comes to stopping power,
nothing beats my.45.

153
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,314
- That is hilarious.
- That is hilarious.

154
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,144
Forty-fives...

155
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:49,714
Great work back there, by the way,
with the guns and the bad guys.

156
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:52,357
Pow, pow, pow.
Took them all out, that was impressive.

157
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,755
I'm sorry,
but I never got your actual names.

158
00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:58,920
And I don't wanna keep calling you Greta.
I'm assuming Greta's an acronym.

159
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:00,725
- Captain Noble.
- Captain Dunwoody.

160
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,834
- Captain. Captain.
- Agent.

161
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,560
Rick and Vicki. Ha, ha.

162
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:05,931
It's rhyme-y, it's cute.

163
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:08,003
- You a couple?
- Don't be ridiculous.

164
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:09,573
It's against agency protocol.

165
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:12,108
Romantic entanglements
lead to lapses in judgment.

166
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:13,835
You ought to know.

167
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:16,914
Walker? Ahem. A word please?

168
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,881
- So, what kind of music you guys into?
- Shh.

169
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,882
I see, you're very busy.

170
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:24,956
I see you picked your new team
for their personalities.

171
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:26,751
Sorry you had to find out this way.

172
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:29,486
It's not like I've been your partner
the last four years.

173
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:32,529
- Please let me explain.
- No. It's cool, you know. I get it.

174
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:36,100
Beckman gave you a new team,
you've been running missions with them...

175
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,634
This wasn't Beckman's idea.

176
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,132
Colonel Casey, grab your team.
Mission briefing in five.

177
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:48,541
That is, if you're all through fraternizing
with your old team.

178
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:58,555
So who is, uh, Suzy Sunshine?

179
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:02,161
Director Bentley. She's our Beckman.

180
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:04,721
Except not as warm and cuddly.

181
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:09,262
Well, babe,
I guess it's just you and me.

182
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:12,302
- Where are you going?
- To fix this.

183
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:13,730
Oh, boy.

184
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:16,636
Why didn't you tell us
Casey was heading up his own team?

185
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:20,176
Agent Walker, you're not the only one
who has to take orders.

186
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:23,280
I'm playing the cards I was dealt.
I suggest you do the same.

187
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:25,280
Quick follow-up question, general.

188
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,783
Who's the A-team
and who's the B-team here?

189
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:30,650
I know you love our team
and Casey's team equally...

190
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,255
Enough. Both of you.

191
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:35,121
Right now you need to focus
on the mission at hand.

192
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:38,195
- Which is?
- A top-priority extraction from Tbilisi.

193
00:12:38,397 --> 00:12:41,855
You'll recognize the target
of the colonel's recent sting operation...

194
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:44,298
Necati Acar, a.k.a. The Turk.

195
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,702
Although his arrest was important,
the real prize is this man.

196
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:51,172
Dragan Pichushkin. Arms dealer.

197
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:54,541
He's made a fortune
dismantling the former Soviet arsenal...

198
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:56,545
and selling it on the black market.

199
00:12:56,716 --> 00:13:00,482
The Turk has agreed to lure Dragan
onto U.S. Soil under one condition.

200
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:02,450
That we offer his family asylum?

201
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:06,786
Precisely, Agent Walker.
All we have is a first name. Jana.

202
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,983
Wife?

203
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,458
Jana.

204
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:12,996
Jana. Mistress. Think it's probably
a mistre... No photos?

205
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,329
That's why we're sending you.
Wheels up in the morning.

206
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:21,064
Use the Intersect to ID Jana
and return her safely to U.S. Soil.

207
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,435
That is all, team.

208
00:13:24,644 --> 00:13:26,373
I think she meant to say A-team.

209
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:29,879
I can't believe
we're finally going on a mission.

210
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:38,255
Hey.

211
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:40,490
What's up, Devon, you okay?

212
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,628
Just trying to find my baseline, bro.

213
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:44,160
Oh. Stressful day at the ER?

214
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,390
Trauma surgery's a cinch.
It's coming home that's stressful.

215
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,899
Being home with the baby's
made Ellie stir-crazy.

216
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:51,093
Must be going around.

217
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,171
When I walk through that door,
she makes up for 12 hours of not talking...

218
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,776
to another adult in about 12 minutes.
Wish me luck.

219
00:13:57,977 --> 00:13:59,376
Good luck.

220
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,843
Hi, honey. How was work? I'm so glad
you're home. I've been dying to talk.

221
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:08,612
Remember how I've been trying
to keep track of Clara's sleep schedule?

222
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:12,757
At first I couldn't find the circadian cycle,
then I applied some biostatistics.

223
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:15,157
Voilà. Isn't that incredible?

224
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:18,627
Oh. Wait till you see the data
that I gathered during tummy time.

225
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:21,096
And here is a chart
of Clara's new vocal sounds.

226
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:24,395
You can go a little loony with someone
babbling in your ear all day long.

227
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:27,898
The problem is,
I only have one test subject.

228
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:32,408
So in order to control my experiment,
we're gonna have to have a second baby.

229
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:35,807
Joking.

230
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:39,473
Speaking of computer modeling,
whatever happened to my dad's laptop?

231
00:14:39,652 --> 00:14:40,914
Devon?

232
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:42,281
Devon, are you listening to me?

233
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:43,945
Huh? Yeah. Computers.

234
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:46,648
- Brain science. Totally with you.
- Good.

235
00:14:46,826 --> 00:14:50,125
I'm starting to think that my dad left me
that computer for a reason.

236
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:54,130
Maybe his research is just the diversion
that I need right now.

237
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,665
I want that computer back.

238
00:14:58,337 --> 00:15:00,737
- I wonder what Casey's team is up to.
- Who cares?

239
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:03,137
Beckman said it herself,
this extraction is top priority.

240
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:06,669
It's the bro-in-law.

241
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,570
Hey, Devon, what's going on?

242
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:11,114
Chuck. We need to talk.

243
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:13,252
- Why are you whispering?
- Clara's sleeping.

244
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:16,946
- And I don't want Ellie to hear.
- Can this wait till I'm home?

245
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:19,818
Ellie wants your dad's laptop.
She thinks he gave it to her for a reason.

246
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:22,927
No, Devon. Listen to me
and listen to me very carefully.

247
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:24,995
She cannot have the laptop.

248
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:27,598
The laptop is filled
with dangerous spy stuff...

249
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,792
which is probably why it's buried
deep beneath Langley.

250
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,494
But she gave the computer to me.

251
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:35,334
- What am I supposed to tell her?
- Tell her you lost it.

252
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:38,136
Tell her you brought it
to the Buy More to get it fixed.

253
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:40,142
She'll assume Jeff and Lester lost it.

254
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:41,473
Good cover story, bro.

255
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:43,171
That's why you called the pro.

256
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:57,458
Wait. I'm seeing a square.

257
00:15:57,663 --> 00:15:59,858
Close. Squiggly lines.

258
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:01,991
Excuse me.

259
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:05,865
Damn it, lady. Can't you see
that you're ruining his concentration?

260
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:09,405
I'm just here to get my computer,
then you can go back to your game.

261
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:11,075
Game?

262
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:15,009
I will have you know, Eleanor,
that our friend Jeffrey here is a clairvoyant.

263
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:18,915
Read her thoughts, Jeffrey.

264
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:23,047
She hates us.

265
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:25,383
She thinks we're pathetic.

266
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:26,923
She doesn't believe in ESP.

267
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:30,418
That's really good.
Can I have my computer?

268
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,358
Fine. Where's your claim stub?

269
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:35,329
- Devon dropped it off.
- No claim stub, no computer. Mush.

270
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:41,171
Okay, uh, you guys just...
You don't understand.

271
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,901
There's something
really important on that laptop.

272
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:46,840
Something...

273
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:49,381
private.

274
00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:51,340
Go on.

275
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:56,644
Devon and I, we made a video
when we were in med school.

276
00:16:56,856 --> 00:17:00,257
Um, I'd just hate for it
to fall into the wrong hands.

277
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:03,859
Jeffrey, clear our schedule.

278
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:09,561
Ma'am, we're gonna find that laptop
if it's the last thing we do.

279
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,708
Looks like Jana's running a little late.

280
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,316
Or else the Turk's enemies
got to her before we did.

281
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,486
Looks like this landing zone
is about to get a little hot.

282
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:34,485
That's why Beckman sent us.

283
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,635
Do any of those guys
look like Jana to you?

284
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:49,434
You wanted Jana? I'm getting her.

285
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:53,100
These charmers stuffed her in the trunk.
I don't like this, Sarah.

286
00:17:58,017 --> 00:18:01,248
Oh, my God. They chopped her up
into little pieces.

287
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:13,955
What?

288
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:19,761
Sarah, meet Jana.

289
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:24,299
This was our big extraction?
A stupid dog?

290
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:26,775
Sometime boss's dog
gets upset tummy.

291
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:29,779
Try mixing in a cup of her dry food
with the wet stuff.

292
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,947
And be sure to walk her every hour...

293
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:35,520
or that happens.

294
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,022
Oh. Gross.

295
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:41,783
Oh, my God, Sarah.

296
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:46,164
We're the B-team.

297
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:53,665
We used to be the A-team...

298
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,138
the sharp end of the CIA stick.
Now we're glorified pet couriers?

299
00:18:57,576 --> 00:18:59,043
Nothing has changed, Chuck.

300
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:01,543
Well, what do you call
Casey's new team, then?

301
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:03,045
I call them the competition.

302
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:05,683
Wanna be on the A-team again?
We have to earn it.

303
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:06,875
What? How?

304
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:09,145
Dragan.
Beckman said he's the brass ring.

305
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:13,257
We're gonna collar him and we're gonna
show the general we've still got it.

306
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,927
Except the only person
who can lead us to Dragan is the Turk...

307
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,756
and who knows where
they're keeping him.

308
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:24,902
- Is that...?
- Jana?

309
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,942
She's got an upset tummy. Think
they remembered to mix in the dry food?

310
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:34,511
If the Turk's dog is behind that door,
so is the Turk.

311
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,080
All we gotta do is get through
four inches of steel.

312
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:39,615
Or we chop off Casey's hand.

313
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:43,578
- Let's keep that as our backup plan.
- Sure.

314
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,383
Okay.

315
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:52,259
Morgan, I can hear you eating
potato chips. Open the door.

316
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:54,296
- Can't do that.
- This is ridiculous.

317
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,765
- Why can't we talk face-to-face?
- Trust me. It's for your own good.

318
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:00,770
Is that right? Or is that
what Casey told you to tell me?

319
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,899
Hey, hey. Colonel's a good man
and he gave me my orders, okay?

320
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:07,102
- To lock it down.
- Let me in.

321
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,871
Over my dead body, Chuck.

322
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:16,020
How about over your tranq'd body?

323
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:18,449
You were distracting me
so she could break in.

324
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:21,957
- Yeah.
- Clever girl.

325
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,459
- Are you using the five-milligram darts?
- Ten.

326
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,655
Please tell Casey
I put up a good fight.

327
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:31,330
Great. Now all we need is something
with Casey's handprint on it...

328
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:33,630
so we can access
the secret part of Castle.

329
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,967
Ooh. What are these?

330
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:39,542
These have a camera inside of them
that scan for any bio-residue.

331
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:41,576
Yuck. Sounds like a CBS show.

332
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:49,482
I found one,
but this handprint is way too tiny.

333
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:52,351
Looks like it belongs to a child.

334
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,289
Oh, right.

335
00:20:55,828 --> 00:20:57,693
Bingo.

336
00:20:58,497 --> 00:21:00,192
Sarah.

337
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:15,946
Not bad for the B-team.

338
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:28,115
Holy crap. Their Castle
is so much cooler than ours.

339
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:32,857
I wonder if they have that
fancy Greek yogurt in their kitchen.

340
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:38,698
Okay, you go find the Turk. I'm gonna see
if I can pull up Dragan's case file.

341
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:51,076
Please.

342
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,014
I told you everything
I know about Dragan's shipment.

343
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:56,051
No. Relax.
I'm not part of their team.

344
00:21:56,989 --> 00:21:59,856
They are like a pair of evil robots.

345
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:02,755
Wait. They told me about you.

346
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:06,159
You are the dog walker, no?
I'm happy you're here.

347
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:08,357
Jana was beginning to walk funny.

348
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:12,129
She needs to have, uh,
how you say, a pee-pee time?

349
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:28,341
Chuck? Chuck,
I think you should look at this.

350
00:22:32,024 --> 00:22:34,049
Hey. What's up?
What do you want me to...?

351
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:43,065
My dad's computer.

352
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:45,566
Why would they...?

353
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:48,101
Casey, please tell me you didn't.

354
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,536
I think it's time for us to go.
Right now.

355
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,304
You're not authorized to be
in this section of Castle.

356
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,710
What are you doing
with my father's computer?

357
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:58,975
The Intersect project is classified.

358
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:00,913
Classif... Classified?

359
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:03,452
I'm not authorized to be down here?
What?

360
00:23:03,622 --> 00:23:05,419
I am the Intersect.

361
00:23:06,325 --> 00:23:07,986
You're not as special as you think.

362
00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:10,889
I think you should get out of here
before you get hurt.

363
00:23:29,448 --> 00:23:30,642
I see you know kung fu.

364
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,751
It's very impressive,
but a little showy for my taste.

365
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,614
How about this style, Bartowski?

366
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:37,312
Oh, for heaven's sake.

367
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,232
Chuck, what is happening?

368
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:59,003
We're following the same program.

369
00:24:00,846 --> 00:24:02,279
Sarah...

370
00:24:02,948 --> 00:24:04,472
they're Intersects.

371
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:06,844
Stand down, captain.

372
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:11,683
So this was your idea, Casey? Huh?

373
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:14,553
You used my father's program
to make your own Intersects?

374
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,558
Now that you have your dream team
you don't need me around.

375
00:24:17,763 --> 00:24:20,391
But that right there?
That's mine, and I'm taking it.

376
00:24:20,566 --> 00:24:21,794
You don't wanna do that.

377
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:25,960
Yeah, well, my father never wanted
his invention to be used like this.

378
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:27,400
Drop it.

379
00:24:27,573 --> 00:24:29,905
That computer
is property of the U.S. Government.

380
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:34,812
- Call off your dogs, Casey.
- Captain, put the gun down now.

381
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:38,175
First, you put the computer down,
Bartowski...

382
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,012
or I'll put a bullet
in that obsolete brain of yours.

383
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:47,654
I'd do as she says, Mr. Bartowski.

384
00:24:48,427 --> 00:24:52,830
Unlike you, my Intersects aren't afraid
to pull the trigger.

385
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:08,135
Now do you understand
why I had Beckman send you to Tbilisi?

386
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:09,711
You wanted us out of the way.

387
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,317
The CIA's two Intersect teams
were never supposed to, well, intersect.

388
00:25:14,485 --> 00:25:17,648
It was important that you not interfere
with the GRETA field test.

389
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:20,882
Right. The Gretas in the Buy More.

390
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:23,492
We've been using your store
as a proving ground...

391
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:26,858
for prospective Intersect candidates.
These two are the best of the best.

392
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:30,057
Oh. Really?
So then what does that make me?

393
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:32,668
None of this would be possible
without you.

394
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:35,101
That's right.
We've been studying you as well...

395
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:39,208
correcting your father's software
for your various limitations.

396
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:41,503
- Limitations?
- His emotional sensitivity.

397
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,544
His overreliance on his handlers.

398
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:47,172
- His inability to terminate targets.
- You clearly fixed that glitch.

399
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:49,751
Vicki here almost shot Chuck.

400
00:25:49,987 --> 00:25:52,285
If you'll excuse us,
we have a mission to complete.

401
00:25:55,693 --> 00:25:57,854
Dragan Pichushkin, our primary target...

402
00:25:58,028 --> 00:26:01,020
is currently en route to an airfield
outside of Los Angeles.

403
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:04,725
Our analysts at Langley believe
that he is on this aircraft, which was...

404
00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:12,769
Hijacked by drug runners in 2006.

405
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:15,810
The plane is now registered
to a Moscow shell corporation.

406
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:18,140
Yeah. What they said.

407
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:19,373
Very good.

408
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,541
Your team will intercept Pichushkin...

409
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,880
confiscate all cargo
and return him alive.

410
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:25,578
- Ma'am.
- Dismissed.

411
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:31,828
Oh. And you two are free to return home
and await further orders.

412
00:26:32,396 --> 00:26:34,159
Unbelievable.

413
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,736
- Walker, let me explain.
- Don't. If you'd stayed with Chuck and I...

414
00:26:43,908 --> 00:26:45,569
you would have been mothballed.

415
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:48,643
- I didn't jump ship.
- You didn't exactly go down with ship.

416
00:26:48,812 --> 00:26:50,609
I left because you don't need me.

417
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:52,510
Don't pretend like you don't know...

418
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:55,618
what I'm talking about.
- We were a team, Casey.

419
00:26:55,786 --> 00:26:58,755
You and Bartowski were the team.
I was just the backup.

420
00:26:58,923 --> 00:27:00,857
That is not true.

421
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:04,757
It doesn't matter, anyway.

422
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:08,626
I wanted you to know I think Bentley's
giving you the short end of the stick.

423
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,768
You and Bartowski,
you're still good agents.

424
00:27:11,936 --> 00:27:14,564
Yeah, well, we used to be the best.

425
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,469
I'm calling about the laptop.

426
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:18,801
Did you find it?

427
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:20,807
Well, there is a chance...

428
00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:23,310
that we returned the laptop
to the wrong person.

429
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,345
- Gee, what a surprise.
- Don't worry.

430
00:27:25,516 --> 00:27:27,780
I got my best man on it.

431
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:32,217
I need you to focus your powers, Jeffrey.

432
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,380
I need a name.

433
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:38,584
I need you to tell me
who has that missing computer.

434
00:27:39,697 --> 00:27:41,130
So...

435
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:42,890
You...

436
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,157
are gonna close your eyes...

437
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:49,204
and you're gonna jot down
whatever letters pop into your head.

438
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,798
Go.

439
00:27:52,743 --> 00:27:54,608
No. That's not a letter.

440
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:59,314
Deeper. Jeffrey.

441
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:01,246
Dig. Dig.

442
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:10,851
What just happened?

443
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:12,521
Did I do it?

444
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,432
Cia?

445
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:24,901
The hell kind of name is Cia?

446
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:28,037
You're totally worthless, Jeffrey.

447
00:28:30,147 --> 00:28:32,012
Take a look at this.

448
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:35,209
Twelve hours ago.
Target leaving for the States.

449
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,683
I'm confident your new team
can handle a few bodyguards.

450
00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:41,086
Not them. That.

451
00:28:47,364 --> 00:28:51,061
He's not moving parts. Pichushkin's
moving a fully assembled bomb.

452
00:28:51,235 --> 00:28:53,362
We can assume he's gonna use it.

453
00:28:53,537 --> 00:28:55,596
- We need backup.
- You have two GRETAs.

454
00:28:55,773 --> 00:28:57,604
- What else do you need?
- My old team.

455
00:28:57,775 --> 00:28:59,766
Chuck and Sarah.
It's a five-man job.

456
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:02,575
You sure you're not being sentimental?

457
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,113
Pichushkin's delivering
live explosives to a metropolitan center.

458
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:08,649
We're equipped
with live ordnance disposal.

459
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:10,946
No. The colonel is right.

460
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:15,390
This is a perfect job
for Chuck Bartowski.

461
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:20,089
Bomb disposal?

462
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:23,324
I mean, seriously? Don't they have robots
for stuff like this?

463
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:26,058
It's the only way Bentley
would let you come.

464
00:29:26,236 --> 00:29:28,727
- I guess expendability has its perks.
- Okay, team.

465
00:29:28,906 --> 00:29:30,635
Target lands in inside 10.

466
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:33,299
You two help me neutralize
Dragan's security team...

467
00:29:33,477 --> 00:29:35,741
and take him into custody alive.

468
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,804
Hey.

469
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:40,848
You're a vital part of this mission, Chuck.
Don't forget it.

470
00:29:43,821 --> 00:29:46,221
And try not to drop the bomb, Chuck.

471
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,793
Once we have the bomb, you're on.
Use the Intersect to defuse it.

472
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:59,834
I know you're a little scared.
The suit'll protect you.

473
00:30:00,037 --> 00:30:02,801
I saw The Hurt Locker, Casey. Okay?

474
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:07,034
I know what happened to Guy Pearce.
His suit didn't really do him good.

475
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:09,338
I'm sorry, I'm being overly sensitive.

476
00:30:09,513 --> 00:30:12,311
I bet your new Intersects,
they wouldn't complain.

477
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:15,179
I had to wear one of these in Bosnia.

478
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:16,680
One of my worst missions.

479
00:30:17,488 --> 00:30:20,457
There. Here, let me show you
a little trick.

480
00:30:20,624 --> 00:30:23,650
This way you don't have to use
your hands to drink.

481
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:26,862
Thanks, buddy.

482
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:31,126
Good luck. It's your favorite.
Apple juice.

483
00:31:01,832 --> 00:31:03,356
Oh, oh.

484
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:05,195
They are outnumbered and outgunned.

485
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:07,462
Those guards are carrying
automatic weapons.

486
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:27,346
Whoa! Holy crap.

487
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:32,188
Those two are like Terminators. They
took out five guys in the blink of an eye.

488
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,230
Welcome to America, Mr. Pichushkin.

489
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:41,931
Let me take your luggage.

490
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:43,629
It's yours.

491
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:45,999
Okay?

492
00:31:55,786 --> 00:31:58,880
Portable fission device.
Five-kiloton yield.

493
00:31:59,056 --> 00:32:01,547
Approximate fireball radius,
two kilometers.

494
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:02,885
That's a suitcase nuke.

495
00:32:04,294 --> 00:32:06,285
I'm sorry. Did Casey just say...?

496
00:32:06,463 --> 00:32:07,794
So you have your bomb.

497
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,329
I have detonator.

498
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:15,232
So I think it's better
if we just part ways.

499
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:19,273
Casey, let him go.
I've got my eyes on Dragan.

500
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:21,835
Sarah.

501
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,842
Help Walker. You stay with the bomb.

502
00:32:27,651 --> 00:32:29,983
You need to disarm this now.

503
00:32:30,153 --> 00:32:33,350
This bomb is a Frankenstein
with a hundred different components.

504
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:36,754
There's nothing in the Intersect
about how to defuse this.

505
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,655
Hold on, I can help.

506
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:41,525
I'm coming, Casey! I'm coming!

507
00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:43,290
I'm coming. I'm coming.

508
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:56,169
Show me your hands.

509
00:32:57,581 --> 00:32:59,378
Where's the detonator?

510
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:04,343
I am detonator.

511
00:33:06,023 --> 00:33:09,322
Very simple.
My heart stop, bomb start.

512
00:33:09,493 --> 00:33:11,586
So you have choice.

513
00:33:11,995 --> 00:33:14,896
You shoot me and hundreds
of thousands of people will die...

514
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:16,827
in nuclear blast.

515
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:20,530
Or I kill you.

516
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:23,297
Not easy choice.

517
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:27,371
Vicki, no! Don't shoot!

518
00:33:33,717 --> 00:33:34,741
What did you do?

519
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:43,923
What the hell just happened?

520
00:33:44,127 --> 00:33:46,618
Your trigger-happy new partner
just armed the bomb.

521
00:33:56,273 --> 00:33:59,242
Ooh. Portable fission device.
Five-kiloton yield.

522
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:03,004
We covered that. Our best chance is
to fly as far from civilization as possible.

523
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,774
What? No.
We're in the middle of L.A. County.

524
00:34:05,949 --> 00:34:08,782
It's the difference between
100,000 casualties and a million.

525
00:34:08,952 --> 00:34:10,351
We gotta move this bomb.

526
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,455
No. Casey. No, that's not an option.
We have to disarm it.

527
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:16,524
You've got the same computer
I've got. It can't be disarmed.

528
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:18,558
I can do this, Casey.

529
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:24,398
Bomb's all yours, Bartowski.

530
00:34:24,568 --> 00:34:26,433
- You can't be serious.
- Move.

531
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:33,272
Okay.

532
00:34:34,578 --> 00:34:36,808
- Just like old times.
- Tell me there's a plan.

533
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,244
- There's a plan, right?
- Yeah, there's a plan.

534
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:45,082
Okay. Casey, first of all, I need you
to pull out the primary device.

535
00:34:46,189 --> 00:34:48,282
Slowly. Carefully.

536
00:34:49,793 --> 00:34:51,317
We're gonna have to improvise.

537
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:53,895
- Improvi... It's a nuclear bomb.
- Stow it, captain.

538
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:57,390
That hockey-puck-looking thing
on the end?

539
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:01,196
That's the detonator.
I need you to twist and pull it. Gently.

540
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:16,010
Okay. The detonator is
from a next-gen Chinese sub...

541
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:19,279
which means the firing mechanism
had to have been modified...

542
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:23,859
to allow the warhead's deployment
in saltwater.

543
00:35:25,028 --> 00:35:27,292
Saltwater. Saltwater! Yes!

544
00:35:27,464 --> 00:35:30,763
These detonators, they automatically
deactivate in saltwater...

545
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:34,802
in the event of a hull breach.
- We're nowhere near the ocean.

546
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:36,598
Oh.

547
00:35:36,773 --> 00:35:39,367
Saltwater, saltwater, saltwater. Hmm.

548
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:42,009
What has...?

549
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:45,307
- What is he doing?
- Casey. My juice box.

550
00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:46,972
What?

551
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:52,114
Please have sodium.
Please have sodium.

552
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:53,813
Yes. Yes. Yes.

553
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:04,666
Are you about to disarm
a nuclear bomb using fruit juice?

554
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:07,166
Okay, do it.

555
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:17,805
I can't believe that worked.

556
00:36:18,014 --> 00:36:21,142
Ha, ha. Up. Up.

557
00:36:27,224 --> 00:36:29,158
- I love you.
- I love you too.

558
00:36:33,296 --> 00:36:35,423
Try not to drop the bomb, Rick.

559
00:36:38,835 --> 00:36:39,893
Aah.

560
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:46,906
Looks like things have gotten
a little crowded in Castle.

561
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:50,103
As I told you before,
this operation requires only one team.

562
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,611
I concur.

563
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:53,772
I've read Colonel Casey's report.

564
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,475
In addition to threatening
Agent Bartowski's life...

565
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:59,952
your team managed to kill the man
you were supposed to capture...

566
00:37:00,156 --> 00:37:03,023
and accidentally arm a nuclear bomb.

567
00:37:03,193 --> 00:37:05,127
I take full responsibility for my team.

568
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:07,456
The truth is, Director Bentley...

569
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:10,532
you should never have pursued
the Intersect field trial...

570
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,328
without consulting
the original Intersect.

571
00:37:13,503 --> 00:37:15,835
Agent Bartowski,
that is why you will oversee...

572
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:18,941
all aspects of the Intersect project
from here on out.

573
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:20,838
And what about my GRETAs?

574
00:37:33,456 --> 00:37:36,425
Intersect extraction complete.

575
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:41,357
So how's it feel?

576
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:43,965
What a relief to have that out of my head.

577
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:45,897
That poor bastard Bartowski.

578
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:48,833
Looks like that's it for the team.

579
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:51,232
Honor serving with you, sir.

580
00:37:51,441 --> 00:37:53,534
Captain. Captain. Good luck.

581
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,015
Where do you think you're going?

582
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:10,786
I figured I was through here
since I don't have a team.

583
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:12,758
I never dismissed you, colonel.

584
00:38:13,396 --> 00:38:15,193
Beckman's wrong.

585
00:38:15,398 --> 00:38:18,424
The problem's not with my GRETAs,
it's this computer.

586
00:38:18,602 --> 00:38:20,092
You're going to help me fix it.

587
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,431
Best engineers couldn't crack
Intersect code.

588
00:38:22,606 --> 00:38:23,868
It wasn't meant for them.

589
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,702
I need someone
who thinks like a Bartowski.

590
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,343
What are you getting at?

591
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:39,010
Prepare yourself
for "Final Fantasy Deux."

592
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:42,953
Oh, please let that be Beckman.

593
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:44,957
Oh, come on.

594
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:46,459
A new mission already?

595
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,532
Beckman wants us to leave ASAP.
She's gonna brief us in the air.

596
00:38:51,368 --> 00:38:53,802
Aren't you curious
as to where we're going?

597
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:56,165
I'm sure it's someplace far-off
and dangerous.

598
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:59,331
- And what makes you so sure?
- Chuck, we're the A-team.

599
00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:01,500
Valid point.

600
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:05,511
Well, we might as well bring this.
It's gonna be a long flight.

601
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:10,585
I'm sure we can find something else
to pass the time.

602
00:39:21,531 --> 00:39:24,159
Not to be crude,
but you were talking about sex, right?

603
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:31,363
Okay, Devon. Go time.

604
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:40,739
Babe, you okay?

605
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:43,545
I went to the Buy More
to get my dad's laptop...

606
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,019
and of course, they couldn't find it.
- It's my fault.

607
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:50,021
I should have never trusted
those jackasses.

608
00:39:50,527 --> 00:39:52,495
No, it's my fault.

609
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:56,196
I shouldn't have pretended
to be something that I'm not.

610
00:39:56,366 --> 00:40:00,234
I thought that there might be something
on my dad's computer that would...

611
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:04,868
I don't know, change the fact
that I'm just a stay-at-home mom.

612
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:07,305
Whoa, whoa. Stop right there.

613
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:11,469
You are Eleanor Bartowski Woodcomb,
Ph.D., MD.

614
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:17,052
The brainiest, sexiest, kick-assiest woman
I have ever known.

615
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:21,583
- You're not just anything, Ellie.
- Really?

616
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,617
You're Mrs. Awesome.

617
00:40:25,328 --> 00:40:27,091
Thanks.

618
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:44,942
- What happened to you?
- I've been in a drug-induced stupor...

619
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:46,514
for the last 24 hours.

620
00:40:46,683 --> 00:40:49,846
What did I tell you about letting
Jeff buy you drinks at Chili's?

621
00:40:50,053 --> 00:40:51,918
Sir, listen, Chuck and Sarah tranq'd me.

622
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:56,457
They breached our apartment.
I blew it and I'm so sorry, sir.

623
00:40:56,826 --> 00:40:59,454
So I'm turning in my wings.

624
00:41:02,365 --> 00:41:06,267
One, you're not an aviator.
Two, these wings are plastic.

625
00:41:06,436 --> 00:41:09,337
Yeah. No, I told the Southwest pilot
they were for my nephew.

626
00:41:09,506 --> 00:41:12,270
That's not the point.
The fact remains, I let you down.

627
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:15,343
And I'm sorry,
I can't lie to Chuck anymore.

628
00:41:15,512 --> 00:41:18,310
You don't have to.
From here on, we're on the same team.

629
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:21,212
Oh, yes. What a relief.

630
00:41:22,685 --> 00:41:23,811
- Okay.
- Gotcha.

631
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:25,045
All right, that's enough.

632
00:41:27,457 --> 00:41:28,651
Can I have my wings back?

633
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,465
- Mrs. Woodcomb?
- Yes?

634
00:41:39,636 --> 00:41:43,367
Hi. I believe
that I have something of yours.

635
00:41:46,976 --> 00:41:49,672
This is my dad's computer.
Where did you find this?

636
00:41:50,113 --> 00:41:51,978
The Nerd Herd gave me
the wrong computer.

637
00:41:52,148 --> 00:41:54,639
- I found your address in the bag.
- Thank you.

638
00:41:54,818 --> 00:41:57,685
You have no idea
how much this means to me.

639
00:42:00,657 --> 00:42:01,681
Hi, you're home early.

640
00:42:02,192 --> 00:42:03,216
Babe, it's dinnertime.

641
00:42:03,393 --> 00:42:04,883
What?

642
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:07,256
Clara is taking a monster nap.

643
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,830
I must have lost myself.

644
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:14,094
- Is that...?
- Yeah. Great news.

645
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,532
I found my dad's computer.
