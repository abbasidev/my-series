1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,739
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things
you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:07,380
I will do anything
to bring back Chuck's mother...

3
00:00:07,548 --> 00:00:09,982
and to eliminate Volkoff
and his organization.

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,112
- Sarah Walker, you're under arrest.
- What?

5
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:17,724
It was all a setup to establish
my cover as a double agent.

6
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,053
I'm going undercover
into Volkoff Industries.

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,196
I'm gonna take them down
from the inside.

8
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:23,887
That's how I lost my mom.

9
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:28,001
That's how you're gonna get her back.
I'm doing this for you, for us.

10
00:00:41,662 --> 00:00:43,721
That all you got? Huh?

11
00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:58,808
Hey. You seen Bartowski?

12
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:02,244
That depends on who's asking.

13
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:06,312
Sorry, I was just
workshopping a tough-guy voice.

14
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:08,154
I need some more work.

15
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:11,086
Anyhoo, I have not seen Chuck.
What's up?

16
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:14,819
Walker's been all over Europe as a
rogue agent and Volkoff's noticing.

17
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:17,486
- Wanna make sure Chuck's in the loop.
- That's great.

18
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:19,326
But seeing how Chuck is not here...

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,526
do you have a second
to have a little chitchat? Man to man?

20
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,096
Yeah, sure.

21
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:29,336
But... Sarah's gonna be undercover
in Volkoff Industries for a long, long time.

22
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,411
- Chuck could be hurting.
- Feelings. I see why you came to me.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,415
Whoa, seriously, these situations
tend to send Chuck to the dark side.

24
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:42,079
He'll wind up sitting, moping, sulking,
eating Cheetos and watching The View.

25
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:47,017
Anyways, I need your help in sort of,
I don't know, keeping Chuck's spirits up.

26
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,754
Maybe we can tranq him
till Walker gets back. That...

27
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,591
Ah. Here's Mr. Mopes now.

28
00:02:05,112 --> 00:02:06,272
- Morning, fellas.
- Hey.

29
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:09,109
You two are looking very dapper
this a.m. How's my crew?

30
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:10,944
Crew? Well, you're chipper today.

31
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:13,109
I just heard the news about Sarah.

32
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:16,723
She's well on her way to taking down
Volkoff and freeing my mom.

33
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,381
So, what's not to be happy about?

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,051
Absotootly.
We were talking about the same thing.

35
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:25,164
We're thrilled and very happy
and you're happy. Happy Chuck.

36
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:26,765
He's happy.

37
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,095
I see. I get...
I see what's going on here.

38
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,899
You're afraid I'm just gonna sit around
eating Fritos because Sarah's gone.

39
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:36,605
I thought it might be Cheetos,
but, yeah.

40
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:38,608
Look, guys, I get it.

41
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:41,748
I appreciate your concern,
but I've thought a lot about this.

44
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:50,757
But that's never gonna happen
with Sarah.

45
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:56,057
She'll always remain
the same exact Sarah Walker.

46
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:28,289
Sarah Walker.
Love what you've done with the hair.

47
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:29,890
Please, sit.

48
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:35,127
I hear you've turned against the CIA.

49
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,603
- Treason, was it?
- It was.

50
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:40,296
Mm. Bit out of character.

51
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:43,735
Years ago, I told Chuck
that I didn't want him to be a spy.

52
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:45,742
I tried to get him
to run away with me.

53
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:48,848
But despite all your pleadings,
he said no.

54
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:50,807
- He did.
- I knew it.

55
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:52,042
But I still loved him.

56
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:56,713
We got trapped in a CIA-run world
with no way out. No exit.

57
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,687
- Unless...
- There's always an unless.

58
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:00,827
Unless I took matters
into my own hands.

59
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:05,488
I turned on the CIA because
I wanna cash out and build a life.

60
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:10,362
It may sound foolish, but I'm trying
to buy a future with the man that I love.

61
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:13,904
You know, I'm a bit
of a hopeless romantic myself.

62
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:18,511
Paintings, poetry, art of massage,
that sort of stuff.

63
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:20,408
So...

64
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:24,178
what do you want?
- I wanna come and work with you.

65
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:29,149
Miss Walker...

66
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:33,754
even if you've told me the truth about
your motives, why would I trust you?

67
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:38,564
Fair question.

68
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:48,764
The reason you're going to trust me...

69
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:52,909
is because I'm not gonna kill you,
right here and right now.

70
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,717
You.

71
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:08,318
You're such fun.

72
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:10,221
Thank you.

73
00:05:10,597 --> 00:05:13,623
Welcome to Volkoff Industries.

74
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:30,153
Chuck 4x12 - Versus the Gobbler

75
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:09,262
Now, you and I have to discuss
how to best utilize your particular skills.

76
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,720
Yes, let's.

77
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:15,844
Sarah Walker, a traitor.

78
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:19,439
This I had to see
with my own two eyes.

79
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:21,516
It shouldn't come as a total surprise.

80
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:25,587
After all, your actions did serve
as a sort of inspiration.

81
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:29,048
Alexei, may I have a word in private?

82
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,863
She's going to betray you.

83
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:40,662
It depends how you define "betrayal."

84
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:42,931
Remember your intentions
when you met me?

85
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,700
Now you're my right hand.
Have dinner with me.

86
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,935
- Alexei...
- Lunch, breakfast...

87
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:51,979
a bit of cake with a cup of coffee.
- Alexei, stay focused.

88
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:56,176
You know I get great pleasure
from bending people to my will.

89
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:58,480
I do.

90
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:03,189
She could be very useful to us.

91
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:11,161
What if we had her
break Yuri out of prison?

92
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,595
That is a wicked idea.

93
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:15,502
Thank you.

94
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:20,336
Sarah, we're going to have you
break out Yuri the Gobbler.

95
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:23,378
Now, don't ask
why he's called that.

96
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:26,613
It's because he eats people.

97
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:29,850
Basically, it's a suicide mission.

98
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,681
I love a good suicide mission.

99
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:34,187
So do I.

100
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:43,156
Morgan, dude, come here,
listen to this.

101
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:51,731
- Pretty amazing, right?
- Dude, it's all sorts of amazing.

102
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,877
Are you putting Kahlua in your cereal?

103
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:56,604
Buddy, the beeps, that's Sarah.

104
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,771
- What?
- She can't use voice communication...

105
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:03,443
undercover. So the CIA developed
a tonal language that only we understand.

106
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:06,350
- Get out of here.
- And right now she just...

107
00:08:06,523 --> 00:08:08,354
She's saying she loves me.

108
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:12,254
Or planning on buying a Buick.
I can't tell.

109
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:15,455
- It's a confusing language. Lot of nuances.
- Beeps and things...

110
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,964
Morgan, can I borrow your T-shirt?

111
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:19,533
But of course.

112
00:08:19,703 --> 00:08:22,228
- I gather things are going well with Alex.
- So well.

113
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:25,864
This girl is the coolest girl I've ever dated
and I've dated almost...

114
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:28,942
- Three. Three.
- Three. Yeah. Three.

115
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:30,602
Hey, Chuck.

116
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:32,408
Don't freak out, stay calm.

117
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,279
Your girlfriend is wearing
your previously unworn...

118
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:37,977
Zemeckis authenticated
Back to the Future T-shirt.

119
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:40,116
Oh, dear sweet goodness.

120
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:44,955
- Pizza, orange juice. Pizza, orange juice.
- What?

121
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:11,579
Hey.

122
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:15,218
Come back to bed
so we can cuddle before work.

123
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:16,825
Uh-huh. Absolutely.

124
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:19,520
Totally.

125
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,097
- There's time. You can save that T-shirt.
- No, I'm cool.

126
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:27,132
- Excuse me?
- She looked really cute in it, didn't she?

127
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:30,668
Can I ask you a question?
What's wrong with me?

128
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:34,937
Nothing's wrong with you, my friend.
But I have news for you, Morgan.

129
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:37,808
- I think you're in love.
- What?

130
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,942
I'm in love?

131
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:44,954
I'm in love.

132
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:46,646
Maybe you're right.

133
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:48,188
Wow. Do I tell her?

134
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:52,556
Well, that's a kind of big deal.

135
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:53,991
Morgan?

136
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,256
Are you coming?

137
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:59,632
Let's finish this conversation at Buy More.
I have some more snuggling to do.

138
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:01,771
And, no, I'm not embarrassed
to say that.

139
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,802
On my way.

140
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:16,011
Stop exactly where you are.

141
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:22,988
One square meter of land on this
compound is never under surveillance.

142
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,491
We are standing on it.

143
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:28,688
I came here to help take down Volkoff
and to get you the hell out of here.

144
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:31,333
Which is why I want you
to break free Yuri.

145
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:35,232
He's Volkoff's trusted bodyguard,
I think he has something to do with Hydra.

146
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:37,606
- Hydra?
- Volkoff's network.

147
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:41,403
A database of weapons buyers, sellers,
his entire infrastructure.

148
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:45,674
Early on, I realized that Hydra
is more important than Volkoff himself.

149
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:48,215
- So how does the bodyguard fit in?
- I don't know.

150
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:49,852
But since Yuri was arrested...

151
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,547
Volkoff's communications
with his network have slowed to a stop.

152
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:55,453
Oh, we should go.

153
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:59,555
Sarah, I need you to realize that
going undercover in a place like this...

154
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,131
can require certain difficult choices.
- I'm well aware.

155
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:07,235
You might find yourself becoming
someone you no longer recognize.

156
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,340
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

157
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,580
- I was just coming over to see you.
- Really, about what?

158
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:24,778
I'm having a bit of an issue with Devon
and I was hoping that you could help.

159
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:27,287
I can't get him to stop cooking
with no shirt on.

160
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:28,788
It's not that.

161
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,894
I keep proposing baby names
and he keeps shooting them down.

162
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:35,156
- One after another. Nothing works.
- That's ridiculous. I'm sorry.

163
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:38,766
It's just that naming the baby
is the last planning we have to do...

164
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:41,665
before I can just relax
and focus on the birth.

165
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:44,466
Yeah. No, yeah, totally.
What can I do to help?

166
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:50,010
Well, I finally picked the perfect name
and I don't want him to shoot it down.

167
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:56,517
It's the most beautiful, unique,
precious name for a girl.

168
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:58,779
Don't keep me waiting.
What is it? Tell me.

169
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,759
- Grünka?
- She's gonna name her Grünka.

170
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:04,791
- Dude?
- Dude.

171
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:06,019
- We can't.
- You can't.

172
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:08,357
Grünka isn't what you name
your baby girl.

173
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:09,829
It's what you name...

174
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:12,763
these people.

175
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:16,495
Ellie said she wants the name
to be original, right?

176
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:20,507
I think I may know a way
to stop this Grünka in its tracks.

177
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:28,211
Hey.

178
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:31,687
I saw Alex leaving your apartment
this morning...

179
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:33,789
wearing your shirt.

180
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:36,517
Mm. Right, Alex.

181
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:40,459
Uh... Yeah, see, that's because,
uh, ahem, she didn't have her shirt.

182
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:45,061
She, well, what I was gonna say is,
she couldn't find her shirt.

183
00:12:45,235 --> 00:12:47,499
She was very cold.
So we wear lots of shirts.

184
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:49,571
And it's like a shirt party, you know?

185
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,969
It's kind of a...
Please don't kill me, okay?

186
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:54,667
I need you to know
I am a perfect gentleman with her.

187
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:57,313
And honestly,
I really do care about her.

188
00:13:01,718 --> 00:13:03,686
That is all I wanted to know.

189
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:05,845
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

190
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:10,091
Any word from Beckman
about what's going on with Sarah?

191
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,727
Still waiting for contact.

192
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:29,742
Surveillance disabled.

193
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:34,478
Whoever's in here,
you're about to enter a world of hurt.

194
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:40,288
A serious world of hurt.

195
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,494
Hello, boys.

196
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:56,099
- Hi.
- Oh, gosh.

197
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:59,106
I'm sorry for the drama,
but nobody can know that I'm here.

198
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:01,107
I had to disable the surveillance.

199
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:07,744
- Wow, Sarah, you look evocative.
- It's so great to see all of your faces.

200
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:10,751
But I don't have much time
before I have to leave.

201
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:13,412
I'm being sent
to Seabrook Supermax Prison.

202
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,081
I need you to create a diversion
for me.

203
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:22,095
Sorry, sorry, you just... You... You just...
You look so different.

204
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:24,165
You know? The hair change, that's...

205
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:27,269
That's a big... It's kind of a drastic...
How do you do that...?

206
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:29,234
- Is that a wash or a wig?
- Ahem.

207
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,341
Uh... I need you to create a diversion
so that I can break out this man:

208
00:14:33,543 --> 00:14:36,444
Yuri Gobrienko,
a.k.a. Yuri the Gobbler.

209
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:39,810
- Yikes. A big mother.
- Well, big doesn't always mean bad.

210
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,814
Here are photographs of his victims.

211
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:44,612
- Oh. No, no, no.
- Oh, that's not good.

212
00:14:44,788 --> 00:14:47,757
- That's impressive.
- The Gobbler is Volkoff's main bodyguard.

213
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:52,190
But your mom believes he has connection
Hydra.

214
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:55,954
I have to rendezvous
and find a way into the prison.

215
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:58,191
I'll meet you inside.

216
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:08,869
Sarah.

217
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:12,981
Sarah, wait. Hey.
I know you gotta go, but...

218
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:23,022
I missed you too, Chuck.

219
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,090
Wow. I... It's kind of like I'm cheating
on you with you right now.

220
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,401
Goodbye.
Call me on the secure line with the plan.

221
00:15:33,603 --> 00:15:35,400
Got it.

222
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:38,537
See you in prison.

223
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:43,108
All sections...

224
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:53,044
- What do we got?
- Transfer from gen pop.

225
00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:54,815
The inmates are having rec time.

226
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:57,619
Careful, it's been almost two days
without a stabbing.

227
00:15:57,794 --> 00:15:59,489
We're due.

228
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:09,464
I was thinking maybe we should just
postpone this mission long enough...

229
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,437
for everyone to get the stabbings
out of their system.

230
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:13,667
Chuck, listen to me.

231
00:16:13,843 --> 00:16:17,506
That tattoo on your face belongs to
the most ruthless gang in North America.

232
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:20,478
Well, you just tap on this bad boy
right here and...

233
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,050
- Uh... It's instant respect.
- What have you done?

234
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:26,484
Hmm? Just a little bit of a smudge.

235
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:31,025
Focus. Timing's limited. We can divert
surveillance for a short period of time.

236
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:33,491
And when you do,
signal me as fast as possible.

237
00:16:33,663 --> 00:16:37,099
- I can flash and neutralize the Gobbler.
- Just make sure he's out cold.

238
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:39,326
He can't know Walker had any help.

239
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:42,938
Yeah. No, good. Good old-fashioned
prison fight. I'm excited, you know?

240
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:46,041
You take out the biggest
and baddest dude in that place...

241
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:49,507
and guess who's top dog. You are.
All right?

242
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,306
You look better without. Tougher.

243
00:16:55,985 --> 00:16:57,111
All right, listen up.

244
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,717
New dude in here. Don't mean
to interrupt your game of mahjongg...

245
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,222
but we got ourselves
a real killer here today.

246
00:17:03,393 --> 00:17:06,487
Yep. New guy here
likes to fight other dudes.

247
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:10,823
I would be very, very careful
of this guy. Killer.

248
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,663
This is the guy you don't wanna
mess with, all right? He's dangerous.

249
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:17,068
Morgan, I think they get the point.

250
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:19,969
They all look like they wanna kill me.

251
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:22,168
- You're welcome.
- Okay.

252
00:17:23,012 --> 00:17:25,207
As you were, guys.

253
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:39,653
Ahem. So...

254
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:44,291
which one of you
is Yuri the Gobbler?

255
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:52,603
Please, not so loud.

256
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:58,505
What's going on? What are you doing?
What's the eye thing about?

257
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:01,013
The last time I pointed at him,
he did this.

258
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:02,742
Swallowed them whole.

259
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,751
Bartowski,
Walker arrives in three minutes.

260
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:12,554
- Prepare to initiate the fight.
- Oh, boy.

261
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:14,424
- Surveillance room's here.
- Gotcha.

262
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:18,089
So listen, Alex, you know,
hypothetically.

263
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:19,462
Very hypothetically.

264
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:24,198
How do you think she would respond
to, let's say, me saying, "I love you"?

265
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:25,432
Stupid thing to say.

266
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:28,042
- What if I mean it?
- No, the words are stupid.

267
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:31,738
You love someone, show them.
I went into her apartment, built her a shelf.

268
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:33,246
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

269
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,442
You've never told your daughter
that you love her?

270
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,644
I mean, that just seems wrong.

271
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:40,982
- I didn't ask what you think. Did I?
- No, sir.

272
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:44,551
You can talk to me.

273
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:47,719
I know a lot about love.

274
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:51,094
Yeah, no. Totally.

275
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:55,498
Moving in on the Gobbler now.

276
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:59,097
The closer you get,
the bigger he gets.

277
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:03,309
Okay, we need this guard
off the surveillance monitors. You ready?

278
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:06,573
It's the only way, right?
We gotta do what we gotta do.

279
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,975
- What's his name, again?
- Steve.

280
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:12,178
Oh, yeah. Steve.

281
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,858
- Hey.
- Who are you guys?

282
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:21,326
It goes against everything I believe in
to interfere with a guard...

283
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:25,797
protecting American citizens,
but this just has to be done.

284
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:29,635
Happy birthday, Steve.

285
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:33,003
I know it's a little late,
but all the guards down in gen pop...

286
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:35,701
we wanted to wish you
a happy birthday.

287
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:38,971
Hey.

288
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:40,809
You Yuri the Gobbler?

289
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:43,478
What do you want?

290
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:46,485
I want your seat. It looks comfortable.

291
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:54,853
You try to make point, huh?

292
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:58,564
Show everyone
that you can take me out.

293
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:02,170
Yeah, well, maybe I am
and maybe I just want your chair.

294
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:06,236
Happy birthday to you

295
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:09,378
Happy birthday to you

296
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:11,137
You got 45 seconds. Take him out.

297
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:13,538
Then let me give it to you.

298
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:38,065
Happy birthday to you

299
00:20:41,577 --> 00:20:44,102
I need a little more time here, guys.
Stretch it out.

300
00:20:45,381 --> 00:20:46,575
Guess I better get back to the grind.

301
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:52,153
How old are you now?

302
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:59,986
What the hell is going on in here?

303
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:05,029
Nobody told us there was a birthday.

304
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,465
Oh, cake.

305
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:10,003
Yeah, it's birthday cake for Steve.
Come on in.

306
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:34,162
I'm in.
What's the status on the Gobbler?

307
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,463
Uhn! He's hungry. He's hungry.

308
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:48,143
Who wants a frosted flower?

309
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:51,610
Casey, I need you
to unlock the east entrance.

310
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:14,627
Top dog.

311
00:22:14,804 --> 00:22:15,828
Yeah!

312
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,271
Thanks. I owe you one.

313
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:27,507
He's in the rec area
at the end of the hall.

314
00:22:27,683 --> 00:22:31,141
- You okay?
- Hmm? Oh, it's just frosting. Don't ask.

315
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:41,458
Hey, sweetness.

316
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:44,065
That's a mighty fine chair
you got there.

317
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:45,700
I want it.

318
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:48,166
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Honestly? Right now?

319
00:22:48,337 --> 00:22:50,396
I can't just be top dog for a minute?

320
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,304
Get up.

321
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,811
Ooh!

322
00:23:00,516 --> 00:23:01,847
Damn, that's fine.

323
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:04,384
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

324
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,052
- Well, looks like you're top dog now.
- What?

325
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:12,126
It doesn't matter.

326
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:26,940
Let's go. Move it. Come on.

327
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:30,068
I love sourdough.

328
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,747
I love you.

329
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:42,918
- Was that weird? That finger-kiss thingy?
- A little. But I love you too.

330
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:45,893
I hate this. When you leave.

331
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:48,257
But it's all gonna be over soon.

332
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:51,055
I hope so.

333
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:55,568
Of course... Of course it will.
We got the Gobbler, that's big, right?

334
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:57,933
It could be, yeah.

335
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:02,536
Chuck, your mom's been doing this
for many years.

336
00:24:02,712 --> 00:24:05,306
It just could take some time.

337
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:10,245
Okay.

338
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:17,187
I'll let you know what we learn.

339
00:24:18,094 --> 00:24:20,790
- Bye.
- Bye.

340
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:41,975
I'm thinking about a new toaster,
babe.

341
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:44,745
I mean, toaster technology
has come a long way.

342
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:48,323
Hello, beautiful friend.

343
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,722
Eleanor. Uh... Can I be of help?

344
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:53,987
We were talking about
a new toaster oven.

345
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:57,257
Toaster oven?
More like bun in the oven. Am I right?

346
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,332
- Sure.
- Any thoughts on names, or...?

347
00:25:00,503 --> 00:25:03,028
Actually, we have.
We're naming her Grünka.

348
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:06,174
- Grünka.
- Grünka, wow.

349
00:25:06,342 --> 00:25:09,607
Wow, I lost my virginity
to a girl named Grünka.

350
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:13,340
Filthy, filthy lady.
Hardly believe she was a grandmother.

351
00:25:13,516 --> 00:25:17,384
- Oh, that's just gross, babe.
- She was gross.

352
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:20,044
Sticks in the head.
We should rethink the name.

353
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:22,514
Actually, I'm pretty happy
with my choice.

354
00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:24,284
Sorry to interrupt.

355
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:28,429
Were you guys talking about that famous
Armenian serial killer, Grünka Kassabian?

356
00:25:28,598 --> 00:25:30,190
- What?
- Serial killer?

357
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:33,064
Yes. Yes, we were.

358
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:38,237
Don't think that I don't understand
what you're doing here.

359
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:41,535
I'm gonna wait in the car, okay?

360
00:25:43,713 --> 00:25:44,941
Mission accomplished.

361
00:25:49,151 --> 00:25:53,645
- Grünka, huh? Love that name.
- I haven't even told you the name yet.

362
00:25:54,323 --> 00:25:57,759
Right. Ask first, then say my line.

363
00:25:57,927 --> 00:25:59,053
Sorry.

364
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:01,658
Hi. Um...

365
00:26:02,131 --> 00:26:04,656
Huh. Yeah.
So, what are you naming your baby?

366
00:26:12,808 --> 00:26:14,571
Yuri.

367
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:16,336
So good to see you.

368
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:17,842
Mr. Volkoff.

369
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:21,983
I love working with this man,
we have a long and storied history.

370
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:24,984
You know, when you were captured,
I was at a complete loss.

371
00:26:25,154 --> 00:26:27,281
My safety compromised.

372
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,857
The one and only agent who has
complete access to my Hydra database...

373
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,555
under lock and key.

374
00:26:34,964 --> 00:26:36,022
I am sorry.

375
00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:42,433
Oh, don't apologize, I'm not angry.

376
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:46,473
Just disappointed.

377
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,543
Disappointed?

378
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:52,875
Well, a little disappointed.

379
00:26:53,816 --> 00:26:56,376
No, very disappointed.

380
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:10,328
Sorry.

381
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,959
I have a hard time
with disappointment.

382
00:27:16,138 --> 00:27:19,574
Feels weird coming back from a mission
without Sarah, doesn't it?

383
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:22,836
A little bit.
Could just be indigestion, though.

384
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:25,003
We ate a lot of cake.

385
00:27:25,848 --> 00:27:30,842
You know, Sarah and I just kind of
started this ritual after a rough mission.

386
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,923
We'd order a pizza and play a board game.
Just to unwind, you know?

387
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:39,125
Guess that's not gonna happen
for a while, is it?

388
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:44,199
Hey, did we record The View?

389
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:47,961
Oh, shoot.
I don't know if I did that or not.

390
00:27:48,137 --> 00:27:50,901
But it's funny you should mention
the board game thing.

391
00:27:51,073 --> 00:27:54,668
We were talking about how we were
itching to play a classic board game.

392
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:56,004
Weren't we, Casey?

393
00:27:57,346 --> 00:27:59,405
- We were.
- We were.

394
00:27:59,582 --> 00:28:01,413
So.

395
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:03,446
Great.

396
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:05,552
Alexei, what did you do?

397
00:28:05,721 --> 00:28:08,087
He's the only one
who knew about Hydra.

398
00:28:08,257 --> 00:28:10,782
No, Yuri didn't know about Hydra.

399
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:14,362
Yuri was Hydra.

400
00:28:22,204 --> 00:28:23,228
Just a moment.

401
00:28:27,777 --> 00:28:29,404
Got it.

402
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:38,318
I hired Yuri to carry this device on him
at all times.

403
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:43,390
It costs him an eyeball, but earned him
an unparalleled place in my corporation.

404
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:52,798
Yeah, but Yuri got careless.
Got himself captured.

405
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:56,961
So the Hydra device
had to be extracted.

406
00:28:57,406 --> 00:28:59,806
So this is your database?

407
00:28:59,975 --> 00:29:01,772
Much more than just a database.

408
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:04,105
This is how I communicate
with my people.

409
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,339
None of them knows each other.

410
00:29:06,515 --> 00:29:09,609
None of them are aware
of what part they play in my puzzle.

411
00:29:09,785 --> 00:29:12,117
Hydra allows me to see everything.

412
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:17,854
Hydra is the heart
of Volkoff Industries.

413
00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:21,827
But the fact that you're even seeing this
proves that it has a flaw.

414
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:35,167
Human error.

415
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:40,843
Yuri's shortcomings made me realize
what a risk the eye was.

416
00:29:41,016 --> 00:29:43,109
So you just destroyed
the whole system?

417
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:47,113
Of course not.

418
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:50,884
I just downloaded all the data
to a more secure backup location.

419
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:54,990
Good, no more complications.

420
00:29:55,164 --> 00:29:56,290
Now, good work, Sarah.

421
00:29:56,465 --> 00:29:58,194
But before I reward you...

422
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:01,268
there is one small issue
that we have to take care of.

423
00:30:02,538 --> 00:30:03,971
Come.

424
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:06,964
The jet's ready to depart.

425
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:08,268
Actually, no.

426
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:12,037
There are two issues.

427
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:15,510
We've got a dead body on the floor.

428
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,813
Phyllis, clean up.

429
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:25,919
World domination. Never gets old.

430
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:29,926
Thanks for keeping my spirits up,
I really appreciate it.

431
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:34,035
Yeah, of course. If there's anything else
you feel like talking about, feel free.

432
00:30:34,203 --> 00:30:35,898
I'm a good listener, and Casey's...

433
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:41,241
Casey. Yeah. Well, I get it.
That's... It's hard, you know.

434
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,243
I wish I could bottle my feelings up,
not be so vulnerable.

435
00:30:44,413 --> 00:30:46,745
You should tell that
to your armies in Australia.

436
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,243
You gotta be kidding me.

437
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,382
Okay.

438
00:30:54,456 --> 00:30:57,118
Who is that? Is it Alex?

439
00:30:57,326 --> 00:31:02,195
Because maybe if we're all in this
sort of, I don't know, caring mood...

440
00:31:02,364 --> 00:31:05,527
maybe you could send her a little text
that says, "I love you."

441
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:08,192
- Would be nice for you.
- Walker, she needs to meet.

442
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,066
- She didn't use the secure line?
- Something must be up.

443
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,867
- Okay, fine, let's go then.
- She said alone.

444
00:31:14,043 --> 00:31:17,206
- Volkoff must be in the vicinity.
- No, forget that, she needs us.

445
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:20,871
Bartowski, this is a delicate situation.
Volkoff knows who you are.

446
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,486
Now, you stay put.
If trouble comes up, I'll be in contact.

447
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:40,792
When you broke the Gobbler
out of prison...

448
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,495
did you by any chance happen
to run into this man?

449
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:47,333
I was using him.

450
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:50,171
He's still loyal to me,
why not take advantage of that?

451
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:51,943
Good answer.

452
00:31:52,114 --> 00:31:53,638
Now, let's prove that it's true.

453
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:57,985
I took the liberty of posing as you
in summoning him here.

454
00:31:59,822 --> 00:32:04,919
All I want you to do is go up
to the ninth floor and kill John Casey.

455
00:32:09,164 --> 00:32:12,156
Frost will go with you
to make sure it all happens correctly.

456
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,830
Oh, by the way, I'll be watching.

457
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:22,208
So let's make it exciting.

458
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:24,543
Have fun with it.

459
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:40,926
There are so many cameras.
How am I supposed to make this look real?

460
00:32:41,096 --> 00:32:44,429
I don't know.
But if you find a way, give him this.

461
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,935
I will. Buy me some time
if Volkoff comes up here.

462
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,077
Buddy, I can't take it anymore.

463
00:33:05,254 --> 00:33:07,518
I gotta figure out
where Casey is meeting Sarah.

464
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,554
I know you miss your girl,
believe me...

465
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:11,817
but Casey said
that we have to stay put.

466
00:33:11,994 --> 00:33:14,189
No. This is not about me missing her,
okay?

467
00:33:14,363 --> 00:33:17,196
What if they're in danger?
What if they need the Intersect?

468
00:33:17,366 --> 00:33:20,665
I'm going to Castle,
maybe I can hack into Casey's phone.

469
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,236
Trident Tower, ninth floor.

470
00:33:24,406 --> 00:33:25,498
What?

471
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:28,040
Trident Tower, ninth floor.
Where they're going.

472
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,474
I'm good at the
"quick look when you get a text...

473
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:33,410
but you didn't know I looked" look.

474
00:33:33,582 --> 00:33:35,982
You're angry at me
because I withheld information.

475
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:39,314
I get it, but, dude,
I thought I did it for your own good.

476
00:33:39,488 --> 00:33:42,252
And by the way, I didn't even know
that you were gone...

477
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:43,686
so that's interesting.

478
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:46,521
I'm just pretty much here
talking to myself.

479
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:48,492
My turn.

480
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,233
What you doing, Walker?

481
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:31,838
Thattagirl.

482
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:37,040
- What are you doing?
- I'm supposed to kill you.

483
00:34:37,212 --> 00:34:38,236
Volkoff is watching.

484
00:34:41,116 --> 00:34:42,947
Good. Now, follow my lead.

485
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,089
Something's up. There are guards.
Casey was contacted off the secure line.

486
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:54,923
Call you when I have eyes on him.

487
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,170
Chuck, you're just in time.

488
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:06,102
Just in time for what?

489
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:10,138
There's a particular moment...

490
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:13,979
when an agent makes the decision
to stop pretending...

491
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:16,974
and to take the leap
to join the other side.

492
00:35:17,152 --> 00:35:20,144
It's a game-changing step.

493
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:22,817
Your mother made it
all those years ago.

494
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:26,017
Now, if you'll come with me...

495
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:29,454
we'll see if Sarah's going to make
the same step.

496
00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:33,324
I think she will. Come on.

497
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:40,840
I can't leave here without killing you.
How do we sell this?

498
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:43,273
- Duck.
- Uhn!

499
00:35:43,478 --> 00:35:45,708
Retrieve your weapon,
shoot me in the shoulder.

500
00:35:45,914 --> 00:35:47,279
I'm not gonna shoot you.

501
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:50,350
Look who I found.

502
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,714
Chuck, what are you doing here?

503
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:58,450
Well, I thought we had a truce, but I like
a little rascal who doesn't always listen.

504
00:35:58,627 --> 00:35:59,719
Truce, huh?

505
00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:02,920
You have an interesting way
of keeping your end of the bargain.

506
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,462
Okay, then...

507
00:36:07,302 --> 00:36:08,997
- throw me out the window.
- What?

508
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:11,230
Throw me out the window.

509
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:15,238
Look, there's a little platform
down there. It's only 40 feet.

510
00:36:15,444 --> 00:36:16,502
I've done 60, easy.

511
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:22,075
- I'll be fine, promise.
- Okay, but you better be fine.

512
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:24,310
Or else I'll really kill you.

513
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:28,445
- I'm here to find Casey. Where is he?
- I'll show you.

514
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:31,822
When you get back to Castle,
give this to Chuck.

515
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:39,666
Quite a brawl.

516
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:44,529
Sarah?

517
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:45,866
I notice your gun's gone missing.

518
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,838
- You want me to finish him?
- No.

519
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:56,082
Kill him, Agent Walker.

520
00:36:56,585 --> 00:36:59,850
- Kill him.
- Is that all you got? Huh?

521
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:12,230
No! No, Casey!

522
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:13,629
No!

523
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:25,144
Aah!

524
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:46,063
It's done.

525
00:37:46,268 --> 00:37:47,530
What...?

526
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:51,236
- Why?
- Why?

527
00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:53,874
Don't you see, Charles?

528
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:55,270
She did this all for you.

529
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,912
A bit of advice, you might want
to give her a bit of space.

530
00:38:00,082 --> 00:38:03,017
Taking a leap like this is painful
for all involved.

531
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:06,210
But congratulations...

532
00:38:06,922 --> 00:38:10,050
you're one step closer
to the woman you love.

533
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:14,188
Chuck.

534
00:38:15,097 --> 00:38:17,088
- Chuck?
- You ready to go?

535
00:38:22,204 --> 00:38:24,104
I'm ready.

536
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:29,839
Good.

537
00:38:42,057 --> 00:38:43,115
I'm sorry.

538
00:38:43,692 --> 00:38:47,253
Maybe involving Chuck's cronies
wasn't the best idea.

539
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:48,726
It was the worst idea.

540
00:38:48,897 --> 00:38:52,731
Look, not having the baby named
is making me a little anxious.

541
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:57,395
And I understand if you don't like that
name, but you haven't liked any name.

542
00:38:57,572 --> 00:39:00,973
- What? I've liked names.
- Like what?

543
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,201
Like, um... Like Clara.

544
00:39:05,247 --> 00:39:06,544
Well, I like Clara.

545
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:09,441
- Really?
- Yeah.

546
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:12,413
Clara. Is that her name?

547
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:16,079
This is a huge decision. One that will
set her path the rest of her life.

548
00:39:16,258 --> 00:39:19,625
Devon, we are gonna have to make
a million decisions like this.

549
00:39:19,795 --> 00:39:22,423
- This is called being a parent.
- This is the first one.

550
00:39:22,597 --> 00:39:25,828
I think I've been stalling
just because I wanna get it right.

551
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:27,969
Okay, I'll make it easy for you.

552
00:39:28,136 --> 00:39:30,400
Clara or Grünka?

553
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:32,096
Clara it is.

554
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:36,568
Little Clara Woodcomb.

555
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,440
You thought
I was gonna name our baby Grünka.

556
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:44,517
Grünka, the name of the spoons
that I bought at IKEA.

557
00:39:46,655 --> 00:39:49,488
- I had you going there for a minute.
- Spoons?

558
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,124
- Mm-hm.
- From IKEA?

559
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:52,692
That's right.

560
00:40:11,413 --> 00:40:13,005
It gets easier.

561
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,845
How?

562
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,519
Distance.

563
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:26,387
Ladies...

564
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:30,520
invigorating work back there.
Let's get home.

565
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,031
How, Morgan?

566
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:39,670
How could she do this?

567
00:40:41,576 --> 00:40:44,136
Oh, my God. Dad.

568
00:40:45,347 --> 00:40:46,541
He looks awful.

569
00:40:49,217 --> 00:40:53,176
I barely even know him,
but I already love him so much.

570
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:56,722
I know. I know. He's gonna be okay.

571
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,950
I promise.

572
00:41:02,264 --> 00:41:05,256
And he loves you too.

573
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:06,729
Trust me.

574
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:08,893
More than you know.

575
00:41:54,082 --> 00:41:55,242
Distance.
