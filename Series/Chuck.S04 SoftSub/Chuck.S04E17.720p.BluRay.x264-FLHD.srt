1
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:04,588
Hi, I'm Chuck.
Here are a few things you need to know.

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:07,232
I have nothing to do
with Alexei Volkoff.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,336
- Then why does he pay for the manor?
- Because I'm his daughter.

4
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:14,371
- My father never gave me any key.
- Yes, sweetheart, he did.

5
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:17,567
When you were young,
a token of his affection.

6
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:20,008
Your whole life
your father's been grooming you.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,115
You are his succession plan.

8
00:01:04,703 --> 00:01:05,897
I give up.

9
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:08,130
Strange reaction.

10
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:13,001
Most people show
a bit more enthusiasm...

11
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:15,941
when they receive a gift.

12
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:20,175
- Sorry, who are you?
- My name is Riley.

13
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:22,081
I'm your father's lawyer.

14
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:24,916
Your father...

15
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:28,249
left a letter for you.

16
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:34,792
"My dearest daughter Vivian...

17
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:39,435
as you know,
I've met an untimely demise..."

18
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:41,367
Sorry.

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,098
What are you doing?

20
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:46,975
Well, he specified
that I read the letter in his voice.

21
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:49,807
He thought it would
make you feel comfortable.

22
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:51,006
Please, stop.

23
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:54,812
I spent several weeks perfecting this.

24
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:57,820
But fine.

25
00:01:59,524 --> 00:02:02,391
"I'm sorry
I was never much of a father.

26
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:07,129
If I could do it over again,
I would trade my entire empire...

27
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,164
for another moment with you.

28
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:15,230
But we can't relive the past...

29
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:18,865
which is why I have groomed you
for the future.

30
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:23,879
That card in my safe will help you
rebuild Volkoff Industries."

31
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:26,483
Mr. Riley,
I'm well aware that my father...

32
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:30,985
now wants me to take over
his evil corporation.

33
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:32,890
So how can I say no?

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,884
No.

35
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:41,226
- Nobody ever said no to your father.
- Then I'll be the first to do it.

36
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:43,524
I'm sorry...

37
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:44,794
I can't allow that.

38
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,202
Now, perhaps
you'd like to rethink your answer.

39
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:52,674
Hmm?

40
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:11,060
Okay, roses or orchids?

41
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:15,893
Uh... I don't know. Roses?
What do you think?

44
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,973
- Not very whimsical.
- And that's good?

45
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:28,840
If that's what you want.

46
00:03:29,548 --> 00:03:32,278
Uh, okay, well...

47
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:33,884
Orchids?

48
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:36,912
Sorry. Sarah.

49
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:40,252
I'm sorry, I just... I don't have
a strong feeling either way.

50
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:44,452
I just don't think I'm cut out for this.
What if you just make the choices?

51
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:46,961
Okay, you know what?

52
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:50,499
Maybe this girly stuff
is a little outside your comfort zone.

53
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,500
I will tell you that at some point...

54
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:56,300
every bride feels a little overwhelmed
with this stuff. I totally did.

55
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:58,909
But there was a moment
where that all changed.

56
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:02,012
I remember I had gone to pick up
our wedding bands...

57
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,777
and I finally held them in my hands
and it all just became so real.

58
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:12,447
I was getting married to the man
that I love, for the rest of my life.

59
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:17,459
And then I just broke down crying,
which sounds ridiculous right now.

60
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:21,292
- Yeah, a little.
- A lot. But it was a turning point.

61
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:26,301
You know, from that moment on,
everything became magical.

62
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:28,837
It was my wedding.

63
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:31,608
I don't know when,
I don't know where...

64
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:35,143
but I promise you,
it's gonna happen to you.

65
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:44,683
You know what? New apartment,
I'm gonna go no television.

66
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:46,187
It'll be very liberating.

67
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:52,888
Kidding. I'm totally kidding.
Seventy-two inches, dude. Bam.

68
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:56,158
I was honestly about
to smack you right now.

69
00:04:57,202 --> 00:05:00,069
So how's the apartment hunting going,
anyway?

70
00:05:00,238 --> 00:05:03,071
It's, uh... Pbbt. Oh, man,
it couldn't be going better.

71
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:04,970
I found a place. A little pricey.

72
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:08,135
- So I'm looking for a roommate.
- That shouldn't be a problem.

73
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:12,511
I hope not. And in the meantime,
it's kind of nice being at my mom's.

74
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:16,745
- Buddy, I gotta say, I'm a little relieved.
- Chuck, this is needed on my part, okay?

75
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:22,416
I am growing mentally and emotionally,
physically... Not so much physically.

76
00:05:22,594 --> 00:05:25,529
But some people are saying
that I'm acting taller.

77
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:29,595
Uh, I gotta get down to Castle.

78
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:34,398
Buddy, I'm so glad that everything's
going so well. You're killing it.

79
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:38,165
Have a great day. Talk to you soon.

80
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:42,778
Hey, son. You sleep okay last night?

81
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:45,848
No. No, I did not.

82
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:49,517
Those cats outside the window
are so loud. They gave me nightmares.

83
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:52,122
Yeah, cats.

84
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,693
Just a heads up. Those cats
are having a romantic dinner tonight.

85
00:05:57,429 --> 00:06:01,229
And there might be more cat fighting
after dinner ends.

86
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,923
Unless your mom eats too much.

87
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:06,400
Listen, I don't wanna think about you
and my Mom doing...

88
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:08,630
Making a... Slipping and...

89
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,707
Son, when you move into the forest...

90
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,038
you can't complain that the wildlife
is making too much noise.

91
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,709
It's only natural. And beautiful.
And frequent.

92
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:21,909
- I need my own place.
- Yes, you do.

93
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:25,784
You went to Volkoff's headquarters
and you were attacked?

94
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:27,822
Yes. I shouldn't have gone to Moscow.

95
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:31,223
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- It's okay. You're safe here.

96
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:34,888
Now, this man Riley, he wants you
to rebuild your father's empire?

97
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:38,729
Yes. But I told him I don't want anything
to do with my father.

98
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:42,669
Did he happen to say what his plan
for rebuilding Volkoff was?

99
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:45,602
I think this may have something
to do with it.

100
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:56,820
We need to talk to Beckman.

101
00:06:56,988 --> 00:07:00,355
So Volkoff has all of his money
in the First Bank of Macau.

102
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:02,924
- We need to freeze those funds.
- We do.

103
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:05,927
But the First Bank of Macau
is no easy target.

104
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:08,861
It's really operated
by the Guan Yi Crime Syndicate.

105
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:13,197
The guards are mercenaries.
We've lost agents inside of there before.

106
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:17,137
But we've never had
an account holder working with us.

107
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:21,040
That makes Vivian the perfect asset.
With her help, we'll be able...

108
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:24,375
to get through the bank's security
and access her father's accounts.

109
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:27,881
Um, general, I'm not so sure...

110
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:32,716
that Vivian is really built
for this sort of mission, you know.

111
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:34,654
Not to mention the fact that...

112
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:38,125
she was pretty clear about
never wanting to see her father again.

113
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:42,130
Well, it's your job to change all that.
You're a spy, she's an asset.

114
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,862
If this mission is going to work,
you need to turn that girl into a Volkoff.

115
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:57,473
Chuck 4x17 - Versus the First Bank of Evil

116
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,577
Fabulously bearded man...

117
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:37,738
seeks roommate ASAP.

118
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:41,878
No, Morgan, don't lead with the beard.
Let it be a pleasant surprise.

119
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,749
Morgan.

120
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,753
Hey, buddy. You look sharp.

121
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:49,291
Listen,
you're obviously a worldly fellow.

122
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:52,453
I was wondering if you could settle
a little debate betwixt us.

123
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:55,963
Where do you think
would be the best place to meet ladies?

124
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:59,797
A Renaissance Faire, right?
Or a methadone clinic?

125
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:04,732
- It's okay if the ladies are really ugly.
- Really? I don't... A Renaissance Faire.

126
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,969
Okay. Interesting.
Can we have two weeks off...

127
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:10,808
to go a Renaissance Faire?
- Not a chance.

128
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,814
- See?
- I don't have time to discuss it.

129
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,419
I'm in the middle
of a housing crisis now.

130
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:17,521
Really? Dude. Dude?

131
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:20,453
We have an extra room
in our apartment-slash-van.

132
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:25,859
So how about this, a place to stay
in exchange for, say, one week off?

133
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,430
- Hmm.
- Uh?

134
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,761
No.

135
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:33,302
Manager to Register 7, please.

136
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,939
Okay, I'm not... I'm done here.

137
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,041
Thank you for the offer
but no thank you.

138
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,109
"Slash-van."

139
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:40,767
See yourselves out, please.

140
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,579
He's a heartbreaker, a soul crusher.

141
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,149
I'm gonna pin that guy down
and shave his beard.

142
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:54,549
Looks like Morgan's potential
roommates are meeting him here.

143
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:57,456
If Morgan won't let us go
to the Renaissance Faire...

144
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:01,292
we'll bring the Renaissance Faire
to us.

145
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:05,230
I have no idea
what you're doing right now.

146
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,735
So you want me to help you
break into my father's bank.

147
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:09,965
Absolutely not.

148
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,508
I've had way too many guns
pointed at me recently.

149
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,839
We'll be there to protect you
the entire time.

150
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:18,312
Look, most years,
I saw my father maybe once.

151
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,849
The longest conversation
we've had is 10 minutes.

152
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:23,920
I get that, I do.
Believe me, I understand.

153
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:27,489
Your father was a criminal mastermind
who forgot your birthdays too?

154
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:29,217
No.

155
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:32,325
But he did leave me
when I was 13 years old.

156
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:35,496
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

157
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:40,004
All I ever wanted to do
was ask him the same questions...

158
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,663
that I know are swirling around
in your head now.

159
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:47,540
Why'd you leave? Why didn't you ever
even make an attempt to contact me?

160
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,706
- Did you ever get to ask him?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,875
And I learned that even though
my father wasn't around...

162
00:10:56,054 --> 00:10:58,887
it didn't mean
he wasn't thinking about me.

163
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,284
Look,
I don't know what you'll find out...

164
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,792
but I can guarantee you
that if you help us...

165
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:08,262
we can help you find at least some
of the answers that you're looking for.

166
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:13,367
When the thugs running the bank
meet Volkoff's daughter...

167
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:15,972
they're gonna be expecting
someone intimidating.

168
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:19,905
And your current outfit
doesn't really scream "bad guy."

169
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,137
I wasn't planning on infiltrating a bank
when I got dressed this morning.

170
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,874
Well, we can fix that. Smile.

171
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,718
It's kind of like J. Crew for spies.

172
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,454
Wow.

173
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:44,068
Yeah. It's also got some really cool
makeover features that are built in...

174
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:48,764
in case you wanna do a full...
Not that I've ever... Anyway...

175
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,103
Go ahead, try it on.

176
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:01,012
So meet me in the armory
when she's done.

177
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:03,813
Yeah. One sec, though,
I wanna show you something.

178
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:09,293
- What do you think?
- It's a little formal for a bank job.

179
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,520
You're right,
it is formal for a bank job.

180
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,358
What do you think of it,
I don't know, for our wedding?

181
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,798
Oh. Oh, the wedding. Yeah.
Yeah, you'll look great in that.

182
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:20,130
Very, very handsome.

183
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:23,206
What's going on? What's wrong?
Something's wrong with you.

184
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,038
- Because you love me in a black tie.
- It's just that this is not my thing...

185
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:30,009
and I feel like
I'm letting you guys down.

186
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,810
You're not letting anybody down.

187
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,785
- Was that Casey?
- Yeah.

188
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:40,816
Casey. Hey. Casey.
Yo, what's going on?

189
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,688
Nothing. Just getting a Hot Pocket.

190
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,698
Love me some Fiesta Chicken, huh?
The way the cheese and the chicken...?

191
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:51,233
We haven't seen you for a while.
You okay?

192
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,201
I'm fine. Let's hook up later.
We'll get facials and chat.

193
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:57,500
We're shipping out in a few hours.
Don't you need to get ready?

194
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,203
Actually, Beckman has me
working on a mission of my own.

195
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:06,207
- What mission would that be exactly?
- Can't really talk about it. Sorry.

196
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:10,218
But I hear you guys are hitting
the First Bank of Macau.

197
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,547
Be careful.

198
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:22,726
I'm here to heed your call
for a roommate.

199
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:27,202
I know, it's intimidating
to be in the presence of a king.

200
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:29,172
You'll get used to it.

201
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,571
Oh, also, I do dishes.

202
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:34,576
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell me about yourself?

203
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:37,442
Well, my parents died in the plague.

204
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:39,582
Okay. Um...

205
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:43,452
- Do you have any pets?
- No, no pets.

206
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,283
I'm not a big pet guy.

207
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,516
- Good to know.
- I like to work in leather.

208
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:50,456
You are gonna go down
on the top of the...

209
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:52,187
You may kiss the ring.

210
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:54,088
Okay.

211
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,827
Okay.

212
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,966
How...? Look, I think there's been
some sort of misunderstanding.

213
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:06,736
I don't believe you're here
for the same ad that I put out.

214
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,780
I don't know what ad you're talking about
but the Buy More's a delicate cover.

215
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,746
You need to shut down this now.

216
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,317
I have no idea what happened.

217
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:18,445
I put out a simple ad to find a roommate
and all these weirdoes start showing up.

218
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:23,660
- Go, go, go.
- Go, weirdo, go. Go, weirdo, go.

219
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,856
Got it.
Those idiots messed with my post.

220
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:32,061
Good luck getting a roommate now.
Perfect.

221
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:36,904
Wait a minute. I got it.
Casey, you have an extra room.

222
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,839
- Not even worth saying.
- Think about the possi...

223
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:42,309
Think about the...

224
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,952
Vivian, remember,
this place is highly dangerous.

225
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:53,818
You need to act like, well, your father.

226
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:57,484
- Chuck will pose as your bodyguard.
- I'll be your very own Kevin Costner.

227
00:14:57,662 --> 00:15:00,153
You'll present
your account card to the bank manager.

228
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,961
He will lead you to the vaults.
Remember, the vault is highly restricted.

229
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:08,435
Once in the vault, you're gonna have to
pass a pretty rigid verification process.

230
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:12,042
I'm not good with tests.
What happens if I don't pass it?

231
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,108
Just, you know, pass. You'll be fine.

232
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:19,341
If you're ever at a loss, just look to me,
I'll be right there.

233
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:21,041
Stay close.

234
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:33,554
May I help you? I'm sorry,
we aren't accepting any new accounts.

235
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,064
Miss Volkoff
is already an account holder.

236
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,802
Miss Volkoff?

237
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:43,997
I wasn't aware
this account had changed hands.

238
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:49,873
Please come with me.

239
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:57,351
Account holders only.

240
00:15:57,522 --> 00:16:01,390
I am her Kevin Cost... Bodyguard.
I am her bodyguard.

241
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,725
It's okay.

242
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:09,898
We'll find another way to the account.
I'm getting you out.

243
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:12,866
You said this might be my only way
to learn about my dad.

244
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,666
- Yeah.
- Then I'm doing it.

245
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:37,660
We've run into a kink in the plan. Security
stopped me from following Vivian.

246
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:41,162
- Okay, which way did they take her?
- Main staircase.

247
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:45,701
Okay, there are emergency stairs
across the lobby, east wall.

248
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,270
That should take you up
to the vault level.

249
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,105
I'm gonna need a key card.

250
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,204
Time to be a spy.

251
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:59,847
Hi, big fella. Sorry about that earlier.
Little security faux pas.

252
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:04,216
I know because we're both in the biz.
You know, the "security biz."

253
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:07,220
My real concern
is just for Miss Volkoff's safety.

254
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:10,053
How do we know she's properly
protected in that vault?

255
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:11,820
- She's safe.
- So you say.

256
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:14,123
And I wanna believe you, I really do.

257
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,130
But what if someone were to break in?

258
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,395
Perhaps, oh, I don't know,
a kung fu master?

259
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:24,201
A little bit of this? Or one of these?
How about swooping it and pushing it?

260
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:29,177
Okay. I believe you. I get it.

261
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:30,974
Point taken. Point taken.

262
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:33,845
- Chuck, what are you doing?
- I'm a believer.

263
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:41,348
- Sarah, I'm in.
- Oh, good. Okay.

264
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:46,220
- Where are we?
- The vault level, Miss Volkoff.

265
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:48,228
Follow me.

266
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:01,370
- What's going on?
- Standard security procedure.

267
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:05,376
Place your hand there, on the table.

268
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:10,551
Sorry. Please step back.

269
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:16,225
We needed a DNA sample to make sure
you are who you say you are.

270
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:19,522
There should be no problem
as long as you're telling the truth...

271
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:22,928
and no one has removed you
from your father's account.

272
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,750
Sarah, I'm on the vault level.
No sign of Vivian.

273
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,147
Copy.

274
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,948
There should be a junction
in the hallway to your east.

275
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:46,886
Copy. Moving east.

276
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:49,117
Oh, no.

277
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,819
- Stepping back. What?
- No, it's not you. You're fine.

278
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,158
I just got a text from your sister.
She wants to go cake tasting.

279
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,925
Cake tasting. How awful.

280
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:01,101
Okay, you should see
two doors up ahead of you.

281
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,273
Yep. Heading toward them now,
but don't change the subject.

282
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:12,014
Look, I know that this wedding stuff
is supposed to be really fun...

283
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,913
but I just find it
a little overwhelming.

284
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,816
You know, the cake and the flowers
and the venue and...

285
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:20,253
Maybe it would be
a little less overwhelming...

286
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,360
if you would just pick one thing
to get excited about...

287
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,791
ease your way in.

288
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:48,645
Sarah, I just flashed.

289
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,880
They have servers here, stolen
from the Chinese army a year ago.

290
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,284
What are they using them for?

291
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,450
I have no idea, but a bank
wouldn't use military-grade tech...

292
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,222
unless they were
up to something serious.

293
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,496
Please state your full name.

294
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,475
Vivian McArthur Volkoff.

295
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,373
What business
would you like to transact?

296
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:19,539
I would like to access
my father's account.

297
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:26,679
Are you working
with a law-enforcement agency?

298
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:31,656
No.

299
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:41,396
Vivian Volkoff...

300
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,402
you have...

301
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:48,437
passed our test.

302
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:52,441
The account is yours.
Sorry for all of our extreme measures.

303
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,279
You'll find subsequent visits
to be significantly less invasive.

304
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:58,183
Here.

305
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,587
Your father's safe-deposit box.

306
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,088
This was all he kept at this bank?

307
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:08,255
Your father once told me this contained
his most prized possessions.

308
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,219
What are you doing down here?

309
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:32,913
You guys sure hide the ATMs
around here, don't you?

310
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,321
- Is everything okay?
- Nothing I can't handle.

311
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:39,628
I spoke too soon. I can't handle it.
I need help.

312
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:40,821
I'm on my way.

313
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:52,834
I'm afraid there's been
a small problem.

314
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,205
Your bodyguard was found
in a secure area.

315
00:21:55,747 --> 00:22:00,241
I am so sorry, Miss Volkoff.

316
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,718
Were you trying to steal?

317
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,466
I trusted you.

318
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:19,596
This is what you do to me?
To my reputation?

319
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,331
Please, Miss Volkoff.
This isn't necessary.

320
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,635
This isn't your concern.
You haven't been lied to like I have.

321
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:32,315
What I mean is, there is no need
to do this on bank property. Yes?

322
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,698
I'll take him from here. Thank you.

323
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:51,528
You can hand him over
to my head of security.

324
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:01,070
Vivian's getting pretty good at this,
isn't she?

325
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,042
Miss Volkoff.

326
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:06,512
I'll admit I didn't see
the family resemblance at first.

327
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:11,654
But now I see your father in you.

328
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,410
So there's no way these things
could be a clue...

329
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,679
to where your father hid his funds?
- No.

330
00:23:22,855 --> 00:23:26,484
I mean,
these are all just pictures of me.

331
00:23:26,993 --> 00:23:29,860
So nothing on Volkoff's money.
Looks like we hit a dead end.

332
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:34,193
Unless Langley uncovers something
about those servers that you saw.

333
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,496
Excuse me.

334
00:23:41,574 --> 00:23:44,441
It's crazy. I mean,
I barely ever knew my father...

335
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:47,943
and now I discover that he's been
watching me this whole time.

336
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:50,513
- I feel like I deserve some answers.
- You do.

337
00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:54,915
At least you got to talk to your father.
I'm never going to be able to do that.

338
00:23:56,188 --> 00:23:57,348
Maybe you will.

339
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:59,718
I thought the CIA
had him locked up somewhere.

340
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:02,156
Yeah. But I am the CIA.

341
00:24:02,762 --> 00:24:05,287
I can ask around,
see if we can set up a meeting.

342
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:08,763
- Are you serious?
- I know what you're going through. I do.

343
00:24:09,368 --> 00:24:13,395
If you really wanna talk to your father,
I can do everything that I...

344
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:18,939
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

345
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:22,714
Hey. So, what's the wedding epiphany?

346
00:24:22,882 --> 00:24:26,374
I just realized we have been going
about this wedding planning all wrong.

347
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:27,576
- We have?
- Yes.

348
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:30,779
You don't build a wedding around
flowers or the cake or food.

349
00:24:30,956 --> 00:24:32,719
What do you build
the wedding around?

350
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:35,793
Uh, the weather?

351
00:24:36,328 --> 00:24:40,264
The dress, Sarah.
You build the wedding around the dress.

352
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:43,561
I know you're not the typical
wedding-dress girl, but I thought...

353
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:46,102
- It seems like it could be fun.
- Really?

354
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:50,504
Yeah. I've been looking for a way to ease
into this, and I think this might be it.

355
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,008
In fact, I'm gonna
go do some research right now.

356
00:24:53,512 --> 00:24:54,979
Okay.

357
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,655
Oh, God.

358
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:10,358
No.

359
00:25:15,634 --> 00:25:17,659
Maybe.

360
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:18,856
Oh, my God.

361
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:21,392
It's perfect.

362
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:35,211
We're getting married.

363
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,581
Oh, my God.

364
00:26:39,752 --> 00:26:42,050
We're getting married?

365
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,923
- Pretty dress.
- I know.

366
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:57,324
Might wanna get a new one, though.
Looks like this one's been on a mission.

367
00:27:05,377 --> 00:27:08,278
Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa.

368
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:10,741
I know what you two did to my ad.

369
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,413
And guess what? You owe me.

370
00:27:14,386 --> 00:27:17,082
We owe you? You owe us.

371
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:20,715
You would be nothing without us.
You get that?

372
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:23,123
Look, I just need a place
to stay for tonight.

373
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:25,729
- And you said you had the room.
- Sorry, friend-o.

374
00:27:25,898 --> 00:27:27,365
Vacancy's been filled.

375
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:32,599
- Really?
- Come. Let us adjourn to our castle.

376
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:35,264
Can you believe
we get to live with a king?

377
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:41,440
This is gonna score us
some serious Ren-tang.

378
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:53,454
We've just heard back from Langley.

379
00:27:53,626 --> 00:27:56,186
Using the stolen servers,
the bank is turning itself...

380
00:27:56,395 --> 00:27:58,454
into a black market stock exchange...

381
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:02,032
laundering money for criminals,
terrorists, and rogue nations.

382
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:05,102
If we could access those,
that intelligence would be priceless.

383
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:08,536
Exactly, Agent Walker.
Which is why we still need Miss Volkoff.

384
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:10,971
As an account holder,
she can enter the bank...

385
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:13,839
and manually upload
a digital tag to their network.

386
00:28:14,013 --> 00:28:16,914
Bartowski, do you think
you can get the asset to do that?

387
00:28:18,517 --> 00:28:22,681
Yes, yes, I think I can, but we might have
to give her something in return.

388
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:26,014
She would like a meeting
with her father.

389
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,550
A meeting? With Alexei Volkoff?

390
00:28:30,362 --> 00:28:33,820
After all she's been through,
don't you think we owe her that much?

391
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:38,993
- Fine. I'll set it up.
- Thank you, general.

392
00:28:39,171 --> 00:28:42,402
There is one more thing.
In order to keep the bank from realizing...

393
00:28:42,574 --> 00:28:45,168
what Miss Volkoff is doing,
we'll need a diversion.

394
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:46,709
What did you have in mind?

395
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:49,712
Gear up.
You two are going to rob a bank.

396
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:05,068
So it comes down to this.

397
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:25,459
Buy More? Why would there be
a facility at the Buy More?

398
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:27,965
They got facilities
like you wouldn't believe.

399
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:31,196
I've seen everything,
nothing surprises me.

400
00:29:33,775 --> 00:29:37,142
The only other TR-476
I'd installed before was in Langley.

401
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:38,471
So why here in Burbank?

402
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:42,377
If it's above my clearance, I don't ask
questions. Neither should you, Todd.

403
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,677
- Just making conversation.
- Don't.

404
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:28,885
No, it's just maintenance, I believe,
over here in Sector 7G.

405
00:30:29,397 --> 00:30:31,331
Sir.

406
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:40,697
Hi.

407
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,343
- Casey.
- What are you doing here, Grimes?

408
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:48,676
Nothing. Nothing. I was...
I needed a place to stay, as you know...

409
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,341
so I thought I could
just crash here for tonight.

410
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:54,946
- What did you see?
- I don't have very good eyesight.

411
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:59,252
I thought they were installing DirecTV
or something because they were...

412
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:01,258
There was some... Nothing. I should go.

413
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:04,626
I'll sleep under my desk at Buy More.
It's probably more comfortable.

414
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,063
If you could point me
in the right direction...

415
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:09,999
John... Yeah, oh, you're still there.
Okay.

416
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:19,277
- We are delighted to see you again.
- Thank you so much.

417
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:22,382
I'm glad you were able to accommodate
me at such a late hour.

418
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,541
Our clientele demands
constant access.

419
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:28,086
Okay, she's in. You ready to do this?

420
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:33,822
- What are you doing?
- What? We're robbing a bank, right?

421
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:37,486
- You packed them, I thought...
- In case we had the chance to go out later.

422
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:40,828
- Take them off. You'll wreck them.
- Sorry.

423
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:43,060
That's better.

424
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:48,801
Now...

425
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:50,640
let's go rob a bank.

426
00:31:56,117 --> 00:31:58,483
Take as much time as you need.

427
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:04,853
Just let him know
when you want to leave.

428
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,388
Ma'am, wait here, please.

429
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:24,764
- Drop it now!
- This is a robbery!

430
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:27,533
Everybody stay down!

431
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:43,054
Miss Volkoff, may I come in?

432
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:48,251
The CIA is not on your side, you know.

433
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:51,625
You're simply an asset to them,
they've been using you.

434
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,027
No, it's not true.

435
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,465
Did one of them
seem to understand you...

436
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,764
you know,
what you're going through?

437
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:02,875
And did he use that connection
to get you to help him?

438
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:06,744
And was it this one?

439
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,281
Yeah, this is Charles Carmichael.

440
00:34:12,453 --> 00:34:15,286
He's the agent responsible
for putting your father in jail.

441
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:22,286
Keep filling those bags, people.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

442
00:34:22,463 --> 00:34:23,760
- Having fun?
- A little.

443
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:27,128
- Takes your mind off the wedding.
- Actually, it hasn't been so bad.

444
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:30,099
I took you up on your advice,
and I found a dress.

445
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:31,295
- Hey.
- Ellie was right.

446
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:33,440
When I put it on, it felt like magic.

447
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:36,576
Get down on the ground
before I blow your freaking head off!

448
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:39,645
I'm so glad you found a dress.
I bet you look gorgeous in it.

449
00:34:39,814 --> 00:34:42,749
Don't be a hero, my friend!
I will break your face!

450
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:48,253
It's actually really pretty. I never thought
I would say this, but I felt like a princess.

451
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:53,953
- Mr. Riley, my father is a criminal.
- That's what they call him.

452
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:59,789
You saw what your father left for you
here at the bank.

453
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:03,167
He loves you, you know?

454
00:35:03,738 --> 00:35:07,970
The CIA has used you.
You know that, right?

455
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:11,370
Chuck promised
I would get to meet my father.

456
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:15,037
No, you're not gonna get
to see your father...

457
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:17,615
because they don't want you to.

458
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:23,120
There's only one way that you can
truly learn about your father.

459
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,451
When you're ready...

460
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,152
you let me know.

461
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:36,369
Oh.

462
00:35:39,907 --> 00:35:42,000
You left this in your father's office.

463
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,847
Thought you might like to have it.

464
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:01,695
- Don't shoot. I'm unarmed.
- Get down here.

465
00:36:01,862 --> 00:36:04,387
Come on, come on.
It's about that time, honey bunny.

466
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:07,728
Nobody follow, we have a hostage.
Keep walking.

467
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:10,928
No one shoot. She's a Volkoff.

468
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:16,934
Thank you, Bank of Macau. It's been
a pleasure doing business with you.

469
00:36:37,198 --> 00:36:39,826
Mission accomplished.

470
00:36:42,903 --> 00:36:45,895
Hey, you did great in there.

471
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:47,438
Thanks.

472
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:51,435
Everything all right?

473
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:54,337
Yeah. Everything's fine.

474
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,442
Okay.

475
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:11,559
You successfully planted the tracer
in the First Bank of Macau's servers...

476
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:14,599
and made the break-in
look like a legitimate robbery.

477
00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:19,102
The digital tag is already leading us to
terrorist organizations around the globe.

478
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:21,935
- Good work, team.
- Uh, general, sorry.

479
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:26,169
About the deal that we made with Vivian.
When does she get to see Volkoff?

480
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:29,077
Yes. After some consideration...

481
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,242
we have decided the security risks
are too great. I'm sorry.

482
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,443
No, no, no.

483
00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:37,085
I promised her
she'd be able to see her father.

484
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:39,920
- What am I supposed to tell her now?
- Agent Bartowski...

485
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:42,358
you told your asset
what she needed to hear.

486
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:45,430
That's what a spy does. Well done.

487
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,597
Do you need my help telling her?

488
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:54,036
No.

489
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,039
Thanks, though.

490
00:37:56,577 --> 00:37:59,239
She trusted me. I'll do it.

491
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,910
Vivian, I'm sorry, but they're not gonna
let you see your father.

492
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:09,919
What?

493
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:13,891
- What do you mean?
- They went back on their word.

494
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:16,586
They? The CIA?

495
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:19,289
- But I thought you were the CIA.
- I am.

496
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:24,130
It's just... It's... It's complicated.

497
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:27,933
I'm not giving up. I promise
I will find a way for you to see him.

498
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:30,838
It just might take a little while,
that's all.

499
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:36,239
Look, I know this is a lot
to handle right now. Are you okay?

500
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:39,018
I'm fine.

501
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:42,512
Thank you for being honest with me.

502
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:49,789
You told me I had to choose
between roses and orchids...

503
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:52,592
but that was before you showed me
Casablanca lilies.

504
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:55,530
- I need a hundred dozen.
- A hundred dozen? More?

505
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:58,864
I'm sorry. What about the cake?
Did you like the hazelnut cream...?

506
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:01,507
It reminded me
of this amazing patisserie in Paris.

507
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:05,441
I think maybe we should fly the cake in.
Definitely we should fly the cake in.

508
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:09,048
That sounds really expensive especially
after that dress you picked out.

509
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:11,843
You only get married once.
This is meant to be special.

510
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,953
Plus, it'll make Chuck really happy.

511
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:17,386
I should look into booking
a private island for the ceremony.

512
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:18,889
Yes.

513
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:21,787
Oh, my God.

514
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:27,392
Ellie, what the heck was that?

515
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:30,966
I think I created a monster.

516
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:34,904
Yeah?
Because I work at the Buy More...

517
00:39:35,075 --> 00:39:38,010
and that stuff sounds kind of pricey.

518
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,773
Maybe you could
just pick up a few extra shifts.

519
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:44,974
Or rob a bank.

520
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,677
Ha. You.

521
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:51,881
Oh, what's going on there,
Case Logic?

522
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:56,087
Case Logic? Mid-90s, held your CDs?

523
00:39:56,697 --> 00:39:58,858
- You're clearly not a nickname guy.
- Oh, God.

524
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:01,524
And, well, look,
I just wanted to apologize...

525
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:03,431
about, you know, snooping around.

526
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:06,232
I just want you to know
I just needed a place to sleep.

527
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:10,070
But between you and I, what was exactly
going down there in Castle? I mean...

528
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:11,302
Nothing.

529
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,077
Not very nice. Okay. Well...

530
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:21,119
Then that wasn't some weird,
mysterious door...

531
00:40:21,321 --> 00:40:23,516
that I saw you walking out of?

532
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:27,623
Look, you're right. I have no idea
what I'm even talking about.

533
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:30,695
There's obviously some
rational reason...

534
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:33,799
you would have a TR-476
in some weird, strange room.

535
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:36,458
I'm just overtired.
I haven't slept, I haven't eaten.

536
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,298
I just really want a place to stay.

537
00:40:38,472 --> 00:40:39,530
- Grimes?
- Yeah.

538
00:40:39,706 --> 00:40:41,867
Are you leveraging me
to stay in my apartment?

539
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:44,203
I don't...

540
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:46,137
Am I?

541
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:49,873
Let's say I was. Is it working?

542
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:55,388
Okay. You can stay at my place
as long as you keep quiet...

543
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,751
don't tell anyone,
especially Bartowski.

544
00:40:57,925 --> 00:41:01,156
Casey, you have no idea how much
this means to me. Come here.

545
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:05,161
Don't get excited. I'm keeping you close
to make sure you keep your mouth shut.

546
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:06,957
Because if you don't...

547
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,665
I know where you live.

548
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,997
Right, because...

549
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:18,099
- Scram.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

550
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:48,469
Hey, Vivian, it's Chuck and...

551
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:51,835
Look,
I know that you must be feeling...

552
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:56,977
Just give me a call
when you get a chance.

553
00:41:57,551 --> 00:42:00,543
If you could. That'd be great.
Thanks. Bye.

554
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:18,070
I'm ready to learn the truth
about my father.
