2
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:19,652
You know that feeling
when a guy you like

3
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:21,661
sends you a text at
two o'clock on a Tuesday night

4
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:23,572
asking if he can come and find you

5
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:26,037
and you've accidentally made it out
like you've just got in yourself.

6
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:28,237
So you have to get out of bed,
drink half a bottle of wine

7
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,077
get in the shower, shave everything,
dig out some Agent Provocateur business

suspender belt, the whole bit

9
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:34,258

12

Oh. Hi.

Hey.

Hey.

18
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,933
After some pretty standard bouncing

19
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:13,374
you realise he's edging
towards your arsehole.

20
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:17,531
But you're drunk and he made
the effort to come all the way here.

21
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:19,936
So you let him.
He's thrilled.

22
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:21,450
Oh!

23
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:23,253
I'm so thrilled.

24
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:34,570
And then the next morning
you wake to find him fully dressed

25
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:38,580
sat on the side of the bed,
gazing at you.

26
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,052
He says that...
- Last night was incredible.

27
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:50,172
Which you think is an overstatement.

28
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:52,292
But then he goes on to say that...

29
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:56,574
It was particularly special because
I've never managed to actually...

30
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:00,774
up the burn with anyone before.

31

And although it's always
been a fantasy of mine

33
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:09,176
I've never found anyone
I could do it with.

34
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:12,456
And then he touches your hair.

35
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:20,016
And thanks you with a genuine earnest.

36
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:23,774
Thank you.

37
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:27,218
It's sort of moving.

38
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:29,411
Then he kisses you gently...

39
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:37,779
and then he leaves.

40
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:50,252
And you spend the rest
of the day wondering...

once threw some punch in my face.

- Thousands.

342
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:55,459
Whoa.
Can I have it?

343
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:56,980
<b><font color=#ca004b>[SHE LAUGHS]</font></b>
- No.

344
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:06,979
What's that?

345
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,934
Oh, um,
my self-portrait.

346
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,050
Oh.

347
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:22,937
<b><font color=#cf685c>DAD:</font></b> Right, it's here.
- Oh, er, I think I can hear your dad.

348
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:27,333
<b><font color=#cf685c>DAD:</font></b> Cab's here!

349
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:28,610
Thanks.

350
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:29,856
Ah, nice of him.

351
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:34,253
Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

352
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:41,852
Um, please look after yourself.
You really do look ghastly, darling.

353
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:51,418
Oh, a café, eh?

354
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:52,690
Yeah.

355
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:55,778
On your own?

356
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,415
Er, kind of.

357
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,257
Kind of? Go on.

358
00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:03,214
<b><font color=#ca004b>[SHE LAUGHS]</font></b>
- It's quite a funny story actually.

359
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:06,299
On no, that's good,
it'll keep me going. Shoot.

360
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:09,938
I opened the cafe with my friend, Boo.

361
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,733
Cute name.
- Yeah.

362
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:13,613
Yeah, she's dead now.

363
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,777
She accidentally killed herself.

364
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,734
It wasn't her intention
but it wasn't a total accident.

365
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:20,294
She didn't actually think she'd die

366
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:23,732
she just found out that her
boyfriend fucked someone else

367
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:26,341
and wanted to punish him
by ending up in hospital

368
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,611
and not letting him visit her for a bit.

369
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:31,175
She decided to walk
into a busy cycle lane

370
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:34,373
wanting to get tangled in a bike,
break a finger maybe.

371
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:37,015
But as it turns out bikes go fast
and flip you into the road.

372
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:40,019
Three people died,
she was such a dick.

373
00:24:42,821 --> 00:24:44,494
<b><font color=#ca004b>[SHE LAUGHS]</font></b>

374
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,217
So yeah.
Kind of on my own.
