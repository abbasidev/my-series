it's about the beauty of sex

90
00:03:57,644 --> 00:04:00,204

Sex brings life.

94
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:14,402
I've been building this sexhibition
since I was 11 and a quarter

95
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:16,840
which is when I first climaxed

96
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:19,835
by accident on a bidet.

97
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,472
The bidet is, of course,
exhibited here as are

98
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:26,123
all the pieces from my
first ever sexhibition.

99
00:04:27,164 --> 00:04:28,164
All apart from one.

100
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:30,118
A few weeks ago

101
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:34,803
one of my most delicate pieces
was stolen from my studio.

102
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:35,959
<b><font color="#ca004b">[CROWD GROANS]</font></b>

103
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:39,036
But in a sense it was a blessing.

104
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:42,724
In fact, her brutal
snatching made me think of

105
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:45,035
all the women of the world
who have been robbed

106
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:48,397
of their freedom, of their happiness

107
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,001
and, in the saddest of
cases, of their bodies.

108
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,393
So in many ways I have to thank the thief

109
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:58,160

piece of work to date.

your genitals at the door

113
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:10,878

about sex when they see a naked body

and I know that my body, as it is now

352
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:03,482
really is the only thing I have left

353
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:06,835
and when that gets old and
unfuckable I may as well just kill it.

354
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:12,321
And somehow there
isn't anything worse

355
00:22:13,444 --> 00:22:15,913
than someone who
doesn't want to fuck me.

356
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:19,322
I fuck everything.

357
00:22:21,204 --> 00:22:23,761
Except for when I was in
your office, I really

358
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:25,960
wasn't trying to,
that was an accident.

359
00:22:30,164 --> 00:22:34,237
Either everyone feels like this a little
bit and they're just not talking about it

360
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:37,593
or I am completely fucking alone.

361
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:42,557
Which isn't fucking funny.

362
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:53,598
Right, well, er...

363
00:22:55,444 --> 00:22:57,481
I should probably, um...

364
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,642
I should probably, um...

365
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,033
I should probably...

366
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:41,836
People make mistakes.

367
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:51,640
That's why they put rubbers
on the ends of pencils.

368
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:55,073
Is that a joke?

369
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:57,764
I don't know.

370
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:04,233
I think we should start
your interview again.

371
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:08,164
Here?

372
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:09,684
Yeah.

373
00:24:10,244 --> 00:24:11,244
Go on.

374
00:24:11,924 --> 00:24:12,924
Okay.

375
00:24:14,284 --> 00:24:16,514
Well, thank you for coming in.

376
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:19,599
No problem.

377
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:24,523
I've read through your application form.

378
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,837
Says you run a café for guinea pigs.

379
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,238

380
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:32,593
Told you it was funny.

00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:35,483
