them like that, before they all...

going to come running back.

Just a tomato sandwich?

355
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,130
Yes.
There a problem?

356
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,329
No.

357
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,940
Listen, I don't want to know
anything about this surprise party.

358
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,975
But if you could just... have it at mine,
this Friday at 7.30, that'd be great.

359
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,378
I can organise it and act surprised,
but if you could just...

360
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,809
Do you know what?
Why don't I just do it?

361
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,818
I can organise it,
do the food, act surprised

362
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,817
and just... take it off your hands.

363
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,420
I mean, I can see that you're busy, so.

364
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:26,774
Okay.
If you want.

365
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,495
Well, I don't want to, but I think it'd be
easier for everyone if I could just...

366
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,610
Okay.

367
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,574
I mean, I've done it. It's done.
It's this Friday at 7.30, at mine.

368
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,860
Great.

369
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,692
How behind are you?
If it's money that you need...

370
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,060
I don't need money.

371
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,651
That'll be £25, please.

372
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,409
London.

373
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,060
Thanks.

374
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,620
Can't believe that thing's still alive.

375
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,130
Oh, um... any news on Harry?

376
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,454
Yeah, we're back together.

377
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,457
Oh God.
I can't keep up.

378
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,054
Hello?

379
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,459
Harry?

380
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,573
Oh... Shit!

381
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,455
Surprise, surprise, surprise...

382
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,256
Surprise!

It's me! It's me! It's me! It's me!

384
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,890
Why would you do that?
I thought I was going to get raped!

385
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,090
I'm sorry! I just...
Baby, I'm sorry.

386
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,380
I thought you wanted a surprise.
It was a ninja surprise.

387
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:35,569
Oh my God, my heart.
I'm shaking so much. Oh my God.

Oh my God!

00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,053
Oh...
- Oh my God.

391
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,216
Okay. It's okay.
Are you okay?

392
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,819
Oh my God.

393
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,100
Did you have a good day?
- I did, yeah. It was fine, thanks.

394
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:50,859
Baby, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't think...

395
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,619
I didn't think you were
going to react like that. I...

396
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,449
I'm sorry, it was a joke.

397
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,573
It was a good joke.

398
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,129
Jesus.

399
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,137
I thought you'd be later.

400
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,614
Yeah, I...

Oh, God, sorry, I just...
I think I'm still in shock.

403
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,059
That was horrible.

404
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,613
It was a surprise.

405
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,732
I know. Thank you.
It's fine.

406
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,938
Shall I go and get us some wine?

407
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,215
Okay.

408
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,900
I know what you look like!
I know what you took!

409
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,817
That is the last time!

410
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,849
Splashed out on a
special bottle for a special...

411
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,535
Harry?

412
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,379
Had to go into the history
on my computer

413
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,811
to find something I'd seen on the
H&M website this morning, and...

414
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,259
I don't want to point fingers, but...

415
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,613
anal, gangbang, mature,
big cock, small tits

416
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:09,497
hentai, Asian, teen, MILF,
big butts, lesbian, gay

417
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,771
facial, fetish, bukakke, young and old

418
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,053
swallow, rough, voyeur, and public.

419
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,616
Why are you being so sexy?

420
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,851
Don't make me hate you.

421
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,571
Loving you is painful enough.

422
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,533
Okay, sorry.

423
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,130
But I really think you should
write that down.

424
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,476
I know it's not appropriate, but I really
think you should write that down.

425
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,900
It's really good for a line.
- I'm not going to write down...

426
00:23:43,949 --> 00:23:45,749
No, no, I'm serious!
For your songs and stuff.

427
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:48,640
It's perfect.
It's poetic, yet real. Serious.

428
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,413
Don't make me...

429
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,690
Hate you.
- Yeah, I know! Thank you!

430
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,973
Loving you is painful...

431
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,012
What am I doing?

432
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,900
There's someone at work who loves me.

433
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,540
Well, she told me she loves me,
and I said we couldn't be together

434
00:24:19,564 --> 00:24:21,441
because I had to know.

435
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,293
Do you want to be alone?

436
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,093
You will never see me again.

437
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,411
I'll always love you,
but I just can't take it anymore.

438
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,012
I don't hate you, I'm scared for you.

439
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,018
He's going to write that down.

440
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,772
I don't hate you... scared.

441
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,855
I'm going to go pack my things up
from the bedroom again. But...

442
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,652
I'm not going to clean.

443
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,089
It's still in pretty good shape, so.

444
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,576
If I don't see you after that, goodbye.

445
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Forever.

446
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,934
He'll be back.
