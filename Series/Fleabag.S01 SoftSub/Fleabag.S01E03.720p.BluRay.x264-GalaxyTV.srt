Jogging.

2
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,571
I did a fart the other day
that was exactly like Mum's.

3
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,816
A door opening or suspicious duck?

4
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,259
Door opening.

5
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,174

6
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,972
God, I'd be lucky.

7
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,931
My bottom dropped ages ago.

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,096
My farts used to be like, pah.

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,373
Now they're just sort of
fighting their way out.

10

I haven't farted in about three years.

Thanks.

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,930
So, it's a 7pm arrival tonight
for a 7:30 surprise, okay?

15
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,334
Yeah, I got your email.

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,939
It's really a business birthday thing.

17
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,336
It won't be much fun
so just don't expect a party party.

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,609
I won't.

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,574
And maybe just wear trousers.

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,019
And don't drink too much.

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,937
There's this huge promotion in Finland.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,497
So this party is quite a serious...
I mean, it's basically a business meeting.

23
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,417

Oh, I don't know yet.

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,374
It's really inappropriate
to jog around a graveyard.

29

Why?

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,055
Flaunting your life.

31
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,770
God, I can't wait to be old.

you look older than you are.

Hello, Claire speaking.
- Mum died three years ago.

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,730
She had a double mastectomy
but never really recovered.

37
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,694
It was particularly hard
'cause she had amazing boobs.

38
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,734
She used to tell me I was lucky
'cause mine would never get in the way.

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,851
My sister's got whoppers.

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,210
But she got all of Mum's good bits.

41
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,454
What's Martin given you?

42
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,935
Oh, cursory stroke'd be nice.

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,493

No bang bang?

44
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,534

that thing on his...

- Yes, you do.

49
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,940
No, not here. No.
- Come on, little one, come on, please.

50

- Thank you.

51
