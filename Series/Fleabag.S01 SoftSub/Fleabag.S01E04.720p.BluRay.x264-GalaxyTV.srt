your voice in your head

in your skull.

Probably for the best.

340
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,672
So is your business...

341
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,515
surviving?

342
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
I'm sorry.

343
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,319
Oh, I don't want that.

344
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,554
So you're doing the whole
silent escape thing?

345
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Indeed.

346
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
Going well?

347
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,437
I touched a colleague's breast

348
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,870
more than once

349
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,150
at a party, I...

350
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,318
They asked me to go on a workshop to...

351
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
huh.

352
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,549
I'm just a very...

353
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,073
disappointing man.

354
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,073
No thanks, I'm trying to quit.

355
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,399
Those, on the other hand...

356
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,076
They keep asking me:
"What do you want from this workshop?

357
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,315
What do you want?"

358
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,877
I'm not telling them what I want.

359
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,234
I wanna move back home.

360
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,713
I want to hug my wife.

361
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,189
Protect my children,
protect my daughter.

362
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,676
I wanna move on.

363
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,036
I want to apologise, to...

364
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,035
everyone.

365
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,713
I wanna go to the theater.

366
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,960
I want to take clean cups
out of the dishwasher

367
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,194
and put them in the cupboards... at home.

368
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,032
And the next morning I want to
watch my wife drink from them.

369
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,509
And I want to make her feel good.

370
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,031
I want to make her orgasm again...

371
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,755
and again.

372
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Truly.

373
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,794
I just wanna cry, all the time.

374
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Claire?

375
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,153
Have you seen my sister?

376
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,359
<b><font color="#cf685c">BOO:</font></b> Hi, this is Boo.

377
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,791
I can't come to the phone right now
but please leave me a messiagio

378
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,114
and I'll get back to you.

379
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,309
<b><font color="#ca004b">[PHONE BEEPS]</font></b>

380
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,920
Someone should probably disconnect that.
