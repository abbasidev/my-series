appointments once a year

to make sure our tits don't
turn on us like mum's did.

missing in this house, don't they?

346
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,091
Big house.

347
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,210
Yes, lovely house.

348
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,975
Oh, the sculpture turned up.

349
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,020
Did it?
- Yes. Must have just toppled off the side.

350
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,571
Well... if you rid a woman
of her head and limbs

351
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,540
you can't expect her to do
anything other than...

352
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:50,956
roll around.

353
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,176
<b><font color="#ca004b">[THEY LAUGH]</font></b>

354
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
What?

355
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,734
Oh, your father and I often say

356
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,772
when you've had a few drinks
you're so like your mother.

357
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,573
<b><font color="#cf685c">GODMOTHER:</font></b> Oh, whoops... look at these.

358
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,091
So the party's moved to the hallway,
always a good sign.

359
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,450
Does anyone mind if I leave,
I've got a dicky tummy?

360
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
So swift.

361
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Thanks.

362
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,740
I'm not going to kiss you
because I'm probably very ill.

363
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,614
You too, come on.

364
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,574
Goodbye then, my... my daughters.

365
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Goodbye.

366
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,890
What a lovely occasion.

367
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,098
Yeah, see you at the sexhibition.

368
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,859
No, there's absolutely no need...
- Yes, lovely.

369
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,619
No, no, we'll definitely be there.
I will definitely be there.

370
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,012
Hold up... Yeah,
trying to keep me overnight?

371
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,097
<b><font color="#ca004b">[LAUGHS]</font></b>
- Very good looking.

372
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,340
I might never see you again.
You're very good looking.

373
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,321
Yes, yes, very good looking.

375
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,580
Thanks, I owe you.

376
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,499
No, I owe you.

377
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,260
It's been really nice to spend
the day with a normal family.

378
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,820
I actually feel quite emotional.

379
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,860
Will you stay with me tonight?

380
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,820
Sure.

381
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,054
I'm gonna go warm up the bike.

382
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,100
Lovely to meet you, Claire.

383
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:40,124
You too.

384
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,374
Um, what's his...

385
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,330
Fucked me up the arse.

386
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,415
Oh that's...

387
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,775
I totally see that now.

I'm sorry if I was a...

390
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,215
Listen to me...

391
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,454
I'm going to leave Martin.

392
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,172
I'm going to give you
the money for the cafe

393
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,653
and I'm gonna go to fucking Finland.

394
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,129
Okay.

395
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,329
Oh and...

396
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,820
That is the coolest thing
you've ever done.

397
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
I know.

398
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Thanks, Claire.

399
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,609
Shall we...?

400
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,580
We can try.

401
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,620
I'll see you at the sexhibition?
- Yeah.
