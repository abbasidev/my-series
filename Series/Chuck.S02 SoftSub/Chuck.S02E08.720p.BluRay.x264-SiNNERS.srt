-Hi, happy Thanksgiving.

694
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,745
First time we can experience
a turkey, dude.

695
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:02,292
Ellie, do you realize that Lester and Jeff
of the Nerd Herd are at our table right now?

696
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,878
-Everything okay?
-The Awesomes couldn't make it.

697
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,212
So you know me.

698
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,089
Just expand Thanksgiving.

699
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,258
-Okay.
-Happy Thanksgiving.

700
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,801
You too.

701
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,720
-Are you okay?
-Of course. Yeah.

702
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,388
Why do you ask?

703
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,766
Because Morgan told me
about you and Jill.

704
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,435
I'm sorry, I just--

705
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,728
I was worried about you.

706
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,063
Um, no. Yeah, everything's good.

707
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,025
She wanted to see if we could work it out
and give it a second try.

708
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,568
And?

709
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,572
And I realized that Jill, Stanford and Bryce,
that's the story from my past.

710
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:38,912
But my new story is you and Sarah
and these freaking yahoos.

711
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,456
And sometimes,
it can be a really fun story.

712
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:42,999
Swedish Bikini Team.

713
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,543
-Flying DeLorean.
CHUCK: Hey, Morgan.

714
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,337
Come on, buddy.

715
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,839
Anyway, where was I?

716
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,758
You were saying
how the turkey's made.

717
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,802
-Saying that this turkey is voluntary.
-It's more of a draft.

718
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,723
Toast to, uh, some of the great, uh, faces
that I know...

719
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,517
...and new ones to Thanksgiving.

720
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,769
LESTER: We don't know each other.
JEFF: Hear, hear.

721
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,938
DEVON:
Happy Thanksgiving.

722
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,106
Great job, baby.

723
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,737
