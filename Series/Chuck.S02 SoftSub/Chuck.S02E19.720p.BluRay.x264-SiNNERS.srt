CHUCK: Hi, I'm Chuck.
Here are a few things to know.

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,047
Is there any way
Intersect images can be taken out?

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,466
-Removed? Only Orion would know.
-Orion.

00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,094
ORION: It's good to finally
see you face to face.

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,597
The cards are the schematics
for the new Intersect. Study them.

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,434
Find Fulcrum's intersect,
you could get your life back.

7
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:22,271
I promised Ellie that I'd find our dad,
but I've tried everything. He's nowhere.

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,773
It's like he's fallen
off the face of the earth.

9
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,525
Dad?

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,873
-I'm sort of freaking out here.
-I know.

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,417
But he's your father.
He seemed happy to see you.

12
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,626
CHUCK:
You think?

13
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,296
I thought it was lack of recognition
followed by shock.

14
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,131
STEVE: You take cream?
-Huh?

15
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,217
Yeah. No.
Whatever's fine.

[WHISPERS]
I can't remember if I take cream.

17

-Just relax.
-How?

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,474
I haven't seen my dad
for, like, 10 years...

19
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,685
...and now I'm sitting in his living room
slash kitchenette...

20
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,312
...while he's making us coffee.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,732
Plus let's just say the last time
I saw him he was kind of--

22
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:11,070
I mean, he tended to be a little--
What's the word? Crazy.

Thank you.

It's good to see that face again.

27
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,088
Yeah, yours too.

28
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,674

30
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,638
Who cares about me? Tell me about you.

Well, I-- There's not much to tell.

Went to Stanford, work at Buy More.

33

Stanford. Not bad.

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,690
He was always a genius, this one.

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,569
-Well, not like you.
-You're right.

36
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,446
He was smarter.

37
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,243
-What about Ellie, how is she?
-Really great, actually.

38
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,745
She's a doctor now.

39
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,540
And in a few weeks,
she's gonna get married...

Ellie's getting married?

42
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,299
She is.

43
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:21,306
That's actually mainly why we're here.

44
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:25,435
Ellie was really hoping that you might be
there to walk her down the aisle.

45
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,063
Oh, I don't think
she would want me there.

46
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,025
I mean, of course she does. We both do.

47
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,027
It's not a good idea.

48
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,281
But tell her that I'm happy for her.

49
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,490
Are you joking?

50
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,742
You have to do this.
She's your daughter.

51
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,578
Charles, I can't.

52
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,081
I don't wanna hear what you can't do.
I've seen what you can't do.

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,759
I'm sorry. I....

-No, it didn't.

I left, and you're mad.

Look, Dad,
I'm not even here for me, really.

00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,572
Okay? Right now, I just--
I want you to come home for Ellie, please.

59

I like you coming up here
and fighting for Ellie.

Yeah, I think so.

Yeah.

Maybe he's not as crazy
as I remembered.

Okay,
let's go get your sister married, huh?

This would be perfect
for the rehearsal dinner...

74
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,928
...because if I wear that dress
this will match.

Sounds good.

-Ellie, hey.
-Hey, Chuck, just a sec.

wasn't the best idea.

I was. Yeah.

But then I realized that...

...we can hate him for the rest of our lives
or we can choose to forgive him.

97

could cause irreparable damage...

Why don't we just contact Roark
and tell them?

136
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,741
We can't, out of fear of alerting
those who might be involved.

In a world of pain.

516
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,682
I can't believe this.
My father invented the Intersect.

517
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,351
That's not true. I didn't invent all of it.

518
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,187
Just the really cool stuff.

519
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,064
Come on.

520
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,444
Granted, I can understand
how this might complicate a few things.

521
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:13,115
Complicate a few things? I saw you die.
I saw you explode in a helicopter.

522
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,575
I see how I could have
given you that impression.

523
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:19,538
I've had to die quite a few times.
One of the perils of being Orion.

524
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,415
This isn't what I wanted, Chuck.

525
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,419
When I realized what the government was
gonna do with the Intersect, I had to run.

526
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:29,297
I knew our guys wouldn't be the only
ones looking for me. More importantly...

527
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,010
...I knew I had to stay away
from you and your sister.

528
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,391
Wait, Dad.

529
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,560
You were protecting us?

530
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,441
I knew I'd have to spend
the rest of my life hiding from the Intersect.

531
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,361
But I never imagined
that it would find you.

532
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,783
It must be such a curse to have
all those secrets trapped in your head.

533
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,119
That's why I came back.

534
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,206
That's why I let your handlers find me.

535
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,418
It's my fault
that Fulcrum's after both of us now.

536
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,464
You wanted me to flash
on your crazy schematics.

537
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,924
To break in here.
Why didn't you say who you were?

538
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,342
Would you have trusted me?

539
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,096
After not seeing me for 10 years,
I just appear and bring you to RI...

540
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,475
...tell you I can get the Intersect,
which I built, out of your head.

541
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,810
What would you have said to that?

542
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,646
-That you were a little bit crazy.
-Exactly.

543
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,900
Now punch in the code
or we'll be a little bit dead.

544
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,818
No, Dad, it doesn't work like that.

545
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,488
-Unless it's in here, I can't do it.
-Yes, you can.

546
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,116
I designed that computer
in your head, son.

547
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,370
Flash, and it will be the last thing
you ever have to flash on.

548
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,812
Aces, Charles.

549
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,534
-That's the Intersect?
-Two point zero.

550
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:24,037
My baby. My greatest creation.

551
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,624
After you and your sister, of course.

552
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,001
Let's make that the hot seat.

553
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,549
We need to make some minor
modifications to Roark's software.

554
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,066
So, what exactly
does your new program do?

555
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,694
Usually the Intersect
works in the other way around...

556
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,531
...but I don't see any reason why
it shouldn't be able to take out information.

557
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,617
In theory, at least.

558
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,453
What you're gonna see
are encoded images...

559
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,748
...that will cancel out
the ones that you originally uploaded.

560
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,417
Wait.

561
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,378
Are you saying
you're gonna overwrite my brain?

562
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,423
That's a good way of putting it. Yes.

563
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,763
-Ready?
-No.

564
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,893
-Your glasses.
-Oh. Yeah, right.

565
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,981
Good luck, Charles.

566
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,120
Something's wrong.

567
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,331
No, no, no.

568
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,082
It's not working.

569
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,127
No, it doesn't work.

570
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,633
But I'm sure you'll have it
up and running in no time.

571
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,137
You always did have
a way with machines, Orion.

572
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,264
And remember, I always had--

573
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,808
Well, I always had a way with the girls.

574
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,602
Remember?

575
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,896
Hey, come on, man. What's the matter?

576
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,648
No hug for your old partner?

577
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,816
No?

578
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,611
I've been looking for you for a long time.

579
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,198
The years have been unkind.

580
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,076
I could offer you a good moisturizer. Huh?

581
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,537
No? Okay.

582
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,999
Put him on the helicopter.
Kill the CIA agent.

583
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,168
He's my son.

584
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,713
He's your son?
Congratulations, that's great.

585
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,799
I had no idea. Kill his son.

586
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,807
Wait, I'll-- I'll build anything you want.

587
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:54,354
Give Fulcrum their Intersect.
But my son walks away from here.

588
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:58,024
-You'll build it either way.
-You're gonna torture me?

589
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,528
After 10 years away from my family?
My son walks away.

590
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,822
All right, all right.

591
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,199
I'm not a monster.

592
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,828
Maybe I'm a little bit of a monster.

593
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,584
Today is his lucky day.

594
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,879
Shotgun on the chopper. Let's go.

595
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,933
Charles.

596
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,894
-Take care of your sister.
-No.

597
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,521
-And take care of yourself.
-Dad.

598
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,149
-You can do this without me.
-I'm not gonna leave you.

599
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,652
Remember when I told you
not to trust your handlers?

600
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,537
Maybe I was wrong.

601
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,416
If his son's gonna walk,
he should do it now.

602
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,795
Goodbye, Chuck.

603
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,299
CHUCK:
No!

604
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,135
No!

605
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,107
In our raid of Roark Instruments...

606
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,361
...we failed to retrieve
either the Intersect or Stephen Bartowski.

607
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,280
Clearly, we recognize
that Fulcrum's possession of Orion...

608
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,449
...poses an unparalleled security threat.

609
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,785
You mean,
Fulcrum's possession of my father.

610
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,995
I promise you, no one at the CIA...

611
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,456
...knew your father's secret identity.

612
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,376
I also promise to entrust
his recovery to our best team.

613
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,420
General, we are your best team.

614
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,633
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.
Chuck's right.

615
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,344
You cannot put Chuck in the field.
It is too dangerous.

616
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,180
Fulcrum knows that he is Orion's son.

617
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:59,104
Look, as soon as my dad
finishes the new Intersect for Roark...

618
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:03,483
...I'm worthless to you, obsolete,
and Fulcrum wins.

619
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,820
The only thing that matters now
is getting my father back...

620
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,322
...and you need me to do that.

621
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,158
Very well, Mr. Bartowski.

622
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:15,745
The assignment is yours,
provided your personal entanglements...

623
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,082
...do not interfere with the mission.

624
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,014
Dad?

625
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:44,190
Ellie, I don't know how to tell you this,
but I think your dad may have split.

626
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,693
His stuff's all gone.

627
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:55,243
Hey. Hey, I'm sure he's planning
on coming back for the wedding.

628
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,246
No. No, he's not.

629
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,125
Well, if it's any consolation...

630
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,545
...I'm not going anywhere, ever.

631
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,214
I mean, no matter how hard
things get between us.

632
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,885
Because that's what
married people do, right?

633
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,891
Just think, in 50 years...

634
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,727
...we'll look back at my bachelor party
and laugh about it.

635
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,563
No. No, we won't.

636
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,106
Probably not.

637
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,442
ELLIE:
Chuck. Are you okay?

638
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,402
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

639
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,237
Only my career was injured.

640
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,950
Chuck, Dad's gone.

641
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,661
I yelled at him
about what happened at your work today.

642
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,247
-I said some things that--
-It's not your fault.

643
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,167
Well, no, it's my fault
that I asked you to find him.

644
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,461
I needed him
to walk me down the aisle.

645
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:50,715
I thought that he would be different
from that guy that walked out on us.

646
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,427
I guess I just expected too much
from him.

647
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,139
Don't count him out yet.

648
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,994
