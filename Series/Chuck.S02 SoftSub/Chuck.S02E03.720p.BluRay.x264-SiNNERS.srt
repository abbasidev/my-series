Sarah, you're the greatest thing

You're beautiful, you're smart,

And for the last few days,
all I can think about is our future together.

687
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,966
About what it's gonna be like
once I get the Intersect out of my head.

688
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:09,554
How we'll finally be together for real.
No fake relationships.

But the more I think about it,
the more I realize...

691
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,566
...that you and I
can never have a future together.

692
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:28,698
I fooled myself into thinking that we could,
but the truth is we can't.

693
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,119
Because even if we had a real relationship,
it would never really be real.

694
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,706
I'd still never know anything about you.

Morgan did...

when the Intersect is out of your head...

707

you'll forget all about me.
