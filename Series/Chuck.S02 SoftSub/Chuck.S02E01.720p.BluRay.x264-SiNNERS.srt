you understand?

676
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,756
-Okay.
-You're good.

677
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:54,260
But before you go change the world,
I think that I should tell you...

678
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:57,430
...that I'm currently on my way
to securing 45 Twinkies.

679
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,767
Now, by which I mean
45 bags of Twinkies.

680
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,268
Why would you do that?

681
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,605
Good question. Because Jeff said
he'd eat them in under three minutes.

682
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,190
Now, he thinks he's eating 45...

683
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,734
...but technically speaking,
he agreed to eat 90.

684
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,237
-Ninety?
-Yeah.

685
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,738
Nobody can eat 90 Twinkies.

686
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,782
That's what I said, dude. He may die.

687
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,910
Or at least do extreme damage
to several major organs.

688
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,122
This I have to see.

689
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,166
Good to see you, Bartowski.

690
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,544
Casey, 90 Twinkies in three minutes.
Be there.

691
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,754
MORGAN:
Jeff might die.
