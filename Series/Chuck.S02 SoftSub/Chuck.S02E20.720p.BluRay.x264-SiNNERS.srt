I can help you. Come on.

You're under arrest.
I'm breaking up with you.

6
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,389
Dad's gone. I thought I needed him
to walk me down the aisle.

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,434
Thought he'd be different
from that guy that walked out on us.

Don't worry, Charles.
I'm not who you think I am.

-You're Orion.
-I'll give Fulcrum their Intersect.

10

But my son walks away from here.

CHUCK: As soon as my dad
finishes the new Intersect...

13
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,072
...I'm worthless and Fulcrum wins.

14

The only thing that matters now
is getting my father back.

-Uh.... No, thanks.

I was just kind of hoping the CIA
would find my father first.

20

The government is doing everything
they can to find him.

How do I know I can trust them?

22

the Intersect in my head.

It's not rocket science.

we are the brains of this operation.

Why don't you start us off?

Well, as I see it...

70
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,695
...Emmett's threat was a ruse
to get us to work hard...

71
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,448
...so he'd look good,
but think about this:

72
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,910
Emmett asked us to behave because
he knows we'd do the exact opposite.

73
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,453
We'd misbehave.

74

But Emmett, he's no fool...

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,832
...so he would know
that we would know that he knows this.

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,001
So obviously, we need to behave.

77
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,920
Okay, so we behave.

78
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,464
Pay attention.
It's the exact opposite.

Emmett would also know
that we'd know that he knows we know.

80
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,887
Because he knows that we know
that what he knows...

81
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,389
...is that we know
he wants us to behave.

Sorry, but the mission was a bust.
She'll put us in more danger.

That wasn't her fault, it was Bernie.
He manipulated her.

-You know Jill. She's a Fulcrum agent.
-Exactly.

That's exactly why we need her.

She knows Fulcrum,
their procedures and secrets.

I know she tried to kill you. I'm sorry.

Because Big Mike needs me.
He'll never say kind words about me.

00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,733
Because if I were to leave,
he has to work.

And then he has to start expending
all of his energy on the store...

I trusted the wrong person, Chuck.

674
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,953
Agent Casey will be waiting here.

675
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,124
He will tranq Chuck.

676
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:42,796
Then he will wait for the extraction team
to arrive for his transfer.

677
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,547
That is all.

678
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,437
How can you just stand there
and say nothing?

679
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,190
Beckman's right.
Safest place for Chuck is underground.

680
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,568
What do you think is gonna happen
when Fulcrum finds Jill?

681
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,162
-We have good news.
-Can it wait? Computer emergency.

682
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,705
It's about your father.

683
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,208
We found him.

684
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,047
What? How? Where is he?

685
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,635
One of our recon teams intercepted
his transport as Fulcrum was moving him.

686
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,222
He's back at the Castle.
He's safe, Chuck.

687
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,891
It's all over.

688
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,235
I owe you an apology.

689
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,653
Why?

690
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,907
I was beginning to think
that I couldn't trust you anymore, Sarah.

691
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,077
Maybe Jill was right,
that the CIA was never gonna let me go...

692
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,247
...that they would always put
their best interests ahead of mine.

693
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,916
But not you.

694
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,254
You've always looked out for me.
Thank you.

695
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:30,445
-[WHISPERS] Take off your watch.
-[WHISPERS] Why?

696
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,946
Because it's all a lie.

697
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,407
Your dad is still out there.

698
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,368
Beckman sent me to get you
to bring you back to the Castle.

699
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,370
They're gonna take you underground.

700
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,622
We have to run.

701
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,437
You're disobeying orders for me?

702
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,776
Committing treason, Sarah.
You could go to jail.

703
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,613
I know.

704
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,326
