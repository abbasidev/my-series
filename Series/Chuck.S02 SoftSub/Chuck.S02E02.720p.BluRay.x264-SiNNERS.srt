Hi, I'm Chuck.

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,087
Here are things
that you might need to know.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,089
As the assistant manager
and your boss...

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,718
...it's my duty to inform you
that I've had complaints from customers.

5
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:12,594
General, what exactly is the Cipher?

6
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:16,265
The Cipher is the artificial brain
for the new Intersect computer.

7
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,600
GRAHAM:
Tomorrow, the new computer will be online.

8
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,395
Operation Bartowski
officially comes to an end.

9
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,230
Enjoy the rest of your life, Chuck.

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,274
You can do anything. I've seen you.

11
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,276
Anything you wanted you could have.

12
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,486
Do you wanna go on a date sometime?

13
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:30,696
Okay.

14
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,532
We have to call off the date.
The Intersect was destroyed.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,200
What? But the Cipher--

16
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,369
SARAH:
It was a Trojan horse, a sabotage device.

17
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,121
The moment it came online....

18
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,124
You're still the only Intersect.

19
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,797
CHUCK:
I don't get it.

20
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,216

I was supposed to be a free man.

21
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,719
No more Intersect,
possibly reclining on a beach...

22
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,096
...with a colada
and some undisclosed companion.

23
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,140
-What the hell happened?
-It's technical.

24
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,143
It's a computer malfunction.
I can help. That's my department.

25
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,645
It exploded into a million pieces,
Graham with it.

26
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,606
You wanna help?
Get some rubber gloves.

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,441
Wait, wait, wait. Graham is dead?

28
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,860
We're playing for keeps here, Chuck.

29
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,989
Well, at the risk of sounding callous,
where does that leave us with the Intersect?

30
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,951
I'd get used to working at the Buy More.
You ain't leaving anytime soon.

31

...as the new assistant manager...

33
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,837
...I just want you to know that things
are gonna run differently here.

34
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,131
Because we did our time together
in the trenches...

35
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,176
...I know what screwups most of you are,
for example, Jeffrey.

36
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,638
You spend the hours of 3 and 5
sleeping in the employee bathroom.

37
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,264
Dude, that was our secret.

38
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:44,144
Morgan, no more borrowing company DVDs
and then just reshrink-wrapping them.

39
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,189
What? That's outrageous, man.
I've never heard such a thing.

40

-I'm insulted that you would--
-Oh, but-- Oh, no.

41
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,820
Oh, okay. Okay, okay, company DVDs
you're saying, right.

-When are we offering--?
-Hey, hey, hey.

Ah, yes, yes, yes. When are we...?

-Today.

Good. Dismissed.

00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,385
I can't believe this is my life.

when I had potential?

Yeah, you were bursting with it.

to do great things, all right? Great things.

But until that day, just know...

60
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:35,529
...that no matter how bad your life gets,
you get to go home to that.

61
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,781
Is that, uh, a real kiss or a cover kiss?
Because I'm confused right now.

Hey, I got an idea.

Why don't we blow off this whole thing
and go to Mexico for a couple of days?

66
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,963
I'll get the daiquiris
if the CIA picks up the plane tickets.

67
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,674
Chuck, I told you, we can't be together.
It's unprofessional.

68
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,970
Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you
with Bryce Larkin, super spy...

69
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,388
...when you were together?

70
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,433

This is new. What is this place?

75
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,241
The CIA decided to spring for new digs.

76
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,826
Finally, a first-rate operation.

77
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,329
Wow.

on staying for a while?

BECKMAN [OVER MONITOR]: Colt fed us
a Trojan horse that blew up the Intersect.

82
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,968
The real Cipher is still out there.

83
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,470
Our intel tells us
it may be in the possession...

84
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,223
...of the former KGB operative,
Sasha Banacheck.

85
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,433
We believe she's in town to sell it.

86
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,519
So why don't we grab her and find out?

87
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,355
Sasha Banacheck was in a Bulgarian prison
for seven years.

88
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,815
They got nothing out of her.

89
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,442
The good news is,
one agent was able to get close.

90
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,152
He's the reason she went away.

91
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,446
And he knows more about her
than anyone alive.

92
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,865
That agent is Roan Montgomery.

93
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,868
Crap. The guy hates me.

94

Flunked me twice.

95
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,625
He's off the grid now. Use the Intersect
to find Agent Montgomery.

96
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,876
All right.

Uh, but you can count me out
on this one.

No more guns being pointed at my head.

00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,651

The only way to get Sasha Banacheck
is to seduce her.

175
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,505
Well, duty calls.

176
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,341
Not you, Agent Frankenstein,
she'll peg you as CIA.

177

We need somebody innocuous...

178
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,887
...someone with whom
she can let her guard down.

179
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,850
Essentially, the last person in the world
she'd ever suspect of being an agent.

Uh, Lester, these are all from your jobs.

182
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,318
Correct. During your brief tenure
as the assistant manager...

I need your services in a romantic capacity.

I just hope Sarah's involved.

and get her to invite you up...

in her room.

One small problem.
Why is she gonna choose me?

you're going to be me.

make himself scarce tonight.

-Her favorite dessert, pecan pie.
-Okay, she likes pecan pie.

with Ellie for? Three years?

-Ha, ha.

to the study of that woman for 19 years.

I hate to pull rank here,
but I think I know Ellie better than you.

is Ellie's favorite song of eighth grade?

That's an excellent question.

I would probably start
with the, uh, bedroom eyes, maybe.
