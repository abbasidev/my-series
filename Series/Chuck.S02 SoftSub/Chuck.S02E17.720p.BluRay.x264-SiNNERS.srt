that we do actual plumbing.

to shut down Operation Bartowski...

339
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,862
...because of one foolish mistake.

340
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,323
But if Fulcrum knows
who you really are...

341
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,410
...pack your bags, Chuck.
You're leaving with me.

342
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,495
Tell your family and friends....

343
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,415
Tell them nothing.

344
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,090
General, I implore you--

345
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,593
Don't use implore,
only use words you actually use.

346
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,262
Here's why I think that Orion is legit.

347
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,513
I don't say legit.

348
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,307
SARAH: Chuck.
-Is Beckman here?

349
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,768
-Uh, she's on her way.
-Okay, what about the computer?

350
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:37,313
It's inside Castle.
Beckman has a unit en route to move it out.

351
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,317
Guys, look, I am certain that Orion
is not Fulcrum, okay? This is the real guy.

352
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,070
If I get five to 45 minutes,
I can convince the general.

353
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,823
No, she doesn't wanna see you.
Please, just wait in your room.

354
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,951

CASEY: Ahem.

355
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,038
-I'm sorry I didn't tell you about my search.
-It's okay.

356
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,208
I'll explain it to her. Now go.

Is the asset secure?

359
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,431
Yes, ma'am.

360
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,142
It was a highly professional team,
Michael.

361
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,895
There must have been 30--
Forty of them.

362
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,272
They stormed the store...

363
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,983
...and they took the new laptop.

364
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,111
What do you think? Barclay?

365
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,738
Whoever did this,
broke some serious laws here, boss.

366
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,032
It's Barclay.
I can smell him all over this.

Mm-hm. Correct, bingo.
Yeah, they closed the tap at Benny's.

-Saw the commotion. Wanted to see.
-I'm calling the police.

-Put that phone down.
-Oh, God.

We can't be calm and collected this time.

We will remain calm and collected.

377
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:04,233
We will be calm and collected
when we go to Beverly Hills tonight.

378

We will be calm and collected when
we use my code to get into the store...

we will be calm and collected...

380
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,367
...when we burn
that mother-loving store to the ground.

381
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,718
-Sir, what exactly are we doing here?
-Payback.

382
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,096
I see. Does this payback involve
illegal activities?

383
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,140
It damn well better.

Hello, this is Chuck speaking.

385
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,078
ORION [OVER PHONE]:
Hello, Chuck. Where's my computer?

386
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,998
Orion. Orion? Um....

387
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:05,544
Uh, unfortunately, your computer is locked
up in a top-secret government facility.

388
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,213
ORION: You have to get it.
-I can't.

389
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,841
My handlers think you're Fulcrum
and to be honest, I'm on the fence myself.

390
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,426
ORION:
I'm not Fulcrum.

391
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,012
Thanks.
Thanks, I'm glad we cleared that up.

392
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,264
-How can I be certain?
ORION: Look at your computer.

393
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,446
How did you know
that was in the Intersect?

394
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:36,283
ORION:
I put it there. A long time ago.

395
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,995
You really are Orion.

396
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,750
Wake up, Casey. The '80s are over.

[GROANS]

398
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,213
I lied to Chuck earlier.
He's done what no one else could do.

399
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,924
He found him. Chuck found Orion.

400
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,425
General, why lie to him?

401
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,470
Orion is extremely important to this project
and to Chuck.

402
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,972
Important?

403
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,308
Don't think for a second
that you can tell me what is important.

404
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,186
I've had an army of analysts and spies
hunting for Orion...

405
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,106
...since before you were in a training bra.

406
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,650
After the first cipher was completed...

407
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,820
...Orion purged his personnel records
and disappeared.

408
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,864
We've been looking for him ever since.
So has Fulcrum.

409
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,701
Neither of us
has been able to lay a hand on him.

410
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,997
Until now. Until Bartowski.

ORION:
You need to go.

412
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:29,211
I have to tell Sarah and Casey what you did.
It's proof that you're Orion.

413
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,965
And on another note, I've got a small
convention of agents in my courtyard...

414
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,800
...and my team is in a meeting.

When Fulcrum made a move on him...

420
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,902
...he nearly destroyed an entire building
with a Predator.

421
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,196
Wow. Beckman is tiny.

422
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,033
General, what if Orion can help Chuck
remove the Intersect?

423
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,409
Erase it from his mind?

424
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,536
Yeah, yeah, good question, Sarah.

425

That's exactly what I don't want.

Chuck Bartowski
is absolutely vital to national security.

427

He can never meet Orion.

429
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,758
Uh....

430
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,176
Yes.

-Yes, yes, I very much do.

extracted from blowfish.

Chuck Bartowski has risked his life
for this country.

But he's not a spy, and he knows it.

-Where's Chuck?

-Sure.

Orion was coming out of the cold for you.
That's excellent work.
