CHUCK:
Hey, I'm Chuck.

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:06,422
Here's a couple of things you might need
to know or maybe you forgot.

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,757
-I'm not who you think I am.
-You're Orion.

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,300
Father invented the Intersect.

5
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:13,929
No hug for your old partner?
I've been looking for you for a long time.

6
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,223
Put him on the helicopter. Kill his son.

7
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,518
I overhead them say that they're moving
your father to Black Rock.

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,855
Black Rock is a code name
for a secret Fulcrum base in Barstow.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,858
I'm shutting down this project.
Chuck's going into lockdown.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,735
Operation Moron is over.

11
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:32,489
They're gonna take you underground.
We have to run. Your dad is still out there.

12
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,200
You're committing treason, Sarah.
You could go to jail.

13
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,037
I know.

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,801
CHUCK: According to the coordinates,
this should be Black Rock.

15
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,265
Well, it doesn't exactly look like
a Fulcrum compound, does it?

16
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,310
SARAH: Your flash was wrong.
-They had to have just moved my father.

17
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,646
These beer cans are fresh.
There's still ash on the cigarette butts.

18
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,150
SARAH: Could have been kids having a party.
-Great.

19
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:12,279
-We gotta go back and start all over again.
-We're AWOL. It's why we ditched the car.

20
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:18,160
If Casey finds us, I go to jail, you go
to a padded cell with 24-hour surveillance.

21
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,829
There is no going back.

Don't give up, Charles.

Cute couple.

25
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,014
ROARK:
What are you gonna do?

26
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,766
You gonna kill me?

27
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,060
You gonna beat me to a pulp?

28
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,479
You can come up
with something more creative.

29
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,523
No, you--

30
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,150
You had it right. I'll kill you.

31
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,861
ROARK: Oh, forgot about that. I'm sorry.
I'll tell you what.

32
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:57,950
As long as the new Intersect is operational
by tomorrow night, your son will be fine.

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,537
Hold on, there's still a ton
of diagnostics to run, simulations--

34
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,705
I can't guarantee I can finish it by then.

35
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,542
Well, then I can't guarantee
your son's safety.

36
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,380
BECKMAN: The safety of the Intersect
is no longer my main concern.

37
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,216
I want you to hunt Agent Walker
and the asset down.

38
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,553
-Bring them back dead or alive.
-Understood, general.

39
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,055
Once the Intersect is in our possession...

40
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,141
...you will have your pick
of assignments.

41
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,228

42
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,606

46
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,835
I-- Chuck hasn't been showing up. I was
looking for some clues where he might be.

47
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,253
-Hi, John.
-Hi.

48
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,588
Chuck? I heard from him.

49
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,591
-He just called?
-He left a voicemail. Not five minutes ago.

50
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,595
Our wedding is this weekend,
and he decided to go out of town.

51
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,763
Well, good. Glad to hear he's safe.

Presumptuous. Should I have asked
for separate rooms?

59
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:43,055
No, it's fine. As long as we're on the lam,
I can't let you out of my sight.

I'm gonna take a shower.

61
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:51,647
I'm gonna assume that whole out-of-sight
thing doesn't really apply right now.

I'm at the motel a mile south of the base.

You want me to kill them?

65
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,664
No. No, Vincent.

00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,290

of violence that are in your nature.

Why are you doing this?

73
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:51,373
Because the floor is gross

responsible for the success of the mission.

516
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,950
She pretended to go AWOL,
used herself and the asset as bait...

517
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,369
...to lure Fulcrum out,
to secure their location.

518
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,788
She risked her life
to preserve the mission.

519
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,541
If anyone deserves a commendation,
it's Walker.

520
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:31,419
-Actually, general, I never--
-Never thought she could be so cold.

521
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:35,132
I mean, I didn't, certainly.
She used me as bait, like Casey just said.

522
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,675
I was treated terribly.

523
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,387
I mean, she cuffed me, I got chafing
on my wrists, I was malnourished.

524
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,681
It was...

525
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,808
...horrific.

526
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,184
Ah!

527
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:50,063
Well, then, Colonel Casey,
now that the Intersect Project is over...

528
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,983
...I assume you want
to return to command your old unit.

529
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,903
I'm sorry, general, I just want to make sure
I didn't misinterpret anything.

530
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,489
Did you just say "over"?

531
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:00,991
That's correct.

532
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,412
We have the Intersect Cube,
Fulcrum is defeated, your mission complete.

533
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,082
Mr. Bartowski, you are free to return...

534
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,917
...to whatever it is you do.

535
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,254
General, I'd just like to say...

536
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,549
...that although I know
we've had our share of ups and downs...

537
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,636
...this has been an incredible...

538
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,097
...dare I say life-changing experience.

539
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,269
You don't feel quite as strongly about.
I get it, you're busy.

540
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,271
Government. It's a little rude.

541
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,108
Why are the Brothers Imbecile
still working here?

542
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,069
Could we just give them
one more chance, please?

543
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,905
You know what, Grimes?

544
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:44,743
I'm gonna ask you
a very important question.

545
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:50,290
And I want you to think very long
and hard about it.

546
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,792
Do you wanna be a loser
the rest of your life?

547
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,587
That's an excellent question, Emmett.

548
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,510
If you would have asked me that this
morning, I probably would have said yes.

549
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,263
Now I'm not so sure.

550
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,766
Then do what needs to be done.

551
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,810
Yes, sir.

552
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,487
Big Mike, in the old country,
if a man did the honorable thing...

553
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,114
...and fell on his sword,
his family was looked after.

554
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,493
That was a good break.

555
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,786
A real nice deal.

556
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,371
Yeah.

557
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,666
-Will you look after my mother?
-I will.

558
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:37,629
Gentleman, it's been a pleasure
serving with you.

559
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,341
If you retell the story, do me a favor
and give me a better physique.

560
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,760
What are you doing?

561
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,099
Morgan out.

562
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,026
Anna Wu...

563
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:05,115
...will you come to Hawaii with me,
where I will learn the ancient art of hibachi?

564
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,660
Morgan, I thought you'd never ask.

565
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,997
MORGAN:
Okay.

566
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,208
This is great.

567
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,923
-Oh, hold on a second. Hold on.
-Okay.

568
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,844
Hey. Hey. Hey.

569
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,889
-Little hot in here, buddy?
-It's a bit chilly, you know, but worth it.

570
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:33,018
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah. No, dude, actually...

571
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,645
...for the first time, everything is fine.

572
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,232
It's all over.

573
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,988
God, I admire him.

574
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,506
JEFF:
You're free, Morgan.

575
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,219
You're free.

576
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,269
DEVON:
Babe, we are late.

577
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,438
We have to go.

578
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,731
I can't.

579
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,109
Honey, we have a whole rehearsal
dinner full of people waiting for us.

580
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:27,447
I knew that my Dad would disappoint me
but I just didn't think that Chuck would.

581
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,449
I don't know, it must be in the DNA.

582
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,622
Ellie...

583
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,043
...I know it's difficult without Chuck.

584
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,961
But he wants to be here.

585
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,463
I know he does.

586
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,425
Your Dad leaving shook him up
pretty bad.

587
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,930
Ellie, he'll be back.

588
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,640
Trust me.

589
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,642
He loves you.

590
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,268
So do I.

591
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,983
Chuck, where have you been?

592
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,153
I was getting your wedding present.

593
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,322
Dad.

594
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,032
Hi.

595
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,828
Are you staying?

596
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,330
I'm not going anywhere.

597
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,167
I got your back, bro.

598
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,976
Hey.

599
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,313
I was wondering if you wanted to come
to my sister's rehearsal dinner.

600
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,941
The Intersect's out, Bartowski.

601
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,528
-You don't need my help anymore.
-I'm not asking you as the asset.

602
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,029
I'm asking you as a friend.

603
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,580
Okay, well, I tried.

604
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,127
Open bar, I hope.

605
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,885
I'll go warm up the vic.

606
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,477
-Hi.
-Hi.

607
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,562
You look amazing.

608
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,023
Thank you.

609
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,276
-Very dapper.
-Thank you.

610
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,570
So how does it feel?

611
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,532
It feels great, actually.

612
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,202
Like everything is finally real.

613
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,663
It is real.

614
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,856
Where you headed?

615
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,025
Burbank.

616
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,611
Got a wedding to go to.

617
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,576
