My pleasure, Stu.

00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,478
Now, Jeff, you've dedicated
the last three years of your life...

...to playing "Missile Command."

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,441

...and raise it to a level
that can only be described as an art form.

on everybody's mind:

00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,868
What's next for Jeff Barnes?

Nothing. No.

164
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,985
You know, nothing. Just....

165
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,697
You know,
we never really get the chance to talk.

166
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,616
How about we grab a beer?

167
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,744
No, thanks.

168
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,039
I could be enticed
to grab a dozen beers, however.

169
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,001
-It's a date.
-We can kick it at my place.

You're gonna love Roscoe.
He's my ferret.
