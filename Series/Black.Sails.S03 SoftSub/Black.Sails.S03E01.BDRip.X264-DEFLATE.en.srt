106
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:54,345
First, I imagine she told you

107
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:56,481
I retired from a prosperous trade

108
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,566
to settle with her here.

110
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:04,465
is that that trade
was high seas piracy.

111
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:08,584
Second, she told you
my name was Drummond,

112
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:12,639
but when I plied that trade,

113
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:15,533
I was called Teach.

354
00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:30,371
Is that so?

355
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:34,042
I understand we faced colonial
regulars out there last night.

356
00:23:34,102 --> 00:23:35,818
So?

357
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:37,879
These raids were difficult enough

358
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:40,749
when the element of
surprise was in our favor.

359
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:43,803
But now?
Now it would seem your days

360
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:47,648
of approaching unannounced
may also be at an end.

361
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:50,509
Every time you go ashore,

362
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:53,263
there is a risk you don't return...

363
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:56,650
a risk Nassau loses
its most recognizable figure

364
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,686
and a risk that would seem
to be escalating.

365
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:03,741
I am suggesting it's time we take
you out of harm's way as well.

366
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:07,495
We're fighting a war
to protect Nassau.

367
00:24:07,555 --> 00:24:10,281
A war in which our most
effective weapon

368
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:13,368
is the fear that we can
instill in our enemies.

369
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:16,672
We've succeeded
in making Captain Flint

370
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:20,843
the name of grim death
to all of them.

371
00:24:20,903 --> 00:24:23,712
The only way that we can ensure
that that story continues

372
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:26,015
is if he is the one telling it.

373
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:29,386
That story is telling
itself, and you know it.

374
00:24:29,446 --> 00:24:32,472
We've been assigned responsibility
for raids we were nowhere near.

375
00:24:32,532 --> 00:24:34,190
Jesus, I've been given credit

376
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,110
for having been
a part of some of them.

377
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,530
They are so terrified of you,
they're terrified of me.

378
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,532
You think that's a reason
we should relent?

379
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:43,868
Who the fuck said anything
about relenting?

380
00:24:43,928 --> 00:24:45,786
Look, I am talking about
letting someone else

381
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:47,322
stand in and play
your role now and again.

382
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:50,075
Thank you for your concern,

383
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:54,246
but I'll decide when it's time
to start altering our tactics.

384
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:57,800
No, I'll decide.

385
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,136
This crew has spilled
a great deal of blood

386
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:02,755
to make your name what it is.

387
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,841
It doesn't belong to you.

388
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:07,059
It's a jointly held asset

389
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,896
belonging to every man on this crew

390
00:25:08,956 --> 00:25:12,733
who sacrificed some part
of himself to build it.

391
00:25:12,793 --> 00:25:15,486
They have a say
about how it is managed,

392
00:25:15,546 --> 00:25:17,070
and I am the voice of it.

393
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,742
It is clear to me that this raid
was more dangerous than the last.

394
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:23,778
They are adapting, and it
is of some concern to me

395
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:26,639
that you either cannot
or will not acknowledge it.

396
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:33,956
I understand this is all
incredibly personal to you

397
00:25:34,016 --> 00:25:35,791
after the loss of Mrs. Barlow.

398
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:37,293
Now, wait a minute...

399
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:40,095
And I understand the burden of
playing the role you currently play

400
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:42,799
must be taking a toll even you
cannot fully comprehend.

401
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:44,442
Stop.

402
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,331
Now you have wormed your way into
the heads of the men out there.

403
00:25:52,203 --> 00:25:55,120
And they've granted you authority
over them because of it.

404
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:02,294
But in my head,
you are not welcome.

It's worse than I feared.

407
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:13,691
The wound should've been far further
along towards quieting itself.

408
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:17,311
It's less than ideal.

409
00:26:20,817 --> 00:26:23,593
Have you been cleaning it
as we discussed?

00:26:23,653 --> 00:26:25,846
(HEAVY BREATHING)
When I can.

411
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:27,456
It's harder when we're at sea.

412
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,186
I understand your aversion to
being seen using the crutches.

413
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:33,988
Well, if you understand it,

414
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:36,241
I wish you'd stop
hectoring me about it.

415
00:26:36,301 --> 00:26:39,836
But the boot was never
intended for a wound this new.

416
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:42,531
Unless you remove
some of the pressure,

417
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:45,200
the wound will only continue
to get more irritated.

418

420

I'll manage.

421
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:55,185
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.

VANE:
What is there to explain?

427
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,454
You couldn't figure out
how to repair the fort,

428
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:21,323
so you lured me into capturing
a ship full of slaves to do the job.

429
00:27:21,383 --> 00:27:24,710
It was the first solid lead
on a slaver we'd had in weeks.

430
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,513
I needed someone who I could
be certain would win her.

431
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:29,724
So you lied to me about it.

432
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:34,738
What the fuck made you think
I would just hand them over to you,

433

knowing what you know of me?

434
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:43,981
The three of us stood in this
room... you, Flint, and I...

435
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,100
and we agreed
that the fort's restoration

436
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,019
was critical to Nassau's security.

437
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,321
We agreed you would
hire men to restore it.

438
00:27:50,381 --> 00:27:52,274
- I tried that!
- You're going to need to try harder!

439
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:53,408
How?

440
00:27:53,468 --> 00:27:55,327
I offer the men exorbitant
wages to do the work.

441
00:27:55,387 --> 00:27:57,103
Do you know what they say?
"You can afford more. We want double that."

442
00:27:57,163 --> 00:27:58,480
All right, double it, it's a deal.
Fuck it.

443
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,524
You know what they say then? "You can't
tell us what to do. We're free men."

444
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:03,119
"We'll work when we please." Would you
like to take a guess how that is going?

445
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:06,339
It's five different crews,
it's hundreds of men,

446
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,791
untold thousands in wages,
and I swear to God,

447
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:11,878
I think that hole in the wall
is bigger now than when we started.

448
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:14,131
I stood between you and him, Jack.

449
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:16,050
When Flint was ready
to wage war against you

450
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,135
over the gold,
I was the one who said

451
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:20,054
you would manage it
as well as anyone could.

452
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:22,723
For the good of this place, I was
the one who said you could be trusted.

453
00:28:22,783 --> 00:28:24,476
Why?

454
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,696
Why did you stand behind me
in that moment?

455
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:29,350
I'll tell you why. Because you and
I had been through enough shit

456
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,232
for you to know that I
would do the same for you,

457
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,952
that I have done the same for you,
and would again without hesitation.

458
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:36,572
I made a commitment
to you, with you,

459
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,574
to restore this place,
to make it strong again.

461
