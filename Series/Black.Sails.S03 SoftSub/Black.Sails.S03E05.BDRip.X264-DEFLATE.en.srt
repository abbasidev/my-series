moved us to the interior

claimed it for themselves.

or, worse yet,
oppose its formation,

302
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:06,393
it will sow all manner of mistrust and
apprehension amongst my colleagues.

discarded, who next?

won't remain silent.

306
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:20,453
Because this is
important to him,

307
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:23,998
that the street understands
that his intentions are genuine

308
00:21:24,078 --> 00:21:26,668
