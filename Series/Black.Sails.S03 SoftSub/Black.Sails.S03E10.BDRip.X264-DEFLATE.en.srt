MAN: Company, retreat!

724
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:41,214
MAN 2: Back! Fall back!

725
00:43:41,294 --> 00:43:43,300
MAN 3: Company, retreat!

726
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,881
Retreat!

727
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:49,348
Tell your governor!

728
00:43:49,428 --> 00:43:51,972
You tell him I'm coming!

729
00:43:56,435 --> 00:44:00,067
Let us say there is some
merit to your argument.

730
00:44:00,147 --> 00:44:04,192
Let us say that Mr. Dobbs
will do as you ask of him.

731
00:44:05,402 --> 00:44:07,324
I would have to
admit in that case

732
00:44:07,404 --> 00:44:10,911
that the world has
shifted beneath our feet

733
00:44:10,991 --> 00:44:14,247
in a most startling way.

734
00:44:14,327 --> 00:44:17,167
But in terms of our future

735
00:44:17,247 --> 00:44:21,338
and the danger that you
believe you may pose to me,

736
00:44:21,418 --> 00:44:23,090
bear this in mind.

737
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:27,177
I have survived starvation,

738
00:44:27,257 --> 00:44:29,346
a tempest,

739
00:44:29,426 --> 00:44:31,390
pirate hunters,

740
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,184
jealous captains,
mutinous crews,

741
00:44:34,264 --> 00:44:36,186
angry lords,

742
00:44:36,266 --> 00:44:37,354
a queen, a king,

743
00:44:37,434 --> 00:44:40,854
and the goddamn British navy.

744
00:44:42,898 --> 00:44:47,322
So to whatever extent
you may be concerned

745
00:44:47,558 --> 00:44:49,447
that some day we will clash,

746
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:55,747
worried that though
today we be friends,

747
00:44:55,836 --> 00:44:59,256
some day you will have
no choice but to be my end...

748
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:04,970
I won't worry too much.

749
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:11,104
GARRETT: They call
him John the Giant.

750
00:45:11,184 --> 00:45:13,440
They say that
he's seven foot tall.

751
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,083
They say that he
moves better on that leg

752
00:45:15,123 --> 00:45:16,916
than most do with the
ones that God gave them.

753
00:45:18,325 --> 00:45:19,326
Why would they say that?

754
00:45:21,661 --> 00:45:24,251
A man walks into a
tavern out the dead of night,

755
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:26,294
threatens the
entirety of the island,

756
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:29,756
and then proceeds to remove
a man's head with a metal shoe.

757
00:45:29,836 --> 00:45:31,591
I say that's a story that
stands a strong chance

758
00:45:31,671 --> 00:45:33,260
of seeing itself embellished.

759
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,595
Do we care that it
isn't remotely true?

760
00:45:35,675 --> 00:45:39,599
Doesn't matter what's
true. Not now, at any rate.

761
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,270
We're creating the appearance
of a man out of nothing.

762
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:47,107
The appearance of a man that
the resistance against the English

763
00:45:47,187 --> 00:45:49,442
feels compelled to rally around.

764
00:45:49,522 --> 00:45:52,112
We'll introduce him.
We'll put flesh on him.

765
00:45:52,192 --> 00:45:53,655
We'll give him a soul.

766
00:45:53,735 --> 00:45:55,282
But if the street
wants to invest him

767
00:45:55,362 --> 00:45:57,617
with more than
we can on our own,

768
00:45:57,697 --> 00:45:59,199
I won't fight them about it.

769
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,290
But that name isn't
doing anything for us.

770
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,000
See about that.

771
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,544
For those of you
who have not heard,

772
00:46:07,624 --> 00:46:09,629
the governor has
imposed martial law

773
00:46:09,709 --> 00:46:14,176
upon all of Nassau Town in response
to the murder of Captain Throckmorton.

774
00:46:14,256 --> 00:46:17,304
He asks that I convey
to the rest of his council

775
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:20,223
the contents of the
letter left for him today,

776
00:46:20,303 --> 00:46:23,682
taking responsibility for
Captain Throckmorton's murder.

777
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:30,609
"I was no one,

778
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:34,279
and then you came,
and my island fell,

779
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:35,568
and I became something else."

780
00:46:36,736 --> 00:46:39,451
Why not Flint?

781
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:41,119
Flint?

782
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,621
You want to put a man forward

783
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:44,122
as a face of our efforts

784
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:45,749
to oust the English
from the island,

785
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:48,293
why not use Flint?

786
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,503
They all know him already.
They all fear him already.

787
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:52,255
I've lived too long
dependent upon Flint

788
00:46:52,335 --> 00:46:54,591
to be the one to hold
our ranks together.

789
00:46:54,671 --> 00:46:57,260
It's time we finally
had an alternative.

790
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,430
"On the night I
confiscated the pardon rolls,

791
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,724
the night I started becoming,

792
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:04,601
I made clear my position

793
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:05,727
that there would
be two sorts of men

794
00:47:05,807 --> 00:47:09,105
on the island going forward...

795
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:10,607
those like Captain Vane,

796
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:13,443
determined to stand by
their oath to the very end,

797
00:47:13,523 --> 00:47:15,737
and those like
Captain Throckmorton,

798
00:47:15,817 --> 00:47:19,115
happy to be the
first to betray it.

799
00:47:19,195 --> 00:47:22,869
And thus, as
always, to traitors..."

800
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:24,704
Does he even know?

801
00:47:24,784 --> 00:47:26,623
Mr. Silver?

802
00:47:26,703 --> 00:47:30,710
Does he have any idea
you're using his name?

803
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,255
What flows forth
from this house,

804
00:47:33,335 --> 00:47:35,423
starting tonight,

805
00:47:35,503 --> 00:47:37,255
is a new story for Nassau.

806
00:47:39,758 --> 00:47:42,514
I've watched her follow madmen.

807
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:45,100
I've watched her
follow rich men.

808
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:49,104
I've watched her
bow before tyrants.

809
00:47:49,184 --> 00:47:52,773
But now it's time
she had a king.

810
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:55,402
When we're ready,
when he's ready,

811
00:47:55,482 --> 00:47:58,443
he'll step into the role
we've created for him...

812
00:48:00,987 --> 00:48:03,910
and lead an impossible army

813
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,700
into an unwinnable war...

814
00:48:09,496 --> 00:48:11,543
and win it.

815
00:48:11,623 --> 00:48:13,753
"Captain
Throckmorton's black spot

816
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:16,423
will not be the last.

817
00:48:16,503 --> 00:48:19,592
Ignore it, and join him.

818
00:48:19,672 --> 00:48:24,427
Heed it, and reclaim
your place amongst us.

819
00:48:26,346 --> 00:48:29,769
Until then, I remain...

820
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:34,437
Long John Silver."
