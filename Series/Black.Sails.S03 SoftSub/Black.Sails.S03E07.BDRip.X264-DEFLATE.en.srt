The only way Rogers

favor our efforts,

I didn't know him, but
I understand you did.

704

Miss Guthrie tells me you
were part of the first effort

705
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,485
with Lord Hamilton and Peter Ashe
to introduce the pardon to Nassau.

706

As with most things, the
men first into the breach

708

But in the hindsight of victory,

709
00:48:58,786 --> 00:49:02,459
they were the ones whose
sacrifice made it possible.

710

Without Lord Hamilton's
efforts, your efforts,

it's likely I wouldn't have
been successful in my efforts

to introduce the pardons

And he was killed for it.

734

His wife and I went to Charles
Town to argue for the pardons,

735

to make peace with England,
and she was killed for it.

would find happiness under her rule.

anything from England

from my island.

going to let it go easily.

in seeking peace.
