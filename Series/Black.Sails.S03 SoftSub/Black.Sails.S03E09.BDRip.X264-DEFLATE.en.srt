00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:05,259
You will have daughters
on both sides of it.

359
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:06,761
And I want you to know...

360
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:08,801
[WHISPERS SOFTLY]

361
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:16,809
Only... you.

362
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:37,875
You have information
about the identity

363
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:39,248
of the spy within our midst.

364
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,672
It's Idelle.

365
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:50,930
She's the one that
learned the secret route

366
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,265
for the governor's caravan.

367
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:57,057
The one that made possible
Captain Rackham's escape.

368
00:26:59,477 --> 00:27:01,775
Have you told anyone of this?

369
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:04,357
No.

370
00:27:06,985 --> 00:27:09,991
Why not?

371
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:11,701
I beg your pardon, ma'am?

372
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:16,790
I know Eleanor engaged you
those months ago to watch me.

373
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,875
If you took this
information to her,

374
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:24,297
it would likely garner you
credit with her at my expense.

375
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:27,008
I know you have considered it.

376
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:29,925
I am asking why
you did not do it.

377
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,224
Eleanor Guthrie used that chair

378
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:36,810
not just to vanquish
her enemies,

379
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,063
but to create new ones.

380
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:43,900
Because some people can
only understand themselves

381
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,989
through the eyes of
those who hate them.

382
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:51,825
They thrive only
on sowing the seeds

383
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:53,785
of their own
eventual destruction.

384
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:56,705
Miss Guthrie has
new clothes now.

385
00:27:56,785 --> 00:27:58,456
Miss Guthrie has
new friends now.

386
00:27:58,536 --> 00:28:02,290
But to my eye,
she looks the same.

387
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:06,923
You think I will
outlast her here,

388
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:10,886
so you would cast your
lot with me and not her?

389
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:14,010
Something like that. Yes, ma'am.

390
00:28:18,014 --> 00:28:22,148
Will you please make sure, when
the governor's men visit the inn,

391
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:24,942
they are serviced
by girls you trust?

392
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:29,197
There will be no more
information seeping out of the inn.

393
00:28:29,277 --> 00:28:30,945
Of course.

394
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:38,206
Will you tell her? Miss Guthrie.

395
00:28:38,286 --> 00:28:40,750
Will you inform her
of our suspicions

396
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,999
about the source of the leak?

397
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:48,216
Davis... Davis, you remember
the time the captain...

398
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:49,467
GUNN: Do you know him?

399
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:53,012
I do not.

400
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:56,224
But Featherstone says he's one of
the most gifted purveyors of bullshit

401
00:28:56,304 --> 00:28:57,934
he's ever met.

402
00:28:58,014 --> 00:29:01,520
And a man determined, above
anything else in life, to be famous.

403
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,065
Which makes him
the perfect fit for us.

404
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:07,485
...stronger and safer
than ever was before.

405
00:29:07,565 --> 00:29:09,904
What's he saying?

406
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:12,198
The governor wants him
to believe that Charles Vane

407
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:13,908
is the cause of all their ill.

408
00:29:13,988 --> 00:29:15,952
It's a lot easier to
watch a man swing

409
00:29:16,032 --> 00:29:18,454
if you're comfortable
hating him just a little bit.

410
00:29:18,534 --> 00:29:22,041
His task is to start
reminding everyone

411
00:29:22,121 --> 00:29:23,251
there's someone else out there

412
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:25,920
that they're far more
comfortable hating.

413
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,587
Who?

414
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:46,942
What is it?

415
00:29:47,022 --> 00:29:51,321
When I sent for you, there
were approximately 20 of them.

416
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:55,075
In ten minutes, it
has grown two-fold.

417
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:58,245
What is he saying?

418
00:29:58,325 --> 00:30:00,539
That the law and order
promised by the new regime

419
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:03,125
is little more than a veneer,

420
00:30:03,205 --> 00:30:04,960
behind which Eleanor
Guthrie has returned

421
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,003
to settle old scores and restore
her tyranny over Nassau once again.

422
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:15,012
I hear they will threaten
to stand in the way

423
00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:17,889
of any attempt to remove
Charles Vane off the island,

424
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:22,394
that if he's to be tried, it
must be here, in the open,

425
00:30:22,474 --> 00:30:24,313
where they can see
it with their own eyes.

426
00:30:24,393 --> 00:30:26,356
Fucking kidding me.

427
00:30:26,436 --> 00:30:28,108
Vane is scheduled to be moved

428
00:30:28,188 --> 00:30:30,235
from the fort to the
Shark in a few hours.

429
00:30:30,315 --> 00:30:32,904
Chamberlain is making
arrangements right now.

430
00:30:32,984 --> 00:30:34,406
Is there anything
you can do about this?

431
00:30:34,486 --> 00:30:35,991
To dispel what is
building down there,

432
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:38,076
it is going to
require appeasement

433
00:30:38,156 --> 00:30:40,203
or it is going to require force.

434
00:30:40,283 --> 00:30:42,998
Appeasement.
Hold his trial here.

435
00:30:43,078 --> 00:30:45,625
To begin with, the
lawyers aren't even sure

436
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:47,002
that we have the
authority to do that

437
00:30:47,082 --> 00:30:49,004
without a judge yet appointed,

438
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:50,922
and even if it were legitimate,

439
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:53,175
proceeding like that
would last weeks.

440
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:56,386
Dredge up a dark past just
when progress is so near at hand.

441
00:30:56,466 --> 00:30:58,680
If the alternative
is an armed clash

442
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,557
between those men
and the dozens of soldiers

443
00:31:00,637 --> 00:31:02,017
it would take to subdue them,

444
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:04,227
a little time spent
confronting the past

445
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:05,646
may be the lesser evil.

446
00:31:05,726 --> 00:31:08,316
I can't believe this
is a coincidence...

447
00:31:08,396 --> 00:31:10,526
a plot to steal the
cache followed so closely

448
00:31:10,606 --> 00:31:12,191
by something as
choreographed as this.

449
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,036
I'll take this to the governor.

450
00:31:20,116 --> 00:31:23,706
You should be careful.

451
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:26,459
I understand the
governor has tasked you

452
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:29,462
with being his eyes and
ears while he convalesces.

453
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:31,255
In this particular instance,

454
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:34,509
you would be wise to make sure,
whatever happens to Captain Vane,

455
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:39,385
those men have no reason to
believe it happened because of you.

456
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:43,393
Whatever happens will
be the governor's decision.

457
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:45,141
Of course.

458
00:31:56,486 --> 00:31:59,572
Any change? No.

459
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,327
May I have a moment
with him, please?

460
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:25,723
I warned you...

461
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,190
...the closer you
let me get to you,

462
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,022
the more dangerous I would be.

463
00:32:35,817 --> 00:32:39,199
I've never given a damn
what people think of me.

464
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,657
But I give a damn
what you think.

465
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,247
I hope that when you wake,

466
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:48,417
you will understand
why I did what I did,

467
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:52,212
you will see that it was
all I could think to do

468
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:55,799
to protect you...

469
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:57,756
the only way I know how.

470
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:11,478
[BIRDS SQUAWKING]
[DOG BARKING]

471
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:19,031
Any news?

472
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:20,407
They say it
shouldn't be long now

473
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:22,614
before Mr. Scott leaves us.

474
00:33:29,288 --> 00:33:32,249
We need to talk about that.

475
00:33:34,585 --> 00:33:37,257
What about it?

476
00:33:37,337 --> 00:33:39,134
We're about to
enter into a battle

477
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:41,178
where every man
must be behind us

478
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:43,180
as any man with
motive not to be so

479
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,473
could sink us.

480
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:49,269
It would seem that you have
made sure that he has one.

481
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:53,316
If it'd gotten out, what he did,

482
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:56,361
you would likely be
stranded back in Nassau.

483
00:33:56,441 --> 00:33:57,737
Most of our men would be dead,

484
00:33:57,817 --> 00:33:59,197
and those that weren't

485
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:01,282
would be back in
those cages right now.

486
00:34:01,362 --> 00:34:06,496
So you sent the vanguard to
make sure that he understood this?

487
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:09,374
To prevent him from
getting any ideas

488
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:12,332
about doing it again, yes.

489
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:19,217
If you have something to add,

490
00:34:19,297 --> 00:34:20,385
you should just fucking say it.

491
00:34:20,465 --> 00:34:21,803
That's not why you did it.

492
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:26,224
Really? Would you like
to tell me why I did it, then?

493
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:28,393
Well, I wasn't there,

494
00:34:28,473 --> 00:34:32,438
but, um, I'd hazard the guess

495
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:36,442
that you learned of
what had happened,

496
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:39,737
told him how
fucking stupid he was,

497
00:34:39,817 --> 00:34:41,406
and in that moment,

498
00:34:41,486 --> 00:34:44,242
he gave you a look that
amounted to something

499
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:45,743
less than contrite.

500
00:34:45,823 --> 00:34:49,664
And in that moment, you felt it.

501
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:51,291
Felt what?

502
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:53,247
Darkness.

503
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,713
Hate.

504
00:34:56,793 --> 00:35:02,927
Showing indifference to the authority
that you sacrificed so much to acquire,

505
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:07,724
disdain for refusing
to acknowledge

506
00:35:07,804 --> 00:35:09,851
that his actions, had
you not intervened,

507
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:11,352
would have led to an outcome

508
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:15,691
that he would have held
you responsible for reversing.

509
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:18,944
Pride.

510
00:35:19,024 --> 00:35:21,280
Questioning what
kind of man you are

511
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,238
if you don't seek
retribution for the offense.

512
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:29,163
So what are you saying?

513
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:32,416
You saying I went
too far with him?

514
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:34,335
Maybe you went too far.

515
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:35,836
Maybe you didn't go far enough.

516
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,630
Maybe you did it just right.

517
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,882
The point is that
while you were doing it,

518
00:35:39,962 --> 00:35:44,970
you heard a voice telling
you that disciplining him

519
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,390
would prevent him from
repeating the offense,

520
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:51,226
a voice that
sounded like reason,

521
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:52,770
and there was reason to it,

522
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,439
as the most compelling lies

523
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:59,401
are comprised almost
entirely of the truth.

524
00:35:59,481 --> 00:36:03,318
But that's what it does.

525
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:07,326
Cloaks itself in
whatever it must

526
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:08,827
to move you to action.

527
00:36:08,907 --> 00:36:10,621
And the more you
deny its presence,

528
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,289
the more powerful it gets,

529
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:16,418
and the more likely it is
to consume you entirely

530
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:18,917
without you ever even
knowing it was there.

531
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:28,430
Now, if you and I are to
lead these men together,

532
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:32,851
you must learn to
know its presence well

533
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:38,480
so that you may use
