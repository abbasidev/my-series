mean that the others

141
00:08:32,768 --> 00:08:35,961

full-scale invasion of the beach,

142

If the Navy took over, stormed
the beach and cleared it,

150
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:55,451
and why would that
be such a bad thing?

151

and order" here.

154
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:06,156
there is no way I
will recapture the trust

otherwise have surrendered.

156
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,542

157
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:11,377
if they were either
dead or terrified of you.

158
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:13,829
Seems the Navy is offering
to see to one or the other.

159
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,714
It could take months to
pacify the island by force.

160
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:17,666

163
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:23,504
Yes, but if the Navy
were to remove anybody

164
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,756
who was setting those fires,

165
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:26,885
again, would that not be
preferable? How exactly

166

asking questions here?

167

You're saying it would
take too long to win it.

172

With all these resources,
you could outlast them.

173

concerned about the time?

00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:12,466
And with many of these parties, Whitehall,
my equity investors, my creditors,

180
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:14,385
the lapse of a deadline or two

181
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:15,719
might be bargained away.

182
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,639
But there is one
particular party

183
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:21,224
whose patience I
do not wish to test,

184
00:10:21,284 --> 00:10:23,726
a party whose history
with the pirates of Nassau

185
00:10:23,786 --> 00:10:26,562
suggests an extreme
reaction would likely follow.

00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:28,339

00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:41,576
secure the remains of the Urca
de Lima's gold stored within it,

190
00:10:41,636 --> 00:10:43,128
and return it to Havana.

191
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:45,233
Promptly.

192
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,965
Failure to do so
would confirm for them

193
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:50,051
that I am simply a
pirate by another name,

00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:51,419
not to be trusted,

195
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:54,422
and would result in a
launch of a fleet of ten ships

196
00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:58,481

to raze Nassau to the ground.

As long as the fort is taken
quickly and in its entirety,

217

of making landfall

Based on our readings

222
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:17,439
I would say that that
estimate is far too optimistic.

223
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,740
We'll have to cut the
men's rations again.

237

I would suggest that
we draw up two lists.

00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,120
One with the names of the men

ship once the wind returns,

240
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,484
and second, the men who aren't.

241
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,180
You think we should feed some
of the men more than others?

242
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,788
No, I think we should feed
some of the men and not others.

243
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,886
The survival of the greatest
number of men on this crew

244
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:19,555
rests entirely on our ability

245
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:21,557
to maneuver this ship to land.

246
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:23,692
Any food that is
diverted away from men

247
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:26,277
necessary to that end
only increases our chance

248
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:29,113
that every one of
us on this ship dies.

249
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:30,865
You can't divide
the men like that.

250

Most of the men on that list

251
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:33,401
will survive in a
weakened state.

00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:39,573
Well, why not just
take the second list

the side right now?

us all a lot of trouble?

Those men out there
hear the two of you arguing,

258
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,081
and they might just lose
whatever faith they've got left

259

what we're doing in here.

way while we exist in this state,

to make an issue

00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:09,184

into it in the first place.

emerge from this situation.

will compile two lists.

full food and water rations,
