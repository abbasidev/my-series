They escaped?

358
00:27:35,478 --> 00:27:37,336
Someone must have
left the pen unlocked.

359
00:27:37,396 --> 00:27:39,373
They overran a
handful of guards.

360
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:42,759
Well, perhaps I can help in
finding them and bringing them back.

361
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:44,795
You'd do that?

362
00:27:44,855 --> 00:27:48,015
I oversaw them for
weeks. They know me.

363
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:49,266
They might be
persuaded to return

would be treated fairly,

They'd rake any ship that
emerged on the other side.
