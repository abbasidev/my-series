Earlier today,

before we knew Rackham
was still on the island,

727
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:32,747
you seemed confident that we
could locate him and his friend in time.

728
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:35,836
You said it was possible

729
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:39,340

that we were looking for them.

It will keep the pressure on,
