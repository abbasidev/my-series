00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,040
<i>Listen, I wanted to follow up
on the Gentry Group of it all.</i>

350
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,249
- Oh, great.
<i>- Yeah. As I suspected,</i>

351
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,249
<i>Adam was having meetings out at JFK</i>

352
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,957
<i>- on Friday.</i>
- I knew that.

353
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,374
<i>And when I asked my younger colleagues
about Kew Gardens, they explained</i>

354
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,124
<i>the clients often like to experience
a little bit of local flavor</i>

355
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,915
<i>when they come to town.</i>

356
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,416
I see.

357
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,999
<i>Anyways, it's a dead end.
I told those stupid detectives</i>

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,832
<i>who called this morning as much.</i>

359
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:31,290
Yeah, I mentioned the Lyfts to them.
Who-who called?

360
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,582
<i>Oh, they double teamed me.</i>

361
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,124
<i>Hey, is the smug one a lesbian?</i>

362
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,290
- Loud and proud.
<i>- [chuckles] Knew it.</i>

363
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,457
<i>And the threats against you--</i>

364
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,082
<i>- have they followed up?</i>
- Doubtful.

365
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,165
But Catherine's guy's looking into it.

366
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,207
<i>Well, listen, if they're just gonna
sit around on their lazy asses,</i>

367
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,040
<i>- I'd be happy to play the heavy.</i>
- [Chloe] No.

368
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,249
It's all right, Bill.

369
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,707
<i>All right, well, if you change your mind,
the offer stands.</i>

370
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,083
<i>- Stay safe, you too.</i>
- Okay, thank you.

371
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,290
- [sighs]
- Okay, well, now you know.

372
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,290
Yeah.

373
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,708
[cell phone chimes]

374
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,083
Oh, Nicky.

375
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,583
- That's-- This is--
- [Nicky] Yeah, okay, okay.

376
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,332
Looks empty, Chlo.

377
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,207
What do you mean?

378
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,875
There's no calls, no texts.

379
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,624
There's no contacts in the contact book.

380
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,290
I don't think it was used.

381
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,540
[sighs] What the fuck, Adam?

382
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,541
What were you doing
with an empty burner phone?

383
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,791
If I say "dealing drugs,"
will you get mad?

384
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,165
Yeah.

385
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,749
- Dealing dru--
- Don't say it.

386
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,374
- But what if--
- Don't.

387
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,082
- Maybe it was your...
- Shh.

388
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,582
- housekeeper Analisa's.
- Shh. Shh.

389
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,790
- [phone closes]
- Maybe she's dealing drugs. [sucks teeth]

390
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,875
[atmospheric music]

391
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,041
She seems to have bought it.

392
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,333
The benefit
of a grieving widow's distraction.

393
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,415
For now.

394
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,707
So, Gentry confirms a meeting with Adam

395
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,082
that we don't have in our books.

396
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,290
Adam starts taking Lyfts out to Queens

397
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,040
on his own personal account.

398
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,957
Was he making a play

399
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,624
to steal Gentry as a client?

400
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,124
Well, he was ambitious.

401
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,040
I fully suspected it, had been for months.

402
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,749
But Gentry entertains it?

403
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,457
Leaving me?

404
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:33,082
[chuckles softly]
Well, you are sort of an asshole.

405
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:37,083
An asshole who's been
burying their bodies for a long time.

406
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,207
Whatever law firm it is
that's trying to poach Adam

407
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,249
wanted him
to bring Gentry along as a client.

408
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,582
Adam makes a show
of what he can do for Gentry

409
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,665
in greener pastures,

410
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,957
but Gentry doesn't take kindly

411
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,540
to having their intimate details

412
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,250
used as a deal sweetener.

413
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,499
So they confirmed
the solo meeting with Adam,

414
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,874
knowing that it would get back to me.

415
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,499
They only had to confirm it
because he's dead.

416
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,124
Regardless, Adam has made a mess
that needs cleaning up.

417
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,207
And what--

418
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,124
Latinos are famous
for their cleaning skills?

419
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,874
You said it, not me.

420
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,624
Lord knows what else he left
lying around that house with him.

421
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,583
Bless his soul.

422
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,540
So you'll head out to the house
since you're going that way anyway?

423
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,457
Your secretary told me

424
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,207
that you were meeting with the counsel
you referred for Ethan.

425
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,416
I'm sure that Chloe really appreciates
the support.

426
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,582
And don't wear those trousers
around the office anymore.

427
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,707
They're very distracting.

428
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,499
[line ringing]

429
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,707
No.

430
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,041
Confirmation from Gentry's
got him down a different path.

431
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,749
Well, I'm headed out there now.

432
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,250
Can stop by tonight.

[Mark Hamilton] <i>I've never seen them
so frisky, for lack of a better word.</i>

436
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,249
Frisky gazelles.

437
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,249
- Turn it up.

[scoffs] Wait nine and a half months,

440
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,499
you'll see the effects.

441
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,624
Gazelles don't have
the same gestational period as humans.

442
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,249
[Hamilton] <i>Uh, but,
uh, our research is showing that...</i>

443
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,165
You do not

444
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,749
know the gestational period of gazelles.
[chuckles]

445
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,457
I do.
Why would I make something like that up?

446
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,082
[laughs] But why

447
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,915
would you ever know that?

448
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,416
I know things.

449
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,207
Okay, boss.

450
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,165
- I know things.
- Sure.

What if he did it?

473
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,999
He didn't do it.

00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,290
You know him.

You know that.

And what the fuck is that?

488
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,000
Find the person who did it.

489
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,499
- Right.
- Right. Okay.

490
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,332

Hey. Good to see you.

Thank you for meeting me.

00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,332
Is that all you're gonna thank me for?

496
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,874
[chuckles] And for taking the case.

497
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:34,582
I owed you. You called, I came.

498
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:38,250
I walked right into that clusterfuck
of my own volition.

499
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,457
Sister wives thing--
that-that's new for me.

500
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,040
Black people don't do that shit.

501
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,207
We do other shit.

502
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,499
- How do you mean?
- Well, it's not every day

503
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,082
a woman marries her sister's ex-husband.

504
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:53,040
Oh, yeah, well... sure.

505
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,957
- There's that.
- Yeah.

506
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,749
There's that.

507
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,249
But it's the kid I can't get a read on,
you know?

508
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,332
He's-he's just not
what you would expect.

509
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,665
Yeah, he's his own person.

510
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,207
Chloe's done a great job with him.

511
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,207
Well, uh, uh, they both,

512
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:10,374
uh, have. Or did.

513
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,832
It's...

514
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:14,915
Well, assuming
the hearing goes as I think it will,

515
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,500
moms will take him home tonight.

516
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,499
What can I get for you today?

517
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,540
Caesar salad, extra croutons,
and probably fish

518
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:25,500
- with steamed vegetables for him.
- Fish-- [sighs]

519
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,040
He's watching his figure.

520
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,875
Thank you.

521
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,082
Yeah. [laughs]

522

00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:37,541
Full courtroom on this humid day.
Sit, sit.

698
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,083
[sighs]

699
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,124
The charge against the defendant,
Ethan Macintosh,

700
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:47,790
is murder in the second degree.

701
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:51,832
How does your client
wish to plead at this time?

702
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,499
My client pleads not guilty, Your Honor.

703
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,540
[Edelman] Mr. Willis,
you'd like to set bail at?

704
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:57,582
[Willis] Thank you, Your Honor,

705
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:59,915
but, given this isn't any ordinary case,

706
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:02,207
Ethan Macintosh is awaiting trial
for the violent murder

707
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,665
of his father, Adam Macintosh.

708
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,290
Suffolk County recommends the defendant
be remanded without bail.

709
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,749
[Sanders] Your Honor,

710
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,957
- Ethan Macintosh is no murderer.
- Wait, what?

711
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:11,624
He's a sweet, sensitive,

712
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:14,374
17-year-old boy who's just lost his dad.

713
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,415
[Willis] The defense may go on
listing the defendant's

714
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:20,249
positive attributes, but that doesn't
change the evidence against him.

715
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,249
Because not only does he have no alibi

716
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,040
for the hour during which
Adam Macintosh was murdered

717
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:27,457
but his DNA was found underneath
Adam Macintosh's fingerprints.

718
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:28,540
It's his son.

719
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,707
[Willis] And blood was found
on Ethan's shoe.

720
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:31,624
- It's Ethan's own blood.
- [Edelman] Mm, Counselor,

721
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,082
let's keep it courteous.

722
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:36,540
Evidence also suggests that Ethan
disarmed the security system

723
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:39,999
before staging a breaking and entering
to cover up his crime.

724
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,874
The items he reported stolen
were later found in his possession.

725
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,207
[Sanders] The prosecution has

726
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:48,665
shockingly declined to note that
the murder weapon was not among them.

727
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:51,290
Your Honor, the prosecution is clearly

728
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:54,082
trying to force me to preview my case.

729
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:57,415
Ethan Macintosh is heartsick and afraid.

730
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,082
Now he is specifically terrified

731
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,249
that he's going to bear
the consequences of a crime

732
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,332
he did not commit. He is terrified

733
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,624
that he is going to be separated
from his stepmother,

734
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,665
a highly well-respected
public figure whom he

735
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:11,999
loves deeply, and who has raised him
since he was a little boy.

736
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,665
A woman who has enabled Ethan
to have a history

737
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,540
of avoiding consequences. If I may.
[chuckles]

738
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:19,707
- [scoffs]
- This is a kid who,

739
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,374
when found with
a large quantity of marijuana,

740
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:23,874
had the means to pay off his friend
to cover it up.

741
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,540
A kid who,
when he brought a gun to school,

742
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,249
- had parents who made a donation
- Oh, God.

743
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,374
to make it all go away. So what's to say

744
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:33,208
this isn't a kid who,
after murdering his father...

745
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:36,165
...won't have the means to escape justice?

746
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,665
Ethan Macintosh is innocent

747
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,457
and whatever concerns
Your Honor might have

748
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,583
are easily addressed
with electronic monitoring.

749
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,207
[Willis] Your Honor, ask yourself,

750
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:48,374
if he had darker skin,

751
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,207
where would he be spending the night?

752
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,290
[gallery murmuring]

753
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:56,375
I think you and Ms. Sanders
know the answer.

754
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:06,165
Counselor, I agree that the consequences

755
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,500
of being held without bail
would be severe.

756
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:11,332
But on the other hand,
I don't want a situation

757
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,499
where we release the defendant
only to find out that

758
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,250
he's chartered a private jet
to the Swiss Alps.

759
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:22,665
The defendant is hereby
remanded without bail.

760
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,708
[somber music playing]

761
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,999
- Hands behind your back.
- [Nicky] Baby!

762
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,249
Shut the fuck up.

763
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,750
- Shut the fuck up.
- [panting]

- [Chloe] Don't let them see you like this.
- [Nicky crying] Fuck.

767
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,999
[reporter] Nicole, over here.

768
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,124
Did you get bad news?
Why are you so upset?

769
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,207
- Uh...
- Get in the car.

770
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,290
[reporter] How's Ethan holding up?

771
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:02,207
- Uh...
- What do you think his chances are?

772
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,082
Did he do it?

773
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:06,374
[clamoring continuing]

774
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:09,332
- [crying] Oh, my God.
- [car door opens]

775
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:11,457
[both gasping]

776
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,582
[Sanders] Okay, I know
this is upsetting--

777
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:15,040
I'll just say I did it.

778
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,624
- Absolutely not. Absolutely not.
- What? No. No.
- I did it.

779
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,040
- I did.
- That will only make Ethan look guiltier.

780
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:21,499
The detectives have your phone
pinging in Ohio

781
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,040
the entire night of the murder. Now, look,

782
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,374
there's a restaurant down the road,
it has a blue awning.

783
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:28,374
We're gonna meet there,
talk next steps. Okay?

784
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,582
Okay.

785
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:31,708
- [Sanders] See you there.
- Okay.

786
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,457
- A nightmare.
- Just put your seatbelt on. Let's go.

787
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,790
[Nicky] Oh, my God.

788
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,165
Oh...

789
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:41,165
Excuse me. Can you move, please?

790
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:44,165
How are you just, like, smiling right now?

791
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,833
- [officer] Back it up.
- Fuck. Oh...

792
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:49,290
Well, that's not how
I expected the day to go.

793
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,540
Ethan did not kill Adam.

794
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,540
And what happened today
doesn't mean he did,

795
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:54,708
but...

796
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,415
...but this is just the beginning

797
00:39:57,416 --> 00:40:00,082
of a long and complicated process.

798
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,624
Sometimes these things are delayed,

799
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:04,790
rescheduled once, twice, even three times.

800
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:07,290
Yeah, but doesn't Ethan
have a right to a speedy trial?

801
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:10,540
County courts drag out setting dates,

802
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,790
especially with a brain surgeon
like that in charge.

803
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:14,790
What's up with the tissues?

804
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:17,332
This is going to help us.
We need this time

805
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,790
- to come up with alternative theories.
- [Nicky] Okay, what about

806
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:21,582
the break-in thing
the prosecutor mentioned?

807
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,665
He didn't seem to buy it.

808
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:25,124
And for good reason.

809
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:26,375
Here.

810
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:30,040
You can see the room
has been messed up a little bit--

811
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,249
drawers opened,
papers on the floor, that sort of thing--

812
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,290
but the window was broken from the outs--

813
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:36,249
[server] Iced organic matcha.

814
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,707
- Thank you.
- [Sanders] Thanks.

815
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:42,790
But here you can see the window
was broken from the outside,

816
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:45,290
after the room was tossed.

817
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:47,415
So, the prosecutor was just
starting to make the point

818
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:49,833
that there actually wasn't a robbery.

819
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,874
- It was staged.
- Whoever killed Adam

820
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:55,499
just wanted
to make it look like there was.

821
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,624
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

822
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,874
[Sanders] Now, all of that's
well and good. He's got a job to do.

823
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,540
And ours is to prove

824
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:06,000
that person
couldn't have been Ethan. Okay?

825
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,582
So, who else has access
to that alarm code?

826
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,290
[soft, dramatic music playing]

827
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:13,832
I don't know. We don't use it.
We-we don't set it.

828
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:15,707
Adam clearly did.

829
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:17,750
And it's not like Ethan didn't know it.

830
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,915
I-- I don't know. I--

831
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,624

832
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,708
The housekeeper's cleared.

833
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:27,708
Well, when do we get to see him?

834
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,665
During visiting hours,

835
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:36,916
Ethan's legal guardian can go anytime.

836
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:42,374
So I... I-I don't see him.

837
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,999
Just for now.

838
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,499
I know that's not the best news--

839
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,415
No, it's not
because that's my son in there.

840
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:48,832
- I know.
- [Nicky] But you're gonna do everything

841
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:51,374
in your power
to make sure she can see him?

842
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,832
Yes, of course.

843
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:54,457
'Cause he needs her.

844
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,500
I understand.

845
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:03,582

you look perfect.

To the restraining order?

to keep this stuff in the past,

You want him home?
