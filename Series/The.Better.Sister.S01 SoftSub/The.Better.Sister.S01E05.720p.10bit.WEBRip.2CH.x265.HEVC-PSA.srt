364
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,541
Okay, yeah.

365
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,291
Of course.

366
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,415
So, what happened at Catherine's?

367
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,458
The worst wake I ever went to.

368
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,624
- What happened with the drinking?
- [sighs]

369
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:20,165
One phony douchebag after another

370
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,624
and you parading me around
in front of them.

371
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,082
You're right.

372
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,249
I'm sorry. It was awful.

373
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,582
Yeah.

374
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,875
Just...

375
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,750
It's scary when you drink.

376
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,290
I just wanted to eat gazpacho with you.

377
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,749
[scoffs]

378
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,124
[quiet, tense music playing]

379
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,583
[sighs]

380
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,415
Hey, um...

381
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:55,040
you want to continue
that conversation we started

382
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,916
about Dad, I'm... here for it.

383
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,333
I've had enough of Hank today.

384
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,124
Can't bring that in.

385
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,832
They're just treats for my son.
He's only 17.

386
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,583
Food is easy to hide contraband in.
It's not allowed.

387
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,665
Sorry.

388
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,750
[dramatic music playing]

389
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,665
Mom. [sighs]

390
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,957
Hi.

391
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,707
- Oh, my God.
- I asked Nicky not to say anything.

392
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,291
- I'm fine. I'm fine. Really.
- Oh, my God.

393
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,708
[sighs] Okay.

394
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,624
I'm so sorry. I had things for you.

395
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:57,040
I had, um, food,
and they wouldn't let me bring it in.

396
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,457
I even had the dumpling soup
that you love.

397
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,000
- That cheap one.
- [laughs]

398
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,749
When I get out of here...

399
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,290
- Right.
- ...we can eat

400
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,207
canned dumpling soup together.

401
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,708
[laughing] Okay.

402
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,582
- Have you been exercising?
- [laughs]

403
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,249
Why? Do I look good?

404
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,416
- Yes.
- [laughs]

405
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,666
I know you're on medication and...

406
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,082
I just want to say I'm sorry I didn't...

407
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,625
help you with that sooner.

408
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,666
How does it make you feel?

409
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,291
Comfortable in my skin.

410
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,416
Good.

411
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,832
- I really miss you.
- I miss you, too.

412
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,249
And everything just...

413
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,374
- sucks without you.
- [laughs]

414
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,915
[laughs]

415
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,332
[sniffling]

416
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,582
- It's been good seeing Nicky.
- Yeah.

417
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,916
I bet it's been nice to get to know her.

418
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,041
Baby, what is it?

419
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,749
[sighs] It actually hasn't been
that long since I talked to her.

420
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,249
- Wh-What do you mean?
- We text.

421
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,790
And talk on the phone sometimes.

422
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:31,415
She gave me a flip phone, like,
five years ago at Grandpa's funeral.

423
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:36,582
We didn't actually start, you know,
um, talking until recently.

424
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,708
[tense, dramatic music playing]

425
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,999
[sighs]

426
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,499
Um...

427
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,708
You know, I found that secret phone
in my office.

428
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah, Michelle said.

429
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,125
It's evidence now.

430
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,207
Is there anything in there
that I should know?

431
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,375
Anything... incriminating?

432
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,708
Not about me.

433
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,625
Kevin's the only other person
who had the number.

434
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,500
Oh.

435
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,790
How's it been with Nicky?

436
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:19,207
She's-she's come a long way, right?

437
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,708
With her drinking and stuff?

438
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,583
I just can't wait for you to come home.

439
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,791
[birds chirping]

440
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,375
I love how he sleeps
with his little butt in the air.

441
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,999
- Are you okay?
- God, you know,

442
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,415
I always wanted a pool, and I just feel
like the blue of this pool is so weird.

443
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,250
Right?

444
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,582
All your art stuff is in the basement.

445
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,790
I just saw it.

446
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:59,124
Why don't you bring it out here,
keep your hands busy?

447
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,665
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

448
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:04,540
Just fuck these fucking hormones.

449
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:07,166
Are you going to be able
to take care of our son today?

450
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,416
Of course.

451
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,374
Bye.

452
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,041
[mysterious music playing]

453
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:22,915
It's worse.

454
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,249
Like, like, she can't get out of it.

455
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,916
Chloe, I can't keep track
of the lies anymore.

456
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,915
Yeah, maybe. I...

457
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,625
I don't know
if I can trust her around him.

458
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,374
[sighs]

459
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,707
You scared me.

460
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:49,875
Ethan told me about the phone
you gave him at Dad's funeral.

461
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:54,915
Then you sat in my car, lying,

462
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:58,249
pretending you don't know whose it is,

463
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,957
letting me believe
that it might be Adam's.

464
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,582
- I was protecting him. I--
- S-Stop.

465
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:07,790
Then you tell me this Dad story
right as we're trying to leave

466
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:10,499
to attend a memorial
for our murdered husband.

467
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,749
And it's, uh...

468
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,332
it's bewildering to you
that I can't address it.

469
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,915
[scoffs] You said it didn't happen.

470
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:21,249
It did.

471
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:26,165
You were trying to shit on every little
bit of good that I got from our family.

472
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,040
I told you,

473
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:31,832
because I'm tired of carrying it alone--

474
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,249
You taught Ethan to lie to me.

475
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,999
And out of all the damage
that you have done--

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,082
Our lives are a lie.

477
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,125
Your life is a lie!

478
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,999
What did Ethan tell you?

479
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,666
[slow, mysterious music playing]

480
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:51,541
Look, um...

481
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,333
You're right.

482
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,499
I'm sorry.

483
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,874
I am truly sorry

484
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,665
for everything.

485
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,833
- [sniffles]
- Really.

486
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:11,166
Yeah, well, it's not like
your apology just ends it.

487
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:15,290
'Cause one trespass leads to another,

488
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,874
leads to another,

489
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:20,915
and you're just nothing
without this constant drama.

490
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:23,000
Just a...

491
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,500
...fucking empty hole.

492
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:31,500
You're so mean sometimes, you know?

493
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,749
I'm gonna head to the city for a while,

494
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,833
till I can visit him again.

495
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,625
How was he?

496
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:48,499
You mean besides all
the fucking bruises on his face?

497
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,999
He asked me not to worry you. I--

498
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,540
You love this control.

499
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:56,540
- [sighs]
- Yeah, maybe you should just

500
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:59,707
try to act halfway clean
next time you see him.

501
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:02,791
Try to hide the fact
that we fucking hate each other.

502
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,915
[Sanders] <i>Two sisters diverged
in the woods.</i>

503
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,915
The pariah they erased
from their family history

504
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,749
now has sole access to that son.

505
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,499
It's the luckiest break
this broken woman has ever had.

506
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,082
Time alone with her sweet boy

507
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:20,040
while he's in the joint.

508
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,124
You like the kid.

509
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,249
- Yeah.
- [phone ringing]

510
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,999
He's the only mature one in that family,

511
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,040
- that's for sure.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

512
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:30,207
- Chloe's tech detective keeps calling.
- Why?

513
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,457
Must be following up
on the threats from her office.

514
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,915
So, an employee or two hates her.

515
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:37,540
Doesn't mean that they killed her husband.

516
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,749
And not to mention,
none of it's admissible in court.

517
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,582
- Right.
- Okay.

518
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,957
- So...
- Mother-aunt and...

519
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,457
Subpoenas are in process,

520
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:48,249
all the communications from the accounts
found on Ethan Macintosh's computer.

521
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,624
- And what about the burner phone?
- Irrelevant.

522
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,874
- Wasn't the defendant's.
- Uh, Adam Macintosh's work files?

523
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:56,957
The-the boss, Braddock, he-he got cagey
when we asked him about the case

524
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,249
that Adam had been working on,
the Gentry Group--

525
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,749
Why would we undermine our case

526
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,583
by looking like we were searching
for additional suspects?

527
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,957
The strength of our case relies upon

528
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:09,624
there being no other suspect
with as much supportive evidence.

529
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:13,707
Any evidence that might introduce
another potential suspect

530
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:16,415
would be the reasonable doubt
a jury needs to acquit.

531
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,540
So, why would we,

532
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:23,082
we, the prosecution, go looking for that?

533
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:26,457
Dom, that kind of dramatic effect
probably works in trial,

534
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:29,624
but at present, sounds like
you're reading slam poetry to slow kids.

535
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,791
- [scoffs]
- [laughs]

536
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:37,708
You cops are so thin-skinned.

537
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,165
Don't let him get to you.

538
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:44,332
That little kerchief in his pocket

539
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:47,374
invalidates anything he might say,
far as I'm concerned.

540
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,582
Listen to me.

541
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,874
His job is to speak in technicalities.

542
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,832
Yours is to find anything
that goes in either column.

543
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,415
We still got a few weeks left till trial.

544
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,415
I know you don't love the kid for this,

545
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:02,375
and while I may disagree,
it either is or isn't him.

546
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,832

Tides have turned.

551
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:14,040
This is your problem.

552

not in the real world.

553

Say what you're saying.

554
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:23,582
Look, go up there in the cloud and get the
messages off the burner phone yourself.

555
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:26,457
Go into town, make trouble
at the husband's office.

556
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:29,165
Rattle the boss's cage.
Be proactive, okay?

557
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,915
As long as it doesn't
take you too far astray,

558
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:35,290
be thorough,
follow the path as far as it goes.

559
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:37,207
You're a good detective.

560
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,124

561

Hey, Detective.

Uh, honey, let me call you right back.

595
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,291
Yeah, I will.

596
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,333
Time for a change at the house, huh?

597
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,790
- That your wife?
- Perimenopause.

I really don't.

Well, it's nothing to have shame about,

I'm doing fine,

You know damn well she's in Manhattan.

- He's got a real hard-on for her.
- What a crazy turn, right?

Going from beloved do-gooder

My partner and his Google Alerts.

616
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:18,124
Yeah. Not a lot of sympathy
left out there for your sister, though,

617

she pretends to care about.

- Here. I got you.
- No. I-I got--

You came off looking good, though--
the wronged mother.

you were the one with the publicist.

All right, thank you, Cagney and Lacey.

622

sweating her menopausal balls off.

Oh, yeah, it's been hot at night,
I'll give her that. No relief.

Oh, by the way, "Cagney and Lacey,"
it's a compliment.

- Our condolences.
- Thank you.

00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:39,124
Thank you. Um...

00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:42,000
he told me he was working with you
before he died.

644
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:45,540
You know what's coming.

645
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:47,707
We can't confirm or deny that.

646
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:50,249
I can confirm
that he is dead because of it.

647
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,082
- Because of his work with you.
- [Olivero sighs]

648
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,499
Have you talked
to the detectives working this case

649
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,749
- about this theory?
- No.

650
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,749
'Cause there's not much we can do for you.

651
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,790
Well, I talked to the people
that I know at the law firm.

652
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:05,124
- Lawyers close ranks.
- But our door is always open to you.

653
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:07,915
So we can have
another elliptical conversation.

654
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,625
It's a condition of our position.

My son is good.

658
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:22,708
And he will die in prison
for a crime he didn't commit.

659
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,666
He didn't do this.

660
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:30,500
He didn't do this.

661
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,540
[Olivero] I'll walk you out.

662
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,124
[whispers] I'll be right back.

Ms. Taylor, wait.

665
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,999
- Off the record?
- Yes.

666
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,165
Get into his office files
and ping me if you find something.

667
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,124
We need intel on the Gentry Group.

668
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,582
They'll never let me do that.

669
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:55,457
Don't ask. You're his wife.

670
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,374
His property is yours now.

671
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,249
So this is definitely part
of what happened to him?

672
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,332
If you can get me
something concrete, firm,

673
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,250
I can give you something real.

674
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,125
What'll I get?

675
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,540
You mention this conversation,

676
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:17,207
particularly to anyone
involved in your son's case,

677
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,625
prison time.

678
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,707

let me know what you want.
