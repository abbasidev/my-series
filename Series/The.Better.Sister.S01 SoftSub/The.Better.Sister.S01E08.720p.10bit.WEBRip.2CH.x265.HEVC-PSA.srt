only to find out, no, they're worse,
and I can't even get them what they want.

00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,125
Okay. Okay. How can I help you?

358
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,665
The FBI wants what... [sighs]

359
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,500
...what Adam had on Gentry.

360
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,415
- [scoffs] What did Adam have?
- Proof.

361
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:51,291
How they could build the projects
so quickly and cheaply.

362
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,166
I don't know what you're talking about.

363
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,665
Chloe... [sighs] You could build
a stadium in a couple months

364
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:04,957
if you've got unlimited labor
and no regulations.

365
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,415
A worker dies on the job one day,

366
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,915
ten more are there
to replace him the next.

367
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,915
Even if they're lied to
about what they're doing,

368
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,250
their passports are taken away
when they get there.

369
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,290
Oh, Jesus.

370
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,582
That's-that's human trafficking.

371
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,415
It's indentured servitude.
It's manslaughter.

372
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,333
Oh, my God.

373
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,374
- That is fucking horrifying.
- Braddock and Braddock

374
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:36,082
helped those scumbags build out
their holding structures.

375
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,249
Most of us didn't know the worst of it.

376
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,665
Those on the inside--
Bill, eventually Adam--

377
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,666
they did.

378
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,415
Look, the FBI's case is close,
but Gentry's smart.

379
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:52,790
They outsourced the worst of their
holdings to other stakeholders, like Bill.

380
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,582
And most of them,

381
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,290
just happy to be bought, like Bill.

382
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,624
And Adam is one of the only people
that was willing to work with the FBI?

383
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,665
I don't know.

384
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,582
I guess his conscience
outweighed his greed.

385
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:09,124
But Adam had access to material I don't.

386
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,499
Okay, but his-his files
on them were empty.

387
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,749
His computer had already been wiped.

388
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,749
No, but he was meticulous. He...

389
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,582
he would've kept a paper trail.

390
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,124
He kept records.

391
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,915
He had records about everything Gentry.

392
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,207
- Okay.
- That was his guarantee.

393
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,290
He would print them.

394
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,624
He'd put them in that old briefcase.

395
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,915
No, no, there was no files in there.
It was just a gun.

396
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,874

00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,582
Olivero, he's gonna... [sighs]

400
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,374
...he's gonna get me disbarred or,
I don't know, maybe worse.

401
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,000
He shows up at my house...

402
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,957
I'm freaking out here, Chlo.

403
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,541
I set up cameras at my place,
and I put them inside fake rocks.

404
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,915
But if Gentry got wind that Adam and I
were working with the FBI?

405
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,457
As much as I hate to help
this asshole's case,

406
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,458
as long as they're operating...

407
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,374

Agent Olivero was physically aggressive

We met to exchange information

00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:36,708
But I worked some magic.

712
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:43,582
Detective Guidry was
on the scene that day,

713
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,957
searching for a man by the same name

714
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,750
and the same race.

715
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:52,832
She beat the shit
out of the wrong fucking Black guy?

716
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,624
And they covered it up?

717
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:57,082
It's not admissible in court, any of it.

718
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,124
[laughs]

719
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,457
And the police higher-ups would
shut it down

720
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:00,790
before it even got there.

721
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,499
They're very good at protecting their own.

722
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,165
- Cocksuckers.
- [scoffs] Well,

723
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:06,582
court of law's not the one that matters.

724
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,916
Thank you so much
for getting this from, uh--

725
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,582
I don't want to know
where you get things from.

726
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:15,874
Nothing ever actually disappears.

727
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:18,166
That's unfortunate for most of us.

728
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,915
Nice doing business with you, Jerry.

729
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:22,208
[exhales]

730
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,958
Hey, your man came through, so...

731
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:32,457
Y-- I'm headed to her now.

732
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,541
Where the fuck are you?

733
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:35,874
I'll tell you later.

734
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,874
- I'm headed home.
<i>- What do you mean, "later"?</i>

735
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:39,415
Chlo, I am freaking out.

736
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,374
I got used to having a Nancy Drew shadow.

737
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,707
I do not like not knowing
where the fuck she is.

738
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:47,207
[thrilling music playing]

739
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,791
[phone buzzing]

740
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,875
[faint TV chatter]

741
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:16,749
Debbie Macintosh?

742
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,999
I'm Detective Nan Guidry.

743
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,833
I'm working on your son Adam's case.

744
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,707
Oh, yeah.

745
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,582
I saw you on TV.

746
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,166
Outside the courthouse.

747
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,707
It must've been difficult,
watching all that stuff.

748
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,207
Folks just loved it.

749
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,040
They couldn't get enough.

750
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:35,374
Story like that, though,
what do you expect?

751
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:37,415
It's like a Danielle Steel novel.

752
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:39,333
<i>The Sisters.</i>

753
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,540
Do you mind if I come inside?

754
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:44,249
Talk to you for a minute?

755
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,166
You got to push me the rest of the way.

756
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,333
Uh, you in neutral?

757
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,832
He was very uptight,

758
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,749
my son,

759
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,415
about the way things ought to be.

760
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,665
We didn't see eye to eye in that respect.

761
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:11,082
He didn't appreciate some of my choices.

762
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:14,832
Even though I told him he wouldn't even
have a goddamn social security number

763
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,625
if it wasn't for me.

764
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,957
We hadn't spoken in a long while.

765
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,040
Must've been hard doing it alone.

766
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,749
Father in jail and all.

767
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,790
[wheezes]

768
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:29,207
They let that bastard out about two weeks
before the cancer got him.

769
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,582
Huh.

770
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:33,374
My source said he died in jail.

771
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:34,957
Yeah, wrong again.

772
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,624
He called Adam.

773
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,915
Didn't hear back from him.

774
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,832
Died in my arms.

775
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,874
You and the ex reunited?

776
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,874
[laughs] Fuck no.

777
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,165
[laughs]

778
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,875
We, no, we hated each other, but...

779
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,832
You know, I couldn't let him die alone,

780
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,624
smelling like prison, so... [sniffles]

781
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,290
I did what I could, I...

782
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:01,875
clipped his nails and combed
the three hairs he had left on his head.

783
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:07,040
He just wanted to meet his grandson
before he died.

784
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:09,083
And he never heard back from Adam.

785
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,499
Particular type person can cut family out.

786
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,332
The only time I ever held Ethan

787
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,540
is when he was a baby,

788
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,416
before all that trouble.

789
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:24,082
What happened at the pool.

790
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,916
With Nicky.

791
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:28,041
Yeah.

792
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:30,832
This whole town chewed her up.

793
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,582
It's a tough thing to come back from.

794
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:36,582
You show me a mother
who's perfect all the time.

795
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,790
- Nobody wants to hurt their kid.
- [phone buzzes]

796
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:40,875
We make mistakes.

797
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:45,874
{\an8}I mean, sure you have your Caseys,
your Andreas, they go crazy, lose it

798
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:48,457
{\an8}and drown their babies in the tub.

799
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,291
{\an8}But that's not Nicky.

800
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,540
You still see Nicky?

801
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:56,249
She brings food by for me,
Mondays and Thursdays.

802
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,582
On account of my not being able
to get around too easily.

803
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:02,207
'Cause my license still in limbo.

804
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,583
Yeah.

805
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:07,082
But not since...
since what happened with Adam?

806
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,999
She came back.

807
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,082
Not when she said she would.

808
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:12,749
She didn't even bring my cream.

809
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,874
Your cream?

810
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,374
Heavy whipping.

811
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:16,790
For my Jell-O.

812
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,125
You do Atkins?

813
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,291
- Uh...
- She left her phone here, too.

814
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,666
When was this?

815
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,624
The day before it happened.

816
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,999
I'm not sure when she got it,
'cause by the time

817
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,208
she did come back,
she said they called her on it.

818
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,415
And that's when she told me.

819
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:38,500
[menacing music playing]

820
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:43,624
Wait, what did you say to me?

821
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,165
[Nicky] The police in New York

822
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,666
called and told me...

823
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:51,207
...Adam's been killed.

824
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:53,707
Killed? Killed? Killed how?

825
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,040
He was stabbed.

826
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,832
Murdered? My boy murdered?

827
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,790
No, no, no, no, no, that' s impossible.

828
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,082
I'm so sorry.

829
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,541
You're a fucking liar.

830
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,374
I don't believe one fucking word.

831
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,874
You get out of my house now.

832
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:08,249
You get the fuck out of my house!

833
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,374
Coming here with that bullshit!

834
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:11,791
Get out!

835
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,875
[screaming]

836
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,833
But by that afternoon,
it was all over the news.

837
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,541
I kept calling her, leaving messages,
but she wasn't picking up.

838
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,666
Not at first, at least.

839
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,833
People find all sorts of ways
to disappoint you.

840
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:39,665
[Guidry] So Nicky was here

841
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:41,832
the day Adam was murdered.

842
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,915
You expected her to come back,
but she didn't.

843
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:45,915
Even though she'd left her phone here.

844
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:48,166
And it was here all night.

845
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:52,499
When she did come back,
she told you Adam had been

846
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,290
stabbed.

847
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,791
Would you say this was mid-morning?

848
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,040
What are you doing?

849
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:02,207
I'm just putting together
a statement that you could sign.

850
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,166
Just confirming those details.

851
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,000
I haven't told you shit.

852
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,458
[Nicky sighs]

853
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,290
Huh.

854
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,540
Definitely thought
the dog'd be gone by now.

855
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:31,999
Well, Franzen grew on me,
so I bought him a friend.

856
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,457
Winter.

857
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:34,832
Oh.

858
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:35,999
That's how it works.

859
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,457
Hi, Winter.

860
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,166
Okay.

861
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:43,040
You're gonna want to push this out
far and wide,

862
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,166
in as damaging a light as possible.

863
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:50,000
You're gonna like it.

864
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,000
It's like a gift.

865
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:00,124
Yeah.

866
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,915
- [chuckles] I know.
- You're gonna

867
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,707
piss off a lot of police with this.

868
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:04,790
What else is new?

869
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,500
This isn't Ohio, Nicole.

870
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:10,083
Noted.

871
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,249
Maybe you can use
that reporter Sid, from the wake.

872
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,665
He seemed to have no trouble
publishing from questionable sources.

873
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:19,333
Indeed.

874
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:22,040
Today.

875
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,708
Now.

876
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:26,250
Please.

877
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:30,165
And thank you.

878
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:32,332
This is good for you too, isn't it?

879
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:35,332
For whatever comeback campaign
you got going for Chloe?

880
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:38,207
Please and thank you.

881
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:41,415
Have you given any thought to my proposal?

882
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:43,749
I'm sure Chloe's told you,
they're talking big numbers.

883
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,499
You could get rid of the Etsy store.

884
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,499
Because it will be both of you

885
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,708
writing the book together.

886
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,374
[sighs]

887
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:59,666
I'd be intrigued if I had any fucking
idea what you were talking about.

888
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:02,958
[sighs]

889
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,083
Expedited warrant
for Bill Braddock's home office.

890
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,415
