00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,457
like an unlovable piece of shit is,

528
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:10,749
that his overachieving,
fit father piled on about...

529
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,707
I don't know, maybe Ethan got tired of it.

530
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,165
Maybe there are not enough
Gucci sneakers in the world

531
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,707
to make him feel adequate.

532
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:21,708
Maybe he stabbed him to death
just to shut him the fuck up.

533
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,332
Just saying.

534
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,083

So gorgeous.

00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:21,999
He had AIDS back when
there was nothing that could be done.

No meds, nothing.

I knew he was gonna die.

556
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:31,915
But one night,
he went for a walk on the beach and...

557

- killed himself.
- Jesus, Bill.

against a specific suspect.

878

880

881

Maybe...

882

- Ms. Taylor, hang on.

884

I was on the beach by myself
for a little while the night Dad died.

885

But that's not what you told the police?

886
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:15,124
No. I told them
that we were together all night.

887
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,624
Why did you lie?

888
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,332
What is wrong with you?

889
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:21,040

- Of course he didn't do it.

890

- Are you family?
- What?

891
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,124
- This is my sister.
- And Ethan's mother.

892
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,707
Biological. Ethan lives with me.

893
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:27,999
Okay. Why was he even talking
to police without a lawyer?

894
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,332
I don't know. I've never,
I've never been arrested, unlike you...
