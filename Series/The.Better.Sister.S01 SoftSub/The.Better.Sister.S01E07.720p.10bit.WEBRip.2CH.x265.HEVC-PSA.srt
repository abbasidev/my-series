- Even though he was murdered?
- Doesn't matter.

00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,749
- Anything I can do?
- Weed treatment for Gentry. Full spray.

Chloe knows her way
around a gutting knife.

87
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,582
Gutting knives are for game.

88
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,124
Oh, see, she once stabbed a giant rabbit.

89
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,582
Ugh. Really?

90
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,915
[Nicky] Oh, well, don't take that...

91
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,665
- Oh. [laughs]
- Oh. I saved, saved.

92
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,207
That was a merciful thing to do.
That rabbit was dying.

93
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,790
Okay, now you sound like Hank.

94
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,832
Dad used to take us camping
at this awful Wallace Lake...

95
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,165
I liked it there.

96
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,999
...and they would fish,
and then they would have to bend the necks

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,415
to drain the blood after they hooked them.

98
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,999
- I'm losing my appetite.
- I'm just saying,

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,540
you are more outdoorsy than you let on.

100
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:50,041
I loved the ghost stories and the rituals.

101
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,625
"As I lay me down to sleep"
is not a ghost story, it's a prayer.

102
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,790
Yes. "Now I lay me down to sleep..."

103
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,124
[Chloe and Nicky] "I pray
the Lord my soul to keep,

104
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,124
and if I die before I wake,

105
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,499
I pray the Lord my soul to take."

106
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,874
- That's pretty good, huh?
- Yeah.

107
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,749
Remember, your soul had a shape?

108
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,957
It was oval.

109
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,124
Yeah, and it was opaque.

110
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,833
- Yeah.
- I can't believe you remember that.

111
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,166
It's based on Psalm 8.

112
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,040
"In peace, I will lay down and sleep,

113
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,582
for you alone, Lord,
make me dwell in safety."

114
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,332
[Chloe] Nicky changed the prayer

115
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,082
when we were camping to

116
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,707
"I'll wait for you at Wallace Lake."

117
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,749
Shadow Lake.

118
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,332
- [Chloe] No, Wallace.
- [Nicky] No, I changed it

119
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:39,499
to Shadow Lake because that's where
I went with my friends to shotgun beer.

120
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,499
- [laughs]
- [Chloe] Okay.

121
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,624
It's... it's nice to hear you guys

122
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,832
talk about growing up together,

123
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,332
even if you can't, you know,

124
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,957
agree on the name
of the shadowy Wallace Lake.

125
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,540
No, I have to admit,
I think she's right about this one.

126
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,624
What?

127
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,582
Mark the date.

128
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,040
Let's make a plaque to commemorate.

129
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,749
- It hurts me to say it. She's right.
- [Nicky laughs]

130
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,749
This is how it's supposed to be,
just the three of us.

131
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,166
[quiet, dramatic music playing]

132
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,999
I got to head into the city today.

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,207
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to come with

134
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,207
- and get some clothes?
- Oh.

135
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,290
Um, we...

136
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,582
we told school that,
uh, we're just gonna be

137
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,165
- taking a little break until...
- Yeah.

138
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,040
...we can figure everything out.

139
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,832
Yeah, that-that makes sense.

140
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,040
I just got to run out really quickly
and then we can go.

141
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,540
Ooh, yum.

142
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,500
- Yeah, take this.
- Thanks. Oh, yeah.

143
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,166
Mmm, it's so good.

144
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,874
Came out of nowhere,
the widow's love affair.

145
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,665
We ran DNA on Rodriguez's coffee cup.

146
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,624
- Nothing on the crime scene.
- And he had an alibi.

147
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,082
How did you miss
the text messages between them?

148
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,165
I fucked up.

149
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,332
[Clark] Hmm.

150
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,916
- [knocking on door]
- Yeah, come in.

151
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,707
Lieutenant, there's a reporter
from CBS News on the phone.

152
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,332
- Yeah, tell them no.
- Okay.

153
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,708
Oh, and Officer Han?

154
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,749
I, uh, I apologize

155
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,624
if my comments about your hair
made you feel uncomfortable.

156
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,541
We're, uh, we're learning
every day over here.

157
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,916
Thank you, sir.

158
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,707
So, instead of being out on my boat,
celebrating a win,

159
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,874
I'm kissing brass ass every day and night.

160
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,374
We don't bring a collar in on this one,

161
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,582
we are all fucked.

162
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,832
Okay, we can recheck the alibis.

163
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,249
Phone records, see what we missed.
Yeah, we're not gonna let you down.

164
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,207
- Fuck the phone records. Bring me scalps.
- [Guidry] You got it, sir.

165
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,915
Yeah, I-I don't think we can say that
about the scalps thing.

166
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,082
- Yeah, yeah. Hit the trail, kemosabe.
- All right.

167
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,165
[Guidry] Oof.

168
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,291
- Hey, Nan.
- Yeah?

169
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:38,583
I know you have this, uh, "Little League
Commission" thing, you know.

170
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,332
Oh, the psych eval.

171
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,457
Yeah. Well, me failing at euphemisms.

172
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,874
[chuckles]

173
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,916
Listen, knock that
out of the park, will you?

174
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,874
After that, 24-7 on this.

175
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,166
You got it, boss. Thank you.

176
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,291
He misses the mustache, too.

177
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,332
I agreed to be on the witness list.

178
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,790
Why didn't you just warn me
that that was coming?

179
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,999
Was I obligated to do so?

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,790
Well, no, but I thought
since we're friends...

181
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,332
Since we're friends, yeah.

182
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,957
Like you were obligated to tell me

183
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,624
that you were in love
with the defendant's mother?

184
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,332
[laughing] Come on.

185
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,332
- You never would've taken the case.
- Well...

186
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,082
- You wouldn't have.
- No.

187
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,957
Y'all meant for each other.
You're all a bunch of liars.

188
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,832
But you're not dark like they are,

189
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,332
those fucked-up white people.

190
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,208
[both chuckle]

191
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,040
- No.
- Oh, my God.

192
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,874
You know, maybe just

193
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,874
distance yourself from that family.

194
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,999
[Jake] Yeah, I know.
I got to get back on track, huh?

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,499
[Sanders] Yeah, back on track.

196
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,540
And this sleeping around
with other people's wives...

197
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,624
[Jake] Please,

198
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,707
- no lectures.
- I'm just saying,

199
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,791
I thought you would have
learned the last time.

200
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,041
- Did we?
- [chuckles]

201
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:16,958
Hi.

202
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,457
Chloe.

203
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,832
Well, look what the tide dragged in.

204
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,957
- I tried the front door, but...
- [Sanders] I got to go.

205
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,624
I got a date with a prosecutor
so I can gloat.

206
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,875
[laughs]

207
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,541
You need me, I'm here.

208
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,625
I've been thinking about Ethan.

209
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,957
Give him a hug for me.

210
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,500
Will do.

211
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,416
[exhales]

212
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,624
If this isn't a good time, I can...

213
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,165
Uh... [chuckles]

214
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,874
It's the Braddock HR department.

215
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,332
They want to put me on leave
until further notice.

216
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,416
Thank you for what you did in court.

217
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,458
I did it for Ethan, not you.

218
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,290
Sorry I wasn't able
to tell you our strategy,

219
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,665
I just thought it would unravel
the whole thing.

220
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,207
You don't really care
about me at all, do you?

221
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,916
Stop it, that's not true.

222
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,374
Well, you came over here, we had sex

223
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,124
after all the games you've been playing,

224
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,000
knowing how much I...

225
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,749
I would have done anything for you.

226
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,041
Anything except the thing I needed most.

227
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,040
I should have fucking known.

228
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,374
Why-why-why can't it, it both be true?

229
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,124
Why can't this have been real

230
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,707
and I also used it to bring my son home?

231
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,791
[tense music playing]

232
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,415
I have no idea who you are,

233
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,957
and it's... it's pretty scary.

234
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,457
Ask. Whatever you want
to know, I'll tell you.

235
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,666
Did you kill him?

236
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,499
No. Why would--

237
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,457
I saw bruises on your chest, like,
two days after Adam was murdered.

238
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,874
I told you, he shoved me.
Don't you remember?

239
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,791
Don't you remember how upset you were?

240
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,208
How angry you were?

241
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,124
Wait, Chloe, are you...

242
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,249
are you trying to frame me for this?

243
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,624
I wouldn't do that.

244
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,791
I would never do that.

245
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,124
Jake, I am so sorry that I hurt you.

246
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,250
What can I do?

247
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,165
- Hmm?
- Go home, Chloe.

248
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,082
[phone ringing]

249
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,291
Go home.

250
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,540
Sí, Mama.

251
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,500
No, everything's fine.

252
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,624
[Chloe exhales]

253
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,624
Ms. Taylor.

254
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,707
Detective Bowen,
please don't lurk on the road.

255
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,457
The neighbors don't like that.

256
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,999
Oh, I was trying to be respectful.

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,166
Oh. Well, what's up?

258
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,540
We're still looking for
your husband's killer, so you know.

259
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,999
[sighs] One would hope.

260
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,832
And seeing how you've been
meeting with the FBI,

261
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,249
you're obviously trying, too.

262
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,290
- You've been following me.
- Yes.

263
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,665
I-I was outside the diner when
you met with Agents Olivero and Younger.

264
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,124
Okay, is that a crime?

265
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,790
Any evidence pertaining
to your husband's murder

266
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,999
that you might be withholding...

267
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,916
that could implicate you,
and that would be a crime.

268
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,499
Agent Olivero is psycho.

269
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,208
And he's useless.

270
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,291
Yeah, because he has
other things on his mind.

271
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,790
Meaning?

272
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:47,957
You.

273
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,375
Um, I-I think you're confusing him
with you.

274
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,374
Uh, okay. Just be careful.

275
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,999
There's still a killer out there.

276
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,790
Appreciate the concern.

277
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,833
I'm definitely gonna
set the alarm. Thanks.

278
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,875
Oh.

279
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,999
And Ethan and I are going into the city,

280
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,333
in case you're interested
in my schedule for today.

281
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,582
Ethan, you ready?

282
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,874
[Ethan] Coming.

283
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,457
- [Chloe] Nicky?
- [Nicky] Yeah.

284
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,249
Detective Bowen was just here.

285
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,916
And I'm sure he was
following me in the city, too.

286
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,999
- Bye, Nicky. See you.
- Bye, honey.

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,832
- Okay. I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

288
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,916
- I'll be right out.
- Okay.

289
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,999
I would not be surprised
if the other one was following you, too.

290
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,499
Well, yeah, the gays love me.

291
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,415
- Just don't do anything dumb.
- [laughs] Okay.

292
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,665
- Hey. No funny business.
- Listen.

293
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,499
I was only doing that for Ethan.

294
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,415
Who cares if they're following us?

295
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,458
We got nothing to hide, right?

296
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,208
- Right.
- Right.

297
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,375
All right. See you soon.

298
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,290
Oh, can I borrow Adam's car?

299
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,790
- I-I turned in my rental.
- Yeah.

300
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,415
Just... watch the grass on your way out.

301
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,707
Oh, Jesus. Uh-huh.

302
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,457
And where you going?
Gonna go see your boyfriend?

303
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,082
[chuckles] What?

304
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,374
- Hemingway-lite, from the courthouse.
- Okay, he's not--

305
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:20,207
I bet he smells like the pages
of a vintage dictionary.

306
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,040
Uh-huh. No, get in the fucking car.

307
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,999
- A boatman's bookcase...
- I am going to a meeting, thank you.

308
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,582
Bet he loves <i>Moby Dick.</i>

309
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,665
Uh-huh. Ooh, what's on your mind?

310
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,290
Dick, that's what.

311
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,207
Knew the kid couldn't have done it.
He had computer hands,

312
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,207
all soft and uncallused.

313
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,207
Too slippery to hold a knife.

314
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:45,040
Arty Bello, the doorman
who worked for the Macintosh family,

315
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,499
he drove Ethan out this way
the night of the incident.

316
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,374
Mr. Bello said he came here after
to meet a friend.

317
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,582
Sure did.

318
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,749
- So you know him?
- Oh, yeah.

319
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,749
Do you recall how long
he was here that night?

320
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,415
Couldn't have been
more than a couple hours.

321
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,290
[chuckles] Didn't stop him
from getting good and fucked up.

322
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,707
Mm. So he wasn't here all night?

323
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,915
I asked him to leave around 7:00, maybe.

324
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,124
Afraid he was gonna come to blows.

325
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,665
Him and that fella, that poor soul.

326
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,957
And who's that?

327
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,041
- [music playing]
- [loud chatter]

328
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,457
[sighs]

329
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,582
Hey, can I get a double bourbon, please?

330
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,333
Gotcha.

331
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,333
- Want to open a tab?
- Nah.

332
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,249
Keep it.

333
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,625
Mm. Thank you.

334
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,457
Emptied now, Ron.

335
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,125
[Irish accent] Space for another
before I depart.

336
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,582
[Ron] Sure.

337
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,207
There you go, Arty.

338
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,750
[Arty] Thank you.

339
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,207
- Adam.
- [Adam chuckles] Hey, Arty.

340
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,249
- Good to see you. Hey.
- Oh, how are you?

341
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,249
Yeah, I had a--
I had a work thing before this.

342
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,999
It was a lot of traffic, so thought
I needed one of these before heading home.

343
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,415
Sure. All right.

344
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,749
Uh, Ethan is, uh...?

345
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,291
He's at your house. I dropped him off.

346
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,915
Yeah, couldn't take another dinner
with those people, so...

347
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,541
Oh, your wife's friends?

348
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,707
I-I appreciate you keeping
this little pit stop between us.

349
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,582
I told Chloe

we're starting from square one.

I want to get back to our work.

- I'm ready.
- Why?

559

You aren't the person you were before.

Oh. I'm so freaking thirsty.

She told me
these mushrooms would do that, but man.

like you did on the stand.

- The abuse.

It's just so...

...so... specific.

And you always suspected?

If I'd known for sure, I would have killed
that motherfucker myself.

what you did to your sister.

Don't give me that bullshit you gave Sid.

Was it even about Ethan?

It was always about Ethan.

The-the Adam thing was a surprise.

how much pain

599
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,749
I would feel to lose my sister.

600
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,082
'Cause when we were leaving her
out of our story,

601
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:27,750
it was... practical.

602
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,166
And also for survival.

603
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,416
But every time I thought
about what I did to her...

...it made me want to die.

606

Erasing her was the only way I could live.

607
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,957
Then that's the story you need to tell.

608
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,999
How it happened,

609
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,124
how it unfolded.

610
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,915

healing, really? Ever?

- Money.
- Oh.

617

- What?

say stupid shit like that.

Are we talking about writing a book?

Yup. With your sister.

- Come on. Think about it.

628
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,540
You can use the magazine
to tease the idea,

629
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:46,290
then publish a piece together,

630
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:48,165

704
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,624
Ah, it's kind of kinky.

705
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,708
[jazzy music playing]

706
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:18,457
[clears throat] Ah.

707
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,124
You've surfaced.

708
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,125
- [chuckles softly]
- Mm-hmm.

709
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,790
That was a heavy day in court.

710
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:27,749
You must be all wrung out.

711
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,083
[Chloe] Hmm.

712
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,249
- Sit.
- Bill, you can't fire Jake.

713
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,207
He's been through so much.

714
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:35,665
It's just a temporary leave.

715
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:38,291
As soon as this blows over,
we'll all be back at it.

716
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:41,332
Jake knows that I'm a loyal man.

717
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:44,499
Loyalty is very important to him.

718
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,999
Is it to you?

719
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,082
Mm. When earned.

720
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,207
Hi, Chloe.

721
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,541
Hi.

722
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:54,165
But now that the trial's over,

723
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,290
I was hoping that we all could
go back to being

724
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:58,790
rich and powerful people again.

725
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:01,415
You know, put all this behind us.

726
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:02,915
Fresh start.

727
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:05,207
Oh, is that why you deleted

728
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:08,124
all of the Gentry Group files
on Adam's computer, for a...

729
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,750
fresh start?

730
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,915
I did no such thing.

731
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:14,832
Bryce, did you?

732
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,374
No.

733
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,832
[Chloe] Hmm.

734
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,041
What were you looking for?

735
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,415
Just the truth
about what happened to Adam.

736
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:24,790
Mm-hmm.

737
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,582
Well...

738
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,458
we may never know.

739
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,707
You know, I did find

740
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,915
a card of an FBI agent

741
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:36,874
in Adam's things.

742
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,332
Might just give him a call.

743
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,791
Maybe it's better that you don't.

744
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:45,165
What's important now is your family.

745
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,207
Your safety.

746
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,207
And you've got your son back.

747
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:51,833
I'd focus on that.

748
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,207
Ah.

749
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,415
That's good advice.

750
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:59,832
Thank you for always
looking out for me, Bill.

751
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,916
Anything I can do, anytime, you know that.

752
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,458
Of course I do.

753
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,625
Get Gentry on the phone.

754
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:13,541
Now.

755
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:19,582
Hey, what's up, kid?

756
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,999
Hey.

757
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,540
Uh...

758
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:23,874
Do you know--

759
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:25,249
Does metal like this go in recycling?

760
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,040
Or is it bulk?

761
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:29,457
Oh, yeah. I'll take care of it. Mm.

762
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,707
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

763
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:31,999
Thanks.

764
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,207
- You see that couch?
- Yeah.

765
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,582
3R.

766
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,457
They get a new one every year.

767
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:39,124
I post it on Craigslist,

768
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:42,000
boom, somebody comes
and picks it up in two hours.

769
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,249
How long's a couch supposed to last?

770
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,249
Well, decades, I think.

771
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,791
You grow out of the costume?

772
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,082
Yeah.

773
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,582
You mind if I sell it?

774
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,750
No, no, go ahead.

775
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:02,290
You know, uh, my old man

776
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,249
used to take his teeth out

777
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,249
when he mowed the lawn.

778
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,415
That was the only time
I ever saw him smile.

779
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:11,999
[gentle music playing]

780
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,625
I did love shoveling the walk with you.

781
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,208
Best days of every winter.

782
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,582
Thanks.

783
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,041
All right.

784
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:26,624
Thanks for the suit.

785
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:28,250
[Ethan] Yeah.

786
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,375
Jesus!

787
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,041
[mouthing]

788
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,333
What the fuck?

789
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:03,249
How'd you get up here?

790
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,333
There's not a lot of security.

791
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,832
[chuckles]

792
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,499
You set us up.

793
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,874
Yeah, look, man.

794
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:13,374
I-I'm dealing with a lot of shit, okay?

795
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,040
Trim like that?

796
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:16,958
Might be worth the trouble.

797
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,707
Okay, uh...

798
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:23,874
Get the fuck off of my property.

799
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:26,790
[both speaking Spanish]

800
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:28,540
We're not amigos.

801
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,957
But we did have a deal.

802
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,290
You would provide us with information

803
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,290
to strengthen our case
against the Gentry Group,

804
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,749
and we don't arrest you
for your involvement.

805
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,165
Is that clear enough?

806
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:41,165
Yeah, it's blackmail.

807
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,457
It's not a deal.

808
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,999
Well, we got more on you from your work
with those scumbags than you know.

809
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,499
Paper trails that you signed off on
to cover their asses.

810
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,082
Well, I know that you got
someone planted on the inside at Gentry.

811
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:56,165
Because they confirmed a meeting
that never even took place.

812
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,499
No, hey, it's slick.

813
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,707
By the way, detectives bought it.

814
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,707
Braddock bought it, too.

815
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,499
So just...

816
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,833
use your plant, okay?

817
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,582
I'm fucking out.

818
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:11,416
You know, Adam was out, too.

819
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,290
Last time we saw him.

820
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:18,916
And there's your pending murder charge.

821
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:21,582
[scoffs]

822
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:25,040
I'm not being charged with anything,
okay, asshole?

823
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:27,915
And Braddock deactivated my access cards.

824
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:30,165
I can't get into my own fucking office.

825
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:32,415
You're a smart guy,
why don't you fucking figure it out?

826
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,874
Or?

827
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,790
Or we file a grievance against you
with the New York State Supreme Court.

828
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,582
And you lose your license to practice law.

829
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:41,582
[shouting in Spanish]

830
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:42,915
Fuck.

831
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:45,082
- [grunts]
- I will bury you

832
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,582
under this fucking deck!

833
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,250
Bury you!

834
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,250
Okay, okay.

835
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,750
[speaks Spanish]

836
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:59,999
And get me what you fucking owe me!

837
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,458
[suspenseful music playing]

838
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:20,332
Guys in front said I'd find you out here.

839
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:23,832
Yeah, I was waiting for the guys
to come and pick up the couch.

840
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:25,415
Is this yours?

841
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:27,124
Yeah, it's...

842
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,374
one of my favorite pleasures.

843
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,874
Hey, everything okay, Detective?

844
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,499
You tell me.

845
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,499
Come on, Arty, alibi was bullshit.

846
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,707
Bar owner told us a different tale.

847
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,958
One that involved you and Adam.

848
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,832
Be more comfortable
talking down at the station?

849
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,249
Out of earshot?

850
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,040
It's not what you think.

851
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:49,499
It never is.

852
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,790
I was with someone.

853
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:53,207
A woman.

854
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:55,207
Where I went after the bar.

855
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:57,166
Assuming not your wife?

856
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:01,290
Once every two years, maybe, we meet.

857
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,832
Same hotel, same room.

858
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:05,249
I saw that movie.

859
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,832
Yeah.

860
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:09,291
Tell me what the argument
with you and Adam was about.

861
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:13,833
He needed to hear some things
from another man.

862
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:16,832
I lost my temper.

863
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:18,207
True.

864
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,916
Then off you went to the affair?

865
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,958
Give me your lover's number.

866
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,625
Please, please.

867
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,249
Be discreet.

868
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,249
My wife don't deserve that.

869
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,582
And Janice'll tell you
everything you need to know.

870
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,166
She was with me all night.

871
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,082
You have any interaction with that sister?

872
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,290
- What, Nicky?
- Yeah.

873
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:54,540
Yeah.

874
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,207
She comes out here and smokes.

875
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,040
Makes private calls.

876
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,957
And still takes care of the mother
after all the shit she's been through.

877
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:02,207
Whose mother?

878
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,708
Adam's, the one that lives in Ohio.

879
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:07,540
Huh.

880
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,207
Doorman's alibi checks out.

881
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:11,040
He crashed on his cousin Tommy's couch.

882
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:13,540
I guess he's been fibbing
to his wife about the number

883
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,790
of beers he puts away any given weekend.

884
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:18,790
Also said that Nicole Macintosh

885
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:21,332
and Adam's mother are close back in Ohio.

886
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:22,499
