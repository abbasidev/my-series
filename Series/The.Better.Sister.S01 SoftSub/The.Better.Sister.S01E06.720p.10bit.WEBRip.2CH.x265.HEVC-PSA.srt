00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,500
[chuckles softly]

711
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,750
So, how did you and Adam meet?

712
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:10,082
Uh, we-we, uh,
knew each other in junior high,

713
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,082
actually, and reconnected later on.

714
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,332
What drew you to him?

715
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,124
Objection. Relevance?

716
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,666
Overruled.

717
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,290
Please answer the question.

718
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:23,000
What drew me to him?

719
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,790
I mean, you've seen the pictures.
He was hot.

720
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:28,541
[laughing]

721
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,833
What was Adam like?

722
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,582
He was very ambitious.

723
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:40,707
Like, if he decided he wanted something,

724
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,082
it went on the to-do list.

725
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:45,415
You know, very type A,
very much like my sister.

726
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:47,457
Not like me at all.
He was everything that I was not.

727
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,415
He was organized,

728
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:53,665
disciplined, he wanted me to be better,

729
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:57,166
and thought
that I could change, but I was...

730
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:01,832
I was just always gonna be what I was.

731
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:04,041
And what was that?

732
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:06,540
A drunk.

733
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:09,000
- [murmuring]
- [Nicky] A drunk.

734
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,040
I...

735
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,790
really tried,

736
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:18,291
um, after Ethan was born.

737
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:22,083
For him, at first, I really tried.

738
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:27,458
And it just got harder and it got worse.

739
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,083
The last thing any mom wants is
for her kid to get taken away.

740
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,457
But then, you realize

741
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:42,749
they're better off without you, that was
something I had to admit to myself.

742
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,415
And I knew Adam wouldn't fail at being

743
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,874
a good dad, you know,
he-he cared way too much

744
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:51,125
about what other people thought of him.

745
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,791
Would you describe his relationship
with Ethan as a good one?

746
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,375
I don't know. I wasn't there.

747
00:40:07,791 --> 00:40:10,125
You were in touch with Ethan, though.

748
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,749
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

749
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,166
What did you talk about?

750
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,415
Cooking.

751
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,165
Baking shows
and Pasta Grannies on YouTube.

752
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,665
[gallery laughs]

753
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:28,583
No insight into the dynamic
between father and son?

754
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:38,249
I was just so happy to be talking.

755
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,541
I did not want to make any waves.

756
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:44,665
Okay.

757
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:46,541
I see.

758
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,041
No further questions.

759
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,625
Would the prosecution
like to question the witness?

760
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,749
So let's backtrack here.

761
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,749
- You're in Cleveland. They're in New York.
- That's right.

762
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,749
And you and your son were in touch, how?

763
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,832
[Nicky] I gave him a flip phone

764
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,915
just so that we could
talk or text if he wanted,

765
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:17,540
when he wanted, about five years ago.

766
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,040
[Willis] And during
which occasion was this?

767
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,124
[Nicky] At my father's funeral.

768
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,457
[Willis] Your father's funeral.

769
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:25,583
With his parents' permission, I assume.

770
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,290
No, they didn't know.

771
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:35,165
[scoffs] So, unbeknownst to his parents,
you made a boy of what-- 11--

772
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:38,540
betray his parents by keeping that secret.

773
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,165
You gave him a lie to hold. And he did.

774
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:45,374
He kept that fact and face
from his mom and dad for years.

775
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:46,665
He's capable of that.

776
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,957
Lying. Hiding.

777
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,415
You taught him that.

778
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:53,540
This kid had no shot.
You made sure of that, didn't you?

779
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:56,457
W-- I, yeah, I mean,
I'm a fucking alcoholic.

780
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,499
That was real drunk behavior, wasn't it?

781
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,165
Please refrain from using
foul language in my courtroom.

782
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:04,040
Okay. It's just not a revelation.
I was a shit mom.

783
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:05,415
So, uh, what else you got?

784
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:07,707
Ethan ever mention any other issues?

785
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:10,290
The Poppit message boards?
Bringing firearms to school?

786
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,290
- Things of that nature?
- No.

787
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:13,500
So you don't really know your son.

788
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:21,625
No further questions.

789
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:29,708
[sighs] Cunt.

790
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:34,665
[Sanders] <i>Would you outline
for the court your understanding</i>

791
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:37,040
of where you and each member
of your family were

792
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:38,957
the night in question?

793
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,707
[Chloe] Yeah, sure. Um...

794
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,665
my son Ethan was with his friend, Kevin.

795
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:45,957
My, um, husband Adam was

796
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:49,540
at a work meeting near JFK,

797
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:51,874
with some clients of his,
the Gentry Group.

798
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:54,374
And I was at my mentor

799
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,665
Catherine Lancaster's home
for a small gathering.

800
00:42:56,666 --> 00:43:00,207
Celebrating the success
of the Women Are Essential movement,

801
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:03,415
some members of which are here
in the courtroom with us now.

802
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:04,499
[Chloe] Yes.

803
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,957
[chuckles softly] Um, the original plan
was for Adam to, um, meet me

804
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:13,249
at Catherine's, but his meeting went late,
so he just went straight to our home.

805
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,249
- While you were still at the party.
- Yes.

806
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,957
Did you convey to your son

807
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:20,249
that Adam's meeting went late?

808
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,040
- No.
- Did anyone else

809
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,874
know that Adam wasn't with you?

810
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:26,249
Um, Bill Braddock, Adam's boss

811
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,874
was there at the gathering, so he knew.

812
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:30,415
And Adam's colleague, Jake Rodriguez,

813
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:32,874
who was usually included
in Gentry Group meetings,

814
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,582
um, would've also known.

815
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:38,791
And how would you describe your marriage?

816
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:47,666
S--

817
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:52,249
More recently...

818
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,541
strained.

819
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:55,833
[Sanders] How so?

820
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:02,874
A few years ago, I encouraged Adam to move
from prosecution to a private practice.

821
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:05,957
I thought more rewards,

822
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:07,750
less frustration.

823
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:11,041
But Adam didn't like it.

824
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:14,124
He wanted out of that practice,

825
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,415
but he felt trapped.

826
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:19,500
And because I had encouraged
the switch, he blamed me for it.

827
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:26,041
[sighs] Adam hated the life that we built.

828
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:30,040
It was...

829
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:32,666
It was like I'd...

830
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:39,499
...I'd failed him in some way

831
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,500
and he resented me for it.

832
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,416
And he started taking it out on me.

833
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,499
Uh, he started hurting me.

834
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,874
Objection. Your Honor, we received

835
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:56,332
no witness statement
to this effect during discovery.

836
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,583
Overruled. Counselor, really?

837
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,000
[Sanders] Hurting you how?

838
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:08,166
Once he was at the firm,
we were just arguing a lot...

839
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,624
...and then it just took a turn.

840
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:15,582
I mean, he'd always had a temper,

841
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:18,540
but one day he pushed me.

842
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,790
Hard.

843
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:22,415
And I fell and slammed my head.

844
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:24,749
And I thought it was just
an isolated incident,

845
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,332
and hoped we'd get through it.

846
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:30,250
But we didn't.

847
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:33,040
And it got worse.

848
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:34,750
And it kept going.

849
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,583
And I...

850
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:43,083
I hid it from everyone.

851
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:47,166
I think I even hid it from myself.

852
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,750
'Cause it was just so humiliating.

853
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:57,083
And I felt like I was such a hypocrite.

854
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:02,749
Was your husband ever violent
toward you in front of Ethan?

855
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:03,999
No.

856
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,957
[Sanders] Did you ever tell Ethan
that his father was abusing you?

857
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:08,041
[Chloe sniffles]

858
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:10,582
Never.

859
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:15,541
Is there anybody who did know
Adam was abusing you?

860
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:21,625
Adam's colleague Jake Rodriguez.

861
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:25,082
[Sanders] What makes you think
that he knew?

862
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:27,416
[Chloe] We would run
on the beach together.

863
00:46:28,416 --> 00:46:30,415
We...

864
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:33,207
got close,

865
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:36,915
and he would ask me
about bruises on my body.

866
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:39,291
And what do you mean when you say "close"?

867
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,165
We became more than friends.

868
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,790
[gallery murmuring]

869
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:46,165
It started about a year ago,

870
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:50,625
when Adam became violent towards me.

871
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:56,999
Did you tell Mr. Rodriguez
where the bruises came from?

872
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,665
No. No, I lied about that for a while.

873
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:02,749
I told him it was from...

874
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,165
boxing class, that I bruised easily.

875
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,458
[scoffs]

876
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:09,957
I eventually told him.

877
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:13,624
[Sanders] Was Mr. Rodriguez upset
when you told him?

878
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,665
- Very.
- Did Mr. Rodriguez ever express

879
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:20,375
his wish for you to be with him
instead of with Mr. Macintosh?

880
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:22,665
Yes.

881
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:25,875
And when were you last with Mr. Rodriguez?

882
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:28,915
We were together yesterday.

883
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:31,832
[galley gasping]

884
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,374
[Sanders] You slept together, you mean?
You had sex?

885
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,791
Yes.

886
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:39,249
