00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,832
Made their way to the bedroom

533
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:57,332
to look for valuables,
Adam heard the noise,

534
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,374
comes in to check it out.

535
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,665
After the confrontation,

536
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:04,458
the perpetrator panicked and fled.

537
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:08,916
That make sense to you, Ethan?

538
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:14,165
I'm sorry,
are you asking him to put himself

539
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:16,249
in the mind of his father's killer?

540
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,333
I'm just letting you in
on our thought process.

541
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,582
Maybe we could look at some
of the other bedrooms.

542
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,457
We've seen the master.

543
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:25,540
See if any items are missing.

544
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,582
[chuckles softly]

545
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:28,874
Sure.

546
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,790
[Bowen] Uh, I actually had
some questions for you

547
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:33,375
regarding the package, Ms. Taylor.

548
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,666
What pack-- What package?

549
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,332
Uh...

550
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,750
I can show you my room.

551
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,041
Great.

552
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,707
Yeah. The DVD.

553
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:49,499
Oh.

554
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,290
Yeah, it's in the car.

555
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:54,874
- Okay.
- Okay.

556
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:58,250
[indistinct chatter]

557
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,166
All right. Oh. A little, um...

558
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah, that's unfortunate.

559
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,833
[weak chuckle] Not my best angle.

560
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,040
Yeah, uh, I'll get this. Thank you.

561
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,540
[clears throat] Michael.

562
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:28,916
- Bag this and get it fingerprinted.
- Yeah.

563
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:34,583
[grunts]

564
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,666
You got it? Ms. Taylor.

565
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,083
We can head back inside.

566
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,415
It's a nice room.

567
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:55,957
It's clean.

568
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:57,874
So, you and Kevin good friends?

569
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,457
He lives out here.

570
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,749
We hang out in the summers,
whenever I come out.

571
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,082
What'd you all do last night?
Anything special?

572
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,915
Just Friday night stuff.

573
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,458
Drove around, sat on the beach, came back.

574
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,915
You read all those books?

575
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:16,457
Half maybe. During the summers.

576
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:17,958
That's pretty good.

577
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,874
Well, how does it look in here?
Anything missing or...?

578
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,958
[sighs]

579
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,583
Couple of things in here.

580
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,458
And what are they?

581
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:48,875
Ms. Taylor, can I speak with you
a moment, in the kitchen?

582
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,125
- Sure.
- Thank you.

583
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,500
You should know
we contacted Nicole Macintosh.

584
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,499
Nicky? Why?

585
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,041
Ethan's a minor.
It's protocol to alert the legal guardian.

586
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:14,415
Well... Yes, but clearly in this case,
that's just a technicality.

587
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:16,207
Hmm.

588
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:19,082
You know that Nicky's an addict,
and she hasn't seen him in many years.

589
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,499
I understand,
but she's still his legal guardian.

590
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,874
Well, because if we had
tried to change that,

591
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,374
then she would've tried to hurt herself.

592
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,082
Hmm.

593
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,874
[scoffs]

594
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,374
I'm sorry, it's just...

595
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:34,540
this may seem like it's
an odd arrangement to you,

596
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:36,249
but there are reasons for it.

597
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,249
At one point, we even had
a restraining order against her.

598
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,540
Yeah, we saw that.

599
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,457
But it's expired.

600
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:44,250
And it applied to your husband, not Ethan.

601
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:50,207
Look, Ethan needs to be
with his legal guardian

602
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,291
who, in this case,
is his biological mother.

603
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:55,958
She said she'll be here
as soon as she can.

604
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,708
Oh, Nicky's coming to New York?

605
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:07,457
Gucci sneakers and a set of Beats
headphones missing from the closet.

606
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,958
Gucci? Nice kicks.

607
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,332
All right, if there isn't anything else,

608
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,415
I really would like to get us home,
back to the city.

609
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:16,833
Of course.

610
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,166
We'll keep in touch, Ms. Taylor.

611
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,082
I left my backpack at Kevin's,
if we can stop on the way home.

612
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,166
Of course we can.

613
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
That lady cop is staring at me.

614
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,166
Oh, I-I told her about the ex.

615
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:42,832
You didn't think I'd want to be there?

616
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:45,541
No, I had a moment with her,
so I took the opportunity.

617
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:50,541
Too quick to get where you're going.
Fast isn't always right.

618
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:54,083
Kid's got a cut on his right arm.

619
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,790
Oh, wait, you-you didn't
tell me about that.

620
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:01,458
- I'm telling you now.
- Oh, well, I told you, too.

621
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:16,500
Nicky might be on her way here.

622
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:21,582
Here, as in New York?

623
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:24,040
Is she coming to our house?

624
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:26,375
I don't know. She hasn't reached out yet.

625
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,499
She does know about your f...

626
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,791
father.

627
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,874
But when-when, when she gets in,

628
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:49,916
I'll give you guys some time,
you know, alone.

629
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:55,666
I'm not gonna go with her, right?
Like to live?

630
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,958
No, I would never let that happen.

631
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,707
[stammers] I mean, unless that's what--

632
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:07,750
No. No, of course not.

633
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,708
When was the last time
she was in New York?

634
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:20,165
[laughter]

635
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,457
Adam.

636
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:23,707
Oh. Above and beyond.

637
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:26,125
Where'd you find
a chain metal vest in kid's size?

638
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,332
Uncle of this guy I work with
at the D.A.'s office

639
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:30,915
is big into metallurgy.

640
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:32,957
He really is so adorable in armor.

641
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,915
Don't know how you do it all alone.

642
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:36,875
We struggle with two on one.

643
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,000
[Nicky] Ethan!

644
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:43,915
Oh, my God, it's Nicky. Nicky's here.

645
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,040
[Nicky] Hey, buddy.

646
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,582
Hi. Do you remember me?

647
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:47,999
I'll handle it.

648
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,874
Who's that?

649
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,790
It's Ethan's mother.

650
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:53,832
Do you want to have a bear
for your birthday?

651
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:55,375
Hey, look, I got...

652
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:58,457
- ...this for you.
- What're you doing here?

653
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:01,790
[exclaims] Mother can't come
to her own son's birthday party?

654
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,458
I mean, his aunt's here.

655
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:05,457
Hey, Nick.

656
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:06,625
Chloe.

657
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,040
What are you dressed as?

658
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,832
M-Medieval something?

659
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:13,582
Um, sorry. Ronnie.

660
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,874
This is my sister, my ex-husband

661
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:18,540
and this cute little knight is my son.

662
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:20,165
I forgot to mention I wasn't invited.

663
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:21,249
- Um...
- Cute kid.

664
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,665
[Nicky] But we were in town.

665
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:23,999
Last-minute trip, so...

666
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,582
- Hey, you sure you don't want this?
- No!

667
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:27,915
Are you sure? Oh, come on, buddy.

668
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:29,749
- It's okay.
- Can I hold him, please?

669
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,415
Let me hold him, please.

670
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:32,374
Chloe, let me hold him.

671
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,083
Come on, can I hold you, buddy?

672
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:41,665
[pants] Holy...

673
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,957
You two are...?

674
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,915
Oh, my God. You two are fucking.

675
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:48,624
You two are fucking!

676
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:50,582
- You need to leave.
- Adam, it's okay. Take it easy.

677
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:52,415
- Take it easy.
- Yeah, they're fucking!
- [Adam] You're drunk.

678
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:53,707
You're scaring him.

679
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:56,749
You are scary. You are scary!

680
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,207
The both of you.

681
00:41:58,208 --> 00:41:59,665
What the fuck, Chloe?

682
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:00,958
[laughs]

683
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:04,165
You... Ow! Fuck.

684
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:05,166
- Shit.
- Oh, fuck. Here, hold that.

685
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,999
[wincing]

686
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,250
[groans]

687
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:13,499
You know what? Let's just go, okay?

688
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,207
Okay. [sniffles]

689
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,957
Ethan.

690
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:18,666
Bye, baby.

691
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,415
- Just take him for a second.
- Yeah, I got him.

692
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,874
- It's okay, sweetheart.
They're just talking.
- Hey, Nicky,

693
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,707
let me get you a Band-Aid for your cut.

694
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:28,832
- Nick, wait, wait.
- Chloe, just-- Fuck.

695
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,332
Is that a fucking joke?

696
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:31,416
I'll wait by the car.

697
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,916
You are so fucking twisted.

698
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,249
Ethan is mine.

699
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:42,165
No matter how hard you try
or how hard you fuck him.

700
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:44,707
Do you understand? Mine.

701
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:45,957
He's mine.

702
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:47,707
I was gonna tell you.

703
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,791
Get your own fucking family.

704
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:54,291
Fuck. You look
so fucking stupid in that outfit.

705
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,416
Good luck with that.

706
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:02,125
[ominous music playing]

707
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,749
It's time for cake.
