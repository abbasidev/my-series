(HUM OF COMPRESSOR)

3
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,817
You were right.
Forensics has signed off on him.

4
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,860
The body can be released.

5
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:55,114
Phil, why don't you wait
until they fix him up over there?

6
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,784
I promised our mother
I'd see him like we knew him, Jimmy.

7
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,203
Before they put on
all that pancake and shit.

8
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,307
Oh, for Madonna santa.

9
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,270
Your funeral director's car is here.
I'll go down and meet them.

10
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,571
John, how long I gotta wait?

11
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,365
Tony Soprano left to his own device...

12
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,993
...is never gonna give up
that fucking animal Blundetto.

13
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,371
- Philly.
- An eye for an eye?

14
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,595
This is kind of fun.

15
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:04,516
But if I was you, I'd dump this job.

16
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,019
I'd go to Italy.

17
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,608
This is no way for a caretaker to live.

18
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,820
Well, a few things
have to settle down first.

19
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,198
My cousin will send me funds
to go through Canada.

20
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,117
Italy, wow. Nice cousin.

21
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:38,884
Oh, hey, thanks for that massage.
My toe doesn't hurt hardly at all now.

(DOOR CLOSING)

23
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,140
Watch the windows.

24
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,352
Ho!

25
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,396
Excuse me. How you doing?

26
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,815
- You're Joanne, right?
- Who are you?

27
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,651
Well, we're friends of your son's.

28
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,320
My son doesn't live with me.

29
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,531
We're from Alcoholics Anonymous.

30
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,409
- What's your name?
- Well, we're anonymous.

31
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,287
I see his car's out front.

32
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,539
He went to California or Vegas.
I don't know.

33
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,626
California or Vegas. When did he leave?

34
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,086
Sorry, I have to go to work.

35
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,046
- Where the fuck is he?
- Phil...

36
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,173
Leave me alone.

37
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,841
I had a brother your son's age.

38
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,010
Please, let go of my hand.

39
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,221
Where the fuck is he, you fucking cunt?

40
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,599
I'll take that Discman
and I'll ram it up your box.

41
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,019
Philly, Philly, please. Please.

42
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,648
It's the guy's mother, Phil.
It's the guy's mother.

43
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,949
Oh, man, those jocks are juicers.
They'll do it just for the free brew.

44
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,325
You're still here?

45
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,953
I'm driving to school.
I don't have to leave as early.

46
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,955
He'll bring some cool people.

47
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,541
- Hey, what are you doing up?
- Snow blower.

48
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,919
Seems to me you are not
sleeping that well, period.

49
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,256
- Look at you.
- Told A.J. to fix this leak...

50
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,967
...while I was still living at my mother's.

51
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,763
What's going on with him?

52
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,850
Every time I go by the room,
he's flopped on the bed, on the phone.

53
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,060
I am so sick of nagging him.

54
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,981
If he thinks he's gonna get into East
Stroudsburg State, he's sadly mistaken.

55
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,157
Now, look at this kid out there,
the gardener's son.

56
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,910
- Can't ask this one to take out the trash.
- Poverty is a great motivator.

57
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,669
- You think we gave A.J. too much?
- Then look at Meadow.

58
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,297
Same house, same everything.
She's doing great.

59
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,923
She takes after you, maybe.

60
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,925
Don't do that. He's my son too.

(DOOR OPENING)

62
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:50,307
Well, I got that appointment with
his coach today. Maybe he's got a clue.

63
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,393
- Hello?
- In here, Dad.

64
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,857
Hey, there's my little amaretto cookie.

65
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,526
Clear a place
so we can take a look at these.

66
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,487
They're only preliminary drawings.

67
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,447
I've got scones if anybody wants.

68
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,241
Meadow! Take a look at the house
your mother's gonna build!

69
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,868
Well, and Grandpa, of course.

70
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:15,248
Tony, Ignatz is responsible for those
Normandy chateaus up on Tisch Drive.

71
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,544
Wow, look at that entry.
What is that, like three stories high?

72
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,590

(PHONE RINGING)

74
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,860
- T?
- Christopher, hi. It's Carmela.

75
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,695
- Is Adriana there?
- No.

76
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,282
I was just wondering what was going on.
I stopped by Fortunoff.

77
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,994
She was supposed to get back to them
with a decision about her china pattern.

78
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,665
And she hasn't returned their calls.
Is everything all right?

79
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,752
We broke up.

80
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,547
What? Why? What happened?

81
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,425
Nothing. She left. Broke my heart.

82
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,677
Moved out a couple days ago.
Haven't seen her.

83
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,638
Oh, no. That's terrible.
Are you all right?

84
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,183
She stiffed me on the club, never showed
for work. The place is rudderless.

85
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:19,438
- Oh, my God. Is there anything I can do?
- No.

86
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,732
Well, look, I gotta go.
Somebody's waiting for me.

87
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,234
I am devastated.

88
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,445
I wish I could reach her.
Is there a number?

89
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,948
- Not that I know of.
- Chris, listen.

90
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,575
There's other fish in the sea.

91
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,370
I know. Thanks.

Tony Soprano and Vito Spatafore

Adriana La Cerva.

94
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,862
Way we make it, she's either taken off
or gotten clipped.

95
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,572
- You hear anything?
- Clipped? Why?

96
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,703
- Stepping out on her boyfriend.
- I heard she took off.

97
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,915
- Any idea where?
- How should I know? He's a dope addict.

98
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,125
Did I already give you that?

99
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,422
- If you hear anything, let me know.
- Say hello to Ike and the guys.

(LAUGHING)

101
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,389
T's held up.
He said to start without him.

102
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,892
- Right?
- Yeah.

103
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,978
What can we say about this guy?

104
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,939
The ancient Romans had a word for it.

105
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,484
Asshole.

106
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,696
In all candor, though,
we love you, Raymond.

107
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,074
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

108
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,164
Take that setup away. He ain't coming.

109
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,458
- Who, Chris?
- South with the geese.

110
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,919
Christopher is the logical sacrifice bunt.

111
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,505
- Make up for the dead brother.
- I'm his brother-in-law.

112
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,216
You think New York is really
gonna come after you, Bobby?

113
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,926
What the fuck do I know?

114
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,346
If you're them, he wants somebody
close to Tony as possible.

115
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,098
And who knows him better and longer?

116
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,726
Don't think Johnny's not gonna put
a financial squeeze on us.

117
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,313
Tell me about it. I'm already getting
fucked with by Johnny's people.

118
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,441
- It's not good.
- All due respect...

119
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,028
...I'm willing to die for a good cause.
This is bullshit.

120
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,447
- There he is!
- Hey, hey.

121
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,992
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down, sit down.

122
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,246
What's going on?

123
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,040
Vito misto, how are you?

124
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,961
- Happy birthday, Ray.
- Thanks for coming, Ton.

125
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,256
I brought these plus...
That's a good one.

126
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,966
"Acuto di Soprano."

127
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,760
I serve it at my house. It's from Avellino.

128
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,972
My grandfather said that some
of my ancestors were winemakers...

129
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,891
...but what the fuck do I know, huh?
Thanks, Ton.

130
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:06,021
- That's gonna be a treasure.
- Yeah, well, whatever.

131
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,400
Larry! What the fuck are you doing here?

132
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,861
- I thought you were under house arrest?
- Fuck them.

133
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,530
I ever see that prison doctor,
God forbid, I'm gonna say:

134
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,326
"Fuckstick, they ever show you these
in medical school? They're called balls."

135
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,870
Good for you!

136
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,999
Listen, I can't stay.

137
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,835
I got a meeting I gotta go to.

138
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,004
Got something I wanna say.

139
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,885
My cousin Anthony
went into business for himself...

140
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,553
We all know this.

141
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,222
In a way, for which there is no excuse.

142
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,768
He's got a problem with rage.

143
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,564
He disappointed me, Anthony, in
ways that I can't even begin to tell you.

144
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,318
And he put us all at risk.

145
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,196
Irregardless...

146
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:00,450
...it's been made clear to me
that if they put their hands on him...

147
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,577
...he will not be dealt with quick.

148
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,330
I'm talking torture.

149
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,960
For that reason, even if I knew
where my cousin was... And I do not.

150
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,296
I would not deliver him up to them.

151
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,009
I am offering him the same protection
that I would offer any of you...

152
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,137
...in similar circumstances.

153
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,224
I know what you're gonna say:
"I would never do what he did."

154
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,142
God bless, I hope not.

155
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,645
But we are a family.

156
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,606
And even in this fucked-up day and age,
that means something.

157
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,610
So we are gonna deal with this
as a family, together...

158
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,072
...no matter how it affects anybody
personal safety-wise...

159
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,574
...financially-wise, whatever.

160
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,126
I see that my nephew isn't here
and it's important he lam it now.

161
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,255
It's my desire that you circle
the wagons, you support him.

162
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,468
Until and as such.

163
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,356
Raymond, sorry I can't stay.

164
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,110
- Happy birthday, huh?
- Thanks.

165
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,905
- Gentlemen, enjoy your dinner.
- See you, T.

167
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,706
Thank you. That was great.

(DOOR CLOSING)

169
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,044

00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,821
- Tell Phil.
- Tell Phil what?

338
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,412
Where you going?

339
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,873
You wanted to confer with me?

340
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,002
It's not important.

Poor fucking Feech La Manna.
Tony sent the wrong ex-con back to jail.

343
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,573
You realize I had a container of imported
provolone coming into that port Saturday?

344
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,992
That fucking Phil
and them put it on a truck...

345
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,579
...took it to Westchester instead of
Rahway where we always split the loads.

346
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,749
Jesus. That shit is liquid gold.

347
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,459
Tony knows what has to be done.

348
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,295
Tell John where to find Tony Blundetto.
He just won't do it.

349
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,297
As if he even knows where Tony B. is.

350
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,175
Give me a fucking break.
Of course he knows.

351
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,387
- It's Christopher I feel for.
- Please. Let me tell you something.

352
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,808
Anthony Soprano is very adroit at keeping
his family out of the fucking frying pan.

353
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,935
Both cousins. The rest of us:

354
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,647

356
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,450
I had a dream a couple weeks ago.

357
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,162
Before I moved back, recurring dream.

358
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,542
- See my old coach from high school.
- What happens?

359
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:36,093
Well, see he told me back then,
this guy, he said...

360
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,181
- Said that I was special.
- You never told me this.

361
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,558
Why now?

362
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,893
Does everything I drag here
gotta be a dead dog?

363
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,191
I went to see my son's football coach.

364
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,486
See, he was starting my boy...

365
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,907
...now coach is going to this other kid.
What's the reason?

366
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,745
Well, A.J.'s just devoting more energy
to academics.

367
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,872
He wants to get
into a good school.

368
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,797
How's things on other fronts?
Your cousin?

369
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:21,263
Well, you touched on something there
that's not so good.

370
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,391
- What's the problem?
- I really can't talk to you about it.

371
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,728
This is very difficult for me
treating you...

372
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,939
...when so much of your life
is closed off.

373
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,691
How many times can I say this?

374
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,402
Look, I'm not trying to be difficult here.

375
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,697
It affects me tremendously,
this trouble he's gotten himself into.

376
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,824
So I'm upset.

377
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,493
Well...

378
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,245
And I care about him so much.

379
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,414
You care about him so much?

380
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,501
We spent hours
getting to the realization...

381
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,880
...that your feelings for your cousin
stem from guilt and shame.

382
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,423
Do you remember that?

383
00:27:56,591 --> 00:28:00,010
- Do you care?
- It's just that it doesn't matter now...

384
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,473
It's just that here we are as always,
back at square one.

385
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,018
With you going into
high sentimentality mode.

386
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,938
Sentimentality mode?
We were children together!

387
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,650
Look, it's a lot like with your son.

388
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,444
Here's what I bet the coach
didn't tell you.

389
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,947
What you wanted to hear most...

390
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:24,243
...is that your son is special too.

391
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,748
What I'm saying is,
whatever you wanna do...

392

...vis-à-vis your cousin,
your son, whoever, own your feelings.

393
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,509
I'm very confused.

394

some people have bogus cups.

to hang a picture of you on my wall.

Well, whatever his legitimate sorrow,
he's got a price.

- And?
- And what?
