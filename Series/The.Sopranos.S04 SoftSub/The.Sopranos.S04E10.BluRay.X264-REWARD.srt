I know it's ridiculous, but I feel like the
Reverend Rodney King Jr., you know?

"Why can't we all just get along?"

176
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,989
- What's ridiculous about it?
- Come on. Don't jerk me off.

177
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,117
This is me you're talking to.

178
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:33,246
You've caused much suffering yourself,
haven't you?

181
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,556
How about Carmine Lupertazzi?

182
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,559
Christopher talk about a dinner
with him and Tony last July?

183
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,019
Nope.

184
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,438
What's the matter, Adriana?

185
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,773
You and Christopher arguing?

186

It's a stressful time
right before a wedding.

A lot of guys get cold feet.

- Five hundred.

if she's even heard from Ralph.

a respiratory infection now.

about Justin here.

to take that out?

to America.

So why did you come back?

346
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,591
You said you'd take me to CompUSA,
so I could get a new Magic Stick.

347
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,343
And I will.

348
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,888
Yeah, well, I got stuff to do.
I told you.

349
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,309
Well, I better get going.

350
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,604
Thank you very much for the vinegar.

- Yeah?

I gotta talk to him.

This one in rehab now.

409
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,769
I was so upset when he didn't bring me
a present back from Italy.

410
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,854
He got something for A.J.
and for Meadow.

411
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,858
He gave me some vinegar,
but I don't think it was meant for me.

412
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,235
It must've meant something
that he felt bad.

Carmela, you sound
like you're 15 years old.

I bring A.J. with me.
Now even he smells a rat.

you know what'll happen to Furio.

in a different century.

Steve at the gym?

420
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:03,258
I felt so guilty all the time,
the lies and the sneaking.

421
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:07,638
It took Jackie going in the hospital
to get me to stop.

422
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,431
We haven't slept together yet.

423
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,308
You're not fucking him?

424
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,436
So this isn't really real.

425
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,897
It is real.

426
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,816

He looks at me like I'm beautiful.

428
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,363
He thinks I'm interesting when I talk.

429
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:29,743
Just those few minutes when we
see each other, I live for those.

430
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,540
I feel like my life is slipping through
my fingers, that I will never be happy.

431
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,292
If you haven't slept with him yet, don't.

432
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,879
And don't go over there anymore.

433
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,936
We're all here?

434
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,355
Good afternoon.

435
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,233
For those of you who don't know me,
my name is Dominic...

436
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,486
...and I'm an alcoholic and an addict.
Don't forget "scumbag."

437
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,031
As some of you obviously don't know...

438
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,368
...I've also been in recovery now
going on four years.

439
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,122
I joined AA in prison,
and frankly, it saved my life.

440
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,835
Okay, now, we're all here today
because we have one thing in common.

441
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,255
Not only do we share a certain
background and culture...

442
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,967
...we also care about Chris and wanna
help him with his heroin addiction.

443
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,763
Now, any one of you guys been involved
in an intervention before?

444
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,149
We caught our daughter
smoking pot once but...

445
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,318
- Not really. No.
- No problem.

446
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,613
An intervention is
a nonjudgmental confrontation.

447
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,408
A "care-frontation," we call it.

448
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,661
What I need from you guys
is to make a list of specific times...

449
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:59,291
...where Christopher's drug use
impacted on you directly.

450
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,753
For example... Adriana, is it?

451
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,963
You might say something like this:

452
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:09,468
"Christopher, last Monday you came
home from work high and belligerent...

453
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,763
...and you were
physically abusive to me."

454
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,057
What if he's high when we try
to talk to him?

455
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,852
Then we wait till he's sober. At
my first intervention, Steven Patrano...

456
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,772
...waited 10 hours for me to sober up.
Your first?

457
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,149
In 1997, I suffered a relapse.

458
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,528
As in heroin addiction, alcoholics
suffer a fairly high recidivism rate.

459
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,407
Great. So he's taking advice
from a two-time loser.

460
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,827
There are no losers in recovery.

461
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,373
Actually, I never really met Ralph's kid.

462
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,084
I saw him once from a distance, though.

463
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,795
Handsome boy.

464
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,632
He's got a long struggle ahead of him,
that's for sure.

465
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:53,261
Doctors, rehab, physical therapy.

00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,142

- Excuse me?

you, Ralph, Zellman.

471
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,378

No, Carmine doesn't know
anything about this yet, Tony.

to cut a deal and make it right.

you in out of friendship, but it's over.

in the courthouse.

Something classy, you know,

That kind of thing.

484
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,643
He's rather portly to be Napoleon.

to Ralph, and if I'm right...

a piece of it.

- Wasn't what he said so much...

We're talking about New York.

Sorry, baby, please.

No, fuck this shit.

515
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,037
You were told once. Now, sit down.

516

Sit down.

517

518
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,563
Christopher, this won't be easy
for any of us.

519
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:36,067
But I want you to know that we're here
today because we care about you.

520
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,486
What was this, your idea?

521
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,573
All we ask is that you listen.

522

525

My only dream is that we have
a happy life together.

526
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,468
The last few months,
things have got very bad with us...

527
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,179
...because of you using drugs
all the time.

528
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,598
You're high all the time,
and I can't take it.

529
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,142
Be specific, hon.

530
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,564
When we first started going out,
we made love all the time.

531
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,735
- Now, because of the drugs...
- Jesus, is this fucking necessary?

532
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,695
Go ahead, Adriana.

533
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,823
You can no longer function as a man.

534
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,328
Last week when I came home to learn
you'd killed our dog...

535
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,455
...that was the final straw.

536
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,706
Wow.

537
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,710
You killed the dog?
What'd you do that for?

538
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,879
- It was an accident.
- What, was it barking?

539
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,465
He sat on her while he was high.

541

- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- I fell asleep.

542
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,845
She got suffocated or something.

543
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,934
Are you done, Adriana?

544
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,148
- Silvio.
- You killed little Cosette?

545
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,859
I ought to suffocate you,
you little prick!

546
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,737
Tony, we're going in order. Silvio.

547
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,031
When I came in to open up
one morning...

548
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,701
...there you were with your head
half in the toilet.

549
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,787
Your hair was in the toilet water.
Disgusting.

550
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,581
- I told you I had the flu.
- I said my piece, Chrissy.

551
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,583
Great. I can't even defend myself?

552
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,335
No one's attacking you, Chris.

553
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,504
Look, it doesn't change anything.

554
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,757
But I can verify that he was sick
for a little while.

555
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,927
This thing with the dog,
how can you not see it on the chair?

556
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,389
- You're getting emotional.
- I know what it's like to lose a pet!

557
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,522
I happen to know that you were high
at my mother-in-law's wake.

558
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:42,152
You were talking nonstop
for 20 minutes, nothing but gibberish.

559
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,404

Paul? You wanna read
your statement?

562
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,876
I don't write nothing down,
so I'll keep this short and sweet.

563
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,211
You're weak. You're out of control.

564
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,048
You're an embarrassment to yourself
and everybody else.

565
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,800
- Oh, listen to you.
- Guys, guys, whoa, whoa.

We said, nonjudgmental.

567

Fuck that. Let him take his medicine.

568
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,558
Seriously, Paulie, you wanna talk
about fucking up?

569
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,310
- Watch it, Chrissy.
- What?

570
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,437
I thought we're being honest here.

571
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,398

in the woods with the Russian guy?

577

- Christopher, I am fucking warning you!
- There he goes, Mr. Type A Personality.

578

We're talking about you killing yourself
with drugs, not my fucking personality!

- That's right.
- I'm gonna kill myself?

a drug problem?

if you'll flip over a nickel bag of powder.

- You lied to me.

of this family.
