Last week we talked about you
feeling like the sad clown.

What's going on now?

10
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,613
Well, I had a dream the other night.

11
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,329
I was riding in a Cadillac
like my father used to have.

12
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,206
Carmela was driving.

13
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,209
I was in the back passenger seat.

14
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,003
Sitting next to me was Gloria.

15
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:37,382
In front of me, sitting next to Carmela
was a business associate of mine.

16
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,093
He's the one whose son
had the accident.

17
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,264
I don't know where we were going.
No place.

18
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,227
At least, we never seemed
to get anywhere.

19
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,023
Kind of like this therapy.

20
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,026
And it was hot in the car,
it was stuffy.

21
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,737
There was no air conditioning.

22
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,201
That's all of it.

23
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,082
Oh, and...

24
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,210
...my friend had a caterpillar
on his head.

25
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,130
It turned into a butterfly.

26
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,217
Has your friend recently changed?

27
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,553
Not friend. Associate.

28
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,182
- And, no.
- What do you think the dream means?

29
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,228
Can't you just tell me what the fucking
thing means? You obviously know.

30
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,731
Why do we have to go through
this exercise every time?

31
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,694
I don't obviously know.
I didn't have the dream.

32
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,613
The meaning is elicited
through verbalization.

33
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:46,451
And the "gehoxagogen" is framed up
by the "ramistam."

34
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,208
Okay.

35
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:58,630
Your wife, your mistress,
a business associate, you...

36
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,966
...all in the same car.

37
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,343
- Your father's car.
- With my wife driving.

38
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,137
Which, if my father were alive...

39
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,806
...he wouldn't have stood for
for two seconds.

40
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,184
- I hear anger.
- No, I'm just saying...

41
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,603
...the old guys were different.

42
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,647
Men in the front, wives in the back.

43
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,190
You like that arrangement.

44
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:21,153
Actually, I think the wives should
ride in a little cart, behind the car.

45
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,196
Like in the cartoons.

46
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,158
Like behind Noah's Ark,
there's a boat with the skunks.

47
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,743
So wives are skunks.

48
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,454
Oh, Jesus-fucking-Christ.
It's a fucking joke.

49
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,998
Does it have to be like
a cancer hospital in here?

50
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,292
But Carmela is in control
in the dream.

51
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,129
- Why, because she's driving?
- Whatever's gone on with the other two...

52
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,839
...you wanna square it with her.

53
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,633
- Why?
- That's what we need to find out.

54
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,345
Freud says dreams are wishes.

55
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,556
Dreams are wishes?

56
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:54,019
I thought you said that dreams represent
repressed urges and...

57
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,064
- It depends.
- I ought to quit this fucking therapy.

58
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,692
Maybe it's this, maybe it's that.
Maybe it's va fangool!

59
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,819
What about impulse control?

60
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,281
I've been sitting here for 4 years
and nothing's been done about that!

61
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,492
And it leads me to make mistakes
at work!

62
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,369
What good did you do me
with that?!

63
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,167
- Let's get back to the dream.
- Fuck the dream. It's just a dream.

64
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,796
The money I been dropping here,
I could've bought a Ferrari.

65
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,881
At least I would've got a blow job.

66
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,927
- What do you mean?
- Please, huh? Don't get me started.

accomplishments we've made in here.

Oh, Carmela's driving the car,
how fucking interesting."

71
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,573
When you first came here,
you were clinically depressed.

72
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:53,620
You suffered from panic attacks
that put your life in danger.

73
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,915
There's been significant relief
in both those areas.

74
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,251
You're right, but...

75
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,964
I mean, come on.
I've been coming here four years now.

76
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,466

We want a 40-percent position
in your HUD business.

83
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,649
Because I bet on the other thing,
you reach into my pocket on this?

84
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,443
That was a gesture of goodwill.

85
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,446
Tony, we've been down
this road before.

86
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,697
We share Zellman.

87
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,494

we're entitled to.

Cake?

107

Your daughter said she saw it
in your car.

She told me about it
when I picked her up from practice.

I buried it.

I wish you would've told me before
I picked up the steaks from Outback.

114

The sides alone were over $30.

115

- Every day.

That's what I miss the most,
talking to her.

Believe me, Bobby, I know.
I lost both my parents.

118

It's very easy for people
to give facile advice.

...maybe it was for the nuns.

Sometimes when I'm walking down
the hallway I can smell her hair.

148
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:13,440
Well, maybe if we did something bad,
she'd haunt us for our own good.

There's nothing to be scared of.

happens now or in the future...

...Carmine won't forget you.

And as far as us talking like this...

158
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,108
It's just because we're old friends.

159
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,278
And I know I can blow off
a little steam with you.

I'm only trying to bring good relations
between the families.

Reason I'm asking is because
we didn't get the bill.

- Here he is.
- I've fucking had it.

- Everything.

00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,295
- Did you offer my nephew something?
- I'm a registered nurse.

175
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,505
Not maid.

176
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,258
Did you offer him an aspirin?

177
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,805
Cunt.

178
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,810
What's with you?

179
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,564
This fucking competency hearing.

180
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,358
Delayed twice
and now it's coming up on Friday.

181
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,194
I don't know whether
to chill champagne or shit in my pants.

182
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,404
No, it's gonna be...

183
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,032
You got shaving cream all over you.

184
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,785
Don't you wash yourself off?

185
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,372
It's over here too.

186
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,332
It's that fucking lighting upstairs.

187
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,335
If Bobby put in the right wattage...

188
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,175
Listen. We find out where
the jurors meet every day...

189
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,720
...before they get bused
to the courthouse.

190
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,930
This mental competency
thing don't work...

191
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,391
I don't wanna talk about it.

192
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,398
So, what is the story there
with you two?

193
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,819
He's a great guy.
He's just still very much in mourning.

194
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,779
We're stuck at platonic.

195
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,574
Well, Karen was a wonderful person.

196
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,912
I'm sure God must have his reasons,
but sometimes you have to wonder.

197
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,374
Well, I'm sure she was as good as gold,
but he's developing a psychosis.

198
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,627
Her clothes are still in the closet.

199
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:25,089
Yesterday he bought her a cake for their
anniversary and he buried it at her grave.

200
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,091
What? At her grave?

201
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,218
God forbid
that I should say something.

202
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,262
Then I would be perceived
as a harpy...

203
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,265
...coming between him
and his dead, idealized wife.

204
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,395
Listen, you, don't make
any plans for Sunday.

205
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,856
Baccalieris are coming,
make them feel welcome.

206
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,361
- Bobby Jr? That kid's, like, 11.
- I don't ask you to do chore one.

207
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,614
You can go without seeing Devin
and your friends for one night.

208
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,868
Yeah, we were supposed to study.
But I guess you don't care about that.

209
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,586
Vic?

210
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,880
Yo, Vic.

211
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,385
- You don't return Johnny's phone calls?
- What did you say?

212
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,805
I'm only the appraiser!

213
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,487
Let me appraise you of this.
Be at the Red Chimney on Route 3...

214
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,491
...9:00 tomorrow morning ready
to go to work for Johnny and Carmine.

215
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,125
Victor's scared now.

216
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,169
- Nobody knows where he is.
- Look, it's a bluff.

217
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,505
They don't wanna start
a separate operation.

218
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:52,176
You know the costs that are involved?
You got the appraiser, the poverty pimp.

219
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,345
They want in on a going thing.

220
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,639
Want me to pay a visit
to Johnny Sack's guys?

221
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,933
Just say the word.

222
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,686
No. You know what?

223
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,856
- I'm not gonna go fucking ballistic.
- All due respect, T...

224
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,694
...throwing your appraiser a beating
was a provocation to you directly.

225
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,696
(HONKING)

226
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,489
There he is.

227
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,452
Stop beeping that fucking horn
or I'm gonna shove it up his fucking ass!

228
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,662
T, Sil.

229
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,873
- All right, Sil.
- Enjoy the game.

230
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,168
- I'll see you, Ton.
- All right, Vit.

231
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,923
You ever talk to Beansie
down there in Florida?

232
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,508
Now and then.

233
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,595
Does he ever run into Carmine's son
down there in Miami?

234
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,556
I'll be on my cell, you need me.

235
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,774
Beans tells me he sees Little Carmine
all the time.

236
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,568
Well, maybe Beans can feel him out.

237
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,863
See if he's receptive to a meeting
with me.

238
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,742
Maybe we can work this shit out,
he talks to his old man.

239
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,703
Beansie's gotta happen
to run into him.

240
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,373
Not like we're asking.

241
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,089
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

242
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,758
- Look at that.
- Just stuffed artichokes.

243
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,554
- No cactus for me.
- Cactus.

244
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,599
You're not Italian
if you don't like artichokes.

245
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,977
So, what, Mike Piazza
eats nothing but artichokes?

246
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,105
I mean, that's dicked up.

247
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,774
All right.

248
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,819
I like rice. Maybe I'm Chinese.

249
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,118
- A.J.
- You too, Bobby.

250
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,578
How'd you like if Oriental kids
made fun of you?

251
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,121
(DOORBELL)

252
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:43,830
I'll get it.

253
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,832
- You want an artichoke, Bobby Jr?
- No.

254
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,667
It's dinnertime.

255
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,628
You sure, B.J?
You're really missing out.

256
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,421
I said already.

257
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,138
Hi. Hello. Hi, Mrs. Soprano.

258
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,474
Everybody, this is Devin.

259
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:08,271
- Devin, would you like something to eat?
- No, thank you, I'll just wait inside.

260
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,319
She tell you who I saw
at Schantz's Hardware?

261
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,656
Oh, God. Do you have to tell
every person you run into?

262
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,702
I'll put an end to the mystery right now.
Connie Francis.

263
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,536
(PHONE RINGING)

264
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,662
Excuse me.

265
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,290
She was looking at recessed lighting.

266
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,001
I put in recessed lighting.
But I'm sorry now.

267
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,003
- Hello.
- Tony, it's me.

268
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,505
- Hey, how you doing?
- Fine fettle.

269
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:39,093
Listen, I spoke to our friend.
The son. He seemed very receptive.

270
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,012
Tuesday night.

271
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,681
We'll meet down here in FLA.

272
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,016
We'll pick a place later.

273
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,852
I got my stepdaughter
and her friends this weekend.

274
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,355
- I'm gonna have to bring them along.
- Okay, good. Good.

275
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,399
Thanks.

276
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,109
Somebody will call you.

277
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,739
- Where is Anthony?
- He went upstairs with that girl.

278
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,367
You two, come with me.

279
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,623
Anthony!

280
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,879
- That door is not supposed to be closed.
- We were studying.

281
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,341
- Is this how you treat your guests?
- My guests? You invited them.

282
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,429
These kids just lost their mom.
Could you give them a little time?

283
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,641
- You know how much Bobby likes you.
- What am I, daycare?

284
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,354
You must have a million games in here.
Clue, Monopoly.

285
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,564
Help them pick something out.

286
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,193
Come on in, kids.
A.J.'s gonna help you find a game.

287
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,411
Spirit...

288
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,248
...speak to me.

289
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,376
Is Bobby Jr. gay?

290
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,381
No, do it again for real,
like last time with the dead little baby.

291
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,091
Yeah, quit messing around.

292
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,760
Okay. Serious.

293
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,721
Spirits, identify yourself.

294
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,100
- You're forcing it again.
- Shut up.

295
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,772
- Do you think it's my mom?
- Probably not. It's not people you know.

296
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,899
- Will you do it with me, Devin?
- Okay.

297
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,489
Spirit...

298
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,575
...do you know Karen Baccalieri?
Sophia.

299
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,086
Is she making new friends in heaven?

300
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,963
Maybe we should play something else.

301
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,633
- Yeah, this is stupid. Let's play Clue.
- You're just a scared little baby.

302
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,469
I'm not scared.
I have this game at home.

303
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,097
I used to play it all the time.

304
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,807
Until it got boring.

305
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:54,645
How about we try
and contact the dead for real?

306
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,649
Just heard from our friend. The other
guy will sit down. I'm going on Tuesday.

307
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,360
- Want me there?
- I was thinking of bringing Paulie.

308
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,946
Face time with you could be
what he needs.

309
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,782
- He's on the rag lately.
- Then I decided against it.

310
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,286
The other day,
we were talking about Florida.

311
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,122
I noticed you clammed up
around Paulie.

312
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,041
You did too.

313
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,501
It occurred to me that
maybe Paulie's the one...

314
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,879
...telling our friend
in New York our business.

315
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,006
Somebody had to pass along
that fat joke.

316
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,342
He was in Youngstown at the time.
In the can.

317
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,260
What, people can't visit him?

318
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,680
Jesus, you believe this shit?

319
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,557
Talking about fucking Paulie here.

320
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,686
He's got no reason to know about
the trip. Nobody's got a reason to know.

321
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,690
Absolutely.
It's on a need-to-know basis.

322
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,903
Get this fucking appraiser working again.
I got houses just sitting there.

323
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,906
You gotta hold hands.

324
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,492
And nobody let go.

325
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,872
The most important thing...

326
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,708
...is that you keep your eyes closed
during the ceremony.

327
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,878
Because if you open them,
whatever spirits we're speaking to...

328
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,924
...will permanently remain trapped
between worlds forever.

329
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,304
Everybody's eyes shut?

330
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,311
Oh, great spirit from beyond.

331
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,940
Reveal yourself.

332
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,693
Give us a sign of your presence.

333
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,406
- A.J!
- Keep laughing if you think it's funny.

334
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,324
It was you.

335
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,535
- You hear that?
- What?

336
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,412
- I heard it.
- Me too.

337
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,415
Wait. I see a...

338
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,750
A gray mist...

339
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,253
...with little specks of light.

340
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,755
- That's what I'm seeing too.
- Wait!

341
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,926
I see somebody. An old man.

342
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:53,055
Spirit from another dimension,
can you reveal yourself?

343
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,725
What?

344
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,271
- What's that?
- How come he's only talking to you?

345
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,567
Because I'm the oldest
and closest to the afterlife.

346
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,613
You're a sea captain?

347
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,782
Capt. Jacobus?

348
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,117
What?

349
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,286
He says it's a terrible storm.

350
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,289
It's raining where you are?

351
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,459
Waves are smashing against the boat?

352
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,711
AAH!
AAH!

353
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,463
She's here! She's here!

354
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,464
(SCREAMING)

355
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,132
Oh, Jesus Christ.

356
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,303
What's going on?

357
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,804
Oh, my God. What happened?

358
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,265
Nothing. We were just playing.

359
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,685
We were playing Ouija board,
and then A.J. did this séance.

360
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,980
Dad, I wanna go home.

361
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,650
Soph, it's just a Ouija board.

362
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,696
She's just scared.

363
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,364
It's okay, honey. Daddy's here.

364
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,493
This is your idea of fun?
You scared these kids half to death!

365
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,495
I didn't do anything, he freaked out.

366
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,205
Why's your shirt all wet?

367
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,457
Bobby, look! He had a sponge!

368
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,168
After what we just talked about,
this is what you do.

369
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,504
- You asshole! You asshole!
- Robert!

370
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,549
You, say good night.

371
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,052
You, get out of my sight.

372
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,138
I can't remember a time when
I was more disappointed in you.

373
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,348
Wanna know something?

374
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,684
He locked me in the garage at the guy
with the ponytail's house.

375
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,021
Bobby, I don't even know what to say.
I am so embarrassed.

376
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:28,025
Part of growing up.
Don't worry about it.

377
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,327
I'm only the appraiser!

379
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,543
Do you think you could hide from us?

380
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,546
Tony bought three more houses
that need appraisals, Victor.

381
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,089
I can't. I told you. Please!

382
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,008
Johnny and Carmine's guys,
they hurt me.

383
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,595
That's nothing compared
to what we're gonna do.

384
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:01,600
So go back inside, get your appraising
shit and start appraising!

385
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,233
Did you like the movie?

386
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,571
What's the matter?

387
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,116
You went to the cemetery today,
didn't you?

388
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,201
How do you know?

389
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,579
Because you got cemetery mud
on your shoes.

390
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,582
Mud? What are you,
Marg Helgenberger now?

391
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,501
What do you know about the mud?
You been spying on me?

392
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,379
What, I can't go to the cemetery?

393
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,800
- I gotta get permission from you?
- We're talking about you. Not me.

394
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,596
The grave and the funeral...
It's never-ending.

395
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,014
You don't wanna let it go.

396
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,559
- Did you even pay the funeral bill yet?
- I'm never gonna pay him.

397
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,937
Son of a bitch put an extra 15 pounds
on Karen when they did her up.

398
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:52,109
This dispute with the bill
is morbid clinging.

399
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,611
This is exactly what I mean.

400
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,614
We have a nice evening
and end up talking about your wife.

401
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,033
- You invited me.
- The other night at Tony's...

402
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,328
...your kids were trying
to contact Karen on a Ouija board.

403
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,622
What do you expect
talking to a headstone?

404
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,417
- She's my wife.
- Well, she's dead. And I'm here.

405
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,628
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.

408
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,492
- Yeah.
- Tony, it's Svetlana.

409
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,870
- Well, hey.
- I've just receiving the brooch.

410
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,872
I want to thank you.

411
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,876
- I don't know why I deserve it, but...
- No, I don't wanna hear that.

412
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,128
I want you to keep it.

413
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,048
I'm gonna keep it, don't worry.

414
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,841
Diamonds like this?

415
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,551
OH.

416
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,596
It's a very nice gift. Very sweet.

417
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,308
And what's happened between us...

418
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,851
...it was nice too.

419
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,604
Okay. Well...

420
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,606
...that's it then?

421
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,025
These things happen
and then life goes on.

422
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,319
Are you sure? Because if...

423
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,988
...you ever wanna talk
or if you ever need anything...

424
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,617
No, it's all right.
Thank you for the brooch.

425
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,251
Broke a woman's heart.

426
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,046
Told her I couldn't see her no more.
Sad, but there's no getting around it.

427
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,007
- Who is she?
- She takes care of my uncle.

428
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,052
Runs an eldercare agency.

429
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,721
Took care of my mother too.

430
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,517
- Your former girlfriend's cousin?
- That one, yeah.

431
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,563
- Is she your current goomar?
- No, it was a brief fling kind of thing.

432
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,401
You know, but after a while,
I felt like I had to cut off the leg...

433
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,904
Not leg, affair. Did I say, leg?

434
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,283
- Why did you cut it off?
- Jesus, I am married.

435
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,411
- What happened?
- I bought her the...

436
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:13,083
It's this diamond pin that I send
to every woman when I'm...

437
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,754
...easing out the door.
I'm such a fucking prick.

438
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,090
You know what?

439
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,593
This is all bullshit.

440
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,096
It was she who gave me
my walking papers.

441
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,098
- You believe that?
- What I meant was...

442
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,100
You know why she didn't want
to see me?

443
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,102
She said I was high-maintenance.

444
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,939
This is after all the time and all
the money and all the fucking Prozac...

445
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,610
...and all the fucking cocksucking,
motherfucking dream interpretations.

446
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,695
She says she didn't want
to prop me up.

447
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,908
And this from a broad that walks
around on crutches half the time.

448
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,618
Nice, huh?

449
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,120
Do you agree
with her characterization of you?

450
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,457
I'm a miserable prick.
I've said it since day one.

451
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,126
And you're no longer interested
in changing.

452
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,961
In finding a way out.

453
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,095
No, I guess not.

454
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,978
I said this last time,
you didn't want to hear it.

455
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,606
You're paying me for my honest opinion.

456
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,817
You should be in therapy.

457
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,654
All this fucking self-knowledge,
what the fuck has it gotten me?

458
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:28,492
Okay, maybe it got me some shit in the
beginning. Some leadership strategies.

459
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,203
All we do now is we sit around
shooting the breeze...

460
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,373
...about philosophy, the Italians,
my Uncle Eckley.

461
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,500
I try to keep the focus on the work.

462
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,504
So when it goes off, it's my fault?
Okay, fine. I accept that.

463
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,050
You know what she says?

464
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,386
This broad?

465
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,973
She's from Russia. Dirt poor.

466
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,144
She had some kind of "osocarma" disease
in her leg when she was 9.

467
00:30:56,312 --> 00:31:00,399
She says that nowhere else in the world
do people expect to be happy...

468
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,695
...except for here in this country. And
still, we're not. And we got everything.

469
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,698
And when we're not, what do we do?
We go to shrinks.

470
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,658
For what, 6, 7 bucks a minute?

471
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,202
There's some truth to what she says.

472
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,496
But should that be a source of shame?

473
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:19,293
That when the desperate struggle for
food and shelter is finally behind us...

474
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:24,548
...we can turn our attention
to other sources of pain and truth?

475
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:29,011
Pain and truth. Come on.
I'm a fat fucking crook from New Jersey.

Anthony.

477
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,724
Now that the panic attacks
and the baseline depression...

478
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,894
...have been dealt with,
the real work can begin.

479
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,063
- I knew you'd say something like that.
- Because it's true.

480
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,067
When we're not constantly having
to put out fires...

481
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,236
...we can really delve
into who you are...

482
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:52,200
...and what you're really after
in your very brief time on this earth.

483
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,415
I'm sorry.

484
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,293
I don't wanna do this anymore.

485
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,462
And you can say
that I'm running away.

486
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,756
I've been here longer
than I'd ever thought.

487
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,926
Longer than anybody
ever thought I'd stay.

488
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,429
And you know what?
I get no appreciation for it.

489
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,057
You've shown a lot of courage.

490
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,600
I commend you on that.

491
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,645
Well, thank you
for the commendation and...

492
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,396
...adiós.

I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

Come to your next appointment.
One more time.

496
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,914
You'll cover my $300 a week
in no time with some other mortadella.

497
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,583
All right, I shouldn't have said that.

498
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,337
Look, you saved my life
in the beginning.

499
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:49,299
And for all the times I came on
like an asshole, I'm very sorry.

if you change your mind.

And if you begin to feel any of
the old feelings, you need to call me.

502
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,979
No.

503
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:08,443
So, what's customary?
I mean, we shake hands? What?

504
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,197

00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,151
Mr. Melvoin,
I've read your application...

520
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,154
...for dismissal on the grounds
of mental incompetence.

521
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,073
I've reviewed the findings
of the doctors in this matter.

522
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:04,953
Frankly, they were unmoved
by Mr. Soprano's performance.

523
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,623
Your Honor, to couch it
as a performance...

524
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,459
It's their opinion that he understands
the charges...

525
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,337
...and that he's competent
to participate in his defense.

526
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,840
- I'd like another round of testing.
- Your Honor...

on any meaningful level.

I appreciate the respect you're
showing me by coming here...

...and reaching out to me at this time.
Always.

I don't wanna crack nuts.
But I will.

...on a separate issue entirely
to reach an accommodation...

592
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,940
...and he don't even make
a counteroffer, where's his respect?

593
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,484
I don't know what advice
he's getting from Johnny.

594

a voice of moderation.

he came onto my turf.

He tried to recruit my melanzane.

612

in a businesslike time frame...

614

further conversation.
