Here, I made it with
a lot of milk and sugar.

00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,276
It's more comforting that way.

5
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,116
You sure you don't want some eggs
or an English or something?

6
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,785
You're coming back?

7
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,621
I hope so. Immigration,
they make problems.

8
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,624
Well, maybe Tony can help with that.

9
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,626
Yeah.

10
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,796
Why are you still here?
I thought you were flying out to Naples.

from Patsy's guy.

Please call. And let us know.

I'm sorry, Tony.

18

You're gonna have to get
somebody else to drive you.

It's not a problem. Go.

You think he wears a bag?

21
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,664
- Who wears what?
- You know, a colostomy bag.

22

Furio's old man.

23
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,169
- How the fuck would I know that?
- Because my ma...

24
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,088
...maybe, maybe not, has to get one.

25
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:57,301

- We could talk about any topic you like.

- No, I'll drive myself.

- I got an important meeting, that's all.

I'm gonna be speaking...

of the rail at the track...

00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:37,201
...from the harbor master on down.
Which is what I was trying to avoid.

332
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,537
You want it renegotiated,
that's what we'll do.

333
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,288
Don't make me go to Perth Amboy.

334
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,543
I'm trying to free myself up
to do a little global thinking.

335
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,003
Right.

336
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,724
- So, girls, what's it gonna be?
- I'll have what I always have.

337
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,937
Chicken Mario?
Fifteen years of Chicken Mario.

338
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,939
Can't you try the veal chop for once?

339
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,525
Why are you giving me
a hard time? I like chicken.

340
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,361
- Hello, beautiful people.
- Oh, look who it is.

341
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,904
- Hey, Ton.
- Hi, how are you?

342
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,157
- Remember Valentina?
- Yeah, nice to see you again.

343
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,078
- Yeah, same here.
- You pulled that horse shit stunt?

We're gonna have some steaks.

346
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,752
- I'll have a steak.
- You don't need a steak.

347
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,839
- I know I don't need a steak.
- Do me a favor...

348
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,675
...don't fuck with the salt shaker.

349
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,263
- You like the sole?
- Scampi for me.

Oh, I don't know, give me...

352
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,186
Come on, you're getting
anorexic over there.

353
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,440
I'm gonna go...
I gotta make a call. Okay?

354
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,442
You're wasting away, you know.

355
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,736
Come on, what are you gonna do?

356
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,573
Here.

357
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,620
- No, no, no, you keep it.
- I don't want your consolation prize.

358
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,788
Bet you have a standing order
at the store.

359
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,958
- I gotta be getting back to my table.
- What, to the blond?

360
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,962
Does she fuck you better than me?
Suck your dick better than me?

361

(LAUGHS)

362
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,305
Come on.

363
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,773
Really, Tony, just tell me.
How come I can't see you again?

364
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,484
- You fuck Ralph.
- You got morals all of a sudden?

365
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,235
No morals, but I do got rules.

366
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,822
Some dago macho bullshit about,
"Don't fuck your friend's girlfriend"?

367
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,991
Yeah, that.

368
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,161
- But not just that.
- Then what?

369
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,669
Look, that day in the countryside,
that was...

370
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,631
- It was great.
- Did I do something wrong? I'll fix it.

371
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,134
No, you can't fix the shit
I'm talking about.

372
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,263
I just don't wanna be
where Ralph has been.

373
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,183
- You prick.
- A one-time thing is one thing...

374
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,646
...but to get into a relationship?
I gotta get back to my dinner.

375
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,358
You don't know anything.
Let me tell you what's really going on.

376
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:19,446
He doesn't fuck me. I swear to God,
he's some kind of freak or something.

377
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,283
- You two don't have sex?
- No. Well...

378
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,495
- Sort of, yeah, but not...
- All right, have a nice life.

379
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,124
Go ahead. Go ahead,
you go back first, I'll wait a minute.

380
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,626
We shouldn't go back together.

381
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,094
- Everything come out all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

382
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,638
How you doing?

383
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,183
- You want red, right?
- Right.

- Tony. It's me, Valentina.

- You got no reason to be calling me.
- I have to tell you everything.

389

I mean, I didn't want to tell you
before because it's just so...

390
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,113
...embarrassing.
Where are you?

391
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,324
- I'm at Ralph's.
- Oh, Christ.

392
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,118
No, no, it's okay.

393
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,955

394
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,917
...Ralph does not have sex
like other people. Regular people.

395
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,170
It's all some kind of kinky shit.
Believe me, I am not hung up.

396
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,758
I've done a lot. I've done girls,
I've done threesomes and I've done...

397
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,511
- With him?
- No, Tony, please just listen.

398
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,180
Ralph is loco. For real, okay?

399
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,267
He just makes me do stuff,
not really even sexual.

400
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,812
Last night I just wanted him to fuck
me so I could get back at you...

401
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,274
...but all he wanted me to do
was drip candle wax on his balls.

402
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,818
Then he went into the bathroom
and jerked off.

403
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,237
Now, I don't call that having
sex with someone.

404
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,740
- Oh, Jesus H. Christ...
- Last week, I swear to God...

405
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,660
...he told me to rub his dick raw
with a cheese grater.

406
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,372
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I wouldn't do it. I told him to fuck off.

(DOOR OPENING)

00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,712

- Will you call me?

Mozzarella.

411
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:35,058
Let me ask you a question.
You think Ralph's a little...

412
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,061
...weird about women?
I don't know, Ton.

413
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,900
I mean, he beat one to death
just for...

414
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,570
I forget. Why was it again?

415
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,991
- Maybe you're feeling guilty.
- I don't see that.

416
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,245
- Why would I?
- Because he's a friend of yours...

417
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,290
...and you're cuckolding him.

418
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,501
Cuckolding is when a man
has an affair with another's wife.

419
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,795
She's not his wife anyway.
She's his goomar.

420
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:08,050
- And therefore has no status whatever.
- Goomars have status.

421
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,553
I mean, it's not like in the old days
when a man had a wife...

422
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,889
...and then sort of a second wife.

423
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,767
Used to be the men would
take out their wives on Fridays...

424
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:21,355
...and their goomars on Saturdays.
Or maybe it's the other way around.

425
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,943
Anyway, when I came up
it wasn't so formal.

426
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,737
A business associate of mine's
got two full families.

427
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,865
One up here, one down in Sea Girt.

428
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,952
And the second wife busts his balls
identical to the first.

429
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,372
Sounds like a complicated
arrangement.

430
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,792
- I'm afraid our time is up.
- Just give me another minute.

431
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,378
- I have a patient waiting.
- Well, let them wait.

432
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,255
You make me wait
out there all the time.

433
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,384
Just wanna ask you
if it's possible for a man...

434
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:54,096
...to go out with a woman
without really doing anything with them.

435
00:32:54,305 --> 00:33:00,102
- You'll have to be more specific.
- He likes them to hurt him. And that's it.

436
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,814
And then he goes and he...

437
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,484
...takes care of himself. His own needs.

438
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:11,154
- He sounds like a textbook masochist.
- Like S & M.

439
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,074
The "M" part, yes.

440
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,452
I thought all that stuff was just,
like, a run-up to the act.

441
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:22,624
That's the case for many people.
But not for people with paraphilias.

442
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,836
For them, receiving pain,
being humiliated...

443
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:30,340
...becomes in and of itself
the sexual release.

444
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:35,137
Like many other things,
we believe it's rooted in childhood.

445
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,265
- We can continue this next week.
- Just one more second.

446
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,268
I received regular beatings
when I was a kid...

447
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,353
...but I'm not looking
for some woman...

448
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,106
...to hook up jumper cables
to my private parts.

449
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,483
It's not a simple one-to-one.

450
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:52,279
More than likely he had
a controlling and punishing mother.

451
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,532
She loved him, but showed
it only in connection...

452
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,786
...with some sort of violent
or abusive act.

453
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:04,166
Is everything about everybody
really about their mothers?

454
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,671
All right, back to the other thing.

455
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,467
If a guy like that is going
out with a woman...

456
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,179
...he could technically not have penisary
contact with her vulva.

457
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,056
It sounds like you're asking me...

458
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:23,351
...for personal information
I really can't give you.

459
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,369
Good morning, Pickwick Framing.

460
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,207
Hello?

461
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,250
Hello?

462
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,219
It's heartbreaking
to hear those women talk...

463
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,097
...about what they were
and what they are going through.

464
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:05,060
The second woman, Joan,
her case is really not very unusual.

465
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,104
Her husband was the financial planner.

466
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,941
She really did not have much
involvement in the finances at the home.

467
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,528
- What are your thoughts?
- Women tend to have the feeling...

468
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:18,115
...that they're not confident.
Men tend to be overconfident, actually...

469
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,409
...in the financial area.
Women have to take responsibility...

470
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,538
...and have to accept the fact
that something like this...

471
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,874
(TONY SINGING IN SHOWER)

472
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,715
You have to have a plan
if your husband doesn't come home...

473
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,425
...and you have
to do the finances.

474

(RUSTLING AROUND WITH BAG)

475
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:20,010
You gotta get up, Ma.
You can't lie there day and night.

476
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,846
I wanna go home.

477
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:27,642
There is no more home, Ma.
We sold it. You know that.

478
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:32,022
They keep making me eat all alone.
That's that Cookie and Minn.

479
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,191
I tried to be so nice.

480
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,445
I bought Cookie a card
from the gift shop downstairs.

481
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,365
I cared enough and I sent the very best.

482
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,952
Don't you worry, Ma.
I'm gonna talk to the social director.

483
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,371
She's the one
to straighten this all out.

484
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,208
But in the meantime,
maybe you can make new friends.

485
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,211
But you gotta get up out of bed.
At least sit up.

486
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,359
You can't let it get to you.

488
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,155

- Shit like that.
- What about plain fucking?

663
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:06,067
I'm telling you,
he can't get hard that way.

664
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,779
And if he could, I don't think
that he'd want to.

665
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,703
(HEAVY BREATHING)

666
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,045
Couldn't believe it when you called.

667
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,215
I was so happy.

668
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,302
I'm feeling pretty happy myself.

669
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:38,015
Why the big change of heart?

670
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,729
Well, I was never hesitating
because of you.

671
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:47,066
I just had to get my head
into a place...

672
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:51,696
...where I felt that I could
really commit, you know.

673
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:55,366
To lavish all the care on you
that you should have.

674
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:33,696
I don't see why I have to do
anything I don't want to.

675
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:39,076
Now, this is Green Grove.
Here the senior citizen is king and queen.

676
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,788
I know, but they told Charles
that this was just a warning.

677
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,916
These people don't fool around.

678
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:49,879
- You're afraid of them.
- Of course he is. And so am I.

679
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,798
This is a stupid thing
for your son to get hurt over.

680
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:58,554
I didn't live for 84 years to have
to be nice to somebody I don't like.

681
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,640
Haven't I earned that right?

682
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:06,437
Ma, I'm gonna have to say this. If you
can't get into the spirit of this thing...

683
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,982
...then we're gonna have to let
you live in a different home.

684
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:16,614
The Salvation Army has one in Irvington
that's supposed to be perfectly fine.

685
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,454
Coffee, Ton?

686
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,208
Got any decaf?

687
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,335
Decaf?

688
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,673
- No, forget it. Regular's fine.
- Well, I can make decaf.

689
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,884
Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks.

690
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,364
Is something wrong, Tony?

691
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:46,203
No. Why?

692
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,005
You out in the backyard
the last couple of days?

693
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,550
Me? It's freezing out there.

694
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,595
You sure?

695
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,847
- The pool guy come around?
- Why would he?

696
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,391
Check up on stuff? Something?

697
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,895
All right, I'm going upstairs.

698
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,361
It'll only take a minute.

699
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:34,793
You sure, Tony, there's not something
you wanna talk about?

700
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,630
No.

701
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,633
Like what?

702
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,346
