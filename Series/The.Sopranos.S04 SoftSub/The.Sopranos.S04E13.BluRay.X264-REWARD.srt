Yeah, let you drive yourself
when you look this bad?

6
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,706
- Yeah?
- He's out.

7
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,377
He looks good.

8
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,339
- Well, talk to him. Get a sense.
- Okay.

9
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,733
Your cousin's out of rehab. Looks good.

10
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,112
Okay. Sorry about that.

11
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,699

Think we might be looking
at a viral syndrome.

Maybe mono.

- Oh, God.
- How's your emotional level?

19
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,975
Stress off the charts lately,
like all of us?

20
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,312
- What do you mean?
- Death? Major change of any kind?

21
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,608
No, just the usual.
One day runs into the next.

Stay on the Advil.
Your temperature goes up, you call me.

23
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:22,868
You know, it's amazing. I got
a relative who's got a heroin problem.

24
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,538
Now, the people that need drugs,
all they can get is shit like Advil.

25
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,083
Thank you for coming.

26
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,551
- That was Grove Street.
- I gotta make a stop, down in Sea Bright.

27
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,096
- Tony, I don't feel well.
- Get some sea air. We'll stop at Barr's.

28

- You won't have to cook.
- Goddamn it. Yeah, I really want lobster.

- Where you going?
- Nordstrom's. They're having a sale.

Sallie Mae calls and your response
is to go shopping?

33
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,703
It's a sale, John.
I need clothes for Italy.

34
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,582
- We're still going, aren't we?
- Might be time to tighten our belts.

00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,464
We should try to go.
I spoke to Nicole Lupertazzi.

00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,593
When she and Little Carmine stayed
at the house all last year, he loved it.

38
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,304
That's good for Little Carmine, then.

John, what'd I do?

42
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,419
Is that my father's truck?

00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,968
- What the hell's going on?
- Me to know, you to find out.

Mrs. Soprano, Virginia Lupo,

00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,147
Hi.

47
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,442
- Tony?
- That's right. It's even got a name.

48
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,071
- Where did this come from?
- That's if we can get it.

49
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,200
It is a huge amount of money.

50
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,828
And your construction
project shut down...

51
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,957
Yeah, well, that can't last forever.
And it's for the family.

52
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:40,088
As the kids get older, it gets harder to
keep us all together, but this is a draw.

53
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,593
Bring friends down,
have big cookouts, Jet Ski...

54
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:49,056
And for us too, though.
When we were piss-poor...

55
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,559
...this was the biggest caviar wish
we could come up with.

Kind of reminds you of
the Kennedy compound, don't it?

58
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,037
Can I ask you why they're selling?
My husband said, "If we can get it."

59
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,249
Well, there is a buyer already.
In fact, the house is sold.

60
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,796
But there's a chance that these buyers
won't qualify for financing.

61
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,590
And I know the owner, Alan.

62
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,635
He lives just next door here.
He's an attorney.

63
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:31,890
If you're offering cash, I thought
you should at least see the place.

64
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,518
So it's not really for sale.

65
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,396
It's just as well,
because we really couldn't swing this.

66
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,689
There's Al!

67
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,785
The jury has claimed
they are deadlocked.

68
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,789
However, I'm inclined
to agree with prosecution.

69
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,209
I'm going to give them
additional time to reach a verdict.

70
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,629
We should've had a hung-jury mistrial.
Object, for chrissake!

71
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,591
Allen charge. It has to play out.

72
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,058
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've communicated that you feel...

73
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,019
...that you're unable to come
to a unanimous verdict.

74
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,524
Now, I know that you've been at it
for a while, and it can be frustrating...

75
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,819
...but we've all spent
a lot of time on this trial.

76
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,739
And being as I have no reason
to believe that another jury...

77
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:33,493
...with the same evidence would
be better able to reach a verdict...

78
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,789
...I'm going to ask you to go back
in there and reason with each other...

79
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:42,919
...and apply the law and come back
in here with a verdict.

80
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,297
If not, I wanna move on.

81
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,300
Here.

82
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,723
Did somebody check this
to make sure we got everything?

83
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,099
Yes.

84
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,229

- Get any sleep?
- Couldn't.

87
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,997
We have absolutely no business getting
into something like that house...

88
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,541
...with A.J. two years away
from college.

89
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,212
That was Virginia Lupo on the phone.
She hasn't heard from the owner.

90
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,255
I guess that deal's gonna go through.

91
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,424
I wonder who they are.

93
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,099
Well, call them up.
You got me plain soup, right?

94
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,769
We'll be finished eating
by the time he gets back.

95
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,230
You have to check the order
while they're here.

96
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,775
What good does that do? You still gotta
go get it and come back again.

97
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,569
- What happened?
- They left out part of the order.

98
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,697
- Call them up.
- Sit down and eat.

99
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,079
Well, I guess some things
just weren't meant to be.

100
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,705
What are we talking about?

101
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,375
I was thinking of buying
a house on the shore.

102
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,086
- Tony.
- Un-fucking-believable!

103
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,088
Well, would we have a gym?

104
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,591
It's the shore.
Wouldn't you want to be outdoors?

105
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,386
Forget that.
You're fined $3 for the F-word.

106
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,472
I heard Dad say "mother-F"
when I was coming down the stairs.

107
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,850
He's fined too.
We're gonna make this policy work.

108
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,352
It's too late.

109
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,828
What's going on?

110
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,668
You know, it does seem like
a good value, even at that price.

111
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,338
Waterfront property in that area...

112
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,843
We probably wouldn't get hurt,
as an investment.

113
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,638
Well, you're the one that took
real-estate classes.

114
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,517
Didn't you say that a person shouldn't
look at a house as an investment?

115
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,938
I know you. If you don't get the place,
you'll sulk. And I'll be the wet blanket.

116
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,525
I'll sulk? I was sleeping.

117
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,614
Just...

118
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,533
If you want me to sign off...

119
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,578
...we probably wouldn't lose money.

120
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,460
But if you don't want to go through
with it, believe me, that's fine too.

121
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,311
But if you did, Virginia Lupo's
phone number is on the bureau.

122
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:51,858
And, you know, better to act
quickly if, you know...

123
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:57,906
More is lost by indecision than by
wrong decision, that's all I'm saying.

124
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,288
- Hey, Jack Lemmon! How's Lee Remick?
- Hey, Ton.

125
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,750
So how the fuck are you?

126
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,378
- That place help you?
- Oh, yeah.

127
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,589
I found out about strengths I have
I didn't even know I had.

128
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,384
- Well, you look fucking great.
- Thank you.

129
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,054
Thank everybody for forcing me
to deal with it.

130
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,350
- Especially Adriana.
- So you're not shooting junk, right?

131
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,020
Fuck, no.
I'm completely clean and sober.

132
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,106
Which one of the 12 steps you on now?

133
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,692
The only one I haven't exactly
done is go around...

134
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,320
...to all the people I fucked over
while I was using and apologize.

135
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,119
Maybe you shouldn't do that one.

136
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,872
- You know, let sleeping dogs lie.
- That's what I was thinking.

137
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,502
Maybe in a couple of cases,
I'll send flowers. Or cash, in some cases.

138
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,680
- Where's Carmine at?
- No change whatsoever.

139
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,100
Where you at?

140
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,938
I think a movement from below
is not palatable to the other bosses.

141
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,982
It's what they fear most.

142
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,026
A movement from outside,
it's more forgivable.

143
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,447
And more understandable,
given the facts.

144
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,533
I mean, you've been reasonable.

145
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:29,330
If I do it, what do you do for me?

146
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:35,170
I take a sad song and make it better
with the other families, as regards you.

147
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,505
You're smart to have reservations.

148
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,426
But there's differences between
this and Castellano.

149
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,804
Yes, you still got the four other
families who could raise a stink.

150
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,641
But Andy's my brother-in-law.
I have their ear.

151
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,396
I'm gonna pass.

152
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,982
- Fuck you talking about?
- I'm taking all the risk.

153
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,568
Fuck were you talking about
last time then?

154
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,528
What would it take?

155
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,576
Fuck even one percentage point.

156
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:11,080
All claims to my HUD
business are irrigated.

157
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,624
- All right.
- Not yet.

158
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:17,879
All future construction projects,
60/40 in my favor.

159
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,310
What I'm gonna tell you
is for your ears only, and Sil's.

160
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,064
We're gonna take out
Carmine Lupertazzi.

161
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,407
- Johnny Sack's gonna go to war, Ton.
- No, he's not.

162
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,540
That's right. Carmine's got major income
besides construction, Johnny don't.

163
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,835
The only other person hurting worse
than these pricks is me.

164

of the five families?

- Well, that's something to be considered.

166
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:08,012
But remember also how deeply hurt
fucking Johnny felt over Carmine...

167

...not backing him on those slurs
against Ginny.

168

169
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,477
Carmine never made that right
with John.

170
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,313
I knew back then that was a mistake.

171
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,024

the other day with Virginia Lupo.

She says those other people
are gonna go through with it.

I was gonna go talk to you,
after I took another look at the place.

186
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,674
The whole thing is galling. I don't think
they're gonna qualify for financing...

187
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:30,470
...and we gave them this God-awful
90-day escrow. My wife's doing.

Well, we've got serious problems.

to talk there in the prep room.

Yes, I'm here.
So, look, what does your lender say?

198
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,145

no comfort from those words.

No, wait, you're not listening.

203
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,992
Simply stated, I want the chance
to sell to a more-qualified buyer...

204

...if I can find one at this late date.

205

Well, actually, it's very simp...

and I'll just stand here?

Not you, please.

so I can't, as a matter of principle...

- So?
- I said 40...

458
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,406

which was ridiculous.

I want you always to remember that.

Even after I'm gone.

468
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,451
- But I'm not going no place.
- Healthy as a fucking rhino, this guy.

00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,578
You stay that way.

- Hi.

472
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,803
A little, I think.

473
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,267
Maybe it would be better
if you went back to school.

474
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,770
Got your head into your schoolwork.
Be with your friends.

475
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:39,274
I'd just be thinking about
what's going on here all the time.

476
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,571
I just keep thinking...

477
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,699
...I used to feel so superior
because so many of my friends...

478
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:52,579
...had these fucked-up divorced parents.
I guess I did too.

479
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,581
And like Finn...

480
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,543
I'm not saying I want kids,
but if we did...

481
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,546
...I used to imagine...

482
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:07,761
...we'd all be together on the holidays,
Christmas, all around this big fire.

483
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,765
You will have a wonderful future,
Meadow.

484
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:16,269
We had a lot of wonderful times
as a family.

485
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:23,109
- All predicated on bullshit.
- I don't want to fight with you, Meadow.

486
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,071
That's not true. I think you know it.

487
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,373
It was because of Furio, wasn't it?

488
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,586
Who said anything about Furio?

489
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,340
I have never been unfaithful
to your father.

490
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,053
Daddy was.

491
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,016
This is not something I want
to talk about. I'm sorry.

00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,727
Not now, not ever.

from him for all those years?

00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,913
Just a little.

01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:06,349
- Where are you gonna go?
- Don't worry about it.

831
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:13,898
You should go back to counseling.

832
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,610
It's better this way.

833
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,993
He's making the right decision.
He'll get a place, you'll go and visit.

834
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,911
It'll be better. You'll see.

835
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,873
Well, you guys could still get
back together maybe?

836
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,918
- Right?
- Yeah. Sure.

837
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,629
We're still close.

838
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,443
God, is there nothing to eat
in this house?

839
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,604
Be careful.

840
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:38,399
I'll be at the Plaza.

841
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,414
(ENGINE STARTING UP)

842
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:50,513
Well, I don't drink anymore. I freeze it
now, and I eat it like a Popsicle.

843
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:55,226
A drink never hurt nobody.
Remember the words of Joe E. Lewis:

844
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:58,730
"You're not drunk if you can lay
on the floor without holding on."

845
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:02,567
Fucking gangster asshole!

846
01:12:06,363 --> 01:12:07,613
Call the police.

847
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:10,992
They'll just turn it down again
when the police boat comes.

848
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:14,162
(DEAN MARTIN SINGING)

849
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,417
- The Coast Guard...
- He can keep paying...

850
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:24,964
...those $200 fines forever, Alan!
You've gotta let it go, Alan!

851
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,384
Give him his money! God!

852
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,031
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
