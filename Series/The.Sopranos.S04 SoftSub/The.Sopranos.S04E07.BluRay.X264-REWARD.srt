He's gonna reappraise them
in the $300,000 range.

148

What you do, Maurice, is you take
the phony appraisals to HUD.

149
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,851
Tell them your Urban Housing League
wants to buy these shit-holes...

150
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,729
...convert them to low-cost housing
for working families.

you take it to the bank.

They cut a check,
and we work it up nice.

At which point I assume my organization
fails to make the mortgage payment.

and repeated vandalism...

155
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,081
...force the project into dissolution.
We all walk away from the houses.

156
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,000

of the profit range.

in strong support of your application.

She called me months later, after you
broke it off. One thing led to another...

All right, all right, take it easy.
It's ancient history.

172
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,144
Still, I've been meaning to tell you.
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

173
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:55,565
What am I, your father?
You're both adults. Enjoy yourself.

174
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,610
It's more than that. I care for her.

175
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,988
Very deeply. Roz and I are separated.

00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,824
The heart wants what the heart wants,
I guess.

177
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,077
The heart also wants
what the dick wants.

178
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:12,123
Okay, who's gonna scrub my back?

Believe it or not, the Chi-Lites
were signed to the same label...

184
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,105
...as Tommy James
and them damn Shondells.

but they're wrong.

Frankly, I'm glad to have her
off my payroll.

- Oh, Jesus Christ.

Why don't you go haunt a house
or something.

What do you want, Robyn?

200
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,213
I heard Paulie Gualtieri's out of jail.

- What do I know?
- How does Christopher feel about that?

202
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,720
Christopher likes Paulie.
They're friends.

203
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,055
Is that a crime now too?

204
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,728
How is Christopher, anyway?
He looked tired last time I saw him.

We're both fine.

As a matter of fact, we're thinking
of finally getting married.

You have a good time today?

214
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,389
Yeah, it was cool. I love the ocean.

See that church?

217
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,615
Your great-grandfather helped build
that almost 80 years ago.

218
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,450
He was a stonemason, the old man.

219
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,495
Came over from Avellino
with $4 in his pocket.

220
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,623
Yeah, but I saw in a book
where you could get a hotel room...

221
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,625
...for, like, 10 cents a week then.

222
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,128
Room service must have been,
like, 1 or 2 cents a meal.

223
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,423
Room service? We're talking
about history here, A.J.

Your family's history.
Newark's history.

225
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,305
- Well, who gives a shit about Newark?
- I'm making a point.

226
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,643
This neighborhood used to be beautiful,
100 percent Italian.

227
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,437
The 1920s, most of them
right off the boat.

228
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,691
Most Italians couldn't even find a church
that wanted them.

229
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,526
So, what did they do,
did they cry?

230
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,112
Did they go to the government
with their hand out?

231
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,698
No. They took care
of their own problems.

232
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,325
They said, "You don't want us
in your church? Fine.

233
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,496
We'll build our own. A better one."
Look at all these buildings around here.

234
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,165
Most of them are falling
down to the ground.

235
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,334
But that church is still standing.

236
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,961
You know why?

00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,005

Because our people give a shit,
that's why.

Every Sunday,
Italians from the old neighborhood...

240
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,223
...they drive miles
to come here to pray.

241
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,142

ain't making any more of it.

her closer to Tony.

279

If they have kids,
that's even more pressure.

Okay, all right, well...

00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,802
Let's get married.

00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,973
Where'd this come from?

349
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:58,269
I don't know. It's gonna be two years
we're engaged.

350
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,438
Let's just go down to City Hall.

351
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,275
City Hall? What are we, shlubs?

352
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,069
You said you wanted
a big wedding, anyway.

353
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,947
I don't care about that shit.

354
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,616
I just want you.

355
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,620
It'll be cheaper anyway.
We could buy a house.

Plus...

357
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,501
...a wife can't testify
against her husband.

358
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:32,470
You can't have a club, stay out all night
getting high when you have a kid.

359
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,606
What if we didn't have kids?

360
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,941
Fuck that! What's the point
of being married?

361
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,695
I mean, what if we can't?
If I can't?

362
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,615
Would you still love me?

363
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,535
Of course I'd still love you.

364
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,997

There's something you should know.

366
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:17,640
A long time ago, years ago,
I had a medical procedure.

367
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,559
It was before we met.

368
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,146
My uterus got pierced.

369
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,192
- Both of them?
- There's only one. That's ovaries.

370
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,028
So, what does that mean,
you can't get pregnant?

371
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,738
My doctor said it might be hard.

372
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,574
A friend gave me the name
of a specialist in Manhattan...

373
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:39,870
You knew you were damaged goods
and you never fucking told me?

374
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,332
- How could you call me that?
- Jesus-fucking-Christ!

375
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,376
How could you lie to me like that?

376
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,087
I tried to tell you once.
I wanted to.

377
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,714
I was afraid that you wouldn't propose.

378
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:56,262
You don't get it, Adriana. I don't have a
son, the Moltisanti name ends! That's it!

379
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,472
- We could adopt.
- Yeah, that's great!

380
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,100
Some kid with Chinky eyes
called Moltisanti!

381
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,060
He'd get his ass kicked every day!

382
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:08,065
- You said you'd still love me.
- That doesn't mean I'll marry you!

You don't wanna lose this one.

marriage and our thing don't jive.

- Let him call.
- They're crack addicts.

452

It's good that you're sorry,
but no, it's not all right.

We've been down this road before.

454
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:24,172
- I know, I know.
- The fact that you're angry is fine.

455
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,675
And it's okay to talk about your anger.

456
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,554
But when it manifests itself
in physicality...

457
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,890

- I was very upset. You lied to me.
- I did not lie to you.

463

about a very sensitive subject.

And you may not believe this,
but I did exercise impulse control.

the other one threw a bottle at my car.

but I let it go. I drove away.

that you extend to me...

...the same courtesy
you would a crack addict.

00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:42,125

truthful here, you know, opening up...

- What do you need my tools for?

...I can never be called to testify.
What do you mean?

637

- A wife can't testify against a husband.
- Oh, right, right.

Actually, though, I don't think
that's actually true.

To claim marital privilege,
three conditions must be met.

643

First, the communication must be
made during marriage.

644
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,576
Anything said before you were married
is fair game.

645
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,370
Two, the communication
must involve only the spouses.

646
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,039
The presence of a third party
destroys the privilege.

647
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,376
Three, the communication can't
be made in furtherance of a crime.

648
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:59,088
Oh, my God, it's a simple question.
Can they make me testify or not?

649
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,592
The short answer? Probably.

650
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:07,054
In an organized crime, a RICO, the feds'll
spend a fortune putting on their case.

they're gonna find a way.
