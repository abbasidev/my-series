See?

326
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,679
Just a spoonful, Jan.
That's enough, thanks.

327
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,517
Tell Daddy what we saw
on the way home from school.

328
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,483
The Fuji blimp over Willowbrook Mall.

329
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,568
So?

330
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,155
Well, you kids seemed to like it
when you saw it.

331
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,865
You begged me to follow it.

332
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,660
It was nice of you
to pick them up, Janice.

333
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,872
- And making dinner.
- Enjoy, everybody.

334
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,044
It does smell good, doesn't it?

335

- I'll get something at home.

336
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,634
No, it's all right. Isn't it, kids?

337
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,223
- Can we eat in front of the TV?
- Yeah.

338
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,226
- That's rude.
- Oh, no, no, no, kids.

339

I'm the one barging in.
You go right in there.

340

You know how to set up the TV trays.
You want a little more?

341
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:32,613
- Okay. It's pretty good, actually.
- Thank you, Bobby.

342
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,532
Thanks.

343
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:40,579
Jan, I told you, I don't want them to be
spoiled because they lost their mother.

344
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,043
I saw my uncle today.

345
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,089
- Jesus.
- That's right.

346
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,217
Is he mad?

347
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,637
What's going on, Bobby?
What were you supposed to do?

348
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,848
- Union business.
- What's going on?

349
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,102
- This election coming up, that's all.
- Bobby...

I'm the one that should've
been in that car, not Karen.

351
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,236
And Junior's been so good to me,
and I'm letting him down.

352
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:18,033
Fuck him. He only thinks of himself,
selfish old fuck.

353
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:22,580
Now listen to me.
I know my uncle. He's a patient man.

354
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,250
But if you don't do your job,
he'll find somebody who will.

getting your ticket punched...

I don't care anymore.

I remember my son Harpo
when my husband left us.

362
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,944
I had both barrels
of a shotgun in my mouth.

363
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,364
But then just one thought of Harpo...

364

My little boy without his mother.

365

- Every day is worse than the last.
- Bobby, my uncle loves you.

He needs you.

367

So you're gonna get up tomorrow
morning, and you're gonna get dressed...

368
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:20,846
...and you're gonna get in that car and
you're gonna do what needs to be done.

369

Aren't you?

370
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,818
Okay, then.
Now, will you eat something?

So show me one of those trusts,

Okay. I can see where you'd
want more mutability, Ton.

373
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,958
Does mutability mean money?
Because, yeah, that's what I want.

this is a stakes race. I think she's ready.

- So, Dr. Dolittle, any thoughts?
- Only six furlongs.

385
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,119

- Excuse me, signora...

No, she's right.

- But she just can't beat Pie-O-My.

It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

488
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,447
And I gotta rot in that courtroom.

489
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,783
I'll put the heat on under the gravy.

490
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,954
And my daughter's coming over
to the house for dinner, so I gotta go.

in Germany last month.

In the federal courthouse in Newark,
there were few surprises in the trial...

494
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,885
...of Corrado "Junior" Soprano.
Hey, Murf.

495
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,637
- Hello, Junior.
- Shh.

496
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,973
The defendant listened as government
auditors detailed...

497
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,476
...financial irregularities
at Comley Trucking.

498
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,395
The prosecution outlined how...

499
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,397
- The fuck?!
- What?

500
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,982
What kind of likeness is that?

501
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,484
If they were great artists,
they'd be in a museum.

502
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,823
I'm fucking fodder for cartoonists now?

503
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,373
You know, Bobby, a little support
in the courtroom would be nice.

504
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:59,836
- Or are you still hanging crepe?
- I took care of the thing. Last night.

505
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,964
- The guy, you saw him?
- Him and 184 won't be a problem.

506
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,508

507

The one in the middle.

of things. All that moping around...

- That's what Janice said.

510
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,153
- Janice?
- She's been wonderful through all this.

511
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,865

bringing dinner over the house.

512
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,493
- Janice?
- She's a pretty good cook.

513
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,787
Since when?
Everybody steers clear of her food.

514
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:37,707
Nah. She made lasagna
the other night. Delicious.

515
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,545
With sweet sausage along with the beef.
I thought Karen's was good, but...

516
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,049
Sweet sausage? In little pieces?

517
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,718
And a layer of basil leaves
underneath the cheese?

518
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,970
- That's right.
- That's Carmela's lasagna.

519

520

of everybody.

this guy did for me.

Something I can't talk about.

534
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,770
Something that was ruining
my whole life, and he made it right.

Slow down.

653
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,984
The horse is sick! The Pie-O-My.

654
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,320
- How bad is it?
- They said she may to die.

655
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:32,074
And the doctor, he won't do nothing
until he gets his money.

656
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,535
Tell them I'll take care of it.

657
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,042
Son of a bitch.

658
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,670
I am now nearing the end of my journey.

659
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:49,717
I hope I still have some
services to render.

660
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,762
(MAN TALKING ON TV)

661
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,404
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go out.

662
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,366
- It's raining.
- Ralphie Cifaretto's horse is sick.

663
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,536
And they can't find him, so somebody's
gotta go down there and pay the vet.

664
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,623
- Down where?
- The racetrack.

665
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,125
It's a racehorse?

666
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,461
So why do you have to go?

667
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:30,257
- You bought a racehorse?
- No. I didn't buy it.

668
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,552
- It followed you home?
- The horse is sick.

669
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,277
I told him you were coming
with the money.

670
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:35,573
He finally gave her something
to settle her down, so I don't know.

671
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,534
- Is she gonna be all right?
- Well, she stopped thrashing.

672
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,246
That's dangerous. The intestines
get twisted, and you have to cut.

673
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,832
And they're finished as racers then.

674
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:51,047
- You the vet?
- I gave her a shot. She's quieted down.

675
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,677
Here. Here's your fucking money.

676
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,847
You better hope she's gonna be all right.

677
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,772
- (HORSE GRUNTS)
- Shh shh shh.

678
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,733
Good girl.

679
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:16,572
That's a good girl, okay?
Shh. Okay?

680
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,657
Trust me.

681
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,787
Trust me, it's okay.

682
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,250
Good girl.

683
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,270
Good girl.

684
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,278

- (HORSE GRUNTS)
- Shh shh.

686
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,220
It's okay. It's okay.

687
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,889
Okay, I know.
