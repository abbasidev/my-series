a life insurance trust.

been established.

Second of all, this is
how you handle it?

- Consider it a message.
- He's in Miami.

74

- They got phones down there.
- He's got a bad history, Tony.

Did you hear what my friend
said about my wife?

He made a crack about Ginny's weight.
Something about her having...

...a 90-pound mole on her ass.

Who told you this?

85
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,400
What's important is that it was said.

86
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,193
If he said it, I didn't hear it.

87
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,530

a remark like that when I'm around.

that Ralph can be a fucking asshole.

serious about him winding up...

- You know.
- She's the mother of my children.

I don't know. He's still unconscious.

of the rules I cannot do it.

has passed, you have no legal recourse.

for the housewarm.

Everybody, come on.

675
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,666
- That's it.
- God, I'm such a spaz.

676
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,668
- No, no, you're good. Come.
- Meadow.

677
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,504
Come on.

678
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,528
Nice.

679
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:29,840
- We'll be in fucking big trouble.
- It ain't gonna happen.

680
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,144
At least it's not just Jason
who's regressing.

681
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,607
Soprano? His own daughter was
going through the same thing.

682
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,736
I felt like such a fraud
giving him advice.

683
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:53,572
My own son has three years
on his daughter...

684
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,785
...and look how he's acting.

685
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,914
Jen, why do you still feel guilty?

686
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:07,753
Sometimes I wonder
if Richard had a point.

687
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:12,591
I shouldn't have gone down into
that garage that late at night.

688
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,430
I went to see Sask at school
the other day...

689
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,182
...and I'm in the parking garage
over there?

690
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:23,936
I was driving around for 20 minutes
when finally I spot someone leaving...

691
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,605
...this big Bluto sort of guy.

692
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,525
I must have crowded him
as he headed for his car.

693
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:35,781
Anyway, he turned around
and became quite confrontational.

694
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:39,618
And for a second, I'll admit,
I thought of you.

695
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,954
What are you getting at?

696
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,459
Parking garages are not
inherently dangerous places.

697
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:51,172
Jen, you cannot blame yourself
for what happened to you.

698
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,970
Turns out this guy was probably another
parent or, more likely, a repairman.

699
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:02,308
But if he had dragged me out of my car
and beaten me up...

700
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:07,021
...would I be saying, "Gee, I shouldn't
have tried to park my car?"

701
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,650
Anyway, enough about him.

702
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:15,196
Let's get back to you.

703
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,379
You wanted to see me?

704
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,175
You can tell Ralph I've decided
to accept his apology.

705
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:46,685
You know that kid you pissed on?
Donny K?

706
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,855
He's got fucking nerve damage
on his left side.

707
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,359
I'm sorry, Tony.

708
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,780
I bet you are.

709
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,908
I'll expect to hear from Ralph, then.

710
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,371
Why the big reversal all of a sudden?

711
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,875
No more weight remarks, Tony.

712
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:14,130
They're hurtful,
and they're destructive.

713
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,007
Oh, I agree.

I'm just reading.

718
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:55,254
Bought you something.

719
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,757
What's this for?

720
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,093
No reason.

721
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,929
I don't know if I believe that.

722
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,358
Put a call in to Ginsberg, by the way.

723
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,445
He's back from California.

724
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,951
Tony, this is beautiful.

725
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,622
What size is this?

726
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,875
I don't know, small.

727
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,128
I don't know if this'll fit.

728
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,964
Try it on.

729
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,703
See? I knew you could pull it off.

730
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,916
You look like a model.

731
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,627
Listen to him now.
