1
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,691
As you know,

2
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:53,196
the human race grew up
alongside glaciers during the Ice Ages.

3
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,366
The cold stimulates ancient nerves.

4
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,476
It makes you feel
a primal connection to the world.

5
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:04,063
We used over 300 tons of ice
to create the hotel,

6
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,817
and guests are surprised to know
how much snow.

7
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,045
Over 10,000 tons.

8
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,422
Wow, that's a lot.

9
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,032
Luckily,
Norway has plenty of snow and ice.

10
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,221
These blocks were created

11
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:22,583
by carefully smoothing the ice
on our river as it freezes,

12
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,837
then harvesting it
for storage in a nearby cave.

13
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,216
Everything you see melts in summer.

14
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,405
We have different artists and artisans
help us build again each year,

15
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,516
so every stay is truly once in a lifetime.

16
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,602
And here we have your room.

17
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,982
The Koi Suite.

18
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,573
Wow. Oh, it's brisk.

19
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,911
Our guest suites are slightly warmer
than the rest of the hotel.

20
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,205
About three degrees below zero.

21
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,373
Not too, too cold.

22
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,686
It's quite invigorating
once you get used to it.

23
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:12,442
As we say, you will feel...
<i>som plommen I egget</i>.

24
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,027
Like a yolk in an egg.

25
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,570
Okay, that's adorable.

26
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,822
<i>Som...
Som plommen I eggen? Eggen?</i>

27
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,325
That's very good.

28
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,952
These fish were hand-carved

29
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,289
by famous Norwegian ice sculptor,
Anders Skjeggestad Ruud.

30
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,749
He won the Boreal Forest Prize

31
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,168
at the Harbin Ice Sculpting
Competition last year.

32
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,669
Beautiful. Isn't that beautiful?

33
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,172
-The bed is made of ice?
-Yes. Isn't that charming?

34
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,967
And I highly recommend trying
our complimentary house brandy.

35
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,262
-The bed is made of ice.
-It is distilled locally from ice wine,

36
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,890
and I assure you it is quite special.

37
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,226
-These furs are very thick...
-Ice. Helen,

38
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,335
we are sleeping on an ice bed.

39
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,856
I could've saved that hundred grand and
frozen my eggs right here, yolks and all.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,257
Now, one more thing.

41
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,487
Your bathrooms are around the corner,
in the hall to your left.

42
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,239
And if you keep going in that direction,

43
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,099
you get to our hot tub deck,
which is always open.

44
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,579
As I'm sure you've noticed, the sky
is quite wonderful this time of year.

45
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,356
Anything else you need,
please do not hesitate to let me know.

46
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,608
Thank you, Bjorn.

47
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,694
Oh. Thank you very much.

48
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,506
I hope you both have an enjoyable stay.

49
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,674
<i>God natt?</i>

50
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,301
Excellent.
<i>God natt til deg også.</i>

51
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,035
Okay.

52
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,503
This is amazing.

53
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:35,215
How did I not realize
that the bed would be made of ice?

54
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,279
We just flew 16 hours
to get frozen like Walt Disney.

55
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,281
Uh, Walt Disney wasn't frozen.
That's a myth.

56
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,806
And look at this place!

57
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,184
It was worth the trip.

58
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,831
I mean, do we absolutely have to go
every wacky place Rick Steves recommends?

59
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:54,586
I mean, would it be so bad to
stay somewhere that's not an experience

60
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,838
but just a really nice hotel?

61
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,923
Can't it be both?

62
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,009
Doesn't it feel...
...kind of nice?

63
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,928
I mean, my...
my skin feels so awake.

64
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,247
Oh, my God. Seriously?

65
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,893
Who knew? Hell is in Norway.

66
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,479
Oh, come on. This is completely your bag.

67
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:13,962
You love feeling bad.

68
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,591
Mmm.

69
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,080
-What you doing over there?
-Looking for your cell phone.

70
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,533
-Val should have numbers by now.
-I already talked to Val at the airport.

71
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,076
Come over here. Get under these blankets,

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,852
-they're so soft.
-You talked to Val?

73
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:30,854
What'd she say?

74
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,026
It's on the list!

75
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,171
Congratulations!

76
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,548
-Good. Great.
-Yeah.

77
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,367
Now come over here. Have some brandy.
It's so good.

78
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,221
Where on the list?

79
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,014
It's...
Stop it. It's a best seller.

80
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,040
I know. I'm just... I'm just curious where.

81
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,959
Top 20.

82
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,312
-Top 20.
-Yeah.

83
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,839
But, like, closer to 11 or closer to 20?

84
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,882
You're impossible.

85
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,885
You're the most impossible
best-selling author I know.

86
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,739
-Come over here.
-Why?

87
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,348
Just come here.

88
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,642
Look at this.

89
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,771
That is amazing.

90
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,401
Oh, God, I always wanted to see it.

91
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,128
One time in Canada I came close,

92
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,906
but this is so much better
than I ever imagined.

93
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,386
It kinda looks like a screen saver.

94
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,745
Oh, my God. Stop, stop, stop. Sit.

95
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,142
Here you go.

96
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,562
Yeah. Isn't that warmer?

97
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,672
Warmer than what?

98
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,217
You can almost hear it, can't you?

99
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,680
Ooh, ooh! It's turning purple.

100
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,185
Look at that.

101
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,689
Hmm. Guess what?

102
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,088
Sitting on a block of ice
makes you feel like you have to pee.

103
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,861
Okay, so pee.

104
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,488
Yeah, but is the toilet
gonna be made out of ice?

105
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,617
-What if I stick to it?
-Pee or don't pee, but...

106
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,679
Uh, this is your captain speaking.

107
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,575
Fingers crossed, hopefully
we've seen the last of that rough air.

108
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,536
Should be smooth sailing for a while,

109
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,729
so we're gonna go ahead
and turn off that fasten seat belt sign.

110
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,692
<i>Feel free to move about the cabin, Carol.</i>

111
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,220
May we get you anything?

112
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,390
Nope. Uh, who's flying today?

113
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,954
<i>Carol, on the flight deck is
Captain John McConnell and also...</i>

114
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,622
<i>First Officer Tom Deegan.</i>

115
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,817
These individuals have a combined
51,619 hours of flight time.

116
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,963
And between the two of them,
they've piloted every variant

117
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,407
<i>of this capable and trustworthy
Airbus A330 aircraft.</i>

118
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,326
<i>You're in good hands.</i>

119
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,472
That's weirder
than the gal from TGI Fridays.

120
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,183
You doing this because she freaked me out?

121
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,893
<i>Uh, that's an affirmative, Carol.</i>

122
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,084
Please stop that.

123
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,814
It's much more spacious up in first class.

124
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,649
Sure you won't be more comfortable there?

125
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,343
It has lie-flat seats.
You could get some rest.

126
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,844
I'm fine where I'm at.

127
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,907
Thank you.

128
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,597
Back in Spain, that was
all the English speakers, right?

129
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,016
Anyone with conversational ability, yes.

130
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,684
Tell me about the non-English speakers.

131
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,394
Certainly. What would you like to know?

132
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,128
Anything. Everything.

133
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,984
Well, let's see. Uh, there's Bora Colak,
a 68-year-old candy vendor in Istanbul.

134
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,386
He speaks Turkish and loves cats.

135
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,698
In Bali, there's Ida Ayu Dewi.
Twenty-three.

136
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:20,495
Uh, speaks Indonesian Balinese.
She's a contortionist and a dancer.

137
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,082
Performs the Barong, the Legong Jobog.
It's all quite exquisite.

138
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,416
I'm sure. Keep going.

139
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,545
Uh, Sidore Melis in Sardinia
is a fisherman.

140
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,321
Or he was, but he's 89 and retired.

141
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,593
There's Mary Kuksie Akintola.
Lives in Maseru, Lesotho.

142
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,136
What... What does she do?

143
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,557
Her family raises Basotho ponies,
but she's only eight years old.

144
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,083
-She hasn't decided on a profession.
-Next.

145
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,604
Abdul Kareem Alsharei lives
in Aden, Yemen.

146
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,839
He's a 37-year-old muezzin.

147
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,384
Mu... Muezzin. That's a...
What is that?

148
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,070
He sings the call to prayer.

149
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,888
He has a powerful tenor voice.

150
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,639
He also loves cats.

151
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:03,371
Okay. But are there any medical doctors?

152
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,565
Any... Any scientists
or an expert of some kind?

153
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,627
Oh, yes. According to <i>Time Out Magazine,</i>

154
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,840
Takeo Kitanaka in Osaka makes the best
udon noodles in the entire Keihanshin...

155
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,782
That's not what I meant. Nope.

156
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,328
All right, that makes... What? Um...

157
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,431
Six.

158
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:25,768
So, you didn't say anything
about the guy from, uh...

159
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,253
Where was it? Uh, Paraguay.
What about him?

160
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,440
Uh, his name is Manousos Oviedo.

161
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,799
We weren't aware of him
for the first 33 hours.

162
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,053
He manages a self-storage facility
in Asunción.

163
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,306
So far, he hasn't really
communicated with us.

164
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:41,975
Huh.

165
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:44,228
I wanna talk to him.

166
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,231
He only speaks Spanish
and a bit of Guarani.

167
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,775
-Do you want us to translate for you?
-No.

168
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,778
I'll manage.

169
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,965
First thing, once I get home.

170
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,991
We could try him right now, if you like.

171
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,343
He's been a bit reluctant
to get in contact.

172
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,611
Try it again.

173
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:59,094
Uh... <i>Hola, señor. Me llamo C...</i>

174
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,309
I think we got, uh, cut off or something.
Try it again.

175
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,554
<i>Hola, yo soy Carol Sturka.</i>

176
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,140
<i>Uh, estoy de los...</i>
...United States...

177
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:30,310
<i>¡No me jodan más! ¡Déjenme en paz, put as!</i>

178
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,423
Get him back.

179
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,719
Get him back.

180
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,612
<i>¡Chinga tu madre, cabrón!</i>

181
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,117
We're sorry, Carol.
We don't think it was personal.

182
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,902
Bye, Carol.

183
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,446
Really, please let us know if there's...

184
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,867
Carol! One... One second.

185
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,412
We have something for you.

186
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,504
We gathered all the mail
that was in transit for you.

187
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,093
We think you're really gonna like
what's in the box.

188
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,355
Anything else we can do for you,
just... just let us know.

189
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,432
<i>Hi, Carol. What can we do for you?</i>

190
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,543
What exactly do you know
about what's in this box in my mail?

191
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:04,214
<i>Helen ordered it for you.
You'd been so stressed out on the tour.</i>

192
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,633
<i>You tried one in the Atlanta airport.</i>

193
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,846
<i>But you said it was too expensive,
so Helen bought one online.</i>

194
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,323
Did she?

195
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,726
<i>She thought it would make a nice
gift to celebrate the end of the tour.</i>

196
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,978
<i>A homecoming present.</i>

197
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:22,983
<i>Carol?</i>

198
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,112
Okay,
here's what's gonna happen.

199
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,574
You're gonna forget
everything you know about Helen.

200
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,577
Every memory. Every thought she ever had.

201
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,306
Get her out of your head. Heads.

202
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,559
-<i>Carol, we apologize if it...</i>
-Never mention her again.

203
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,519
Never think about her again.

204
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,189
Only I get to remember her,
you got that? Only me.

205
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,870
<i>Then how come your name isn't Big Dummy?</i>

206
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:07,361
<i>Well, there were already
three other people in town with that name.</i>

207
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,340
<i>But that's beside the point.</i>

208
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:14,385
{\an8}<i>One day I got up the courage to
go up to Mean Old Lady Hickenlooper</i>

209
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,013
{\an8}<i>and ask her why she always frowned.</i>

210
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:21,100
<i>Well, she had been born
with no smiling muscles.</i>

211
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,798
<i>I pointed out that a frown
is just a smile turned upside down!</i>

212
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:33,947
<i>So from then on, whenever I'd go by,
she'd stand on her head and wave!</i>

213
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,165
What the hell?

214
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,265
-<i>Good morning, Carol.</i>
-What's with the food?

215
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:47,252
<i>It's the exact meal you had at that
B and B you stayed at in Provincetown.</i>

216
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:51,048
<i>2012? Remember? You were there
to see the Indigo Girls.</i>

217
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:55,945
<i>You were very complimentary of the chef
that morning. It really stuck with her.</i>

218
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,032
-<i>The sorghum flour pancakes...</i>
-So you took it upon yourself

219
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,557
to make me breakfast?

220
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,821
<i>Well, we knew your fridge was pretty bare.</i>

221
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,915
<i>You've only got tonic water,
half a carton of oat milk,</i>

222
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,876
<i>a jar of green olives, a jar
of black olives, a jar of red olives...</i>

223
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,213
-I told you Helen was off-limits.
<i>-Yes, of course, Carol.</i>

224
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:14,321
So how the f...

225
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,551
How do you know what is in my fridge?

226
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,595
<i>Theresa from Merry Maids.</i>

227
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,723
<i>You had them clean up just before
you got home from the book tour.</i>

228
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,124
<i>Is the food not to your liking?</i>

229
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,478
<i>Would you like us
to make you something else instead?</i>

230
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:29,586
Nope.

231
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,508
I want you to leave me alone.

232
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:56,196
Shows what you know, fuckers.
It's three quarters of a carton.

233
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,114
What... the... fuck?

234
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,160
-<i>Hello, Carol.</i>
-What happened to my Sprouts?

235
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,329
Are you the Grinch
who steals supermarkets?

236
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:12,207
<i>So sorry. We're consolidating resources</i>

237
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:15,210
<i>to centralize useful items
for distribution.</i>

238
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:18,671
<i>Food, medicine, anything helpful
from stores or businesses</i>

239
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,447
<i>or what used to be private homes.</i>

240
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,699
<i>It's just more efficient.</i>

241
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,054
Fine. Fine. I get it.

242
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,306
<i>Is there something specific you need?</i>

243
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,517
<i>We can deliver to you anytime. Anywhere.</i>

244
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,603
I am not going to call you
every time I need something.

245
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,420
I don't want you waiting on me.

246
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,692
I am a very independent person. Okay?

247
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,261
I always have been. I fend for myself.

248
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,347
I just want my Sprouts back.

249
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,766
<i>Absolutely. Will do.</i>

250
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,309
Okay.

251
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,478
Great.

252
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,233
So, what? Um...

253
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,629
Can we say Friday, maybe?

254
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:02,865
I just need a rough estimate
of when I should come back.

255
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,200
<i>We'll be there in a moment.</i>

256
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,877
Carol.

257
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,403
May we sneak past you here?

258
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:18,495
-All set, Carol. Call us if there's...
-something you want that's not here.

259
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,119
-We'll get it...
-to you toot sweet.

260
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,713
<i>Luckily, there were some Druid priests</i>

261
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,966
<i>who were in town for the opening
of Stonehenge-land.</i>

262
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,302
<i>They said they could stop it</i>

263
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:19,430
<i>if they could sacrifice
the town's dumbest virgin.</i>

264
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:26,396
<i>I don't know why I raised my hand.</i>

265
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,303
Damn it.

266
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,753
You have got
to be fucking kidding me.

267
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,038
<i>Hello, Carol.</i>

268
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:27,957
<i>So sorry to startle you.
We didn't mean to do that.</i>

269
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,584
Why are you turning off the lights?

270
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:32,212
<i>Yes, we know. It was a mistake.</i>

271
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,672
<i>We had a little problem
isolating your branch circuit.</i>

272
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,007
<i>They're back on now, right?</i>

273
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,592
-<i>The lights in your house? Okay.</i>
-Yes.

274
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,386
Why are you turning them off
everywhere else?

275
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,679
<i>For conservation.</i>

276
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:45,517
<i>Just the ones that aren't necessary.
Which are, well, most of them.</i>

277
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:48,102
What? Lights aren't necessary
for you guys? You just see in the dark?

278
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,146
<i>Oh, no.</i> <i>Not at all.</i>

279
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,232
<i>It's just that there's no crime
to prevent,</i>

280
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:56,027
<i>and we're not working at night.
Except for essential operations.</i>

281
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:58,363
<i>Water treatment,
hospitals, things like that.</i>

282
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,156
Right, so it's more of your efficiency?

283
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,828
<i>Yes. You donated twice to the Sierra Club,
so we felt you'd understand.</i>

284
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:07,247
<i>If you'd like, we'd be happy
to restore the rest of the lights.</i>

285
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:10,416
No. Screw it. Leave them off.
Who gives a shit?

286
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,628
<i>Carol, is there anything
we can do to cheer you up?</i>

287
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:15,320
Cheer me up? Why?

288
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:19,050
I'm fine. I'm so happy.

289
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,970
There is nothing wrong with me that
a fucking hand grenade wouldn't fix.

290
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,054
You got one of those?

291
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,889
'Cause I think that
would be the perfect topper

292
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:27,058
for the greatest week in human history.

293
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,522
Fuck it.

294
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,496
<i>It must've just been
the excitement of the moment,</i>

295
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,956
<i>but they said the only way
to prevent the eruption</i>

296
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,959
<i>was for me to crawl through their legs,
up the volcano,</i>

297
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:37,754
<i>while they gave me my birthday whacks.</i>

298
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,346
<i>Well...
and you're not going to believe this...</i>

299
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,045
-Yeah?
-Hi.

300
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,571
Sorry it took so long.

301
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,742
-A hand grenade.
-Yes.

302
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:28,513
We thought you were probably
being sarcastic,

303
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:30,497
but we didn't want to take the chance.

304
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,751
W-Were you being sarcastic?

305
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:40,724
Right. Of c...
Of course you were.

306
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,153
Do you want us to take...

307
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:46,680
You know what?
We're just gonna... We'll get rid of it.

308
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,476
Feel better, Carol.

309
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,731
Hey.

310
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,150
Do you maniacs drink?

311
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:02,046
It's okay.

312
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,656
You can bring the hand grenade.

313
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:22,400
Does the whole world
get drunk when you drink?

314
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:27,155
Like, does some six-year-old in Sri Lanka
slur his words when you knock one back?

315
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,491
No, it...
it doesn't work like that.

316
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:30,599
Hmm.

317
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,936
How do you say cheers in Sanskrit?

318
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:37,397
Roughly it means,
"May everyone be blessed."

319
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,318
Well, then. Shoot... Shoo...

320
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:45,030
Shoopy shoop shoop.

321
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,831
You know the word "vodka"
is a diminutive of <i>voda,</i> meaning "water."

322
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:58,978
Very similar
to the Latin <i>aqua vitae,</i>

323
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,647
literally "water of life."

324
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:03,024
That becomes the Scandinavian <i>akvavit</i>.

325
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:06,152
Although the drinks are very different.

326
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,905
Fun fact,
whiskey has the same root meaning.

327
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,699
It's Scots Gaelic from <i>uisce beat ha</i>.

328
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,016
You don't say.

329
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,291
What gives this particular brand
its distinctive smoothness,

330
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:23,485
it's distilled from both potato and corn.

331
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,339
It is slightly alkaline.
Do you taste that?

332
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:30,051
Lower-shelf alcohol tends to be acidic.

333
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:32,804
The chief distiller learned the process
from his grandfather.

334
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:34,997
And now you learned it
by stealing it out of his brain.

335
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:44,506
How long do I have left
before you turn me into a worker bee?

336
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,136
It's a hard thing to predict.

337
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:51,906
Scientific advances tend to ebb and flow.

338
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,391
That's not an answer. How long?

339
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:57,769
We're working round the clock.

340
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:03,400
It could be as soon as a couple weeks,
or it could take months or longer.

341
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:09,156
That's quite the range for someone who
knows everything that there is to know.

342
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:15,954
Regardless, sooner or later, I'm fucked.

343
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:20,667
Sorry, Carol.
We have a biological imperative.

344
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,855
You people make no goddamn sense.

345
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:24,963
Do you know that?

346
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:28,193
"We wanna make you happy," you say.

347
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:30,862
"Your life is your own," you say.

348
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:34,973
And "agency."
I've got all this agency, b-but...

349
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:39,228
I mean,
I guess I have agency just until I don't?

350
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:42,314
Carol...

351
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:47,086
if you were walking by a lake,
and you saw somebody drowning,

352
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,904
would you throw 'em a life preserver?

353
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:50,965
Of course you would.

354
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:55,470
You wouldn't think, you wouldn't wait,
you wouldn't try to get consensus on it.

355
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:57,579
You'd just throw it.

356
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,000
So now I'm drowning?

357
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:04,878
You just don't know it.

358
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:12,511
Well, uh... ...you people
are brainwashed, is what you are.

359
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:18,809
I mean... ...what could possibly
be so great about this mind meld of yours?

360
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:23,164
Actually, let me guess. It's, uh...

361
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:26,876
it's all beautiful scenery,
and you feel nothing but contentment.

362
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:33,072
Just wave after wave of bliss and peace
and everything is perfect.

363
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:38,536
It's-It's like living inside a postcard,
every second of every day.

364
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:42,392
Basically, it's every Rick Steves special
ever, right?

365
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,476
That kind of bullshit?

366
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,521
Like you're... you're, uh, taking a hike
in the woods, and there's a warm rain,

367
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:52,443
and the trees are so tall
you-you can't even see the tops.

368
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:56,114
Or you're having coffee
on the canals in Amsterdam,

369
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:59,200
and it's like you're
in a coffee commercial.

370
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:04,646
Or you're taking a walk at sunset
on the most flawless beach in Croatia.

371
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:08,984
Or you're in Norway,
above the Arctic Circle in...

372
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:13,447
In a hotel made of ice.

373
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:16,783
Under a pile of furs.

374
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:32,633
I told you that Helen was off-limits.

375
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,562
You are a bunch of mind-fuckers.

376
00:35:57,449 --> 00:36:00,661
Wow, you got this thing
really jammed in there, don't you?

377
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,849
Please, be careful with that.

378
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:07,543
Right. Like you would give me
a real hand grenade.

379
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,421
Carol, if we may?

380
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,085
You-You gave me...

381
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:02,031
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Fuck.

382
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:03,140
Uh...

383
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,202
Oh, fuck.

384
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:14,502
Shit.

385
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:17,422
Uh, okay.
I-I-I'm gonna go get some help, okay?

386
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,757
It's okay, Carol.

387
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:21,617
Help is coming.

388
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,378
May we join you?

389
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:23,780
We're happy to say
Zosia's doing much better.

390
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:26,866
There was some blood loss,
but no real nerve damage.

391
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,310
She did get a pretty severe concussion
that we're gonna wanna keep an eye on.

392
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:32,396
She's resting now.

393
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:36,441
Can we get you a-a fresh
change of clothes?

394
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:44,032
Carol, your quick thinking
really saved the day.

395
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:50,581
Why would you give me a hand grenade?

396
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:52,416
You asked for one.

397
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,043
Why not give me a fake one?

398
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:58,005
Oh.

399
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,507
Sorry if we got that wrong, Carol.

400
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:08,116
If I asked right now,
would you give me another hand grenade?

401
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,308
Yes.

402
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,245
Even after last night,
you would give me another?

403
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:13,604
Oh, sure.

404
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:19,026
Okay, what about a bazooka?

405
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:22,905
And the thing a bazooka shoots?
A rocket, or whatever.

406
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,341
Yes.

407
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,201
All right.

408
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:29,786
All right.

409
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:31,872
What about...

410
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:35,375
I don't know, a tank?

411
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:38,337
Mm-hmm.

412
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:44,092
What about an atom bomb?

413
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:48,722
Why would you want one?

414
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:50,325
To blow shit up?

415
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,243
For kicks. I mean, does it matter?

416
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:54,937
You gave me a grenade, for fuck's sake.

417
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:05,197
It'd be okay to say no at this point.

418
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:07,282
That would be sane.

419
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:10,786
Not utterly batshit crazy.

420
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:16,959
If you truly wanted a nuclear weapon,

421
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:21,731
we would weigh the pros and cons with you.

422
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:25,109
Uh, we would explain
that it would be very destructive, uh...

423
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,718
Yes or no?

424
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:30,639
Ultimately...

425
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:32,933
yes.

426
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:35,936
Wouldn't necessarily feel good about it.

427
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:42,651
But we would move heaven and earth
to make you happy, Carol.

428
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:48,824
Would you like an atom bomb?

429
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:53,745
I'm gonna have to get back to you on that.

430
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:59,352
Okay. Okay.

431
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,461
Oh, would you like a cup of coffee?

432
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:05,132
Uh, one sugar, with oat milk, right?

433
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:07,509
-And maybe a-a pinch of, uh...
-You can go.
