1
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,195
Hello!

2
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,031
You okay?

3
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,117
Sorry, we didn't mean to startle you.

4
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,932
We wouldn't have intruded
but, if you don't mind us saying,

5
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,375
maybe you could slow
down and take a break.

6
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,313
You've been at it for two hours straight.

7
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,023
You people are spying on me.

8
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,192
No. You just happened to
be outdoors this morning.

9
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,653
How? Where? Where
are you watching me from?

10
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,138
- An mq-9 reaper.
- A what?

11
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,849
It's an air force drone. It's...

12
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,523
I don't see anything.

13
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:58,403
Yeah, no, you wouldn't really.
It's way up at 40,000 feet.

14
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,864
It's not dangerous. It's not even armed.

15
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,536
Sorry. Bad idea. It's leaving.

16
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,375
Please? We'd feel so
much better if you'd hydrate.

17
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:12,960
What's in it?

18
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:14,646
Water.

19
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,673
And what else? Something that's
gonna make me turn into one of you?

20
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,717
No, we're months away
from knowing how to do that.

21
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,283
Jarmell gurky says it's okay.

22
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,952
Who is jarmell gurky?

23
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,163
He's a bottling line
supervisor in Winston-Salem.

24
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,499
He was running the second
shift at the aquafina plant

25
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,316
when this got filled on may 8th.

26
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,820
To the best of his knowledge,
it's just good clean water.

27
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,884
Why are you standing in my yard talking

28
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,536
about whatever the fuck
it is you're talking about?

29
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,496
Who are you?

30
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,225
Someone we thought you might like.

31
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,477
Not so much. No.

32
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,271
Sorry about that, Carol.

33
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,006
Regardless, you are on
the verge of heat exhaustion,

34
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,968
and that's the opinion of
every medical doctor on earth.

35
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:05,804
How about it?

36
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,630
You have water in the
house. Please drink some.

37
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:41,924
And maybe pace yourself.

38
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,886
We can see we're upsetting you.

39
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,504
Wait.

40
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:03,612
Stop.

41
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:14,933
You're gonna need a pickax by the way.

42
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,976
There's a lot of volcanic rock in that soil.

43
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,380
Your neighbor Martin at 1204 has one
in his garage, along with a sun hat and

44
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:22,965
work gloves.

45
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,888
Wait right here. Don't move.

46
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,163
What the hell is this?

47
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,126
Are you supposed to be
my character raban? Why?

48
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,212
If we chose poorly, we apologize.

49
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,882
We just want you to be happy.

50
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,466
Why raban as a woman?

51
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,182
My original version of him was a her.

52
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,184
But I talked myself out of it.

53
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,979
And we never told anyone.

54
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,816
Helen and I were the
only ones who knew.

55
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,298
So if you can't read minds...

56
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:32,385
Carol, you may find this
hard to believe but yesterday

57
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:36,413
was the greatest day in
the history of humanity.

58
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,099
Helen thought so too.

59
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,602
No. Helen is not one of you.

60
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,770
She joined us before she passed.

61
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,898
She's gone but all of her thoughts,

62
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,590
her memories, they're right here.

63
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,612
Should we tell you how
much she loved you?

64
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:53,430
You bunch of ghouls!

65
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:58,769
You are a goddamn bunch
of grave-robbing psychopaths!

66
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,998
You are the reason she is dead!

67
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,666
And now you're gonna speak for her?

68
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,402
Fuck you! Fuck every single one of you!

69
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,960
Jeez.

70
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,388
Hello?

71
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,558
Anybody?

72
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:40,870
Is anybody there?

73
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,771
Hello? Are you still there?

74
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:48,527
Fuck.

75
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:27,024
Shit.

76
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,861
Shit.

77
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,418
Jesus Christ! What's...

78
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,504
Okay.

79
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:56,362
What... my god, I... Hang on.

80
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,198
Here we go. Here we go.

81
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,325
Okay. I'm gonna bring you down.

82
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,368
All right. Down, down, down!

83
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,437
Shit! Sorry. Sorry.

84
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,040
Hang on.

85
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,525
No, no. No, no. No. What...

86
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,069
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.

87
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,548
No, no. Come on, come on.

88
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,157
Fucking piece of shit!

89
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,413
Down, down, down, down. Down.

90
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,416
Goddamn it!

91
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,257
Fuck. Come on. Fucking shit...

92
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,093
- Carol?
- Fu...

93
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,848
we can take it from here, if you like.

94
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:46,979
I was just trying to... We know, Carol.

95
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,147
We're all right.

96
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,734
Thank you.

97
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,887
<i>Hi, Carol. How may we help you?</i>

98
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,324
The pirate lady can
come back if she wants.

99
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,242
<i>Absolutely. She'll be right over.</i>

100
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,546
<i>Is there anything else we can...</i>

101
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,607
Carol?

102
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:02,781
Was that me? Did I make
everybody freeze like that?

103
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,285
We're affected by your emotions.

104
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,012
The negative ones,

105
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:12,040
if they're directed right at us,
they can be a little tough to take.

106
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:16,437
So, how many people
did I hurt just now?

107
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:19,631
Please. That is not how you
should look at this. Not at all.

108
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:21,758
Did anybody die?

109
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:29,766
How many?

110
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,774
Worldwide? It's a few.

111
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:40,903
Dozens?

112
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:46,575
Hundreds?

113
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,774
There is a quicker
way if you're open to it?

114
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:30,739
The astronauts up in the
space station, are they like you?

115
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:33,367
They are.

116
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,536
They're on their way back.

117
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,167
And everybody at the south
pole and on nuclear submarines?

118
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,397
Missile silos? Area 51?

119
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,506
Yes.

120
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,218
We made a point of
reaching them early on.

121
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:53,679
That's kind of the best way to do it.

122
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,033
How many people like me
in the world did you say?

123
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:58,284
Eleven others?

124
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,602
Actually, now there are 12.

125
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:05,482
There's a gentleman in Paraguay
whom we became aware of this morning.

126
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:09,278
Were any of them hurt today when I...

127
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,240
Did any of them get hurt?

128
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,118
There was just one minor injury.

129
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,997
Mostly there was consternation.

130
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,124
They're okay.

131
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,965
These 12, how many speak English?

132
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,111
Five either as a second
or third language.

133
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:35,113
I want to meet those five.

134
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:38,324
Communication wouldn't
be an issue for the 13 of you.

135
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:39,933
- We can translate.
- Nope.

136
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,311
Just the English speakers.

137
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,330
We'll have to ask their permission.

138
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,689
Fine. Ask.

139
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,025
The sooner the better.

140
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:58,636
Shit. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey!

141
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,889
Are you there? Can you hear me?

142
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:01,997
We can hear you.

143
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:05,834
All five say yes.

144
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:03,326
How you doin' back here, Carol?

145
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,686
- Is there anything that we can get you?
- I'm good.

146
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:07,312
Just...

147
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,335
You're more than welcome to
sit up front with us, if you'd like.

148
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,027
You could take the controls.

149
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,839
It's fun.

150
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:20,200
Who's flying this thing?
That gal from tgi Fridays?

151
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:22,369
Maybe just concentrate on her.

152
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,665
Well, let us know if
there's anything you need.

153
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:40,363
Carol, this gathering today,
we have high hopes for it.

154
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,471
Great.

155
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:47,186
- But?
- But, as we say, your lives are your own.

156
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:50,063
Which means what?

157
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:53,567
We can't really protect
you from one another.

158
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:00,407
We'll be landing in Bilbao in 40 minutes.

159
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,502
- Where did you come from?
- Did you have to travel far?

160
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,504
- Yeah. I had a good time. Yes.
- Peru.

161
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:39,088
- And you?
- China.

162
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,198
I have some pictures. It's very beautiful.

163
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,039
Yes. It's my first time
outside of my country.

164
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:51,917
It was a bit long.

165
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:16,835
Would it be acceptable to
everyone if we continue in English?

166
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:17,919
- Yeah.
- Of course.

167
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:19,361
- Sure.
- Wonderful.

168
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:23,448
Sorry. I was just in the...

169
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:27,995
Doesn't matter.

170
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:29,872
Hi.

171
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,958
Hi. I'm Carol.

172
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,211
Hello. Otgonbayar.

173
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,022
Pleased to meet you.

174
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,315
Otgonbayar.

175
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,134
- Otgonbayar.
- Otgonbayar. Okay. Pleased to meet you.

176
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,822
My name is xiu Mei. Hello.

177
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,740
Hello, xiu Mei.

178
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,057
I'm Carol.

179
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,245
Kusimayu.

180
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,497
Kusimayu, that's a lovely name.

181
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:56,607
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

182
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:58,358
And...

183
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:00,736
I'm laxmi.

184
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:02,487
Laxmi.

185
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:06,408
Great to meet you.
Great to meet all of you.

186
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:13,415
Wow. Just... wow, right?

187
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,335
This is such a relief.

188
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,655
Do you know who these guys are?

189
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,365
Hello, Carol.

190
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,783
We're family members.

191
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,727
This individual is byamba,
otgonbayar's daughter.

192
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:38,917
Hi, Carol. This individual is neu
xiansheng, xiu Mei's husband.

193
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:41,503
T'ika, kusimayu's aunt.

194
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:43,713
Sisa, kusimayu's cousin.

195
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,757
Aarush, laxmi's husband.

196
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:48,801
Padma, mother of laxmi. And this is...

197
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,036
Ravi, laxmi's nine-year-old son.

198
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:53,705
We're very pleased to meet you, Carol.

199
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:57,894
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

200
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,002
Yep.

201
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,317
Wait a second.

202
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:06,945
Including me, I thought there
was supposed to be six of us.

203
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,428
I only count five.

204
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,450
Number six is a
gentleman from Mauritania.

205
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:16,103
He requested a specific
aircraft which took a bit longer.

206
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:21,149
Mister koumba diabaté invites
you aboard his plane once it arrives.

207
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,069
He thinks it'll prove
suitable for your gathering.

208
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,604
Hello, hello!

209
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:04,693
<i>Bienvenue à bord!</i>

210
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,716
It was available to whoever asked.

211
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:37,994
<i>Bonjour, enchanté.</i>

212
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,537
I am koumba diabaté.

213
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:42,147
<i>Bonjour</i>. Carol sturka. Nice plane.

214
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:48,028
<i>Je suis Ravi de vous avoir à bord.</i>

215
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:50,965
Welcome to Spain, Mr. Diabaté.

216
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:55,053
We hope your flight was most pleasant.

217
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:57,746
How could it be otherwise?

218
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,709
But please tell me, what brings
you aboard air force koumba?

219
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,587
She was available to whoever asked.

220
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,800
Welcome aboard, Carol.

221
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,554
This plane has upstairs.

222
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,119
Yeah.

223
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:25,815
This they call the "nuclear football."
With it, one could blow up the world.

224
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,628
I am joking. I do not
think it works anymore.

225
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:30,737
But don't drop it!

226
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:32,465
Again, a joke.

227
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,550
- Heavy.
- Which is fitting.

228
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:37,262
Anything capable of blowing up the
world needs to have some heft to it,

229
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:38,370
don't you think?

230
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,005
Excuse me, excuse me.

231
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,049
That was my first question to them.

232
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,719
Hey, guys! Excuse me.

233
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,346
Everyone?

234
00:34:57,222 --> 00:35:00,142
May we have your attention? Please?

235
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:04,730
Thank you very much.

236
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:09,735
So... I think we're all good here.

237
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:16,384
Family members,
beautiful women, pirate lady.

238
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:19,036
You can all just go
wait out on the tarmac.

239
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:23,600
Why should my family have to leave?

240
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:24,809
Yes, why?

241
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:28,229
We need to talk amongst
ourselves, just the six of us.

242
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:30,172
That's why we're here, right?

243
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:40,658
Wait. Pirate lady.

244
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:45,788
Are there any microphones
in here or recording devices?

245
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:48,374
There's a built-in system
that came with the aircraft.

246
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:50,108
We can make sure it's turned off.

247
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,344
I did not know that was there.

248
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:00,869
You have complete privacy.

249
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:02,829
Call us if you need us.

250
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:21,950
Actually, if you recall,

251
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:24,035
Harrison Ford never
rode in the escape pod

252
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,829
which I thought was a clever gambit.

253
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:27,956
- He stayed behind in the cargo hold.
- So,

254
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,690
what are we gonna do about this?

255
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:41,618
Anyone have any training
in biology? Or genetics?

256
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,499
Anybody a doctor? A medical doctor?

257
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:54,006
Any backgrounds in
science? Of any kind?

258
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:00,888
Anybody build a volcano?

259
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:11,982
All right.

260
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:15,819
I don't know how we do this.

261
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:18,780
I don't know where we begin.

262
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:20,657
But

263
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:22,951
it's up to us now.

264
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:26,723
The future of humanity is in our hands.

265
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:29,642
As scary as that sounds, it is.

266
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:33,170
It is up to us to put the world right.

267
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:42,304
Why?

268
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,701
Why save the world? Is that...

269
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:48,661
Wait, is... that's your question?

270
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,229
Why does the world need saving?

271
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:53,649
At present, the situation
seems very nice.

272
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,569
Cool plane. Really.

273
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,423
Meanwhile, everybody everywhere else

274
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,843
has turned into some kind
of fucking pod person. Right?

275
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:06,054
And it does not matter
how nice they are to us

276
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:10,058
or how many supermodels they
send to peel our grapes and jerk us off,

277
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:14,938
that does not change the
fact that this is not right.

278
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:17,005
I've seen this movie.

279
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,442
We've all seen this movie.

280
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,635
And we know it does not end well.

281
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:25,848
Are you the one who lost her temper
and made them all stop moving?

282
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:33,188
When you did this, I
was in an automobile.

283
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:35,274
My grandfather was driving.

284
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:39,361
The automobile crashed,
and my grandfather died.

285
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,241
I'm...

286
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:49,705
I'm sorry. I didn't... She
not know they do that.

287
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,582
Nobody know.

288
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,252
And it won't happen again.

289
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,338
I don't know. You seem very angry.

290
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:02,050
I'm very sorry you lost your grandfather.

291
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,554
But the rest of your
family waiting outside,

292
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:08,765
you've lost them too.

293
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,286
Everybody understands that, right?

294
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:15,498
Your husbands, wives,
parents, children...

295
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,333
They're not them anymore.

296
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:19,460
My child is still my child.

297
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:20,587
Very much so.

298
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,422
That cute little boy we just met?

299
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:26,176
The one who can perform open-heart
surgery and fly the space shuttle?

300
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,552
Yep, he's right as rain.

301
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,053
You listen.

302
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,805
That is my child out there.

303
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:33,850
He is also your prime minister,

304
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:37,770
some guy you dated in high school,
your gynecologist. Think about that.

305
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:40,273
You... you are a horrible person.

306
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:42,442
Okay, who is the angry one now?

307
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:44,652
Guys, I'm not looking for a fight here.

308
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,387
I'm just trying to make a
point that this whole thing...

309
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,825
We have to do something.

310
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:52,142
Do what?

311
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,651
I am not convinced things
are as bad as you say.

312
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:08,325
As we speak, no one is
being robbed or murdered.

313
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:10,661
No one is in prison.

314
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:16,375
The color of one's skin, by
all accounts, now meaningless.

315
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:21,088
All zoos are empty. All
dogs are off their chains.

316
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:25,300
Peace on earth.

317
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,221
Assuming that's even true...

318
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,560
Ask yourselves what's been lost.

319
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:39,958
Why zoos are empty?

320
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:43,253
They emptied them. Everywhere.

321
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:45,171
They let loose all the animal.

322
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:47,823
Beijing zoo is near my house.

323
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:53,346
I look outside, I see giraffe
eat all the leaf off my tree.

324
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:58,709
I say, "shoo. Shoo. Go.
Go." It do not listen to me.

325
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:06,341
I tell you this. I do not give away my dog.

326
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:10,738
Apparently, when it came
to the lions and the tigers,

327
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:12,782
they suffered quite a few maulings.

328
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:15,309
Can we just stick with
talking about the people?

329
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:21,481
What's going to happen when they
figure out how to turn us into them?

330
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:24,985
That is what I want.

331
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:28,423
I want to be with my aunt.

332
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:30,407
I want to be with my cousin.

333
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:35,346
Honey. No, you don't. You
may think you do, but you don't.

334
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,556
Don't tell her how to think.

335
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,249
Could you just... please.

336
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:41,585
Look,

337
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,713
I know you are...

338
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:51,094
Lonely and scared and this whole thing...

339
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:55,307
Is terribly confusing.

340
00:41:57,935 --> 00:41:59,269
Believe me, I know.

341
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,106
But everything about you that's you,

342
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:08,171
everything that is personal
and individual and special...

343
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:12,991
If we let this happen, you
won't have that anymore.

344
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:16,846
I'll have it. I'll share it.

345
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,247
What did they tell you?

346
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:20,350
What kind of promises did they make?

347
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:21,583
No promise.

348
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,086
They only tell me what it's like.

349
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:27,965
You don't think it sounds wonderful?

350
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,135
You don't ask them what it's like?

351
00:42:32,928 --> 00:42:33,905
No.

352
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:36,241
How could you not
ask them what it's like?

353
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:38,851
Raise your hand if you asked them.

354
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:45,583
You sit there and you tell us
we must do this, we must do that.

355
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:47,710
But you don't even
bother to educate yourself.

356
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:50,112
Why should we listen
to anything you say?

357
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:54,050
Because I'm smart enough to
know you don't ask a drug dealer

358
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,951
to describe their heroin.

359
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:59,788
Now, what are we gonna do here?

360
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:02,457
I'm open to suggestions.

361
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:09,590
Who's hungry?

362
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:13,719
I, myself, am famished.

363
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:23,187
Hello, good people.

364
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,481
We are interested in lunch!

365
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:44,124
Voilà.

366
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:48,629
Is this...

367
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:52,674
<i>Poulet yassa!</i>

368
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:55,552
<i>Incroyable.</i>

369
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:05,437
Exactly like my <i>tantine</i> awa
made it when I was a child!

370
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:09,000
However, and I'm not
complaining mind you...

371
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:10,585
I did order lobster.

372
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:11,836
We apologize.

373
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,782
We searched a wide radius, but the
only lobster currently available is live.

374
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:20,118
We don't kill.

375
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,622
Not even a lobster?

376
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:29,062
Your chicken, fish, beef,
veggies are the freshest

377
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:30,963
we could find in the local markets.

378
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:33,423
We do hope you enjoy.

379
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,530
So, you are vegetarian?

380
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:00,117
That would be our preference, yes.

381
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:03,137
What if I wanted escargot?

382
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:05,056
Surely you can kill snails.

383
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,349
No.

384
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:07,892
A wasp even?

385
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:12,647
If it's about to sting, you don't... Kill it?

386
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:13,755
No.

387
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:16,258
What if you step on tiny...

388
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,528
Insect.

389
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:21,072
If you step on tiny insect by accident?

390
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:22,615
We try not to.

391
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,076
We can't purposely end life.

392
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,369
It's not in our nature.

393
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:30,606
Well, hip-fuckin'-hooray for you.

394
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:42,659
They won't step on a bug, but
they'll enslave an entire planet.

395
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:45,221
Yeah, that makes sense.

396
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:48,975
Our joining is very much
the antithesis of slavery.

397
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:50,560
If you're gonna hit me, hit me.

398
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:51,668
Your "joining"?

399
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:56,524
All the marketing brains on earth,
and that's what you came up with? Wow.

400
00:45:56,548 --> 00:45:58,860
There is a better word for it in celtiberian.

401
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:01,887
Well, I don't remember
you asking anyone.

402
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:07,643
I don't recall anybody getting a vote
on whether or not they wanted a joining.

403
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:10,455
We ourselves have no choice.

404
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,856
For us, it's a biological imperative.

405
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,709
Like breathing.

406
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:19,756
But every time, one comes to
understand how wonderful it feels...

407
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,301
How many fucking people died
during your wonderful fucking joining?

408
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:25,827
Must you curse so much?

409
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:28,247
There is a child present.

410
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,851
I'm sorry, Ravi.

411
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:32,936
I apologize.

412
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,670
It's quite all right.

413
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:36,964
Tell me, Ravi.

414
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:42,487
For a pelvic exam, what kind of
speculum do you prefer, metal or plastic?

415
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:43,595
What?

416
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:46,139
It would depend.

417
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,827
- Both have their uses.
- No, stop it.

418
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:50,870
But, I mean, you probably
wouldn't do a palpation, right?

419
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:52,622
You know, not with
those tiny little fingers.

420
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:54,207
How dare you?

421
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:55,959
How many people died?

422
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:58,527
We didn't intend for anyone to die.

423
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:01,381
And for the first month, no one did.

424
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:06,052
We would bring in newcomers
individually, thousands every day.

425
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:08,370
It was all very peaceful.

426
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:10,682
But, then the military discovered us.

427
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:14,185
And to avoid even more bloodshed,
we had to accelerate the process.

428
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:15,752
So, how many?

429
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,426
How many people died?

430
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:36,815
886,477,591.

431
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:39,943
As of this moment.

432
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,655
Jesus Christ.

433
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,161
Wow...

434
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:53,373
I guess you gotta break a few eggs?

435
00:47:56,627 --> 00:48:00,297
You killed 11 million.

436
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:15,604
So...

437
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:20,710
What if I caught a fish?

438
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:25,239
Or say I procured a chicken
or a pig, and I myself did the...

439
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:27,157
What then?

440
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:32,746
We would mourn the
passing of all these creatures.

441
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:35,808
But you would cook them for me?

442
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:37,018
Yes.

443
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:38,252
Okay.

444
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,216
Are you gonna let her continue like this?

445
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:47,153
Carol.

446
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:52,599
After lunch we were thinking you all
might like a tour of the guggenheim.

447
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:54,786
It's a beautiful museum.

448
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,788
Frank gehry designed it.

449
00:48:56,812 --> 00:48:58,498
Yeah, Helen talked about it.

450
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:00,023
It was on our bucket list.

451
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:02,276
But you already know that, don't you?

452
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:04,754
All right.

453
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,089
Warm up my plane.

454
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:07,406
I'm going home.

455
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:09,867
Good riddance.

456
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:26,091
You, you, you, you...

457
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:31,889
And especially you,
have the time of your lives.

458
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:35,285
Enjoy it. Eat, drink and be merry.

459
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:38,371
Go to the guggenheim, Disneyland Paris,

460
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:41,416
wherever else these whacked-out
moonies take you next.

461
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,902
But know this, you are traitors.

462
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:50,324
You are traitors to the human race!

463
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:09,593
Carol?

464
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:12,179
Carol.

465
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,806
Get off... get off me.

466
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:17,619
Get off me.

467
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:21,039
Get the fuck off me! You fucking freaks!

468
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:24,024
Get the fuck... Get off!

469
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:35,452
God, no. No, no, no, no. No.

470
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:50,193
Ravi?

471
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,678
Ravi. Ravi.

472
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:14,235
<i>Good morning, Carol.</i>

473
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:15,737
<i>We hope you slept well.</i>

474
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:17,346
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

475
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:21,016
How are you feeling?

476
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:23,060
<i>We couldn't be better.</i>

477
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:25,187
<i>Thank you for asking.</i>

478
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,774
<i>May we get you anything?</i>

479
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:36,240
You got anything to
make me stop doing this?

480
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:39,785
<i>We don't. Sorry.</i>

481
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:43,163
<i>But how about something to eat?</i>

482
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,834
<i>We can make you some
great bacon and eggs.</i>

483
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:53,608
<i>Remember your trip to the inn
at little Washington, fall of 1998?</i>

484
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:57,070
<i>They served that pepper
bacon you still talk about.</i>

485
00:52:57,094 --> 00:52:58,988
<i>We flew it in for you.</i>

486
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:01,533
<i>And your favorite crispy
brioche from les crayères.</i>

487
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:05,519
How bad did I screw
things up with the other five?

488
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:09,398
Did they leave?

489
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:13,151
<i>All but one.</i>

490
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:44,766
This is the finest Martini
I have ever tasted.

491
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:54,818
Good morning, Carol.

492
00:53:56,153 --> 00:53:57,154
Carol.

493
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:58,864
How are you feeling?

494
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:04,470
Better than I should for being the
biggest mass murderer since Stalin.

495
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:07,473
I don't think these fine
people see it that way.

496
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:09,041
No.

497
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,114
Please, have a seat.

498
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:25,265
Some coffee, perhaps?

499
00:54:34,191 --> 00:54:37,212
That guggenheim is really worth a visit.

500
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:39,005
Stunning architecture.

501
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:40,447
You wanted to talk to me?

502
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:42,115
Yes.

503
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:46,221
I am headed to Las Vegas, Nevada.

504
00:54:46,245 --> 00:54:48,181
Have you been there?

505
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:49,891
Looking for hotel recommendations?

506
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:51,184
No, no, no, no.

507
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,228
I am staying at the west gate.

508
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:56,689
I will occupy the penthouse
of Mr. Elvis Presley.

509
00:54:56,713 --> 00:54:58,566
Yeah, that sounds about right.

510
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,592
Some say it is haunted by his ghost.

511
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:02,386
This intrigues me.

512
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:03,929
Okay.

513
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:07,283
Well, give Elvis my regards.

514
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:13,021
And, if it is acceptable to you I
wish for zosia to accompany me.

515
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:17,210
She suggested I ask. I
believe she needs your blessing.

516
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:18,360
Who's zosia?

517
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:21,822
Your chaperone.

518
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:27,369
Accompany you for what?

519
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,835
Jesus Christ.

520
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:37,522
I'm s... what can I say?

521
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:41,008
In the past day, I've spent
time with her, gotten to know her.

522
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:43,010
Learned her name.

523
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:45,572
I feel we made a connection.

524
00:55:45,596 --> 00:55:46,889
Can I ask a question?

525
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:51,810
What is wrong with you?

526
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:55,415
Is it a medical condition?

527
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:59,669
- That it can't just...
- Stay in. - I apologize.

528
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:01,403
Clearly I have struck a nerve.

529
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:04,048
If she is your companion...

530
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:06,718
She's not my anything.
None of them are.

531
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:09,304
They are a bunch of
brain-damaged incompetents

532
00:56:09,328 --> 00:56:11,246
but you keep sticking your dick in them.

533
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,671
Zosia, would you join us, please?

534
00:56:29,598 --> 00:56:31,683
Have I behaved in an untoward fashion?

535
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:35,103
Have I shown you... any of you...

536
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:40,275
Affection that was in
any way unwelcome?

537
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:44,780
For us, affection is always welcome.

538
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:52,889
Zosia, what is the
square root of 46,279?

539
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:54,516
Okay to round it off?

540
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,583
Just a bit over 215.

541
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:59,646
I have a strong sense that is correct.

542
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,130
Okay. Let me see if I've got this straight.

543
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:06,528
Casanova mcboner here
wants you to join his harem,

544
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:10,514
which is hunky-dory with you,
provided I give you my permission?

545
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:14,685
That's your idea of paradise?

546
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:17,789
- Being used like some sex doll?
- Hey.

547
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:20,083
- And I'm what, your pimp?
- That is completely uncalled for.

548
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:21,459
You're completely uncalled for.

549
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:23,920
- The entire fucking world is ending...
- Carol.

550
00:57:23,944 --> 00:57:25,964
And instead of doing the right
thing and trying to help me,

551
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:28,883
- you'd rather run around, sticking your...
- please! The last thing these people need

552
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:31,159
is you losing your temper.

553
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:43,922
You wanna go with him... go with him.

554
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:49,344
Please, work this out yourselves.

555
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:52,931
- We can't choose.
- Yes, you can.

556
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:55,976
If you can do square roots in
your head, you can make choices.

557
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:59,897
And there's a whole third option,
where you just tell us both to piss off.

558
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:05,402
If we were to choose,
it would hurt one of you.

559
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:09,990
We can't do that.

560
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:22,878
Perhaps I have not seen
the movies you spoke of.

561
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:28,717
But to me, this does not
feel like the end of the world.

562
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:40,312
Ca...

563
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,860
Stop! Open the door!
