1
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,620
-Hello?
-<i>How dare you make my son cry.</i>

2
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,247
Laxmi?

3
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,624
You made everyone cry.

4
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,627
And you gave your chaperone
a heart attack. What is wrong with you?

5
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,464
First of all, I don't have a chaperone,
so stop calling her that.

6
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,675
Second of all, Zosia's gonna be fine,
thank you for asking.

7
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,220
-<i>And third of all...</i>
-Why do you do such things?

8
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:35,513
Are you mentally unsound?

9
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:40,100
Third of all,
I learned something important.

10
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,269
Laxmi, I think that
there might be a way to fix...

11
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,230
You do not ever make my son cry again.

12
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,033
Hey, if Miss Sunshine asks
for my phone number again,

13
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,618
you tell her to pound sand.

14
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,935
She's gonna be all right, isn't she?

15
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,058
She's gonna be fine.

16
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:36,879
Hello?

17
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,646
Anybody here?

18
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,236
-<i>Hello, Carol.</i>
-Hey.

19
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,563
-Where did everybody...
-<i>This is a recording.</i>

20
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,992
<i>At the tone, you can leave a message
to request anything you might need.</i>

21
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,660
<i>We'll do our best to provide it.</i>

22
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,540
<i>Our feelings for you
haven't changed, Carol.</i>

23
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:16,543
<i>But after everything that's happened,
we just need a little space.</i>

24
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,356
Come on.

25
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,169
Are you fucking kidding me?

26
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,048
Fine.

27
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,218
{\an8}Good riddance!

28
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:51,889
{\an8}Fuck you!

29
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,486
Afflicted... Afflicted people.

30
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:00,434
To my 12 fellow survivors, greetings.

31
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,186
I'm Carol Sturka.

32
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,272
Some of you know me.
Some of you I've yet to meet.

33
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,024
But...

34
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,266
if you're still one of us...

35
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,070
then this message is for you.

36
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,576
There is a way to undo this situation.

37
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,413
To turn the world back
the way it's supposed to be.

38
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,501
How do I know this?

39
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,421
Because earlier today,

40
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:33,759
these afflicted people, these Others,
they basically told me so themselves.

41
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,555
Because guess what? They can't lie.

42
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,147
Which is yet another thing
I've discovered.

43
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,062
This alien virus, or...

44
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:49,733
whatever it is,
it doesn't allow them to do that.

45
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:55,280
So, what is this solution exactly?

46
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,325
That they didn't tell me.

47
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:05,415
But they so resisted telling me,
that everybody suddenly burst into tears.

48
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,460
Worldwide, apparently.

49
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,447
Which I know upset at least one of you.

50
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:16,844
And then after that, they completely
abandoned the city I live in.

51
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,264
Leaving me here all alone.

52
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,184
Which says to me I'm on the right track.

53
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:29,857
Now, I realize some of you

54
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,151
think the world might be
better off this way,

55
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,488
with all the newfound peace,
love and understanding.

56
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,116
Enjoy that opinion.

57
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,285
Relish it.

58
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,370
Because it may be
the last one you ever possess.

59
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,332
And when the day comes

60
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,585
that you have peace and love
forced upon you, who knows,

61
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,837
maybe in that last fleeting moment

62
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:56,633
you might just realize
you treasured your individuality.

63
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,388
Please, let's work together.

64
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,432
The 13 of us.

65
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,030
'Cause it's gonna take
everything we've got.

66
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,063
But these people need saving.

67
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,234
We owe it to humanity.

68
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,239
Call me anytime, day or night.

69
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,701
Good luck and godspeed.

70
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,432
<i>Hello, Carol.</i>

71
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,016
<i>This is a recording.</i>

72
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:50,438
<i>At the tone, you can leave a message
to request anything you might need.</i>

73
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,149
-Yes, yes.
-<i>We'll do our best to provide it.</i>

74
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,608
-<i>Our feelings for you...</i>
-Got it.

75
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,068
-<i>...haven't changed, Carol.</i>
-Got it.

76
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,492
-Got it.
-<i>But after everything that's happened,</i>

77
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:00,614
-<i>we just need a little space.</i>
-Got it.

78
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:03,868
It's Carol.

79
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,452
I've made a video.

80
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,163
You're not gonna like it.

81
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,707
However, I want you to make 12 copies

82
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,835
and distribute them
to all of the other people like me.

83
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,336
And for those that don't speak English,

84
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,006
I want you to subtitle what I say
word-for-word.

85
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,760
I certainly can't force you to do this.

86
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:24,847
However, you doing it would please me,
and I know you're into that.

87
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,601
And conversely, if you don't do it,

88
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,314
I can't be held responsible
for the biblically shitty mood

89
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,440
in which I will no doubt find myself.

90
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:41,488
So, I'm gonna leave it outside
on the curb, by a rock.

91
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:45,951
And I'll stay far, far away
'cause God knows you need your space.

92
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,855
No. No. No, no, no.

93
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,086
Hey!

94
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:27,506
Get out of here!

95
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,632
<i>Hello, Carol.</i>

96
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,718

<i>But after everything that's happened,
we just need a little space.</i>

101
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,446
I want the lights back on. All of them.

102
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,281
Everywhere.

103
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,158
Now.

104
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,390
<i>Hello, Carol.</i>

105
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,267
<i>This is a recording.</i>

106
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,229

<i>Our feelings for you
haven't changed, Carol.</i>

109
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,864
<i>But after everything that's happened,
we just need a little space.</i>

110
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,577
I need my trash picked up.

111
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,274
Hello.

112
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,234
<i>Hello, Carol.</i>

113
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:35,944
<i>This is a recording.</i>

114
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,657
<i>We can pick up your trash
as long as it's bagged,</i>

115
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,367
<i>and each bag weighs 17 pounds or less.</i>

116
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,662
<i>Please remove all bags from the bin</i>

117
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:47,998
<i>and place them on the curb
a minimum of two feet apart.</i>

118
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,166
<i>Thank you.</i>

119
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,055
You motherfuckers sure love your milk.

120
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:22,916
Hello!

121
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:32,843
Hello?

122
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,355
Shoo! Hey!

123
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:47,399
Shoo! Get out of there!

124
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,846
{\an8}Greetings, fellow survivors.

125
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,098
Carol Sturka here with an update.

126
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:03,809
Here where I live,
Albuquerque, New Mexico,

127
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:07,646
{\an8}they drink this
like it's going out of style.

128
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:10,941
These are little milk cartons,

129
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:13,443
the kind we give children
in elementary schools.

130
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:15,700
Back when we had elementary schools.

131
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,198
And children.

132
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:20,534
And, as you can see,
they seem to come in all kinds of flavors.

133
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:23,204
Plain, chocolate, strawberry, so on.

134
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:24,580
But the thing is,

135
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,749
it's not milk in any of them.

136
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:35,382
It is this one strange liquid.

137
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:42,598
And they make it
in this local dairy facility in my town.

138
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:44,975
Well, made. Past tense.

139
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,936
'Cause as I told you in my previous video,

140
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:49,688
they've shut everything down here
and abandoned me completely.

141
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,817
Which is... You know, whatever. Who cares?

142
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,654
But in this dairy,
they make this by mixing water

143
00:28:58,238 --> 00:28:59,281
into...

144
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:07,164
this white powdery stuff.

145
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,457
Can you see that?

146
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,042
Whatever that is.

147
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:13,504
And then the resulting liquid is
all they seem to consume.

148
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:16,089
Look around where you live.

149
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,428
I'll bet they are manufacturing
this in every city in the world.

150
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:24,306
Everywhere there's a spare dairy
or a bottling factory.

151
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,059
Maybe where you are, it doesn't come
in a carton, it comes in a can,

152
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:29,520
but either way, it's this.

153
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,814
So what is this?

154
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:37,570
What does it do to them
when they drink it?

155
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:40,864
Could it be that this is
how they're all staying connected?

156
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,326
Here's what I know so far.

157
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:47,120
It does not smell like anything.

158
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:52,835
But it's got this weird texture.

159
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,090
It's kind of like olive oil, but thinner.

160
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,053
That probably means something.

161
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,846
And I've got no idea
what makes it this color.

162
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,764
What would you call that? Amber?

163
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,891
Straw? Straw colored?

164
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,562
And I tested the pH. It is a 7.1,

165
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:12,938
which means...

166
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:14,731
Hang on, I have it marked.

167
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:16,275
It is

168
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:18,485
neutral.

169
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:21,655
Well, basically, it's neutral.

170
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,200
You know what else is neutral?

171
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:25,367
Celery.

172
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:28,620
And water, so...

173
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,165
Yeah.

174
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:39,423
And it does not contain chlorine.

175
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:41,675
So...

176
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:46,388
Anybody listening out there?

177
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:47,807
Huh? How about it, you 12?

178
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,433
Any response?

179
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:53,520
Are you even getting these?
'Cause how the fuck would I know?

180
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:34,103
Greetings, fellow survivors.

181
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:36,313
Carol Sturka here with an update.

00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,609
No.

183
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:06,570
No!

184
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,408
Get away from there!

185
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:13,994
Hey!

186
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:24,922
Fuck.

187
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:52,741
Why won't you fucking come loose?

188
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:31,632
Son of a bitch.

189
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:58,784
Son of a bitch.
