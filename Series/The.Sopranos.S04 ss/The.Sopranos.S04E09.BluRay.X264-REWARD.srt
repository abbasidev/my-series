2
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:44,686
Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes
the presentation of evidence for today.

3
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:48,690
I repeat my earlier admonition that you
not discuss the case among yourselves...

4
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,236
...or with anyone else, including media.

5
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,322
Your Honor, I have a logistical problem
to discuss.

6
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,491
I'd like to call a witness out of order.

7
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,287
Now I missed the Early Bird Special.

8
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,958
Took a half a chicken home
the other night. Got two meals out of it.

9
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,129
Mr. Soprano. Big bombshell
from the prosecution today...

10
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,757
...with testimony detailing misuse
of Joint Fitters' 401K funds.

11
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,759
- Your reaction?
- No comment.

12
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,596
- Mr. Soprano, Allison Pak, Channel 6.
- Allison, hi...

13
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,682
Corrado!

14
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,392
- Corrado!
- (ALL EXCLAIMING)

15
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,937
- Has he been shot?
- He got hit in the head by a boom.

16
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,940
I'm here at the federal courthouse
where reputed mob boss...

17
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:35,195
...Corrado Soprano just fell nine...
No, seven steps.

18
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:41,368
- Hey, how's our royal highness in there?
- She's doing good.

19
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,370
Lois, this is Carmela, my wife.

20
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,414
- Hi.
- Hi.

21
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:49,459
Great to see her run again. Had her first
full-speed workout this morning.

22
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,962
Go ahead, fourth stall down.
I'll be right there.

23
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,841
- What is that, a goat?
- Yeah, that's her friend.

24
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,889
- She ready for the Toboggan Handicap?
- Yeah.

25
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,020
Hello.

26
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:13,567
- She's something, isn't she?
- She is magnificent.

27
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,071
Yeah, that's a good girl.
You're feeling better, huh? Yeah.

28
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,908
You see that? When she saw you,
she came right over.

29
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,661
You know what she likes? She likes
when you rub her muzzle right here.

30
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,956
Right, Lady Pie? Yeah.

31
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,002
You ought to see her race.
She busts her heart to win.

32
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,132
You like the ponies. I'll take you.

33
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,642
Follow my finger.

34
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,895
He said they'll do this every hour.
Check the neurological.

35
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,440
You ought to go.
The family's on the way.

36
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,442

I gotta go. I gotta catch a plane.

41
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,670
I'll be back Monday.

42
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,215
- Feel better.
- Make sure Beppy gets my chicken home.

43
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,760
Corrado, you didn't get
to the Early Bird Special.

44
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,805
He was disoriented.
Scored low on his Folstein...

45
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,848
...but that's consistent with concussion.

46
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,518
We're gonna sue the goddamn
Justice Department!

47
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,813
His CAT scan's negative, so,
so far so good.

48
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,358
He, I don't know...
He didn't seem like himself.

49
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,111
He could've been working
on a dementia for a while...

50
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,862
...and the blow tipped him over.

51
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,240
- You mean Alzheimer's?
- That's one form of it.

52
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,325
That's why we want to keep him here.

53
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,370
Listen, good chance
this could all go away.

54
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,122
Bobby.

55
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,208
- Where is he?
- They took him down for an x-ray.

56
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,918
We gotta get him into the city.

57
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:59,298

The best.

Why don't you take it easy?

59
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,471
- Had to be Paulie told Johnny.
- You think so?

60
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,765
He hates my success.

61
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,270
I been thinking about
that birthday dinner.

62
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,565
Who was there when I told
the Ginny Sack joke?

63
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,651
Not Paulie. I remember Albert saying
he didn't get a gift.

64
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,821
It was Little Paulie,
the witless fucking nephew.

65
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,615
He told Paulie, Paulie tells Johnny.

66

- You have a son, Peter Paul?
- Oh, my God. What happened?

He's all right, but I'm afraid
he's in a little trouble.

80

We found him in a public men's room
in Lafayette Park.

81

I don't know how to put this delicately.
He was sucking a Cub Scout's dick.

Ma'am, I wish that was all.

84
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,564

surgery performed upon arrival...

of a small rodent in the rectal passage.

- A gerbil, ma'am.

- Better?

168
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,153
It's the least we could do.

169
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,413
Ralph?

170
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:35,420
- Rosalie. Oh, Jesus.
- I didn't know if I should come.

171
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,215
- I don't know what to do.
- I know.

172
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,595
I'm so happy to see you.

173
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,056
How is he?

174
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:51,436
He's not...
Not as good as yesterday.

175
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,563
- How are you?
- I didn't understand...

176
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,191
...what you were going through, Ro, I...

177
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,276
I didn't know anything.

178
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,447
I was stupid. I'm sorry.
I apologize.

179
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,824
It's okay.

180
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:09,621
I mean, there's no way to know
what it's like until it happens to you.

181
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,374
You were so strong
when Jackie Jr. passed away.

182
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,711
- I don't know how you did it.
- Justin's gonna be all right, Ralph.

183
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,839
You'll see. He's gonna be fine.

184
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,760
He's gonna be a vegetable.

185
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,889
At least I have a daughter.
Ralph's all alone.

186
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,725
I told him he should go and talk
to Father Intintola.

187
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,436
- He should.
- He won't.

188
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,776
There's another one who should
talk to the priest.

189
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,196
- Is it true he overdosed on sleeping pills?
- Apparently.

190
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,033
I also know that he and Tony are
on the outs, but Tony's not talking.

191
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,919
First question. "What is today's date?"

192
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,840
A blond with big tits
and a hatful of Viagra.

193
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,300
Yeah, cute. Fuck around.

194
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:08,221
When that government shrink gets ahold
of you, you better know how to fake it.

195
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,141
- I could do it in my sleep.
- Oh, yeah?

196
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,727
- What's your name?
- My name?

197
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,147
You can't not know your name.
They'll know you're fucking with them.

198
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,776
Listen to this. "Give the subject
a piece of paper.

199
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:26,281
Ask him to draw a circle, fold the paper
in half and give it back."

200
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,450
These demented old bats can't do that.

201
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:33,997
Maybe you should wipe your ass with it,
then they'll know you're a whack job.

202
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,834
You think this is funny?
I'm a source of amusement.

203
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,546
- I pretend to wipe my ass!
- No, take it easy.

204
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,382
I lived my whole life with dignity.

205
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,678
Now I gotta pretend I'm a fucking
drooling idiot. A scumparì.

206
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,472
It's just a good, clean way out,
Uncle Jun. That's all.

207
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,227
My poor fucking brother, Eckley.
How they mocked him.

208
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,438
- No, look...
- Suppose it doesn't work.

209
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,316
- We'll go after a juror.
- Suppose nothing works!

210
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,738
Let's do another question.

211

(DOORBELL RINGS)

212
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,912
- Fucking Grand Central Station!
- That must be the nurse.

213
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,372
Maybe she'll give you a sponge bath.

214
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,711
Svetlana! I've been wanting
to talk to you.

215
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,047
I bring nurse. I don't come to see you.

216
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,133
I should never have taken
your prosthesis.

217
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:32,055
- But it did bring me to the Lord...
- You're a boring woman.

218
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,644
- Hey. How are you?
- Okay.

219
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,898
- Good to see you.
- This is Branca. She is registered nurse.

220
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:46,235
- He is Mr. Tony. This is the uncle.
- Help me up, I gotta go to the bathroom.

221
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,029
I do it.

222
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:55,078
- What's your problem now?
- Like anyone would care.

223
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,502
- Pleased to meet you.
- How are you doing?

224
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,213
I feel like such a hypocrite.

225
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,299
I haven't been in church in years.

226
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:13,137
But we had a Mass for Justin's baptism.

227
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,473
- For all the good it did.
- Ralph.

228
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,642
See?

229
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,353
- What am I doing here?
- God understands.

230
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,440
That's why it's at times like these
he's the only one we can turn to.

231
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,442
God.

232
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:33,324
My son's lying in a hospital
hooked up to a machine.

233
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,618
He never did nothing to nobody.

234
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,539
Our Lord gave his only
begotten son to suffer.

235
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,333
Nothing compared to this.

236
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:47,672
Were you there when Jesus Christ
had his moment of doubt and pain?

237
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:57,140
It's a great mystery to us,
why things happen as they do.

238
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:01,394
- But God has a plan for all of us.
- Come on, Father.

239
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:05,982
I've done things in my life
that I shouldn't have done.

240
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,737
He's making my son pay for it.

241
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,116
- That's how he's punishing me.
- God is merciful.

242
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,202
He doesn't punish people.

243
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,540
I would do anything if Justin
could even walk again.

244
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,876
Justin's in God's hands now.

245
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,130
And I assure you,
God loves him very much.

246
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,967
Your job is you.

247
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,180
To get yourself right with God.

248
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,433
For yourself and for your son.

249
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:48,524
- Would you like to make a confession?
- I think I need a little more time.

250
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,070
You know, to do a good one.
But when I'm ready...

251
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,656
- I understand.
- Thank you.

252
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,201
Let's pray.

253
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,749
Have mercy on me, God,
in your goodness.

254
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,712
In your abundant compassion,
blot out my offense.

255
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,591
Wash away all my guilt.

256
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,471
From my sin, cleanse me,
for I know my offense.

257
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,183
My sin is always before me.

258
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,859
- A scholarship at Rutgers?
- That's right. In Jackie Jr.'s name...

259
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:36,781
...for $20,000. And that's every year.
Ralph? Give me a break.

260
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,202
That's not all. He asked Ro to marry him.
She had the presence of mind to say no.

261
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,665
Although, she did say he went to see
Father Intintola and they had a long talk.

262
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,751
- No shit?
- I know what you mean about Ralph.

263
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:55,466
Although, to see him like that, and
Justin hooked up to those machines...

264
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,389
Good morning, you.

265
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,272
- When have I ever asked for French toast?
- Just eat the bacon.

266
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,650
It's unhealthy, this whole obsession
with your weight.

267
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,660
So...

268
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,622
- Where were you out so late last night?
- Nowhere.

269
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,458
Fooling around with blondie?

270
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,669
Quit it.

271
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,797
- Look at that guilty look on his face.
- Let him eat.

00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:39,177

274
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,642

How's Justin? Learn any news?

278
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:30,686
Well, it's the left side of the brain.
That affects speech...

279
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:36,317
...right side of his body.
It's too soon to tell.

280
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,072
All right. Well, sit down. Come on.

281
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,995
You want something to eat?

282
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,831
I just came by to give you...

283
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,793
- From the thing.
- It could have waited.

284
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,338
I had to smack the guy around
this morning.

285
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,507
Nice.

286
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,718
Least I'm good for something.

00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,353
How could I let something
like this happen?

288
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:17,191
It could happen to anybody, Ralph.

291
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:31,747
So high on coke I forgot to call him.

Then I thought I did.

- Yeah, I will.

hooked up with that miserable twat.

Maybe if I met a girl like Carmela, I...

Who got you those no-show jobs?
And not a word of gratitude.

330

He's a saint. You forget the thousand

she said she couldn't have kids.

502
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,559
But this new doctor says
maybe she can.

503
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,520
But I don't know if I'm ready.

504
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,398
Don't over-think it.

505

you leave your phone number.

With my schedule, I cannot
look up phone numbers.

509

I'll tell you one thing. You can't
be high on scag and have children.

510
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:01,768
I mean, look at that shit with Justin.
It would fucking ruin your life.

511

Those kids on milk cartons.
Teenage girls, they run away.

512

God knows what happens to them.
Killed, I guess.

514

...I want you to move my car away
and put yours in the driveway.

the fuck out of here.

520
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,022
...he was still moaning.

521
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,776
He died almost right away.

522
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,863
Ambulance wouldn't have
helped him anyway.

523
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:06,082
Paulie was in New Paltz all day.
I know that for a fact.

Well, good. Good.

I'm sorry.

What the fuck happened over there,
you think?

528
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,889
Tragic.

Hey, I'm not saying I'm a saint.
I've done drugs. When I was younger.

when they didn't have any money.

I'm sorry.

Wanna throw it away on drugs?

540
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,421
Okay.

- Retired here.

545

He's in a VA hospital now.
He's having prostate surgery.

with Ralph getting whacked.

We were right to disappear him.
You're right.
