1
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,360
I need your help. You gonna
tell me what's going on?

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,390
It's Kacey.
- Kacey's gone missing before.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,430
I know, but Kacey was picked up
by a john in a red pickup truck.

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,400
I saw a red pickup truck
outside of my house.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,120
You think he's been following you?
- I don't know.

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,900
Kacey ever go down the airport?
- Never.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,240
The girl that OD'd this week had a napkin...

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,510
...from 7 Brothers near the airport.

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,110
I'm gonna go and see if
anybody recognizes the victims.

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,310
Yeah,
I know that girl.

11
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,150
She was in here with this guy,
Jimmy Scanlon.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,180
They were fighting really bad.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,620
I need to speak to Jimmy Scanlon.

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,220
He hasn't been in in days.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,420
I'm not convinced that Michaela's
not in some kind of trouble.

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,190
I worry about that little boy.

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,960
You heard of a guy
named Dock McClatchie?

18
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,990
No.
- He's tagged in a bunch of pictures...

19
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,190
...on Kacey's Facebook page.

20
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,560
You recognize him?

21
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,660
No.

22
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,620
What is it?

23
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,870
Nothing.

24
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,455
You're gonna go look for her, aren't you?

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,160
Hello, Mickey.

26
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,300
You know who I am?

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,440
Kacey told me about you.

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,240
I'm not... I'm not trying to make trouble.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,170
I'm just trying to f... find my sister.

30
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,040
Yeah? I'm trying to find her too.

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,970
She took something of mine.

32
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,680
Whatever it is, I'm sure--
- Whatever it is,

33
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,820
it's between me and her.

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,250
Well, I know she was here 'cause
I saw her shoes in the other room.

35
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,250
So now you care all of a sudden, huh?

36
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,665
Look, I already told ya,
she ain't here.

37
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,190
Now go.

38
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,585
This ain't a place for you.

39
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,430
Take it.

40
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,530
Go on, take it.

41
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,600
I give one warning shot.

42
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,700
I'm fair.

43
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,235
Now, don't ever come back here again.

44
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,150
You know what I do for work, right?

45
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,225
You know what I do for work, right?

46
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,160
I don't know what you want
to find her so bad for anyway.

47
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,710
Don't you got better things to worry about?

48
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,520
Like what?

49
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,620
Like your son.

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,850
Thomas, right?

51
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,950
Cute kid.

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Stay away from my son.

53
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,570
Stay away from my house.

54
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,100
Okay, so you've given them
all their cards, then what?

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,870
Uh, then, we see if they raise.

56
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,800
Very good.

57
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,870
Uh, don't tell your mother
anything about the soda, okay?

58
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,010
It's our little secret.

59
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,110
Okay.

60
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,190
You in or you out?

61
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,580
Yeah, McGivney.
You in or you out?

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,975
Kid doesn't have all night.

63
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,820
You're a natural.

64
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,990
What the hell?

65
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,160
What... What is he doing here?

66
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,460
Yeah, Gee.
What's the kid doing here?

67
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,000
McGivney, don't help.
Please.

68
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,900
Kid's having fun is what he's doing.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,640
Oh, yeah? The kid's supposed to be
doing his math homework at your house.

70
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,440
He is.

71
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,410
We're working on probabilities.

72
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,550
All right.
Get your coat.

73
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,180
I asked you to do one thing for me.

74
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,480
Just one. One thing.
Why can't you do that?

75
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,280
Cool your jets.
The kid's gonna be all right.

76
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,680
I raised you,
and you're doing just fine.

77
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,415
Yeah, I'm just winning at life.

78
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,160
You're mad.

79
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,630
I'm not mad at you.

80
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,160
I'm mad at the infant you
have for a great-grandfather.

81
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,170
But I was having fun in there.

82
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,870
I know.
That's not the point, though.

83
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,970
Gee-Pop knows better.

84
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,620
Just... please don't push him away.

85
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,460
You getting your stuff
all packed for tomorrow?

86
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,380
Good job, buddy.

87
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,140
Luck is what happens when preparation...

88
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,280
Meets opportunity.
- Yep.

89
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,650
Well, just because
I get upset with Gee-Pop,

90
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,150
doesn't mean we're not going to see him.

91
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,560
You don't believe me?

92
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,520
We don't see any of our family.

93
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,260
For like, Thanksgiving
and Christmas and stuff.

94
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,960
David at school told me he
sees his cousins every week.

95
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,230
All the holidays too.

96
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,140
Do you not like them or something?

97
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,770
Of course I like them.
I just... I...

98
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,310
I usually have to work
during those holidays.

99
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,860
Do you have to work this year?

100
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,580
I... I don't know yet.

101
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,480
'Cause I need pictures of
them for my family tree.

102
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,720
And if we could go to
Thanksgiving, then I could--

103
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,730
I have pictures of...
I have pictures. Come on.

104
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,130
All right.

105
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,230
Okay.

106
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,780
There's cousin Hailey.

107
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,370
Caden.

108
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,540
You can take these.

109
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,615
You can take 'em out for your tree.

110
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,250
I've never seen this picture. That's--...

111
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,590
That's you?
- Mm. Yeah.

112
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,460
How old were you there?

113
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,810
I was about eight,
I think.

114
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,330
She's so beautiful, right?

115
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,430
You look just like her.

116
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,150
And that's your dad.

117
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,765
Yeah, long time ago.
- Before he died.

118
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,610
How come you never talk about him?

119
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,455
Well, he wasn't really
around much when I was a kid.

120
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Like my dad.

121
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,290
Where's their father?

122
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,590
Gee didn't want him here.

123
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,960
I heard he's not doing too well these days.

124
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,330
They say it was a lot of things,
but you know what it was.

125
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,470
We all know what it was.

126
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,665
It was that damn drug
that got her in the end.

127
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,400
You poor souls.

128
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,140
She loved you two more than anything.

129
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
You never forget that.

130
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,100
Look, Mick,
it's Daddy.

131
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,630
Kacey,
get away from the window.

132
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,730
Gee will see.

133
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,630
Son of a bitch.

134
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,850
How dare you come here,
you fucking no-good junkie!

135
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,350
Mr. O 'Brien, please.
- You did this to her.

136
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,765
You killed her.
You killed my baby girl!

137
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,770
Mickey,
is Mama gone?

138
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,620
Yeah.

139
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,020
She's gone.
- To heaven?

140
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,540
Yeah.

141
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,850
And she's not coming back?

142
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,770
No.

143
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,165
Who's gonna be my mama now?

144
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,210
I'll be yours.

145
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,310
And you'll be mine.

146
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,290
What's his name?

147
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,230
And he knows Dock?

148
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,510
Name is Winton.

149
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,850
Owns a tire store near a
dope set at K and Westmorland.

150
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,020
Keeps it looking
closed up from the outside.

151
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Why?

152
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,150
Because he runs a supervised
injection site on the inside.

153
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,920
Unofficially.

154
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,250
What'd you do last night after I left?

155
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,810
Hello, Mickey.

156
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,990
I had to help Thomas out
with his homework.

157
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,430
He wants to see his cousins
for Thanksgiving.

158
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,810
And that's a bad idea why?

159
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,060
'Cause they kinda suck.

160
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,080
He's not gonna see his dad?
- Mm-mm.

161
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,815
I'll come with you if you want.

162
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,960
To your cousin's.
You know, strength in numbers.

163
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,390
I wouldn't do that to you.

164
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,955
You might be doing it for me.

165
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:26,400
Sheila's taking the girls to visit her parents.

166
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,220
Mm.

167
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,440
And I still can't get used to not
seeing them during the holidays.

168
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,640
Since we separated.

169
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,410
You don't think that you
guys can work it out?

170
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,400
Sheila's thinks I'm still betting.

171
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,800
Are you?

172
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,480
Sheila didn't believe me. So.

173
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,470
I guess there's no reason to stop.

174
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,120
What about you and Thomas' father?

175
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,855
You think you'll work that out?

176
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,830
That was over
before Thomas was even born.

177
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,100
That's why I transferred to the 30th.

178
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,690
You know, all the time we were
partners, you never told me that.

179
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,170
Yeah,
there's nothing to tell

180
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,280
Hello.

181
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,380
I understand, yeah.

182
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,120
Sure, yeah.
I'll come after work.

183
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,300
Hey! Hey, you! Hey, I'm
over here! Great, thanks.

184
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,830
Yeah, he's a regular.
I got it.

185
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,590
Everything okay?

186
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,500
Simon stopped paying tuition.

187
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,870
Oh,
so everything's not okay.

188
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,330
No warning.
No nothing.

189
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,600
That why you sold the house?

190
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,040
Yeah.
- I wondered about that.

191
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,880
How can a father not want to see his kid?

192
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,445
He deserves better than that.

193
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,830
So do you, Mick.

194
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,820
Sure. I know, Dock.

195
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,170
He comes in here every now
and again, use the back.

196
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,920
He a dealer?

197
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,020
Yeah.
- Of what?

198
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,510
Drugs, girls.

199
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,770
Got a rough crowd he runs with.

200
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,000
You know where we can find him?

201
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,870
Mm-mm.

202
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,690
No, last time I knew,
he was, uh,

203
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,640
squatting at an abando off Braddock.

204
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,545
I don't know if he's still there.

205
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,950
You know this girl?

206
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,780
Her name is Kacey Fitzpatrick.

207
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,650
Yeah, I know Kacey.
Sweet kid.

208
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,950
She used to come in here with Dock.

209
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,920
Used to? Have you seen her recently?

210
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,690
Not for a couple months.

211
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,830
And the last time she was here,

212
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,100
she was all beat up.
Her eye was swollen shut.

213
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,030
I gave her some ice and some Advil.

214
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,040
You think that Dock might have
been the one to beat her up?

215
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,200
I don't know.
Could have been a john.

216
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,215
What's this about,
Truman?

217
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,135
Kacey's missing.
We're tryna find her.

218
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,540
Do you think Dock could
have done something to Kacey?

219
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,850
Like what?
- Like kill her.

220
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,920
Dock...

221
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,560
...talks a big game,
but he's no killer.

222
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,500
He-He's more bark than bite,

223
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,060
if you ask me.

224
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,050
Maybe you should have asked Kacey.

225
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,750
Mickey.

226
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,680
How are you so sure Dock's the guy?

227
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,075
You know something I don't?

228
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,675
No, I just... I have... just
a feeling about that guy.

229
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,410
Look, I know you want to find her. I do too.

230
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,160
We gotta explore every avenue, all right?

231
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,830
Not just the Dock leads.
- All right. Yeah.

232
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,390
Let's talk to this Jimmy Scanlon's family.

233
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,040
If he was seen arguing
with one of the victims,

234
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,230
maybe his wife knows something about it.

235
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,980
I got a friend at Delaware PD.

236
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
He'll set up a meeting.

237
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,120
All right.
I gotta go to work.

238
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,920
Ahearn's already pissed off
because of yesterday.

239
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,505
All right, I'll give you a ride.
- Thanks.

240
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,670
What's going on?

241
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,600
Danjarat found a video of the
perp in those girls' murders.

242
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,810
You can't see shit.

243
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,740
He's purposely keeping his face hidden.

244
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Wearing gloves too.

245
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,510
So we know he's six feet or taller.

246
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,910
Couple hundred pounds.

247
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,820
Race, indiscernible.

248
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,950
A Wildwood sweatshirt's our
biggest get, in terms of ID.

249
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,120
Dude's got to be white.
- Excuse me?

250
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,660
Black people
don't go to Wildwood anymore.

251
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,220
They go to AC.

252
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,790
Is this footage taken near
the Taylor Yoon crime scene?

253
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,930
Yeah.
Well, this,

254
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,660
coupled with the witness account...

255
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,670
...from the second victim's crime scene,

256
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,880
tells us we may have our perp.

257
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,500
Show this around the neighborhood.

258
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,830
See if any of the girls recognize him.

259
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,490
Do you recognize this guy, Alonzo?

260
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,090
Mm-mm.
- His name is Dock McClatchie.

261
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,260
Okay.
- Kacey's got a thing with him.

262
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Or used to.

263
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,970
I don't.

264
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,070
Most of the time Kacey was in here,

265
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,170
she was working, so...

266
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Thanks.
- Yeah.

267
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,080
Nicole! Nicole! Nicole?

268
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,180
Hey, you got a sec?

269
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,200
Nicole.

270
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,990
Hey, you all right?

271
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,050
Will you look at something for me?

272
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,150
What's wrong?

273
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
You all right, Nicole?

274
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,000
And it was like she was mad at me.

275
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,340
Or scared.
- Of you?

276
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,230
I don't know.

277
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,440
And it wasn't just Nicole, either.

278
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,610
Every woman on the avenue
was the same way.

279
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,300
It's just, they've never
been like that with me.

280
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,450
You know, there's a killer on the loose.

281
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,450
Maybe they're just all on edge.

282
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,550
But why run from me?

283
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,420
Right?

284
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,290
Don't take this the wrong way, Mick, but...

285
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,535
...are you holding back on something?

286
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,580
No. Why?

287
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,375
Universe is speaking to me.

288
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,790
What is the universe saying?

289
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,890
It's saying,
'Truman,

290
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,505
'Mickey's holding back on something.'

291
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,535
You know you can talk to
me about anything, right?

292
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,740
Yeah.

293
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Hey, remember.

294
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,670
We've got to be careful what
we ask Scanlon's wife in there.

295
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,190
Can't be raising too many flags
on a case that's not ours.

296
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,670
Yeah.

297
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,810
It just isn't like Jimmy to disappear like this.

298
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,960
Our son, he's sick, and all he keeps
asking is when Daddy's coming home.

299
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,750
He has to come home.

300
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,750
On the night that Jimmy disappeared,
was he acting differently?

301
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,990
Behaving weird?

302
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,090
He was anxious. Uh...

303
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,120
He got a call, told me he had
to meet someone from work.

304
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,530
I didn't ask who.
I should have asked who.

305
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,400
But the weird thing was that the cops...

306
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,660
...at the Wilmington Police Department...

307
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,330
...said that no call came in on his phone.

308
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,070
So he might have had a burner.

309
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,190
What's that?

310
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,290
A second phone.

311
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
Oh, God. Did he?

312
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Do you recognize...

313
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,930
...these women?

314
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,620
No.
Why? Who are they?

315
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,660
Well, this is Elizabeth O'Connor,
and this is Taylor Yoon.

316
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,820
And they were...

317
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,690
They both went missing...

318
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,880
...around the same time
that your husband did.

319
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,360
And you think they...

320
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,930
...they may have had something
to do with him being missing?

321
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:19,725
We're just trying to see if any of
these disappearances are related.

322
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:23,310
So you handed over your phone
records to the Delaware Police?

323
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,065
They said they didn't
find anything unusual.

324
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,570
How about bank accounts?

325
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,720
Uh, I gave them everything.

326
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,720
But I mean,
there wasn't anything weird.

327
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,350
We shared our accounts,
so I would know.

328
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,160
Is there any chance
that he had a bank account...

329
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,810
...that you didn't know about?

330
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,820
Um...

331
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,640
Sorry, I... I...

332
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,940
I wouldn't know the first thing
about trying to find that.

333
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Um... we... I... I...

334
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,510
I thought we shared everything.

335
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,415
Okay, um,
thank you for your time.

336
00:20:02,513 --> 00:20:04,513
Thank you.

337
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,290
DPD are doing everything they
can to try and find your husband.

338
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,390
Yeah.

339
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,210
Uh...

340
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,760
Do you recognize this guy?

341
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,230
His name is Dock McClatchie.

342
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,730
Does that name ring a bell?
- Mickey.

343
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,830
No.

344
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,950
Sorry.

345
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,050
Okay.
- Come on.

346
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,840
Girls, I hear ya cackling up there any more.

347
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,680
I'm gonna give you
somethin' to cackle about.

348
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,610
How come he doesn't like us?

349
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,650
He does.

350
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,580
He's just sad
'cause we remind him of Mom.

351
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,790
Besides, we don't need Gee-Pop.

352
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,220
Right?

353
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,640
All we need is each other.

354
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,275
Come here.
I want to show you something.

355
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,250
Whoa, what is that?

356
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,350
It's for us.

357
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,690
You ever need to hide something,
you put it in here.

358
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,430
You ever need to tell me anything,

359
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,530
you put it in here.

360
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:31,560
And if you ever need to tell me something...

361
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,785
I'll put it in here, too.

362
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,050
We can put notes and stuff.

363
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,570
And no one will ever see it.

364
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,900
Except me and you.
- Except me and you.

365
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,360
This is Danjarat.

366
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,660
Detective Danjarat,
it's Mickey Fitzpatrick.

367
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,990
I'm sorry I'm calling so late,
but do you have a second?

368
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,360
Sure. I'm still at the station
if you can believe that.

369
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,230
No rest for the weary.

370
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,930
Yeah, something like that.

371
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,030
Anyway, what's up?

372
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,360
Mickey?

373
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,760
Yeah. So...

374
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,250
I-I showed the video around today...

375
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,950
...and one of the women I spoke to...

376
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,820
...thought she recognized the guy
in the Wildwood sweatshirt.

377
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,520
Uh, she's scared to come forward officially,

378
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,510
but she did give me a name.

379
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,610
What was the name?

380
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,220
Dock McClatchie.

381
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,510
If you keep putting your head down,
they'll think you're sleeping.

382
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,640
Even if you're not.

383
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,780
Just look out the window.
if you get bored.

384
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,820
Okay, okay. It's just not easy
sitting still for a whole hour.

385
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,650
They should make classes shorter.

386
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,990
Hey.

387
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,140
Mickey,
what's in there?

388
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,190
Nothing.

389
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,755
No, seriously,
I want to know.

390
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,460
An oboe.

391
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,900
That's cool.
Can I hear you play?

392
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,550
I always wanted to play an
instrument. My dad won't let me.

393
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,650
Can I hear?

394
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
Don't.

395
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,230
Thank you.

396
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,570
It's really nice of you.

397
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,670
Give that back!

398
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,310
That was a mistake,
little girl.

399
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,640
Now I'm definitely not giving it back.

400
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,590
Kacey! Stop!

401
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,600
Come on.
Let's go home.

402
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,885
Were you waiting long? Okay.
- No, no.

403
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,680
Mickey, the problem... Oh...
- I wanted to... Sorry.

404
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,500
I wanted to apologize,

405
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,640
uh, for my outburst.
It... it...

406
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,565
I was upset with the situation, not with you.

407
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,790
I understand.
Thank you.

408
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,630
I apologize, too.

409
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,880
Thomas is a really special child,

410
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,125
and I'd do anything to keep him here.

411
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,620
Except actually keep him here?

412
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,930
I went to the school board on his behalf.

413
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,060
Their argument is that he's already
a recipient of a partial scholarship...

414
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,670
...and that your financial situation
hasn't demonstrably changed.

415
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,860
But they have agreed to keep Thomas
through to the end of this term, and...

416
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,840
Then he'll have to...

417
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,405
Have to leave.
You can say it.

418
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,850
Yeah, I'm afraid that's the case.

419
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,950
Unless you can get Thomas's father--

420
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,050
No. Not an option.

421
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Look.

422
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,390
I looked up the public school
in your catchment.

423
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,860
It's actually quite good.

424
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,170
But it wouldn't be the public
school in our catchment.

425
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,470
Uh, it doesn't allow for early drop-off,

426
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,900
so he'll have to go to Ashbridge.

427
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,720
I see.
- Which is where I went when I was a kid.

428
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,810
And it wasn't good.
It was overcrowded.

429
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,430
Thirty-three kids to a
classroom, and Thomas is just...

430
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,165
He's not the kind of kid who...

431
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
Keep the money.

432
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,540
What?
- No one knows you gave it to me.

433
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,345
I wish there was something
more I could do for Thomas.

434
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,720
So do I. Thank you.

435
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,040
It's called Ashbridge Elementary.

436
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,450
It has an aftercare program as well.

437
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,180
Just like Valley Green.

438
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,050
So then I'll just pick you up at night.

439
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,280
It's, uh, it's where you went, right?

440
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,550
Mm-hmm.

441
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,640
Your new school?
Yeah, that's where I went.

442
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,740
Did you like it?

443
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
I loved it.

444
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:38,020
This is Ashkenazy's version, but
I think I like Sokolov's better.

445
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,840
You're lying.

446
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,840
What?

447
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,780
When you said you loved your old school.

448
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,710
I heard you talking about it before with Gee.

449
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,750
You told him it was terrible
and that you hated it.

450
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,520
You told him that's the reason you
were sending me to Valley Green Friends.

451
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,820
I don't remember saying that.

452
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,060
But if I did--
- I'm not a baby.

453
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
What does that mean?

454
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:03,430
You tell me the least important stuff.

455
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,100
Instruments and the planet
and trees and the government.

456
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,270
But Thomas,
those things are important.

457
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,100
I know too much about the
history of Philadelphia.

458
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,320
And about Faust and the devil and about...

459
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,840
I don't know,
about bird calls.

460
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,510
Do you not like learning
about those things?

461
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,450
I do, but...

462
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,720
I'm big now, and you can
tell me the other stuff, too.

463
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,820
Like, that I have to go to a crappy school...

464
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,290
...because we can't afford
a good one anymore.

465
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,090
You need to tell me where my dad's been...

466
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,860
...and why he isn't talking to me,

467
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,090
and why he isn't paying
for school anymore!

468
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,190
Calm down.

469
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
He's just...

470
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
You can tell me, Mom.

471
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,990
I know I can tell you.

472
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,265
There's just nothing to tell.

473
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,330
But I can tell you something that I think...

474
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,980
...might make you feel better.

475
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,000
I have Thanksgiving off this year.

476
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
You do?

477
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,630
All right, here we go.

478
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,580
Hey, guys.
- Hi.

479
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,520
Wow. You really came.

480
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
We really came.

481
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,640
Hey, sweetie.
How you been?

482
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,740
Good.

483
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,380
And you are?

484
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Truman. Truman Dawes.

485
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm Hailey.
Hailey O'Brien.

486
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,375
Well, come on inside. It's
fuckin' frigid out there.

487
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,700
Ry, you remember Thomas,
don't you?

488
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,270
Are you kidding me?

489
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,070
Like, seriously? Get up.

490
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,200
Get up!

491
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,400
Get the fuck up!

492
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,170
Let's go. Come on.

493
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,240
Why don't you take your cousin
down the basement? Go play.

494
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,190
Come on, let's go.

495
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,050
Truman,
can I get you a plate?

496
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,150
Uh, sure.

497
00:30:36,215 --> 00:30:38,150
Hey, Mick, you, uh,
you want one?

498
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,250
Um...

499
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,920
Yeah.
I'm gonna be right back.

500
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,020
I'll be right back.

501
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,360
Sorry.

502
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,460
I'm gonna...

503
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,290
He's very vulnerable,
but a heck of a player.

504
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,990
Hey.

505
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,090
Look who it is.

506
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,510
What's goin' on?
- You all right?

507
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,580
Yeah. I've been trying to get a hold of ya.

508
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,780
You didn't get my texts?

509
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,990
Nah, something's wrong
with my phone I think.

510
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,760
Yeah, Kacey's missing.

511
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,290
Oh, man,
I'm sorry to hear that.

512
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,590
Do you have any idea where she might be?

513
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,030
Nah, I ain't seen her in a minute.

514
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,410
I ain't been down the Ave much.

515
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,030
Bobby, I don't care if you're dealing.

516
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,040
I just want to know when the
last time you saw Kacey was.

517
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,360
What you think, Jer?
Like two months ago?

518
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,460
Something like that.

519
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,300
Okay, do either of you
know a guy named Dock?

520
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,820
Oh, shit. Yeah. Why?

521
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,900
Because I think that Kacey and Dock
were together before she went missing.

522
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,090
That guy's bad news.

523
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,190
A buddy of his turned
up dead about a year ago.

524
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,630
Rumor has it, he was
skimming off Dock's supply.

525
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,365
When Dock found out about it...

526
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,020
What do you think?

527
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Mm.

528
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,230
Good.

529
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,930
Just good?

530
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,030
I made it.

531
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,230
It's extra good.
- Mm.

532
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,690
You're Mickey's cousin, right?

533
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,440
Yeah.

534
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,140
Were you all close growing up?

535
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,000
Mm, kinda.

536
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,670
I was always closer to her sister, though.

537
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,500
What was Mickey like as a kid?

538
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Mickey was...

539
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,020
I don't know.

540
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,710
Same as she is now.

541
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:47,100
Smart, quiet, uptight.

542
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,220
Not many friends.

543
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,850
Mostly she just kept to
herself and played her music.

544
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,250
You know, she used
to watch us sometimes.

545
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,120
You know, like, um,
like, babysit.

546
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,760
And guess what she made us do.

547
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,090
What?

548
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,330
Okay. So she would, like,
set up a little audience...

549
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,900
...and put us in chairs,
facing her.

550
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,970
And, like,
play a concert for us.

551
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,270
And, you know, like, I mean, me
and Kacey, we were just the same.

552
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,570
We couldn't sit still for nothin'.

553
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,410
And she'd make us sit there
while she played.

554
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,840
'Course, we always started laughing, and...

555
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,810
...and Mickey would get pissed,

556
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,910
tell my mom.

557
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,470
She always was a little fuckin' narc.

558
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,440
Made to be a cop from day one.

559
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,860
No offense.

560
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
None taken.

561
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,705
You know,
I do remember you.

562
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,420
Back when I was still talking
to Mickey. Long time ago.

563
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,985
I met her after work one day.

564
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,320
And you were there.

565
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,310
I remember thinking you were cute.

566
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,295
You're not talking to Mickey?

567
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Why not?

568
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,610
You know, you'll have to
ask Mickey about that.

569
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,010
Gotta warn you though.

570
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,080
She lies.

571
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,220
Here you go, bub.

572
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,910
You okay?
- Yeah.

573
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,950
Is that Mickey?
- Yeah, it's fine.

574
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,980
And Thomas.
- Hi, Aunt Lynn.

575
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,980
Have youse been here the whole time?

576
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,120
Yeah.

577
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,690
He looks just like your mother, honey.

578
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,220
You got so big.

579
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,560
Last time I seen you, you were
- - - We're gonna head out.

580
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,460
Actually--
- Youse're leaving already?

581
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,730
Yeah.
Thanks for having us.

582
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,800
Well, you can't leave yet.
We haven't said grace.

583
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,000
We have to say grace, everyone.

584
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,730
Jesus Christ, Ma.
Everyone's eaten already.

585
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,400
You watch your fucking
mouth, Hailey O'Brien.

586
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,190
It's grace time.

587
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,240
Hold hands.

588
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,340
Everyone hold hands.

589
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,110
I wish you never started
going back to church.

590
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,520
What's that, Hailey?
- Nothing, Ma.

591
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,620
I'll start.

592
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,720
Dear Lord in heaven,

593
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,920
we thank you for the food you
have put on our table today.

594
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,360
We thank you for the roof over our head,

595
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,430
and we pray for the
forgiveness for all our sins,

596
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,210
known...

597
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,310
...and unknown.

598
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,420
And we pray that the Birds
win the Super Bowl.

599
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,870
Amen
- ALL: Amen.

600
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,870
Wait.

601
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,840
The rest of youse gotta go now.

602
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,180
What do you want to pray about?

603
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,090
Just talk to God.

604
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,190
He's listenin'.

605
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,920
Uh, I pray for Loogie and Joey B.

606
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,520
I pray that everything goes good
at Juju's doctor's appointment...

607
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,130
...on Monday.

608
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,830
Lord, please let the Cowboys lose...

609
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,680
...and the Lions game go over
so I can finally hit a parlay.

610
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,630
Hailey.

611
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,340
What do you want to pray for?

612
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,040
Come on. Just say something
you're praying for...

613
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,200
...or something you're grateful for.

614
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,260
I'm praying for Mickey.

615
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,660
Well, I'm grateful for Mickey.

616
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,140
The only problem was that
Ryan said that his sister...

617
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,570
...wouldn't let us use the PlayStation.

618
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,480
And, Mom,
can we get one of those?

619
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,080
'Cause Ryan said that I could
come over and play with it...

620
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,950
...whenever I want when she's not home.

621
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,780
And also he wants to have a sleepover.

622
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,490
And Mom, can we see my
cousins all the time now?

623
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,190
Um...
- Because I really want to.

624
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,260
Because guess what?

625
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,630
Ryan said he can eat whatever he wants...

626
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,390
...out of the fridge anytime he wants it.

627
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,230
So I think we need to see them all the time.

628
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,830
All the time, huh?

629
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:07,265
Yeah, all the time.
Or, like, every other day and...

630
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,420
Mom?
- Yeah.

631
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,980
Who's the girl with the pink hair?

632
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,230
What'd you say?

633
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,250
The girl with the pink hair.

634
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,420
I brought my family tree there
to fill in some stuff...

635
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,890
...and when I showed it to Ryan,

636
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,155
he said I was missing
the girl with the pink hair.

637
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,875
I don't know what he meant.

638
00:37:31,928 --> 00:37:33,650
Uh...

639
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,810
I think he might have been mistaken.

640
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,250
Okay.

641
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,680
Go let yourself in.
I'll be right there.

642
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,090
Can you start getting ready for bed?

643
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,650
Yeah.
- Good night, Thomas.

644
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,750
Good night, Truman.

645
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,830
I never talked to him about her.

646
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:10,990
Just, I always felt like it was safer not to.

647
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,890
Thank you for coming.

648
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,415
Don't say a fucking word.

649
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,210
I know it was you.

650
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,980
Mom!

651
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,550
I can't find my toothbrush!

652
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,720
I'll...
I'll be right up, babe.

653
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,250
What? What was me?
What was me?

654
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,490
Got a visit today
from some of your cop buddies.

655
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,650
You telling me that's a coincidence?

656
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,300
If you fuck with my life,
I'll fuck with yours.

657
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,940
Maybe I should go up there,
talk to Thomas, huh?

658
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,170
Like you had your buddies
come talk to me today?

659
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,340
Please... please, don't.
I swear...

660
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,210
I didn't send...
I didn't send them.

661
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,610
I didn't.
- Mickey.

662
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,080
We both know you're lying. Okay?

663
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,880
Tell me the truth.
You sent them.

664
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,980
Say it. Say it.

665
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,380
Okay.

666
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,920
I sent them.

667
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,350
Get down on the ground. On the ground.
- No.

668
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,450
On the ground.

669
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,960
I told you I give one warning shot, right?

670
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,400
No... not in... Not in front of my kid.
- You had yours already.

671
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,030
Close your eyes.
- Please. No, don't let him...

672
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,800
...find me like this. Please, no!
- Close your eyes.

673
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,600
Okay? Okay.
- Count me down.

674
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,190
One, two, three. Say it!
- No.

675
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,820
One.

676
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,090
One... one.

677
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:59,175
Two.

678
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Mickey!

679
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,760
Hey, Mickey.
Are you all right?

680
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,700
What happened?

681
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,100
Hey.

682
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,040
No, it's okay.
It's okay.

683
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,210
I think he's gone.

684
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,940
I think he's gone.
- Who?

685
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
Who's gone?

686
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,630
Dock.

687
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,410
McClatchie?
- Yeah.

688
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,995
How'd he even find you?
Why'd he find you?

689
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:42,083
I...

690
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,060
I found him first.

691
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,790
What?
- Yeah.

692
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,830
The other night, you showed me
that picture of Kacey and Dock...

693
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,430
...in front of this abandoned house.
- Yeah.

694
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,100
I know that house.
- How?

695
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,100
It's been used for shit like that for years.

696
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,170
Kacey OD'd there once,
when she was in high school.

697
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,990
I had to, like, go and save her.

698
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,555
But...
why didn't you call me?

699
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,635
Why would you go there alone, Mickey?

700
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,420
You know,
I don't fucking get it.

701
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,240
Why the fuck you hiding shit from me?

702
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,520
Of all people.

703
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm just trying to help you.

704
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,560
Truman,
it's complicated.

705
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,260
What's so fucking complicated, Mick?

706
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,960
Aren't we friends?

707
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,300
Have I ever let you down my whole life?

708
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,650
Have I ever done anything
to make you not trust me?

709
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,140
No.
- No.

710
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,210
No. Then why?

711
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,610
I... I...
- I just don't get it.

712
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,310
You know what your cousin
Hailey said about you?

713
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,670
She said you lie, Mickey.

714
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,990
You got a problem.

715
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,235
You got a bad sense of who to let in.

716
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,320
The people who never let you down,

717
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,260
those are the people you let in.

718
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,460
But those who let you down
again and again and again,

719
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,045
those are the ones you push away, Mickey.

720
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,275
You hear what I'm saying?

721
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,540
Okay,
so let's start again.

722
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,870
Why would you go to Dock's without me?

723
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
You know what, Mickey?

724
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,515
When you're ready to talk,
I'm here.

725
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
I found it.

726
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,630
Mom,
I have to spit.

727
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,690
Hi.
- Mickey.

728
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,190
Yeah. I'm sorry to disturb you on holiday,

729
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,800
but I just wanted to let you know
we looked into Dock McClatchie.

730
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,300
We brought him in for questioning, but...

731
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,600
He's got an airtight alibi for at
least two of the three homicides.

732
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,270
What is it?

733
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,920
He was in custody at the time.

734
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,390
Mickey?

735
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,910
Mom?

736
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,010
You okay?

737
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,350
Mom,
can you talk to me?

738
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,770
How did you--
- I stole it back.

739
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,540
But how?
- It doesn't matter.

740
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,070
But Louis won't ever bother you again.

741
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:33,500
That's dangerous, Kacey. Louis
Driscoll's dad is really mean.

742
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,650
Anyway,

743
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,580
it's my job to take care of you.

744
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,680
Not the other way around.

745
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,720
I want to take care of you, too.

746
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,390
You can tell me stuff,
and maybe I can help you.

747
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,220
You're my mom.

748
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,730
And I'm yours, too.

749
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,610
You said so.

750
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,480
So when you're ready to talk.

751
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,580
I'm here.

752
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:03,140
What are you thinking about?

753
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,710
My birthday party.
- Oh.

754
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,710
I want to have everyone this year.

755
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:07,980
Can I?
- Mm-hmm.

756
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,580
I want to have it at,
uh, Land-O-Fun.

757
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,090
And I want to invite Carlotta and Lila.

758
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,190
Okay.

759
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,470
And Dad.

760
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,740
I wanna invite Dad.

761
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,720
Thomas, I want to discuss
something with you.

762
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,940
You've been asking about
where your father is and...

763
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,440
I've never told you the truth because...

764
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,810
I didn't want to hurt you.

765
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,620
And now I can tell that
not telling you the truth...

766
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,720
...is hurting you more.

767
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:53,290
As far as I know,
there's nothing going on...

768
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,830
...in your dad's life that's
preventing him from seeing you.

769
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:59,080
He's just...
not being a good dad.

770
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
Or a good person.

771
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,570
I, uh, I think that he's making...

772
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:08,645
...all the wrong choices right now.

773
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,810
And this is not your fault.

774
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:13,290
Okay?
Because you're perfect.

775
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,530
Hey.

776
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,060
You are perfect.

777
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,100
Do you hear me?

778
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Do you understand me?

779
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,610
This is on him.

780
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,280
Okay, Thomas?
Okay?

781
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:33,650
But can we still ask him?
Just to see?

782
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,480
He loves Land-O-Fun.

783
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,010
I will ask him,
but I don't want you...

784
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:43,680
...to be disappointed if he can't make it.

785
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,030
Hey.

786
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,680
You like Truman, right?
- Yeah.

787
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,250
You think he's a smart guy?

788
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,120
Do you know what he
said to me the other day?

789
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:00,660
He said that there are
some people you let in,

790
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,225
and some people you keep out.

791
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,000
And I think that it's time for both of us...

792
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,340
...to recognize which one
of those your dad is.

793
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,440
So, does this mean Dad won't
take me to see the Sixers anymore?

794
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,980
Well, I'll take you to see the Sixers.

795
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,980
You don't know anything about basketball.

796
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,710
I do. I do, too.

797
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,190
Name one player on the team.

798
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,050
Allen Iverson.

799
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,020
Mom.

800
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,620
Okay, okay,
but I will learn.

801
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,890
I'm smart.

802
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,370
I'm good at learning things.

803
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,120
Kacey! Kacey!

804
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,420
Kacey!

805
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,520
You need something?

806
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Sorry.

807
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,290
Three-alarm fire at 222 Braddock Street.

808
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:21,090
56201 responding.

809
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:29,410
Was anybody inside?

810
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:30,650
Not sure. It was pretty
well gone when we got here.

811
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,750
Keep some distance.

812
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,460
Get in line.
Where's that water?

813
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,620
Paula!

814
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,090
Was Kacey inside?

815
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:41,730
Was... was she inside?

816
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:42,860
Come on, Paula. Come on.

817
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,020
Please!
- No! I told you. She's gone.

818
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,670
Can you help me out
with something? Please?

819
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,000
What?

820
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,925
Did you know any of the girls
who were killed?

821
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,450
What about 'em?
- I got a video of the perp.

822
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,000
Can you look at it? Just see
if you recognize him, please?

823
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,220
He's still out there.

824
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,125
Paula, come on.
Look at the video.

825
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,610
Come on!

826
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,260
God, Mickey.
Are you serious?

827
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,330
Are you shittin' me?

828
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,620
Serious about what?
- Don't bullshit me.

829
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,720
Don't bullshit me.

830
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,620
You know him?

831
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,960
Yeah, I know him.

832
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,530
You know him too.

833
00:50:34,595 --> 00:50:36,595
'Cause he's a cop.

834
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,020
Guy comes around here,
wavin' his badge for blowjobs.

835
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,890
It's only a matter of time
before he upped his game.

836
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,890
What? Wait, wait.
- You stay away from me!

837
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,285
You're gonna get me killed.

838
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,420
I'm ready to talk.
