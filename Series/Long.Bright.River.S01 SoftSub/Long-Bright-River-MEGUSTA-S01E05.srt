1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,350
Calling all units. Possible
domestic assault in progress.

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,450
You need to step back.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,790
You don't remember me, do you?
But I remember you.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,600
I know you wanted
your dad to be at the party,

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,700
but I've left several messages
and he's not responded.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,230
Daddy!
- Hey, buddy.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,170
Simon.
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,265
Come here, asshole!
Don't you walk away from me!

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,490
Simon, get off of him!

10
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,650
Did they find Jimmy Scanlon?
- No, not yet.

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,380
He was getting some pretty hefty payments
from a company called S.O.K. Holding.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,720
Pretty suspicious
for a sheet metal worker, right?

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,250
Do you remember my friend, Aura?

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,720
She has a husband who works for the DA.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,310
Maybe he can figure out what Scanlon
had to do with those dead women.

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,530
Taylor went to PYC?
- And so did Elizabeth O'Connor.

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,270
Simon was their counselor. And Paula
said that the guy in the video was a cop.

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,685
Do you think Simon could be the killer?

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,280
Mick--

20
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,850
That's why Paula looked at me like she did,

21
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,720
because she couldn't believe that I
couldn't recognize who was in that video,

22
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,250
that I didn't know that that was Simon.

23
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,840
He used this place as a market to
shop for girls, and now they're dead.

24
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,430
Simon's a predator.
But serial killer?

25
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,015
Injecting them with insulin?
- Look. Look.

26
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,290
That looks like him.

27
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,915
Looks like a lot of guys.

28
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,150
Simon's withholding child support.

29
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,711
He pulled a lot of bullshit
at Thomas's birthday party.

30
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:19,720
This is not personal.

31
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
Look, I'm on your side.

32
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,710
But this is one hell of an accusation.

33
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,490
What we've got now is not proof.

34
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,590
Then we'll find proof.

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,540
How?

36
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,470
I will find Paula tomorrow,
and I will get her to ID Simon.

37
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,800
If I say his name,
maybe she will, too.

38
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,750
It's okay. I'm here.

39
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,830
Come on, eat,
you stubborn piece of...

40
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,300
Your neck still hurting?

41
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,700
How'd you get in here?

42
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,470
I have a key.
- Oh.

43
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,070
It's been a while since you used it.

44
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,500
Can I see that?

45
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,010
Uh...
- Just let me see it.

46
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,370
Just take it off.

47
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,940
Jesus. It looks like it hurts.
You should see a doctor.

48
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,350
Doctors are for girls.

49
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,650
Besides, all they do is try to give me...

50
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,320
...the same shit that wrecked your mother.

51
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,610
Should've dropped Simon
like the dogshit he is.

52
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,430
Why didn't you tell me
how you felt about Simon before?

53
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,560
And you would have listened?

54
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,090
You knew more than everyone
from the day you were born.

55
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,520
That my scarf?
- Oh, yeah.

56
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,980
You left it at Land-O-Fun.
- I got others.

57
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Maybe you could say thanks.

58
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,090
Maybe you could tell me
why you really came by.

59
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,620
Do you know where the
Mulroneys next door moved to?

60
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Oh.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,360
Still looking for Kacey.

62
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,410
I thought if I could find Paula,
I could find her.

63
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,480
Heard Sue moved into her mother's place.

64
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,830
Over on Clearfield?
- Yeah, that's the one.

65
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,930
Okay.

66
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,450
Take some Advil.

67
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,710
Aura,
I'm running late for work.

68
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,450
Okay, I won't keep you.

69
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,450
Just wanted you to know that
Joe looked into the company...

70
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,390
...you asked him about,
this Jimmy Scanlon one.

71
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,660
And?
- Oh, I don't know.

72
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,820
But he made you a very cute
folder, tabs and everything.

73
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,090
Tell him thank you, and after
work, I'll come and get it.

74
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,460
We're going out to dinner. I'll
text you the name of the place.

75
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,400
Okay, I'll, um,
I'll run in and grab it.

76
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,475
Or you'll sit down and eat with us.

77
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,190
It's not a negotiation.

78
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,140
You want that file, right?

79
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,215
Besides, you could use a night out.

80
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,480
Help you?

81
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,420
Yeah.
Officer Dawes from 30th.

82
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,490
Got some time on my hands.
I, uh...

83
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,790
I'm on leave.

84
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,030
I was wondering if you guys
need any after school help?

85
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,105
Uh, let me get you a form.
- Thanks.

86
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,870
Recognized some faces in those photos.
- Oh, yeah?

87
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,700
Yeah. Um...

88
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,690
Does Simon Cleare still work here?

89
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,080
You a friend of his?

90
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,510
No, no, no, different districts.

91
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,370
Never worked with the guy,
but, you know, saw him around.

92
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,050
Detective Cleare moved on a while back.

93
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,190
Right.
- We got about two dozen PYCs in the city.

94
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:30,155
He might have gone over to another
one, or maybe he found a new hobby.

95
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,325
Working with kids ain't for everyone.

96
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

97
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,760
What's up?
- Mickey.

98
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,325
Did you hear?
- Hear what?

99
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,120
They, uh, found another victim.

100
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,790
Kensington woman?
- That's what I heard.

101
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,120
What else did you hear?
- Good morning.

102
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,310
Thank you, Sergeant Ahearn,
for letting me get right to it.

103
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,930
Get right to it,
then, Detective.

104
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,730
Another young woman was found.

105
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,540
Possible connection
to the Kensington murders.

106
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,140
It's a sex worker,
like the others.

107
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,840
Motive unclear.

108
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,840
No witnesses.

109
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,080
Uh, insulin overdose?

110
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,030
No. It's a, uh, it's a gunshot.

111
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,970
But the victim. She's...

112
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,870
She's still alive.

113
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,530
The victim was found up on Delaware Ave.

114
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,760
Soaking wet,
shot at close range.

115
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,220
She sustained life threatening injuries.
- Did you get an ID?

116
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Yeah.

117
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,190
Emily Morris.

118
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,060
Do you recognize her?

119
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,950
No. I've never seen her.

120
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,880
Maybe you could ask
the other girls about her.

121
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,790
Sure. Did she say anything
about who shot her?

122
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:07,245
Officer Fitzpatrick, I need to
speak with you in my office, now.

123
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,660
You get to my level, you go
to a lot of training sessions.

124
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,830
Some lady tells you how to be sensitive,

125
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,990
how to have difficult conversations.

126
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:22,340
Well, now, you and me get to
have a difficult conversation...

127
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,520
...about why you paid a visit
to the Yoon family.

128
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,310
Yeah. I thought rules were your thing.

129
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,950
That is why I put Lafferty with you.

130
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,720
Instead, you spun him out
on your bullshit theories.

131
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,620
And now you took it upon yourself...

132
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
...to go to the home of a murder victim,

133
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,730
and personally question
the grieving family, which...

134
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,930
I think you know is an
egregious breach of protocol.

135
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,600
I was just following up on the suspect
video, like Danjarat had asked.

136
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,740
Yeah. You work for me.

137
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,190
As a patrol cop, not for him.

138
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,640
Not a detective.

139
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,910
So, stop with all the questions.

140
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,000
That family could sue the department.

141
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
You want a suspension?

142
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,350
Hey! You want a suspension?

143
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,680
I got an ID on the surveillance video.

144
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,290
And this... This is the first
time I'm hearing about it?

145
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,830
A woman from the Avenue said that
we need to be looking at a cop.

146
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,940
A cop who forces the women to...

147
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,370
...service him,
and then threatens them...

148
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,840
...if they say...
- She give you a name?

149
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,940
No.

150
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,720
The oldest trick in the book.

151
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,250
Johns say they're a cop,
they get a free...

152
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,807
Whatever, Mickey. You
never heard that one?

153
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:46,090
I...

154
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,130
I know... I know this woman.

155
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,270
Okay? I know this woman.

156
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:52,325
Well, who is she?

157
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,300
You just said you knew her.

158
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Now her name eludes you?
- I can't... I would need to get her consent.

159
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,325
I can't go to IA
with an anonymous accusation.

160
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,030
Jesus. After the conversation we just had?

161
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,020
Who is she?

162
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,690
Do you want a suspension?
- Paula Mulroney.

163
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,800
Oh, prostitution, possession...

164
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,100
...robbed the library, that Paula Mulroney?
- Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,340
Sorry to interrupt,
but this is pressing.

166
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,580
I'd like Mickey to go to Lutheran.

167
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,250
Doctors brought Emily Morris
out of a medically induced coma.

168
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,780
She won't talk to anyone,
but maybe she'll talk to Mickey,

169
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,450
being she's from the neighborhood and all.

170
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,230
Go.

171
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,710
Then get back on your shift.

172
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,370
Hi, Emily.

173
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,105
My name is Officer Fitzpatrick,

174
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:31,313
and I need to ask you some questions.

175
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,580
I'm from Kensington.

176
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,620
I grew up there.

177
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,050
My sister...

178
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,390
...maybe you know her.

179
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,290
Kacey Fitzpatrick?

180
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,630
Who did this to you?

181
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,950
Hey, he shot you, Emily.
Left you for dead.

182
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,000
We think he's hurting other women.

183
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,075
We think he's going to do it again.

184
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,360
And you can help stop him.

185
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,070
I know you're scared.

186
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,400
But you can trust me.
I'm on your side.

187
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,930
Was it a cop?

188
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,310
Was it a cop?

189
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,410
Emily.

190
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,090
Were you ever part of the PYC program?

191
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,190
Get out.

192
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,300
Time to change your dressing,
so we'll need the room, Officer.

193
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,230
Give me just one minute alone?
- Get out.

194
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,900
She was intubated
for a long time during surgery.

195
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,315
Throat's completely raw.
She needs rest.

196
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,380
There's supposed to be a
security guard outside her room.

197
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,880
What, with the parade of cops,
probably thought he could...

198
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,380
...grab a sandwich or something.
- Parade of cops?

199
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,730
Sorry, who else was here?
Who else did you talk to?

200
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
She was scared.

201
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,510
She was staring at my gun.

202
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,930
Well, she was shot.

203
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,900
What if one of the cops who
was there was threatening her?

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,630
What... What if...

205
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,730
It was Simon?

206
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,740
Did you find Paula?

207
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,240
I'm standing outside of her mom's
house right now. Where are you?

208
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,210
Uh, Mr. Winton's,
locking up for him.

209
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,650
Is he okay?

210
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,950
Yeah. Reoccurring pneumonia, and a
bad case of denial about being 70.

211
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,980
Well, he and Gee
should join a bowling league.

212
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,420
They got a lot in common.

213
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,045
Emily Morris was picked up on
Delaware near the Betsy Ross Bridge.

214
00:14:43,128 --> 00:14:44,230
All the way up there?

215
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,030
Yeah, doesn't really fit the pattern, does it?

216
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,100
Want to check it out with me after my shift?

217
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,930
You really want to do that?

218
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,650
What, after Ahearn chewed you out?

219
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,190
Yeah.
- All right. Bye.

220
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,030
Mickey Fitzpatrick.
- Hi, Mrs. Mulroney.

221
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,300
Everything okay, hon?

222
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Yeah, yeah.

223
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,490
Okay. Come on in.

224
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,270
I... I wasn't expecting company.

225
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,010
You want a Tastykake or something?

226
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,290
Oh, uh... Yeah, sure.

227
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,150
You look good, Mickey.

228
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,030
Real good.

229
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,180
How's the little guy?

230
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,190
He just turned eight.
So he's not so little anymore.

231
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,290
I remember eight.

232
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:49,030
Oh, teeth still falling out,
always with the questions.

233
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,310
Eight's sweet.

234
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,750
And easy...

235
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,885
...compared to what comes next.

236
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,670
Have you seen Paula lately?

237
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,130
Uh, been a while.

238
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,610
She's doing okay.

239
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,310
Comes around a little more.

240
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,575
Good. That's good.
Where's she been living lately?

241
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,120
She don't exactly have an address.

242
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,490
Not exactly the life I imagined
for my little girl.

243
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,030
I got some guilt about that. I do. I...

244
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,020
I worked the two jobs.
I should have been home more.

245
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,530
Hmm. I did my best.

246
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,305
Just like you, Mickey. Thomas
is real lucky to have you.

247
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,620
How's Kacey?

248
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,340
I don't know.

249
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
I can't find her.

250
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:44,580
I came by looking for Paula,
wondered if she'd seen her.

251
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,780
She'll show up.
You stay positive.

252
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,855
You say a prayer,
however you do it.

253
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,490
I gotta... I gotta get down to Rittenhouse.

254
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,290
I gotta work a luncheon. I...

255
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,560
I don't know why
they can't just call it 'lunch.'

256
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,660
And next time I see Paula,
I'll ask about Kacey.

257
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,630
Okay? Hey.
- Thanks. Thank you.

258
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,600
You want money for coffee? I...

259
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,825
Oh, no, no, no. I'm good.

260
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,710
Of course you are, Mickey.

261
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,230
Mm.

262
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:17,535
For a while there, we thought you were
gonna leave us and never come back.

263
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,630
Excellent.

264
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,760
You've been practicing,
Michaela. It shows.

265
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,380
Thank you. I love this piece.

266
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,830
You have tremendous promise.

267
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,310
Which summer programs
have you considered?

268
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,410
Vienna? Rome?

269
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
New York?

270
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,140
Mickey, you have aptitude,
but you got a late start.

271
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,810
I'd like to help you set some goals. Mick.

272
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,260
You sound dope.

273
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,440
Uh...

274
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,260
Kacey, what are you doing here?

275
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,910
Just thought I'd surprise you.

276
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,130
We always spend
the weekends at my place.

277
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,300
I... I drove all the way here...

278
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,860
Big whoop. I took the bus.

279
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Can we...

280
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,770
Serious, Mick?

281
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,610
I'm sorry. She just showed up.

282
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,450
Your sister's a piece of work.
- She's a kid.

283
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,550
She's not your kid.

284
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
I missed you this week.

285
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,220
You miss me?

286
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,785
You know that I did. But I...

287
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:10,380
It's your life, Mickey.

288
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,500
You get to choose
and you always choose her.

289
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,570
I'm not choosing her.

290
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,870
I feel sorry for her.

291
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,770
Look, look, look. I know I'm going
to regret this in, like, an hour,

292
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,240
and wish that I was spending
the whole weekend with you...

293
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,710
...and not her, okay?

294
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,810
It sucks for me, too.

295
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,330
Mm.

296
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,190
So, uh, the Cinema Club does screenings.

297
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,260
We could go see what's playing.

298
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,260
I do have a reading to do for Monday,

299
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,710
but, I...
- Cool. Do it now.

300
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,350
Okay.
- I'll go find some food.

301
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,320
Hey, Jer, what's happening?

302
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,310
Some girl OD'ed in the music hall.

303
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,590
Hey, I need you to back up, okay, ma'am?
- She's my sister.

304
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,740
What happened to her?

305
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,340
She overdosed.
- What?

306
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,480
On alcohol and these.

307
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,010
How long your sister's been snorting Oxy?

308
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,450
What? I... I don't know.
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,100
I'm gonna need you to back up.

310
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,195
Yeah, perfect. Thank you.

311
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,650
Is she gonna die?

312
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,900
Not today. But she's gonna
come to the hospital with us.

313
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We'll fix her up.
How old is she?

314
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Fourteen.

315
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,990
You said Emily Morris was wet
when they found her on the road.

316
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,660
Soaking wet and bleeding out.

317
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,790
Maybe the shooter figured she was dead,

318
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,730
and threw her in the river.

319
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,660
But why was she here? She...

320
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,070
There are easier places to turn tricks.

321
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,540
Might have been here against her will.

322
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,800
Other than the fact
that Emily works the Avenue,

323
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,340
this doesn't match the pattern.

324
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,840
OD, insulin.
So maybe it's not connected.

325
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,730
But it felt like...

326
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,950
...she was listening.

327
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,850
She was about to open up...

328
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,820
...when I asked her if it was a cop,

329
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,370
if she was a part of PYC.

330
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,850
I went back there... to PYC.

331
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,780
Why?

332
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,950
I wanted to take a look around.

333
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,770
See if Simon still worked there.

334
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,060
He doesn't.

335
00:22:10,135 --> 00:22:13,620
But the way the desk officer was talking,

336
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,350
it was like saying a priest
got moved to a new diocese.

337
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,480
If Simon thinks
the girls are coming forward...

338
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,235
...maybe we do have motive.

339
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,045
I think we should follow him.

340
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,990
See what he does after work,

341
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,060
where he goes at night.

342
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,715
Only way to see if he really is the killer.

343
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,220
Can I feed Carmichael?

344
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,650
Hey, listen to Gee. Go to the
bathroom before you go to bed.

345
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,050
Mom.
- Sorry. And it's a school night,

346
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,620
so please don't stay up too late, okay?

347
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,160
I know. It's awesome, right?

348
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,430
Don't open that cage door all the way.

349
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,060
He's not gonna get out.
Trust me.

350
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,830
Uh, make sure he does his reading,
okay? His book is in his bag.

351
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,770
Can you give him some of those
frozen peas for dinner?

352
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,100
And 8:30, he needs to be
in bed, and that's it.

353
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,325
Thank you for taking him.

354
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,610
Are you not gonna ask me
why I need overnight help?

355
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,940
No. You were always a little old lady.

356
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,910
What is that supposed to mean?

357
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,050
I'd love it if you were up to no good.

358
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,210
But that ain't your style.
Never was.

359
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,520
Hmm. I'm sorry I asked.

360
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,710
Let me know if he wants to
call before bed. I love you.

361
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,810
He got out.

362
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,700
He shits on my chair,

363
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,370
guess who's cleaning it up?
- Motherfucker.

364
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,970
English horn wasn't even offered
at our school.

365
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:49,070
I think Mickey chose it later because she
likes correcting people who call it French.

366
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,010
I chose it because it's beautiful.

367
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,580
Ask Aura why she chose the cello.

368
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,780
What? Joe, you know this, right?

369
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,810
We don't have to get into it.
- I'm intrigued.

370
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,480
It was because of a cartoon.
- It was not a cartoon.

371
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,340
It was because of a cartoon.
- It was an anime.

372
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,220
Don't patronize me.

373
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,380
Okay, moving on.
Go ahead. Show them.

374
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,800
Company that made the deposits
into Jimmy Scanlon's bank...

375
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,950
...is a subsidiary
of a Chinese consulting firm.

376
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,400
There's not much on them.

377
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,740
Why would the Chinese consultants
be paying a sheet metal worker?

378
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,740
I asked the same question.

379
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,740
Scanlon went to North Catholic,

380
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,110
no college, did a bunch
of construction gigs...

381
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,180
...before he joined the sheet
metal workers down in Tinicum.

382
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,580
The kind of guy consultants love to recruit.

383
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,550
Right? Smells weird.

384
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:39,140
But, I'm going to dig some more
and we'll let you know what I find.

385
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,220
What are you two up to after this?

386
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,400
Oh, we have a work thing.
- Gotta pick up Thomas.

387
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:55,110
Hey, so, Truman...
What's the deal?

388
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,530
We were partners, now we're
work friends. You know this.

389
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,610
Remember how Joe and I met?

390
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,910
You testified in a murder trial.

391
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,820
And he was the public defender.
I know all about work friends.

392
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,820
Work friends are hot.

393
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,065
I don't know why I'm laughing.
- I do.

394
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
I like this one.

395
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,280
What is it?

396
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,950
Was it obvious...

397
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,840
...with Simon...

398
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,990
...in the beginning...
that he was bad?

399
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,125
I was intimidated by him.

400
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,990
We were very young.

401
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,320
I didn't know how to talk about
it, but we can talk about it now.

402
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,420
No, I don't need to.

403
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,890
Okay.

404
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,100
Then can we talk about Truman
and the way he looks at you?

405
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,660
That's enough.
- Just saying...

406
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,970
I hope you're not driving.

407
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,945
Hey, kid, check this out.

408
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,090
Will I get to wear these someday?

409
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,315
Eh. Put 'em on right now.

410
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,080
Really?
- Yeah.

411
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,220
There you go. All right.

412
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,970
It's like a dress.
- Nothing wrong with that.

413
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,600
You come from a long line
of mummers, kid.

414
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,140
My pop, my Gee pop.

415
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,940
So if any jitbag says it's weird
to put on makeup and dress up,

416
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,930
you tell them it's a family thing.

417
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,930
Yeah.

418
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,720
Can we listen to music?

419
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,190
What do you want to listen to?

420
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,830
I don't have all that sad stuff
your mom plays.

421
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,000
Kids at school like K-pop.

422
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,000
That ain't happening. How about
The Geator with the Heater?

423
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,990
Who?
- The boss with the hot sauce.

424
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,410
Is that a real person?

425
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,910
Jesus! What is Mickey doing over there?

426
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,410
My own great-grandson
doesn't know Jerry Blavat!

427
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,380
Ah. He's a Philadelphia icon.

428
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,150
He was on Bandstand,
for Chrissake.

429
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:24,095
I used to spin your mom-mom
around this room to his songs.

430
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,330
You just wait.

431
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,065
It's going to change your life.

432
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,060
Geator with the Heater.

433
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,200
That's it. That's it.

434
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,830
You got to get ready for this.

435
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,440
Simon should be off soon.

436
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,940
Maybe we'll find the proof that we need.

437
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,750
Was there a time when you...

438
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,505
...thought about taking the detective exam?

439
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,090
Well, thank you, Mickey,

440
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,360
very much, for asking.

441
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,900
It's too quiet.

442
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,125
I never wanted detective.

443
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
I liked the uniform.

444
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,590
Told people who I was.

445
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,890
Now it's just hanging in the closet.

446
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,300
Until you're better.

447
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,330
Better than what?

448
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,990
What are we doing right now, Mickey?

449
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,490
You know it's not just a few bad apples.

450
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,230
I just don't know if it's possible to be...

451
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,460
...a good apple when
the whole system is bad.

452
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,350
I spent 25 years watching over this avenue,

453
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,970
watching community groups come and go,

454
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,365
watching every new mayor...

455
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,110
...promise to clean up Kensington.

456
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,380
But we're the ones
who do the sweeps they order,

457
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,550
we're the ones turning people
out of their tents,

458
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,050
whether they got someplace to go or not.

459
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,695
And I don't feel good about it when I do.

460
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,940
How about you?

461
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:46,235
You ever wanted detective?

462
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,030
I mean, yeah,
I thought about it.

463
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,680
I never took the exam, though.

464
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,440
Even without Ahearn reminding
me of my shortcomings as a cop

465
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,950
I would be, like...
I would be a worse detective.

466
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,050
Come on.

467
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Patrol's decent pay.

468
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,540
It's regular hours.

469
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,570
And lets you keep an eye on Kacey.

470
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,400
It's good to have you back, Kace.

471
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,270
I mean, I did a lot of thinking because, like,

472
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,770
what the fuck else you gonna do in jail?

473
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,155
I'm gonna be better.
I just want you to know that.

474
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,725
One day at a time, right?

475
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:44,670
Thank you for being my family and
letting me stay and everything.

476
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,320
Are you sure Simon won't mind?

477
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,960
He'll be fine.

478
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,490
Hey, guess what. We have a
bed in the guest room now.

479
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,100
Damn, Mick. You're like a
real fucking grownup now.

480
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,835
I should've taken my shoes off.

481
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,140
What's this for?

482
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,470
Those are practice tests.
I'm studying.

483
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,270
To be a detective?
- Yeah.

484
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,980
Why?

485
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,550
What about music?
- What about music?

486
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,290
I just... I always thought you
would've quit the force by now.

487
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,490
Thought it was like
a fucking holdover while you...

488
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,715
...figured your shit out.

489
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,470
Mickey, the happiest I ever saw you,

490
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,040
swear to God, was when
you were playing at Penn.

491
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,140
You're so good.
You're, like, so fucking good.

492
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,400
That teacher wouldn't shut up about it.

493
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Yeah.

494
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,180
Maybe you could go back to school.

495
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Like, teach kids or something.

496
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,440
I don't know.
- No, I don't think so.

497
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,690
Because of me?

498
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,290
No.
- Is that why you never went back?

499
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,190
I... Penn was a mistake.

500
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,230
Gee was right about that.

501
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,030
Hey, babe.

502
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,955
Is being a cop what you want
or what he wants?

503
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,290
Kacey.

504
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,390
Hey, Simon.

505
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,980
Bet you missed me.

506
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,630
Uh, not as much as Mickey did.

507
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,430
Call your PO yet?

508
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,375
I'm assuming we have to test you?

509
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:24,520
What are the conditions of your parole?

510
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,620
Let's do that later.

511
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,390
Oh, my God.
From one jail to another.

512
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,710
Warden Cleare runs a tight fucking joint.

513
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,230
Simon's coming out.

514
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,560
All right,
see you tomorrow, guys.

515
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,660
All right, here we go.

516
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,525
Mick, we don't have to do this.

517
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,980
No, it's time.

518
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,460
I need to see where he goes.

519
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,510
Go ahead.

520
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,240
I mean,
he's not looking around.

521
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,340
Not checking his phone.

522
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,230
Doesn't seem like he's meeting anybody.

523
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,150
He always used to tell me he didn't smoke,

524
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,350
and I smelled it on him,

525
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,020
and he'd blame it on the detectives at work.

526
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,480
He lie about the drinking, too?

527
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,620
No, I never saw him drunk.

528
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,790
Hmm.
- He likes control.

529
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,240
That's his favorite vice.

530
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,270
Can I ask you about your gambling?

531
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,090
What do you want to know?

532
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,185
You just don't seem like
someone with a problem.

533
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,790
Oh, it's a problem.

534
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
I sit at a hot table.

535
00:33:55,895 --> 00:33:57,895
I could lose days.

536
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,405
Always paid my debts, though...

537
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:09,085
...no matter how creative I had to get.

538
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,810
But it was a problem for Sheila.

539
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,910
Sometimes...

540
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,395
...she didn't believe it was
gambling keeping me out late.

541
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,820
What's your blackjack?

542
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,730
The only thing that comes close
is playing music.

543
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,830
English horn?

544
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,805
I don't know what that sounds like.

545
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,370
Well...

546
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,730
Here's...

547
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,500
...my favorite composer,
Franz Liszt.

548
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,680
It's this Gretchen scene
from his Faust symphony.

549
00:34:50,765 --> 00:34:52,100
That is it. That's it.

550
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,670
You hear that resonance?
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,210
It kind of, like, shimmers.

552
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,810
That's the reed.
- Hmm.

553
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,180
I make my own.

554
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,460
Well, I used to, uh...

555
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,085
Yeah, before I pawned it.

556
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,790
What's the going rate
for a used English horn?

557
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,225
The guy at Front Street
got the deal of the century.

558
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,660
English horn is often
described as melancholy,

559
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,605
and it is, but it's also the
inner voice of the orchestra.

560
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,320
It's wistful, and poignant.

561
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,730
You picked the one that sounds like you.

562
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,670
He's out.

563
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,660
Where is he going?

564
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,760
No idea.

565
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,770
You're the reason
she's so unhappy all the time.

566
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,970
Kacey, stop.

567
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,240
She never went back to Penn.
And now she's a fucking cop.

568
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,106
Hold on. Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

569
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:37,340
No.

570
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,380
You're the reason
Mickey dropped out of school.

571
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,110
She gave it up so she could be near you.

572
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,118
You're like a fucking anvil around your...

573
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:45,220
...sister's neck, and
you're bringing her down.

574
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,380
What about you, Simon?

575
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
I hear you leave at night real late. Sure.

576
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,720
Where do you go, Simon?
Where do you go?

577
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,764
You're nuts, maybe you're
dreaming that shit.

578
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:52,390
Simon, Simon.

579
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,690
Where do you go at night?

580
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,390
Where do you go at night?
- Just... Just, please.

581
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,390
Where the fuck do you go?

582
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,490
Hey! Hey!
- Fucking...

583
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,020
Mick.

584
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,470
Get your bag and get out.

585
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,545
You're gonna let this happen, Mickey?

586
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,830
Your fucking choice.

587
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,300
Oh, my God.
- What?

588
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
That's Dock's abando.

589
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,685
What the hell is he doing here?

590
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,870
Oh, my God.

591
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
She's running from him.

592
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,580
Shit.
He's following her.

593
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Truman.

594
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,700
Agh!

595
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,980
Get down.

596
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,000
Wait! No!
- He's gonna hurt her!

597
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,755
He's not hurting her.
I think she's working.

598
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,910
I thought he was going to kill her.

599
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,010
We both did.

600
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,090
He's home for the night.

601
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,020
He'll brush his teeth.

602
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Slip into bed.

603
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,200
Tell her he doesn't smoke.

604
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,510
We can get him for solicitation.

605
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
No.

606
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,940
I know he's done worse.

607
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,885
I don't know what the next step is.

608
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,460
Mick, I'mma take you home.

609
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:23,140
We can figure this out tomorrow, okay?

610
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,060
Hey, I can't really talk right now.

611
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
I'm running late.
And I need to get out on patrol.

612
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,530
This will just take a second.
- Okay.

613
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,080
Can you meet me at Duke's tonight at 7:00.

614
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,700
Duke's? Why?

615
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,640
We need someone to hear us out on Simon.

616
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,570
A neutral third party
to help figure out what's next.

617
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,780
Who?
- Mike DiPaolo.

618
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,950
He said he's been working closely
with the detective you mentioned.

619
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,600
Danjarat?
- Yeah, that's right.

620
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,680
Truman. I don't know.

621
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,620
After what Paula said,
do you think we can trust...

622
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,990
I've known DiPaolo a long time, Mick.

623
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,560
We can trust him.

624
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,140
I promise.

625
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,590
Okay, I'll be there.

626
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,960
Just need to make sure
Bethany can watch Thomas, okay?

627
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,300
All right.
- All right.

628
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,200
Thank you for coming last
minute. I won't be late. Okay?

629
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,910
And maybe you can help Thomas
put together...

630
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,570
...his costume for the holiday concert?

631
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,980
It's all in this box right here, Bethany.

632
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,880
Hey. Is everything okay?

633
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,550
Yeah. Halloween costumes.
Got it.

634
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,650
We'll do it tomorrow.

635
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:22,020
Okay. Uh, where are you going?

636
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,120
I have a meeting.

637
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,220
What kind of meeting?

638
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,945
Um, a meeting I wish I didn't have to have.

639
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,010
Hey.
- Hey, you all right.

640
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,310
Little nervous, I guess.

641
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,410
I got this for you.

642
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,250
Mick, you're gonna be fine.

643
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,350
Hey, bud.

644
00:42:52,415 --> 00:42:54,820
Sorry I'm late. Work shit.
- Hey.

645
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,160
Ooh. Look at this. Dimly lit
table, and a double Beam?

646
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,890
What is this, a date? Cheers. Hey,
Mike. Ah. We met at this guy's birthday.

647
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,160
Yeah, birthday. Yeah. Mickey. I remember.
- Good to see you again, Mickey.

648
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,900
Like I said, what we're gonna
talk about here, it's confidential.

649
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,165
Yeah. Can't wait to hear
what you two got cooking.

650
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,735
Do you know Detective Simon Cleare?

651
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,740
Uh, I know who he is.

652
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,560
Yeah. He works down in...
in South.

653
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,310
You were there, too,
weren't you?

654
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,640
Yes. A long time ago
when I first got on the force.

655
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:31,160
I'm working the Kensington
murders, and two of the victims...

656
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,920
...were under Detective Cleare's watch...

657
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,060
...at the local Police Youth Club.

658
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,800
And I know with certainty that...

659
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,800
...he was using the facility
to target young women...

660
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,300
...for unethical reasons.

661
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,070
Because he targeted me.
- Look, whatever this is about--

662
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,280
Cleare is a strong match to a video...

663
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,310
...that the department believes
is a person of interest.

664
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,780
Off the video, we had a
woman come in with a tip,

665
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,880
said we need to be looking for a
cop soliciting women in Kensington.

666
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,955
I'm sorry. I gotta stop you.
- Mike.

667
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,270
Let her finish.

668
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,990
Last night,
we personally witnessed

669
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,000
Cleare soliciting a young woman
in Kensington.

670
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,030
Okay? My sister,
Kacey Fitzpatrick,

671
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,510
is missing.
- We got the guy.

672
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,890
What?

673
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
He's behind bars.

674
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:25,940
How real is it?

675
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,950
State DNA database
linked him to multiple victims.

676
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:31,050
Who is it?

677
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,850
Sean Kelly.
- Sean Kelly?

678
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:37,435
The guy you arrested
on DV a few days ago.

679
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,390
No.

680
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,230
Yeah.
He's a real piece of shit.

681
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,050
No.

682
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,950
Look... you wanted me to hear you out.

683
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:55,110
That business with Cleare,
he sounds like a real asshole,

684
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:59,060
but for this case, it's just...
he's just not the guy.

685
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,160
He got mixed up.

686
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,355
Whatever's going on here,

687
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
it's not a good look.

688
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,440
I'm saying that it feels personal.

689
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,050
You should let it go.

690
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:37,330
Can I have another Citywide, please?
- I don't want one.

691
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,950
I grew up in a Mummers club.

692
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:43,025
You drink these to forget your day.

693
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,200
I need two of them.

694
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,310
Sean Kelly?

695
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,040
He's not a cop.

696
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,180
They got him on DNA.

697
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,190
Paula said he was a cop.

698
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,840
It seems Paula was wrong.

699
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,260
Yeah. Yeah.

700
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:07,140
Just like me.
So fucking wrong.

701
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:11,330
I don't remember the last time I was right.

702
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,980
We were both wrong about this.

703
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,450
You all right?

704
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,290
Bethany's not here.

705
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,300
Oh, my God! Where is she?
Her car's not here.

706
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:46,100
Mickey. Mickey.
Don't go in.

707
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,950
Damn it.
- Thomas!

708
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,050
Thomas!

709
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,430
They're not here.
She's not answering.

710
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:02,100
No, no, she didn't...
She didn't text me.

711
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,365
He's been taken.
- Let me see the security camera.

712
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,180
Michaela...

713
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:36,271
Oh.

714
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:38,940
What happened? Where's
Thomas? Where's Thomas?

715
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,590
He's downstairs, sleeping.
You can come and get him now.

716
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:45,940
Oh, my God.

717
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,480
Bethany had to leave. She
asked if I could watch Thomas.

718
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,220
Didn't she text?
- No, she didn't text me.

719
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,320
Oh dear, I'm sorry.

720
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:01,410
You can come and grab
Thomas now if you like.

721
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,540
I love you.

722
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,640
I hope you know that.

723
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,325
I know I don't say that enough.

724
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,730
I love you so much.

725
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:11,985
I can't believe I lost it
like that when he wasn't here.

726
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:16,690
Spent his whole life afraid
of somebody coming for him.

727
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,790
Yeah, I get it.

728
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,160
I'm a parent.

729
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,495
And I got some words for Bethany.

730
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,450
Thank you for everything.

731
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,720
Everything, like...
- Of course.

732
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,990
For being there for me.

733
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:38,490
All these times,
for just having my back.

734
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,410
For believing me.

735
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:47,350
For not judging me.

736
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:26,340
Mick... Mickey, no.
- What?

737
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,605
You've had a few drinks.
- I'm okay. Are you okay?

738
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,130
Yeah.
