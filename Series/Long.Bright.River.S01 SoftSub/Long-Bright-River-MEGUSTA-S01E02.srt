1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,520
Possible homicide.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,760
I'll call in forensics.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,060
Previously on Long Bright River...

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,630
There might be a bad batch
of something out there.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,100
We've noticed an increase
in ODs all over the city.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,330
How do we know that they were ODs?

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,200
There wasn't enough of anything
in her system for it to be an OD.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,040
So what was it?
- Insulin.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,200
You want to know what's weird?

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,810
I have no evidence that she was diabetic.

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,460
You think somebody killed her?

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,210
The receipt that you found on
the girl down the A Street tracks...

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,110
...is from a gas station
outside of the airport.

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,650
The girl that OD'd this week
had a napkin from 7 Brothers.

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,220
Would Elizabeth have any reason
to be down at the airport?

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,182
She would have no reason
to be down there.

17
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:45,460
Help!

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,630
You talked to Truman lately?

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,990
No. Why?

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,530
Some of the guys were talking
about your last partner.

21
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,300
You two still talk?
- No.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,300
How come? -We just don't.
Why are you pressing me on it?

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,770
Listen, what happened to these
girls, it's not their fault.

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,590
But we can't let all of them go.

25
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,660
She's my sister.

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm worried about what you're going to find.

27
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,780
So am I.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
He asleep?

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,710
Get some rest.

30
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,080
We'll talk in the morning. I...

31
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,760
I made up the couch for you.

32
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,860
Thanks.

33
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,580
Truman...

34
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,590
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,365
I didn't have your back that day.

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,250
I think I froze.

37
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,770
And I'm... I'm... I'm really
sorry that you got hurt.

38
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,435
It's the wrong apology, Mick.

39
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,660
Everybody makes mistakes. But
you didn't come around afterward.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,310
You didn't come by the hospital.

41
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,230
Nothing.

42
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,260
It's been months,

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,185
and I didn't hear anything
from you until now.

44
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,800
And I thought we were friends.

45
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,990
That's your apology.

46
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,320
Mick, hurry up!

47
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,750
Jesus, were you asleep already?
It's, like, 9:00.

48
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,850
I'm working A-shift tomorrow.
I was gonna go to the gym.

49
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,820
Where's Simon?

50
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
He went down to AC.

51
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,850
Chinese food?

52
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,950
What's the occasion?

53
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,540
One year.

54
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,670
Mick, you trying to shake my hand?

55
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,990
I'm so sorry. No.
- You were trying to shake my hand.

56
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,090
Kace...

57
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,550
I told him, when you gotta go,
you gotta go.

58
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,020
He didn't believe that you were gonna do it.

59
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,620
Oh, my God. He was so mad at me.

60
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,890
You gotta tell Gee.
You gotta tell him.

61
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,990
Tell Gee what?

62
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
About your token.

63
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,820
It's a big deal, Kace.
- Mm-hmm.

64
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,040
He's not gonna care.

65
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,000
That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

66
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,840
You're the only one left who believes in me.

67
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,860
Is that Mom's?

68
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,030
Yeah.

69
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,840
I don't think I've ever seen it off your neck.

70
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,940
The clasp broke.

71
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,698
Oh.
- Happened once before.

72
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:19,660
I was four years old.

73
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,500
And I pulled it off her neck accidentally...

74
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,070
...when she picked me up.

75
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,010
She get mad?

76
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,360
No. She never got mad.

77
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,490
You don't remember?

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You miss her.

79
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Don't you?

80
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,010
Mm.

81
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,315
I can't remember her, Mick.

82
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,920
Yeah, like, not a single thing.
- What?

83
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,580
Yes, you do. You remember Mom.

84
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,480
You tell stories about her all the time.

85
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,450
Yeah,
but they're all your stories.

86
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,355
They're stories that you told me.

87
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,345
I wanna remember. I just don't.

88
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,440
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

89
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,600
Just tonight,
just while Simon's out.

90
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,880
Please.

91
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,110
Fine.
- Yes!

92
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,210
Thank you.
- Mm.

93
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Mm.

94
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Mickey?

95
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,710
What?

96
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,525
Thank you for letting me back in.

97
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,495
Next time,
don't forget your keys.

98
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,130
That's not what I meant.

99
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,060
Okay, so, remember.

100
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Sugar...

101
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,100
...flour.

102
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,850
What else?

103
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,070
Uh, eggs.

104
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,170
Eggs. How many eggs?

105
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,990
Two. Three.

106
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,730
So...

107
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,810
...baking powder, pinch of salt...

108
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,620
...little bit of milk.

109
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,080
Okay, and you mix it up, and
that's how we get the batter right.

110
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,620
Right. So the key when
you're putting it in the pan,

111
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,990
is not to make 'em too big,

112
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:02,530
'cause if you do, then the batter
won't cook all the way through.

113
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,880
There you go.

114
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,600
What's this little fella's name?

115
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,240
Oh, that... that's Dun-Dun.

116
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,510
Dun-Dun, huh?

117
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,790
What does Dun-Dun want
for breakfast this morning?

118
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,910
Um...

119
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,610
Chocolate chip, blueberries?

120
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,705
I think Dun-Dun wants plain.
- Plain, all right.

121
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,650
Good morning, Mom.

122
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,860
These are great pancakes,
Thomas. You did such a good job.

123
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,090
Thank you.

124
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,190
Hmm. Mm.

125
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,560
How you likin' your
plain pancakes, Dun-Dun?

126
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,630
Oh, he... He doesn't talk.

127
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,020
What do you mean,
he doesn't talk?

128
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,820
You can't hear him?

129
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Listen.

130
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,970
Mm-hmm.

131
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,740
Okay.

132
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,280
I mean, we can agree to disagree...

133
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,525
...but I...
I like the blueberry ones.

134
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,290
He's getting so big.

135
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,130
Hmm. Tell me about it.

136
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,600
I can barely remember the girls at that age.

137
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
You know, you blink, and...

138
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,930
Yeah. Do you get to see them
that much these days?

139
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,770
Yeah. When they come home
from school, here and there.

140
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,590
But not...

141
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,985
...not as much as I'd like.

142
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,790
You gonna tell me what's going on?

143
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
It's Kacey.

144
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,920
How long's she been gone this time?

145
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,020
Like, six weeks.

146
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,600
Feels like just yesterday,
she was standing...

147
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,185
...in the supper line at St. Francis Inn.

148
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:50,200
And these victims,
any connection to Kacey?

149
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,890
Other than the fact that
they all worked the Avenue...

150
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,640
So Kacey has been missing six weeks.

151
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,830
And most of these girls' bodies showed
up days after they disappeared, right?

152
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,950
So?
- So maybe it's unrelated.

153
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,990
Kacey's gone missing before.
- I know.

154
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,860
But in Alonzo's video, Kacey was picked
up by a john in a red pickup truck.

155
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,890
I saw a red pickup truck
outside of my house,

156
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,830
and I think I saw a red pickup
truck in Kensington, too.

157
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,060
You think he's been
following you? -I don't know.

158
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,200
My landlord said that a guy
got out of the truck,

159
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,670
was asking about me, and she tried to
describe him. I have no idea who it is.

160
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,970
I thought it might have been Simon,

161
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,300
but he doesn't own a red pickup truck.

162
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,030
Let's assume it was a john that
picked up Kacey in that truck.

163
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,700
What the hell was he doing
outside your house? -I don't know.

164
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,800
I don't like this, Mick.
- Yeah, I don't like it either.

165
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,160
I gotta get going.

166
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,760
I gotta drop Thomas off at
Gee's house before I go to work.

167
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,325
Look, I'll... I'll watch him.

168
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:51,000
Really?
- Yeah.

169
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,680
He and Dun-Dun can
do my errands with me.

170
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,740
Thank you.

171
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,100
Yeah. Yeah, it's...
It's all right.

172
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,310
I'm gonna go and ask around
near the airport,

173
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,310
and see if anybody recognizes the victims.

174
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,910
Maybe it'll explain why those girls
were down there before they were killed.

175
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,950
I'll make some calls, too.

176
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,020
And see what Ahearn's saying,
behind the scenes.

177
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,290
Ahearn thinks they're all accidental
ODs. It's less work that way.

178
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,520
If it was just fentanyl and tranq...

179
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,390
...in the victims' systems, I'd
agree with him. But insulin?

180
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,880
That's a whole other ball game. Not
even Ahearn can turn a blind eye to that.

181
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,120
I'm going to say goodbye to Thomas.

182
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,900
Mick.
- Yeah.

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,860
I don't want you going back
to that house alone.

184
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,060
You need to tell someone at the
station about that red truck.

185
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,360
Ahearn's not gonna listen to me.

186
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,460
Make him.

187
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,240
Okay, folks, this is Detective Davis
Danger-rat of the East Detectives.

188
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,950
He's got a flash for youse.

189
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,200
I'll give him the floor.
Detective.

190
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,150
Danjarat.

191
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,395
Excuse me?
- It's pronounced Danjarat.

192
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,290
Okay.

193
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,060
Over the past several days, three
females in their late teens, early 20s,

194
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,430
have been found dead here, here and here.

195
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,230
Taylor Yoon, Elizabeth O'Connor,
and an un-ID'd third victim.

196
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,970
Time of death, sometime during
Halloween weekend.

197
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,510
All three were likely sex workers,

198
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,510
and all three were, at first, believed
to have died via opioid overdose.

199
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,810
However, all three were determined...

200
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,850
...to have lethal amounts
of insulin in their system.

201
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,180
Were they diabetic?

202
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,520
No. Either someone's putting
insulin in the supply these days,

203
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,890
or there may be a single
perpetrator of multiple homicides...

204
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,460
...at large in your district.

205
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,930
Maybe the killer was diabetic.

206
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,260
Could be. We're looking into anyone
recently arrested for solicitation...

207
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,270
...whose medical records
also indicate diabetes.

208
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,940
I know that's a long shot, but
we don't have much else to go on.

209
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,870
Just be on the lookout going forward.

210
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,810
Any rumors you hear,
anything suspicious you see,

211
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,510
please report it directly
to Sergeant A-hearn or myself.

212
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,610
Ahearn.

213
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,120
Ahearn.

214
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,020
But now, more than ever,
all of you on patrol...

215
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
...need to keep your eyes open out there.

216
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,520
Ain't easy to tell a dead body from
your everyday nodder on the Ave.

217
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,560
Which is why we need to wake them up.

218
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,130
Make sure they're breathing.

219
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,350
Seems like it should be policy anyway.

220
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,400
Thank you.

221
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
All right, that's all.

222
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,440
Hey, hey. Can I talk to you a second?

223
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,410
Right... right now? -Please.
Yeah. I just have a quick question.

224
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,840
Well, I mean, more like an idea.

225
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,410
Yeah, yeah.
Just give me a second.

226
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,910
I'll... I'll...
I'll be right back.

227
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,250
Detective Danjarat, hi.

228
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,880
Sorry. I just... There's
something I have to tell you.

229
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,020
Uh, a couple of the
women from the Avenue...

230
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,920
...have been talking about seeing
this guy in a red pickup truck,

231
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,920
coming around and acting strange.

232
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,320
Have you heard anything about that? -No.

233
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,060
Well, they get a plate?
Make, model, any of that?

234
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,260
No, just a...
It's a red pickup truck.

235
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,920
Okay, well, thank you.
We'll keep an eye out.

236
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,470
You asked if the killer was diabetic.

237
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,890
It was my first thought, too.

238
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,510
We'll keep an eye out for that truck.

239
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,610
Thank you.

240
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,175
Possible domestic assault
in progress.31 G Street.

241
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,245
Possible domestic assault
in progress.31 G Street.

242
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,590
Come on.

243
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,490
56201 responding.

244
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,840
Hi, ma'am. I received a call
about a possible assault.

245
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,940
Did you make that call?

246
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,060
It wasn't me. I didn't call.

247
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,930
Well, somebody called.

248
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,070
Maybe it's somebody inside
with you. Maybe your kids.

249
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,170
Nope.

250
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,180
Uh, the laceration above
your eye looks pretty bad,

251
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,050
so I think you should get that checked out.

252
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,170
I could come in and take
a closer look if you want.

253
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,060
Laceration?

254
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,960
Who talks like that?
Just say 'cut.'

255
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,090
I'm sorry?

256
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,130
You don't remember me, do you?

257
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,320
I think you're thinking of a different person.

258
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,300
Mickey Fitzpatrick, right?
Kensington High School.

259
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,540
Mrs. Powell's history class?
First row?

260
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,340
Yeah.
- Yeah, well...

261
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,260
Fuck you, Mickey Fitzpatrick.
I don't need none of your help.

262
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,120
You always did think you were
better than everybody else.

263
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,760
Now, in a second,
I'm gonna teach you...

264
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,710
...how to arm and disarm
this thing. All right?

265
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,190
Okay.
- Okay.

266
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,000
Truman, why do we even need an alarm?

267
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,600
I mean, everybody should have one, really.

268
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,640
But it's just something that
will let the right people in.

269
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,590
And keep the wrong people
out, okay? You understand?

270
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,690
Do you have one?

271
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,500
No.

272
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,610
I'll get one, though.

273
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,380
Excuse me.

274
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,450
Hello, ma'am.

275
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,250
May I ask who you are...

276
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,690
...and what exactly you are mounting
to the wall I just had repainted?

277
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,330
He's my mom's friend.

278
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,660
He's installing a security system.

279
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,130
It lets the right people in,
and keeps the wrong people out.

280
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,330
Well,
thank you, Thomas.

281
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,745
And who exactly are the 'wrong people'?

282
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,460
Name's Truman.

283
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,080
Cecilia Mahon.

284
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,180
What a lovely name.

285
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,160
Well, thank you.

286
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,180
I told Michaela I didn't want
any trouble around here.

287
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,490
There's no trouble, ma'am.

288
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:23,560
Hey, Thomas.
You want to go finish up for me?

289
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,660
Okay?

290
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,660
I installed a camera outside.

291
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
It covers the whole property.

292
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,580
Can't be safe enough these days.

293
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,700
I suppose you're right, Truman.

294
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,000
But I'll tell you something.

295
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,620
I'm not convinced that Michaela's
not in some kind of trouble.

296
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,110
And if I'm being honest.

297
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,760
I worry about that little boy.

298
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
Is that Mickey?

299
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,520
No, that's not her.
- Fran, is that Mickey?

300
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,320
It don't look like her, Twohey.
She's bigger than that.

301
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,790
Assuming you don't
want anything stronger.

302
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,410
Mm.

303
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,470
Well, she's thirsty,
whoever she is. Mm.

304
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,370
Hello, Mr. McGivney, Mr. Twohey.
How are you doing? -It is Mickey.

305
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,400
I told you that, McGivney.

306
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,810
Mickey, how come you don't
come around here no more?

307
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,480
I do sometimes.
- Oh, hardly.

308
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,450
Mick, are you still playin'
the horn? She was incredible.

309
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,550
When she was a little girl,
no bigger than this bar,

310
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,680
she came in here, gave us a
concert. Wore a ball gown.

311
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,650
Yeah. I was there, McGivney.
It was not a ball gown.

312
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,220
That was a, you know,
a whatchmacallit, a... a jumper.

313
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,510
Idiots.

314
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,360
You need something?
Where's Thomas?

315
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,300
Have you heard from Cousin
Bobby, or Cousin Hailey recently?

316
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,700
No. Why are you asking?

317
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,340
Because Kacey's missing.

318
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,670
And I've texted them,

319
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,710
and I haven't gotten a response. Ah.

320
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,530
Kacey is always missing.
That's what she does.

321
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,420
I'm worried.

322
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,850
Have you heard anything about the girls...

323
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,720
...from the Ave that were killed?

324
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,750
No.

325
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,850
Never mind.

326
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,190
I just think that something might have...

327
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,190
...happened to her this time.

328
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,360
Ain't nothing different about this time,

329
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,925
or the 600 times before this.

330
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,530
I don't know why you keep
letting that girl in.

331
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,710
Yeah, I gotta go.
But thanks for the water.

332
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,620
If you hear from them, can
you just tell them to call me?

333
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
And Aunt Lynn, too?

334
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,930
Thank you.

335
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:09,985
Mick.

336
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,895
Bring the kid by when you can.
Maybe he'd like to see the place.

337
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,510
Or don't.

338
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,930
Oh, Michaela.

339
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,370
Come sit in with us sometime, will you?

340
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,300
Yeah.
- We could use a horn.

341
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,910
Sundays and Wednesday nights, 8:00,

342
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,070
right here in the clubhouse.

343
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,740
She's too good for Golden
Slippers, McGivney. -Oh.

344
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,380
She's classically trained.

345
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,280
Oh. Classically trained!

346
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,780
I would absolutely love to do that,

347
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,880
but I work those times.

348
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,125
But thank you for asking.

349
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,740
You stay safe, Mickey.

350
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Ow.

351
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,350
Whoa!

352
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,500
Jesus. What is this?

353
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,540
Uh, that's our new alarm. Truman put it in.

354
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,660
Do you like it?

355
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,260
Huh.

356
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Hi, Michaela.

357
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,680
We're having a little tea.

358
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
I can see that.

359
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,030
Where's Truman?

360
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,130
He's in the restroom.

361
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,860
I hope I'm not intruding.

362
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,465
Thomas was so curious
about my tea service collection.

363
00:21:30,518 --> 00:21:33,570
And then he wanted to show me
this wonderful project...

364
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:38,290
...that he's working on,
and introduce me to your family.

365
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,390
Mm. Can I see?

366
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,035
It's... It's really coming
together. It's good, bud.

367
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,990
Hi.
- Hi.

368
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,090
Hey.

369
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,000
Well...

370
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm going to excuse myself now.

371
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,400
I imagine that it's time for dinner.

372
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,010
But it was so nice to get to know
you a little bit better, Thomas.

373
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,110
And uh...

374
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,130
Nice to see you, Michaela.

375
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:16,690
Oh, and thank you for the
tea. -Oh. You're so welcome.

376
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,800
Will you go wash up for dinner?
- Yeah.

377
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,110
What?

378
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,660
She's nice.
- She's nosy.

379
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,500
She's...

380
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,030
You shouldn't have invited her up,

381
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,190
she's gonna expect that from now on.

382
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,900
Good fences, right?

383
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,500
Yeah.
- Hey, Mom.

384
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,810
Teacher Dana called.

385
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,590
She said she needed to meet
with you tomorrow before school.

386
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,010
Okay.

387
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,510
Everything okay with that?

388
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,050
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

389
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,350
You find out anything about that truck?

390
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:56,090
Not yet. I told this new detective
they have working the case.

391
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,170
Davis Danjarat. Do you know him?

392
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,460
No.
- He's good.

393
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,900
He seems to care.
He's looking into it.

394
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,100
You make it to the airport
today? -No, I didn't.

395
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,175
A call came in,
so I had to take it.

396
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,940
Of course you did.
- I almost didn't.

397
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,225
Your sister is missing. Kind of
trumps everything else, right?

398
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,810
I better be heading out.

399
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,480
Left instructions for you
on the alarm system.

400
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,820
It has an emergency SOS feature
that will call me if you need help.

401
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,790
Thank you for...

402
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,190
For watching Thomas.
He likes spending time with you.

403
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,980
I like spending time with him.
- Hmm.

404
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
And his mom.

405
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,160
I'll let the two of you eat.

406
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,790
Truman.

407
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,090
You were right.

408
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,620
I should've called.

409
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,090
Better late than never.

410
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Night, Mick.
- Night.

411
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
Hmm.

412
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,370
Keys? Again?

413
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,970
Sorry.

414
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,290
Kace.
- Yep.

415
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,830
No.

416
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
I tried, Mickey.

417
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,140
I really did.

418
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,710
A whole year.

419
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
How?

420
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,895
It wasn't my fault,
you know, I tried.

421
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,310
I tried.

422
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,660
Well, you didn't try hard enough.

423
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,100
You know the deal.

424
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,170
I know.

425
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,110
One more night.

426
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Please, Michaela.

427
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,200
I don't have anywhere else to go.

428
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
One.

429
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,545
And then you need to leave.

430
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,295
You're gonna end up like her.

431
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Fuck.

432
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,230
I'm going.

433
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,135
I'm really sorry, Mickey.

434
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,250
I know.

435
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,205
But you still have to go.

436
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,030
Miss Fitzpatrick, I just
wanted to check in with you...

437
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,080
...about the emails I've sent about tuition.

438
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,300
Yeah, I um...

439
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,170
I... I... I did receive them,
and I'm... I'm sorry, I...

440
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,010
We've been in the middle of a move,

441
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,745
so I was gonna get back to you.

442
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:25,780
As you know, we at Valley Green...

443
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,410
...make an effort to be
inclusive of all demographics...

444
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,020
...when making admissions decisions.

445
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,490
I personally believe no child should be
held back in education because of means.

446
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,950
We've done our best to offer Thomas...

447
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,320
...the best package we can produce.

448
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:41,860
But at this point, your part of
the equation is four months late.

449
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,010
Hey, you were right about that truck.

450
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,110
Sorry?
- The red truck.

451
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,210
Cross-checked it against crimes in the area.

452
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,380
A few weeks back,
Vice busted a trap house nearby.

453
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,250
Said they saw a red truck fleeing the scene.

454
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,120
Now they... they didn't get a
plate. But we're keeping an eye out.

455
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,520
Do you know where the house is?

456
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,360
It's off Opal Street, I think.

457
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,260
Oh, and we also got an eyewitness
account on a possible suspect...

458
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,130
...in the murder of one
of the three girls, Taylor Yoon.

459
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,370
A woman reported seeing a man
leaving the scene...

460
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,530
...wearing a Wildwood sweatshirt.

461
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,840
That mean anything to you?

462
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,470
Just ask around if you can.

463
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,270
Okay. Thanks.

464
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,440
Yeah.

465
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,010
Hey, so I, uh, heard you spent
some time in West Philly?

466
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,010
A couple of the guys
said you went to Penn.

467
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,420
I did undergrad.
Graduated in 2015.

468
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,900
I... I only went for a year.

469
00:30:40,975 --> 00:30:44,800
Still. I knew there was a reason I liked you.

470
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,490
May I help you?

471
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,450
'Kay.

472
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,090
And what the frig kinda instrument is that?

473
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,450
It's an English horn.

474
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,890
It was played by one of the members
of the Philadelphia Orchestra...

475
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,290
...when Eugene Ormandy was conducting.

476
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,660
It's 60 years old.

477
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,330
You got any papers on it?

478
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,630
No, it was a gift.

479
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,300
From Freeman's when they
were in Center City.

480
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,500
I went there.
I tried to sell it through them,

481
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,640
but they, um, they said...

482
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,670
...it would take too long
to investigate the provenance.

483
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,080
And I need the money now.

484
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,155
How much you looking to get for it?

485
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,250
$8,500.

486
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,350
Yeah, okay.

487
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,220
Well, it's worth more than that.

488
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,490
I'm sure. I'll tell you what.

489
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,670
Without any papers, best
I could do is two grand.

490
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,470
This is $2,000.

491
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,100
That's less than a month of our
standard tuition. -No, I know.

492
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,110
I... I'm working on gettin' the rest,

493
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,710
but I'm just gonna need
a little bit more time.

494
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,380
I've tried calling Thomas's
father on numerous occasions,

495
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,380
but he hasn't returned any of my calls.

496
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,650
Perhaps I have
the wrong number in my file...

497
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,230
Oh, no, you don't have the wrong number.

498
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,330
I see.

499
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,740
Mickey, I...

500
00:32:23,825 --> 00:32:25,490
At a certain point,

501
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,190
maybe it's worth considering
whether Valley Green...

502
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,000
...is still the best fit for your situation.

503
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,230
My situation?

504
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,070
I just mean since your
finances seem to have changed.

505
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,805
I'm doing the best I can, okay?

506
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
Come on, let's go.

507
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,220
Mom, why were you talking
to Teacher Dana?

508
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,635
Did that have something to do with Dad?

509
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,210
Mickey...

510
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,830
...it's me.

511
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,580
I thought we agreed that it's not a
good idea for Thomas to call right now.

512
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,370
I need this time.

513
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,770
I just have too many responsibilities.

514
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,845
You have to make Thomas understand.

515
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
Mom, are you okay?

516
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,860
Did you call your dad?

517
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,170
Thomas. Hey.

518
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,360
I was scared.

519
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,190
Scared of what?

520
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,480
The night we went to Truman's.

521
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,700
You...
- I what?

522
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
You looked scared, too.

523
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,570
And Truman was hooking up
those cameras,

524
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,500
and Mrs. Mahon said we were in trouble.

525
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,340
And I thought maybe if I called Dad,

526
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,960
and told him we were in trouble, then...

527
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,210
Are we in trouble?

528
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,435
No, we're not in trouble.

529
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,580
I'm so sorry I scared you.

530
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,750
Those... Those security cameras are
just out of an abundance of caution.

531
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,220
Daddy was mad that I called him.

532
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,090
No, he wasn't mad.
He was just worried.

533
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,360
That's why we can't just call him like that.

534
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,280
He'll... He'll get upset,
and you know, he's just...

535
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,620
Busy.

536
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,045
Do you know how strong you are?

537
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,170
I don't think I get that from him.

538
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,610
Let's get you cozy.

539
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,660
Don't forget about Dun-Dun.

540
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,880
You all right?

541
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,660
Yeah.

542
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,330
Okay, sweet dreams, bub.

543
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,670
No, no, no, no, no, no.

544
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,910
Hey, it's Kacey.
Leave a message.

545
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,270
Or don't.

546
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:34,310
Oh, God. Please don't tell me
you took... Mom's necklace, Kace.

547
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,910
Can you just bring it back?

548
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,650
Can you just bring back the necklace?

549
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,850
I will... I will do anything.
I will give you anything.

550
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,590
I just... I just really... Just
not that. I just need that back.

551
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,460
Okay? Please.

552
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,875
That is all I have left of Mom's, okay?

553
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,265
Excuse me.
Do you work here a lot?

554
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:12,930
Uh, six days a week.

555
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,250
I do something?

556
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,410
Have you seen either of these girls?

557
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,930
Ah... Can't say that I have.
They missing?

558
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,900
Deceased, unfortunately.
- Shit.

559
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,800
Well, no, I never seen 'em.

560
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,900
Okay. Thank you.

561
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,480
Excuse me. Do you recognize
any of these girls?

562
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,470
Maybe they were customers in here?

563
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,360
Mm. Ask Frank.
He practically lives here.

564
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,115
Hey, Frank. You seen either of these girls?

565
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,680
No.

566
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,900
Yeah, I know that girl. She's
been in here a couple of times.

567
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,440
I'm shit with names,
but I always remember a face.

568
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,840
Do you remember how long ago?

569
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,540
Week, week and a half.

570
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,710
She was in here with this guy,
Jimmy Scanlon.

571
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,380
Comes here all the time.

572
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,580
I remember because
they were fighting really bad.

573
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,730
Do you remember
what they were fighting about?

574
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,350
Home invasion in progress,
36 Ruth Street.

575
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,450
All units respond.

576
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,490
You gotta take that?
- No, it's okay.

577
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,320
I don't remember what she was saying.

578
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,460
I just remember how upset she was.

579
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,760
Upset at him, I mean.

580
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,760
Do you know where I can find this Jimmy...

581
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,800
Scanlon?
- Yeah.

582
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,875
Shop next door.
- All units respond.

583
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,760
26643 en route.

584
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,990
Excuse me.

585
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,350
I need to speak to Jimmy Scanlon.

586
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,450
That makes two of us.

587
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,460
He hasn't been in in days.

588
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,290
Been out since last Thursday.

589
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,330
Wife don't know where he is either.

590
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,030
Do you think something
might've happened to him?

591
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,800
Like what?

592
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,215
Do you recognize either of these girls?

593
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,020
No. Should I?

594
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,440
May I ask what Jimmy does here?

595
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,620
He's a sheet-metal worker,
the same as all of us.

596
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,055
Well, if he comes back...

597
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,020
...would you please have him call me?

598
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,120
Yeah, sure.

599
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,830
Thanks.
- All right.

600
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,400
Backup still requested at 36 Ruth Street.

601
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Please respond.

602
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,650
Hey. What are you doing here?

603
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,810
Probably same as you.

604
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,040
Look, that's what I was trying to
tell you at the station yesterday.

605
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,610
But you ran away.

606
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,410
Ever since we saw that dead girl.

607
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,510
I couldn't get her out of my head.

608
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,720
I thought somebody down here
might know something.

609
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,390
I told Ahearn about the napkin.

610
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,420
And he told me to come check it out.

611
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,560
Backup still requested at 36 Ruth Street.

612
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,890
You find anything?
- No.

613
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,390
Please respond.

614
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,860
Hey, Mickey.
- What?

615
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,760
I know you don't think
I give a shit about these girls,

616
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,670
but I do.

617
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,770
That's why I'm down here after my shift.

618
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,820
I thought a lot about
what you said the other day.

619
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,320
And you're right.

620
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,420
They deserve more.

621
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,850
Backup still requested.

622
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,100
All units respond.

623
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,590
Where the hell were you today?

624
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:39,385
I mean, what part of 'all units
respond' were you not understanding?

625
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,603
I'm sorry.
I was at lunch,

626
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:43,730
and I just lost track of time.

627
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:47,650
Well, far be it for me to get
in the middle of your downtime.

628
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,000
First, you want to ride solo,

629
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,640
then you're just MIA
in the middle of your shift?

630
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,735
What the hell is going on
with you, Fitzpatrick?

631
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,180
You should have told Ahearn, Mick.

632
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,480
Told him what?

633
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,110
About Kacey.

634
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,080
If he doesn't know, he can't put the
weight of the department behind you.

635
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,990
They've never been behind me.
- That's in your head.

636
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,090
Is it?

637
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,390
Listen, you're a good cop.

638
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:15,860
You care about the neighborhood,
you always follow the rules.

639
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,630
Ahearn knows that.
If he knew about Kacey,

640
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,870
maybe he'd understand
why you're breakin' 'em.

641
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,970
Ahearn's MO in life
is to do the least work possible...

642
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,670
...without getting on
the bad side of the union.

643
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,770
Am I wrong?

644
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,725
I got something else for you.

645
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,680
What?

646
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,800
You heard of a guy named
Dock McLatchie?

647
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,050
No. Why?

648
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,220
Well, he's got a bad reputation.
Rumor is, he's a gunrunner,

649
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,160
and he's tagged in a bunch of
pictures on Kacey's Facebook page.

650
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,730
Kacey doesn't have a Facebook page.

651
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,295
She hasn't had one for years.

652
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
Yes, she does.

653
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,185
You didn't know about this?

654
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,985
How do you know about this?

655
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:09,910
That first time, you told me
she was your sister.

656
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,180
I sent her a friend request.

657
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,500
I wanted to watch out for her.
For you.

658
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,180
Here, take a look.

659
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,730
Listen, I don't want to add to your worry,

660
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,800
but if it's the guy I'm thinking of,

661
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,950
he's not someone I'd want
my sister messing around with.

662
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,050
You recognize him?

663
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,460
I knew she was seeing somebody,
but I didn't know who it was.

664
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,930
What is it?

665
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,840
Come on.
Just live a little, man!

666
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,840
Come on.

667
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,080
Come on, Mickey.

668
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,250
Nothing.

669
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,020
Can you send me that picture of them?

670
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,130
Yeah, sure.

671
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,370
I had her arrested.
That's why she unfriended me.

672
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,220
When?

673
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,050
Like, ten years ago.

674
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,560
I reported her, and the
cops came in and took her.

675
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,260
What'd she get arrested for?
- Theft.

676
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,930
Wasn't the first time
she'd stolen from me, from Gee.

677
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,970
Cash, jewelry, silverware.

678
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,790
But this time, it was different.

679
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:39,745
My mom gave me this gold necklace.

680
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,940
It was right before she died.

681
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,940
Hm. -It was a little medal of St. Jude.

682
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,030
And Kacey knew how much it meant to me.

683
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,130
She stole it anyway.

684
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,150
She pawned it for a fix.
And I...

685
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,940
...couldn't forgive her.

686
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,280
Please,
let me in! Please, Mickey!

687
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,310
We're family.

688
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,080
Please let me in, Mickey.

689
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,420
Please let me in.

690
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,930
Please, Mickey!

691
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:24,920
I shouldn't have called the cops on her.

692
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,100
I shouldn't have taken it
out of the family. But...

693
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
I did.

694
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,380
And that was the beginning of the end...

695
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
...for us.

696
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,705
It's one thing to be a cop.

697
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,760
It's another thing to use the
police against your sister.

698
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,410
You were upset.

699
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,910
You had every right to be.

700
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:55,730
There's no way you could've
known this might happen.

701
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,635
It was never the same,
after that.

702
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,750
You haven't talked to her since?

703
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,820
She came to live with me
and Simon a couple times.

704
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,300
She was in and out of rehab.

705
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:12,185
We fought a lot when she was there.

706
00:44:12,273 --> 00:44:15,163
And the last fight was really bad.

707
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,450
I didn't choose her.

708
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,040
And I should've.

709
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,430
And so when that call
came over the radio today.

710
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,530
I did.

711
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,645
And I want to find her so I can tell her.

712
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,870
Tell her what?

713
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,830
That she meant more than a necklace.

714
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,940
We'll find her.

715
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,290
Come on.

716
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,910
Thomas, are you almost done
with your homework?

717
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,730
I'm just finishing up some math.

718
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:11,260
You want to do the rest at Gee-Pop's?

719
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
Yes.

720
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:19,730
Hey, the car
hasn't even stopped yet, Thomas.

721
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,370
Sorry, Mom.

722
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,470
Can I go now?
- Yep.

723
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,920
Gee-Pop!

724
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,320
A visit with my great-grandson
on a school night.

725
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,140
You got a hot date or something?

726
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,990
No.
- Probably wouldn't be...

727
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,520
...the worst thing in the world for you.

728
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,620
Gee.

729
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,000
You're gonna go look for her, aren't you?

730
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,770
I haven't heard anything
back from the cousins.

731
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,330
Sounds like a good thing to me.

732
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:59,140
It feels like they would rather
lose Kacey than help me out.

733
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,270
Forget 'em.

734
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:03,790
Those two zeros got nothing
to be judgmental about.

735
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,890
Gee-Pop, you coming?

736
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,755
Yeah, yeah.
Hold your horses, kid.

737
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,675
You had every right to do what you did.

738
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,140
Fuck those O'Briens.

739
00:46:16,215 --> 00:46:19,955
Always were the weakest link in this family.

740
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,850
Hello, Mickey.
