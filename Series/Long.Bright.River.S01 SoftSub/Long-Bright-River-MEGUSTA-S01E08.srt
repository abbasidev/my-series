1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,750
I ran autopsies,
and all three came back...

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,990
...with a lethal amount
of insulin in their system.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,830
Looks like someone's
going after these girls.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,930
Kacey's not missing anymore. Found her.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,070
How'd she look?
- Sober.

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,240
And pregnant.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,140
I'm sorry I made you worry.
I just... I was scared.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,045
That I would take this baby, too?

9
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:33,010
That you'd be right to take her.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,280
I spoke too soon about Dock.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,320
You know his abando
got burned down yesterday.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,920
Word on the street,
it was his old supplier.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,550
Old supplier,
means there's a new one.

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,460
Always is.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,260
There's a whole lot of product there.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,560
So we were right about what
Scanlon was doing with his boat.

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,760
If Jimmy was bringing it in, maybe the
women were taking it out to the streets.

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,760
Do you know any dealers
who would trust someone...

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,270
...in active addiction
to run their supply for them?

20
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,040
Paula says that
the guy in the video is a cop,

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,900
and then she ends up dead.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,540
We've been cross-referencing Scanlon
with all the women on the Avenue.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,980
But maybe we should've just
been crossing him with cops.

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,580
I found her.
I found Melissa.

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,230
Did you... What did she say to
you? Did she tell you who shot her?

26
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,390
She said the killer is Truman Dawes.

27
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,300
Listen, what happened to these
girls is not their fault.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
But we can't let all of them go.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,090
Mickey. It's still our job to police them.

30
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,670
Mickey, hey.

31
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,860
Maybe they'll be better if they
knew someone was watching them.

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,590
No, it's not Truman.

33
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,690
It... it can't be.

34
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,450
Are you sure? Emily Morris
said he was the killer.

35
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,970
Yeah.

36
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,350
What else did she say?

37
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,020
Nothing. That was it.
- What else?

38
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,290
Kacey.
- Nothing. Nothing.

39
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,490
She didn't want to talk to me, Mickey.

40
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,160
She was scared to tell me.
Scared I'd tell you.

41
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,160
Scared that he'll come after her.

42
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,660
That's... that's ridiculous.

43
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,860
Paula said killer was a cop.

44
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,930
Who used his badge to get blowjobs.

45
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,870
Does that sound like Truman?

46
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,640
No, it doesn't. But if you asked the
wives of half the men I've been with,

47
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,860
they'd probably say it didn't
sound like their husbands either.

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
He didn't do it.

49
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:13,045
He couldn't have.

50
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,110
You're fucking wrong.

51
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,700
She's fucking wrong.

52
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,330
Shit. Kacey, what's wrong?

53
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,100
What? What is it?
- I'm fine. I'm just fucking...

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Kacey.

55
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,430
I left my subs at Dad's.

56
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,740
I don't think I can hold out
till I get back there.

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Suboxone?

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,910
Yeah. I need it to stay clean.

59
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,100
Stay here.

60
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,360
What up, officer?
- Hey, what's up, Darnell?

61
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,100
You got a second?
- Not for you. Fuck outta here.

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,195
I'm not here to bust you.
I just need some help.

63
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:11,070
Come on. I'm in a uniform,

64
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,240
about to hand
a known drug dealer some cash.

65
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,340
That's not exactly a good look for me.

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,980
So please help me.

67
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,080
What you need?

68
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:21,460
Suboxone. Subs.

69
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,180
We find out popo's a fiend.

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,750
It's not for me.
It's for my sister.

71
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,250
Man, whatever.

72
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,390
How much you need?
- Two.

73
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,510
A hundred.

74
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,300
Nice doing business with you.

75
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Darnell, have you heard
of a new product on the street?

76
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,770
Heard Dock's been pushing it.
And some others.

77
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,760
Yeah, it's around. But I ain't
touched that shit, though.

78
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,860
How come?

79
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,170
'Cause cops are behind it?

80
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,710
Is it Truman?

81
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,230
Don't know who's behind it.
I just heard it was blue.

82
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,780
Thank you.

83
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Uh...

84
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,130
I know you want to talk to Truman.

85
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,030
Just drop me off at a park or something.

86
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,130
I'll be fine.

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,095
I'm not dropping you off at a park.

88
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,275
Come on, you can rest on the couch.

89
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,430
Where's Thomas?

90
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,580
He's downstairs with the landlord.

91
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,100
Okay.
- Um,

92
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,410
she sometimes watches him.

93
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,430
Can I use your bathroom?

94
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:58,525
Refresh?
- Yeah.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,620
Hi, Mrs. Mahon. It's Mickey.

96
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,260
I was wondering if Thomas could
stay with you a little bit longer.

97
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,360
I've to run into work.

98
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,170
Uh...

99
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,480
Great. Thank you. Yeah.

100
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,230
Actually, there's one other thing. Um...

101
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,240
My cousin's visiting,
and she's taking a nap.

102
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,320
So if you could make sure that Thomas
doesn't come up here for any reason...

103
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,430
Right. Great. Okay.

104
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,830
Um...

105
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,210
You don't have to worry about that.

106
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,520
Worry about what?
- Thomas.

107
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,945
I would never do that to you.

108
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,170
I just need to...

109
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,500
Oh, I just need to sit down for a bit.

110
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm gonna head out.
I need to talk to Truman.

111
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,120
You don't believe me about Truman.

112
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,140
I don't.

113
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,460
Thomas, you all right in there?
- Yup, coming.

114
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,970
You have an hour before bed,

115
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,000
so I thought we could play
another game of Clue, and...

116
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,540
...maybe have some hot chocolate.

117
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Yeah. Be right out.

118
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,460
No. You know what you are?
You're fucking dead weight.

119
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,530
You're the reason
Mickey dropped out of school.

120
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,630
You're like a fucking anvil...

121
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,270
...around your sister's neck,
and you're bringing her down.

122
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,500
Wake up.

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Who's the father?

124
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,950
Is it Simon?

125
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Wake up.

126
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,860
Uh...

127
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,120
You were having a bad dream.

128
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,140
Thomas?

129
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,050
You know me?

130
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
Yeah.

131
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,750
And I know you.

132
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,150
You do?

133
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,795
You're the girl with the pink hair.

134
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,440
What the hell am I doing here?

135
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,310
This is Ryan, and cousin
Hailey, and Aunt Lynn.

136
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,950
Oh, and Gee-Pop's over here.

137
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,960
And I put you here 'cause I
didn't know where you went.

138
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,710
Um...

139
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,410
Um...

140
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
Here.

141
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,340
What's your name again?

142
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,980
My name? Um... I'm Kacey.

143
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,366
Ryan told me all about you
on Thanksgiving, and...

144
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:37,650
Yeah?

145
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,480
I told Mom that I needed
to put you on the family tree.

146
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,390
But when I asked her about it, she
said that she didn't know who you were.

147
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,550
And that Ryan must've been mistaken.

148
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,460
Yeah. I don't know.
Uh... I don't know, Thomas.

149
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,630
Why would she say that?

150
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,620
That she didn't know who you were?

151
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,790
Maybe she didn't know
about your pink hair.

152
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,380
Yeah, I think that must be it. Yeah.

153
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,020
Thomas? Thomas.

154
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,180
Up here.

155
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,650
That's Mrs. Mahon.

156
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,920
She's really nice, and she takes
care of me when Mom's at work.

157
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,360
Thomas, you can't run off
like that. Your mother...

158
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,460
Oh, hello.
- Yeah.

159
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,430
You must be Michaela's cousin.

160
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,530
I'm Cecilia Mahon.

161
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,300
Um, I'm Kacey.

162
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,270
Sorry, Kacey. Michaela said
you weren't to be disturbed.

163
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,960
Thomas, we should be going
and leave your cousin alone.

164
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,100
You grew up with my mom.

165
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,900
What was she like when she was little?

166
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,450
Um...

167
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,520
Thomas, maybe we should leave.

168
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,620
No, it's all right.

169
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
It's all right.

170
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,550
Um...

171
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,750
She was...

172
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,500
...really, really smart.
She was so smart.

173
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,110
She uh... I don't think I ever saw
her without a book in her hand.

174
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,460
I mean, I wasn't like that. I
didn't... I couldn't read like she did.

175
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,310
She... she was good.

176
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,150
She always chose the right thing, and...

177
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,380
She loved music.
She loved her horn.

178
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,890
She still does.

179
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,460
She loves playing Tristan and Isolde.

180
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,685
Really? She still got it?

181
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,345
My mom gave me these
from when she was little.

182
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
Oh, my God.

183
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,120
She said the killer is Truman Dawes.

184
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:19,205
You know him, too.

185
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,410
'Cause he's a cop.

186
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:26,355
Always paid my debts, no matter
how creative I had to get.

187
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,450
I don't get it. It finally
feels like we're getting closer,

188
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,220
and then you want to back off?

189
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,845
You really want what happened to
Paula to happen to you, or Kacey?

190
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,270
Man, Mickey used to play these
all the time after Mom...

191
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,370
...after her mom died.

192
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,655
Even when Gee told her to stop.

193
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,370
Why did he tell her to stop?

194
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,470
Um...

195
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,880
Well, I think,
because Gee was...

196
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,100
...sad, you know, that
Mickey's mom, your grandma...

197
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,890
...was gone.

198
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,190
But Mickey wouldn't listen.
She would... It was funny.

199
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,965
She followed every single
rule he had. But not that one.

200
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,750
Why not?

201
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,330
Probably just... it made her
feel close to her mom.

202
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,840
Gee told her that it made her
weak to keep listening like that.

203
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,110
But I think it made her strong.

204
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,080
I wasn't like that, I, um...

205
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,750
All I could ever do was escape the pain.

206
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,505
But she didn't, she couldn't.
It was like...

207
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,115
...she only ever knew how to face it.

208
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,260
I think I get that from her.

209
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,775
Put your hands where I can see them, now.

210
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,040
Keep those eyes open for me, Kori.

211
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,200
All right. Keep them open.
You hear me?

212
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,060
Wanna tell me what the hell
it is you think you're doing?

213
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,685
Kori, keep those eyes open.

214
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,920
I... I thought...
- You thought what, Mickey?

215
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,590
She OD'd.

216
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,320
And she might need
another shot of Naloxone.

217
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,435
So maybe you want to lower that
Glock you got pointed at me?

218
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,350
Kori. Kori?

219
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,000
Kori.

220
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,540
What... what the fuck?

221
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,040
It's okay, you're gonna be all
right. You're gonna be fine.

222
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,310
But listen to me.
I need you to slow...

223
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,610
...your breathing down for me, all right?

224
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,750
I need you to slow it down.
- Come on. Can you do that for me?

225
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,850
Come on.

226
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,230
Okay. Good.

227
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,570
Good.

228
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,930
Your leg looks pretty bad.

229
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,290
I'm gonna try and clean it out.
But you're headed for sepsis...

230
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,400
...if you don't go and see
a doctor. No hospital.

231
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,930
Kori, you won't survive
the night if you don't go.

232
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,120
Okay? For me, please.
You gotta go.

233
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,940
Truman, how can I help?

234
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,970
You can step the hell out of
my light, so I can clean this.

235
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,330
Okay. Okay.

236
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,190
Hey, is uh...
she gonna be all right?

237
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,820
Good thing you called when you did.

238
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,069
Just let Mr. Winton know I hope
he feels better, all right?

239
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:00,390
Yeah.

240
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,490
Let's go.

241
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,940
I didn't know about Winton.

242
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Any of it.

243
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,950
Ever since Mr. Winton's sons died,

244
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,025
he spends a lot of nights out here.

245
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,990
When he's not helping folks
out at the shop,

246
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,360
he's helping folks out on the street.

247
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,730
He's not feeling so well these
days. So, I've been stepping in.

248
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,500
I'm so sorry. I...
Please just let me explain it.

249
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Which part, Mick?

250
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,540
Why you followed me,
or why you pulled a gun on me?

251
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,620
Kacey found Emily Morris,
and she told Kacey...

252
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,920
...that you were the one
who was murdering these women.

253
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,660
And so I went to talk to you. And
then I saw you with the duffel bag.

254
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,160
And then the needles. And then
what was I supposed to think?

255
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,960
Not that I was a serial killer.

256
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,470
Or that I was a cop covering up for one.

257
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,440
Why would Emily Morris say that?

258
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,040
Beats me, better question is,
why would you believe her?

259
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,370
Because that's what she told Kacey.

260
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,930
And I've doubted her so many
times, and I just couldn't...

261
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,030
...this time.

262
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,570
So you gained her trust to lose mine.

263
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,010
Truman.

264
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,170
I'm so sorry, okay?

265
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,340
I... I just... I want you
to understand something.

266
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,470
I need you...
- You pulled a gun on me, Mickey.

267
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,140
I know. And if I could take it back, I would.

268
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,620
There's no taking this back.

269
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,865
I was in love with you, Mickey.

270
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,110
I'm in love with you, too.

271
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,730
You got a fucked up way of showing it.

272
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,170
I should probably get going now.

273
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Um...

274
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,710
Are you all right, dear?

275
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,910
Yep.

276
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,620
Just a little light headed.
- Sit back down a bit.

277
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,280
Yeah.
- Thomas,

278
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,990
why don't you go and get Kacey
a glass of water?

279
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,090
Yeah. Yeah.

280
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,450
How far along are you?

281
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,970
I'm... Thank you.

282
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,070
Seven months.
- Oh.

283
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,400
There's a baby in there?

284
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,630
Hello?

285
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,440
Hello in there. It's me, Thomas.

286
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,660
I think she kicked.
- Did she?

287
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,330
She kicked.
- She likes you.

288
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,430
She kicked for me.

289
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,840
Hi. Mom, Mom!
- Thomas.

290
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,940
I felt the baby kick.

291
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,090
That's great.

292
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,820
Thomas wandered up here and
found your cousin, I'm afraid.

293
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Okay.

294
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,680
Well, I guess I should be going.

295
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Thomas, Kacey.

296
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,180
Michaela.

297
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,490
Hey, Thomas,
why don't you get ready for bed?

298
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,730
When will I see you again?

299
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,180
I don't know.

300
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,120
Well, we're family and families
see each other all the time.

301
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,110
So just don't be a stranger, okay?

302
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Mickey, I'm...

303
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,010
Mick, I'm sorry. He just...
he came up here.

304
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,660
I didn't know what to do. I...

305
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,660
Davis.
- Yeah?

306
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,980
You ordered an autopsy on Paula Mulroney.

307
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
I need to know why.

308
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,030
Mick... Mick, I'm sorry.

309
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,300
You were right. When he came
up here, I shouldn't have...

310
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,120
Jesus, Mick, I said I was sorry.

311
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,360
Was it really so bad that he met me?

312
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,300
Emily Morris said it was Truman Dawes.

313
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,090
Are you sure that's what she said?

314
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,270
Yeah.

315
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,540
What were her exact words, Kacey?

316
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,615
I told you her...
- Her exact words!

317
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,610
When I found her at that abando.

318
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,350
I told her I needed to talk to her.

319
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,720
But she wouldn't talk to me. She
was high as fuck, but she got up,

320
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,350
she walked away.
She didn't say a thing,

321
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,820
so I begged her to talk to me...

322
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
...tell me who shot her, told her he
could try that with somebody else.

323
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,760
But she just laughed at me
and told me to fuck off.

324
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,660
She didn't want to talk to me
because of you,

325
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,330
because you were protecting the killer.

326
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,600
And I was like,
'Wait, I don't understand.

327
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,470
'What does the killer
have to do with my sister?'

328
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,600
And she said...
'Because he's her partner.'

329
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,300
Like, I already knew that or something.

330
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
Then she ran away,
and that's it.

331
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,340
Partner?
- Yes.

332
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,030
She said 'partner'?

333
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,750
Yeah. What... what...
what's wrong?

334
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:33,250
Truman hasn't been my partner in months.

335
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
Oh, fuck.

336
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,010
Then who has?

337
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,030
His name is Eddie Lafferty,

338
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,680
and he was assigned to me when
Truman went on medical leave.

339
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,550
There. You know him?

340
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,190
He's Dock's supplier.

341
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,250
He's a cop, huh?
- You didn't know?

342
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,400
I mean, I guess I'm not surprised. He's...

343
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,190
...also been with a...
lot of the girls on the Ave.

344
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,290
No, not with me, but...

345
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,070
...a lot of them.

346
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,795
So what made him
graduate to killing them?

347
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,400
Mick, I'm so sorry about Truman. I mean...

348
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,300
I really... I...
I didn't know he was on leave.

349
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,240
And maybe if you just explain
that to him, he'll understand.

350
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,560
No, he won't.
He won't understand.

351
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
Oh, my God. Wait.

352
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,900
What is it, Mick?

353
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,590
Oh, my God.
- What?

354
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,260
That's Lafferty with my boss, Ahearn.

355
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,830
And that's Scanlon, the guy
who got shot with Emily Morris.

356
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,350
They all went to high school together.

357
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,540
Ahearn, Lafferty and Scanlon.

358
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,440
So Jimmy was bringing it in
off those boats,

359
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,880
and Lafferty was bringing it to the street.

360
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,010
I mean, it still doesn't explain
why those girls were killed.

361
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,980
I need to find Lafferty.
I need to bring him in.

362
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,080
There's a detective in my
department who I think I can trust.

363
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,350
A cop?
- Yeah.

364
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,590
Are you kidding? No fucking way.

365
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,290
We don't know how high up this goes.

366
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,770
We're better off going to Dock.

367
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,390
You're not better off going to Dock.

368
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,635
I met him. He's not a good guy, Kace.

369
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,510
Yeah, he is.

370
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,280
He's just not clean.

371
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,880
Thomas, I love you
more than anything else.

372
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,750
I know.

373
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,670
Hello?
- Detective Danjarat.

374
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,860
It's Mickey Fitzpatrick.

375
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,810
I know who the killer is.

376
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,885
We've got the wrong guy in custody.

377
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,700
Hey, Lafferty,
it's Davis Danjarat.

378
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Whoops.

379
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,950
It's all clear.

380
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,490
Holy shit!

381
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,590
What is it?

382
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,400
Prescription... for insulin.

383
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,530
A fuck ton of it.

384
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,070
Mickey!

385
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:24,190
Mickey! It's me. Danjarat.

386
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,650
Hey, you were right about Lafferty.

387
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,810
And you were right about everything.

388
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,590
Hi. Did you find him?

389
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,460
No, he wasn't home.

390
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,770
We don't know where he is.

391
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,360
What is it?

392
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
My sister's gone, too.

393
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,240
Kacey Theresa Fitzpatrick, 5'5'.

394
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,940
Approximately 115 pounds,
pink hair and pregnant.

395
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,460
And Mike, keep this quiet,
okay? Only cops you trust.

396
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,750
Hey. Don't worry.

397
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,990
Okay? We'll find Kacey.

398
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:12,270
I also have DiPaolo
on the lookout for Emily Morris.

399
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,690
I'm coming with you.

400
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,590
Don't worry, dear.
I'll stay with Thomas.

401
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,030
His Gee-Pop is coming pretty early to
pick him up for the New Year's parade.

402
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,030
Mickey, it's better if you stay here.

403
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,000
Kacey might come back,
all right?

404
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,010
Okay? I'll call you
as soon as I find anything.

405
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,170
You're not gonna listen to him, are you?

406
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,850
Mr. Winton. Hi, it's Mickey
Fitzpatrick, Truman's um... friend.

407
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,670
I'm looking for Dock McClatchie.

408
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,495
Hey, Dock.
- Got something for me?

409
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,250
Yeah.
- I got something for you, too.

410
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,420
Are you sure I can't be a devil?

411
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,090
They're all taken, kid.

412
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,490
You're either an angel or you're nothing.

413
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,830
Look at me and McGivney.

414
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,055
Look at how sharp we are.

415
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,760
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

416
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,100
I know, you're shy.

417
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,840
You don't like people looking at you.

418
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,170
Twohey don't either.

419
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,360
That is true. I don't.

420
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,770
Listen to me.

421
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,510
You belong here.

422
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,650
This is your birthright.

423
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,250
Come here.

424
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,120
Read me these names.
You can read right?

425
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,650
Gerald Francis O'Brien.

426
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,790
Francis Patrick O'Brien.

427
00:32:55,855 --> 00:32:58,090
Robert Paul O'Brien.

428
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,845
This is your great-great-great grandfather.

429
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,573
This is your great-great uncle.

430
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,520
And this is your other great uncle.

431
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,010
You may be a Fitzpatrick by name,

432
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,765
but you've got O'Brien blood in your veins.

433
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,480
Oh, that's godawful.

434
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,880
That'll be O'Connor,
out of tune again.

435
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,480
Hey, McGivney,
what's worse than a banjo?

436
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
What?
- Two banjos?

437
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,740
You know why I like New Year's, Thomas?

438
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
It's a fresh start.

439
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,310
You couldn't stay away,
could you?

440
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,140
I need your help.
Have you seen Dock McClatchie?

441
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,300
You've been asking for a lot lately.

442
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,870
You want to find Dock,
you gotta talk to God.

443
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,970
Immaculate Heart.

444
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,770
...too much heat.

445
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,280
Yeah, you and me both.

446
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,110
Had so much heat,
my house got burned down.

447
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,080
I heard about that.

448
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,350
But I'm here now, aren't I?

449
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,450
That's everything?

450
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,190
That's all I have left.

451
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,290
Damn shame about that bust.

452
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,790
You're telling me.
You got kids?

453
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,185
Fucking alimony is no joke.

454
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
I like these new digs.

455
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,100
A real fairy tale come true.

456
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,800
No, I'm serious.

457
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,940
Something romantic about it.

458
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,740
My mother used to make me
take her to mass on Sundays.

459
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,580
Other kids hated it,
but I... no, I loved it.

460
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,980
The altar, the smell...

461
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,265
...the way the light came through
the stained glass, you know.

462
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,470
Don't move. Hands up.

463
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,510
Mickey!
- Shut up! Hands up!

464
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,630
Where is she?

465
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,730
Where's Kacey?

466
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,060
What are you doing here?

467
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,400
Where the fuck is Kacey?

468
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,740
Huh? Where is she?
You, get down! Get down!

469
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,240
Hands behind your head.

470
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,340
You, too, Eddie.

471
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,310
What are you doing here?

472
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,350
Where the fuck is Kacey, huh?
Where is she?

473
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,850
Who's Kacey?
- Shut up! I said, get down!

474
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,030
Mickey.
- Get down.

475
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,010
Kacey? Kacey, you here?

476
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
I know she's here.

477
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,940
I saw her purse.

478
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,300
Where is she?

479
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,830
Mick. Mick, I'm here.
I'm working.

480
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,170
I'm undercover, working. Fuckin'
talk to Ahearn, all right?

481
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,480
He'll tell you everything.

482
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,210
You're a liar.

483
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,350
You've been lying to me.
Since the day I met you.

484
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,280
You lied to me
when I came to your apartment,

485
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,520
and you were telling me
about how Ahearn and his buddies...

486
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,990
...are the ones who
toe the line, when it's you.

487
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,860
It's you. Yeah,
maybe they do, too.

488
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,080
But they're not the ones who
killed those women. You are.

489
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,300
You really think that I could
do something like that?

490
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,730
I do. Yes, I do.

491
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,490
And there's a living witness who knows
that you can do something like that, too.

492
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,910
Now tell me where the fuck my sister is.

493
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,645
She ain't here, Mick.
- Shut up!

494
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,160
Kacey trusts you.

495
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,850
She said you were a good guy.

496
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,450
I am a good guy.

497
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,320
Who the fuck do you think brought
you to the fucking hospital?

498
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,905
Jeannie, Nicole beat the piss out of you.

499
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,110
Then where is she?

500
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,380
I don't know.

501
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:08,580
You're lying. You're both lying.

502
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,980
Tell me the truth, or I swear
to God I will pull the trigger.

503
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,980
I know you killed those women.

504
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,950
And I know you killed Paula, too.

505
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,980
And for your sake,
Kacey better still be alive.

506
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,620
Tell me what you did.

507
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Okay. All right.

508
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,430
I'll tell you what happened.
But you gotta let me explain.

509
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:39,355
I didn't mean for any of this
to happen, okay?

510
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,980
It just...

511
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,200
...it got out of hand.

512
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,470
I didn't mean to.
I just... I was lonely.

513
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:53,430
So I was with some of the girls,
and then I don't know,

514
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,280
they turned on me.

515
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,020
Maybe it was because you used your badge
to force them to have sex with you.

516
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,900
Step back, Mickey.

517
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,190
Mickey. Listen...

518
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,660
I didn't mean to hurt nobody, Mick.

519
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,960
I swear. You gotta understand.

520
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,730
They were threatening me, saying
they were gonna go to my bosses.

521
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,330
Mickey.
- I couldn't let anybody find out.

522
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,725
I lose everything.
- Mickey.

523
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:15,300
I've got kids.

524
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,970
Do you know what it would do to them?

525
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,195
What it would do to them?

526
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,950
What about what it did to those women?

527
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,910
What did it...
what did it do, hm?

528
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,520
What did it really do?

529
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,420
'Cause when we discovered
that first body on the tracks,

530
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,900
nobody did nothing about it.

531
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,700
They barely mentioned it at roll call.

532
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,050
You think I didn't care?

533
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,060
Well, nobody else did neither.

534
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,350
Mickey, step back.

535
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,660
What kind of life, right?

536
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,540
That's for Taylor.
That's for Elizabeth.

537
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,310
That's for Amelia.

538
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,370
Go ahead.

539
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,200
I spent a lot of my life locked up.

540
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,275
At least this time,
it was worth it.

541
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
For Paula.

542
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,350
Everybody needs to go.

543
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,220
Well, I'm gonna stay.

544
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:24,015
Hey, go, keep walking until you
can't see the cathedral anymore. Go.

545
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,370
I was trying to warn you.
- I know.

546
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,790
Go.

547
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,300
Go.

548
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,870
Go.

549
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,170
Kace...

550
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,330
She said, 'That's for Amelia.'

551
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,430
Who's Amelia?

552
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,710
Emily's friend.

553
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,350
She have pink hair?

554
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,890
Are you in trouble?

555
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
I don't know.

556
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,660
Do you want to go home?

557
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,190
Can we go somewhere else for a minute?

558
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
Yeah.

559
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,435
I'm so sorry for all of this.

560
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,390
You weren't supposed to be there, Mickey.

561
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,360
I was trying to help.

562
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,300
Yeah, it wasn't your
place. It wasn't about you.

563
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,740
It was about of our existence,
you know. About...

564
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,310
It's about taking care
of ourselves and each other.

565
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,020
I was...

566
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,110
I was trying to take care of you.

567
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,010
Yeah, well, that's, like, my
whole point, Mick. You can't.

568
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,920
We needed to do it on our own.
If only to...

569
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,590
...prove to ourselves that we could.

570
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,790
So many people write us off for...

571
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:16,510
...this choice that we made. But it
wasn't a choice, not for all of us.

572
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,610
I know.

573
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,300
Gee told me...

574
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,820
...that Mom was using
when she was pregnant with you.

575
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,710
You didn't have the same start as me.

576
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,850
I... I didn't know that.

577
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,610
Now that explains a lot.

578
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,710
Yeah.

579
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,480
'Cause, like,
for the longest time.

580
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,320
I tried to think back to the time...

581
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,395
...the moment when it all went bad.

582
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,010
I know when that was.

583
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:52,815
When I let Simon come between us.

584
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,170
You know, he took me here when
I was 18 years old to this pier,

585
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,440
and he kissed me for the first time.

586
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,540
I never told you that.

587
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,710
Maybe it was
because I knew deep down that

588
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,810
I was letting you down.

589
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,420
You were a kid, Mick.

590
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,850
You were a kid just like me. You
were supposed to be able to fuck up,

591
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,945
and make mistakes,
and have that be okay. But...

592
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,880
I don't know. I guess you thought
you couldn't or something.

593
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,550
You were never supposed
to take care of me.

594
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,340
I felt guilty.

595
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,440
I just felt guilty.

596
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,660
About what?

597
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,960
About the fact that I...

598
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,950
...had something that you didn't.

599
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,025
I got something that you never got.

600
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,700
I got Mom's love.

601
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,670
Or, I don't know,

602
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,770
the memory of it.

603
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,675
I have these memories of her.

604
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,980
And, like, I just...

605
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,225
I could just feel her love in them.

606
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,110
And some days, it's...

607
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,930
...that feeling is all that keeps me going.

608
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,910
Sometimes I...

609
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:18,600
I feel like that's the thing that separates us,

610
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,165
you know, more than anything.

611
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,955
I do have that Mickey,
the memory of love.

612
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:35,150
I just got it from you.

613
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,335
Lafferty was wrong, you know...

614
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,090
...when he said that nobody cared.

615
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,310
You cared.

616
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,190
You wouldn't let this place ignore us.

617
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:39,860
You said their names when no one else did.

618
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,790
Taylor Yoon.

619
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,020
Elizabeth O'Connor.

620
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,030
Amelia DelVecchio.

621
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,500
Paula Mulroney.

622
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:09,475
We gather today, to mourn
the loss of these friends.

623
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,830
Each of them was a member
of our community.

624
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:17,550
Each of them
was one of God's own children.

625
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,270
People with promise,

626
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:23,530
people loving and beloved...

627
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:29,110
...and one after another in a line, in a river...

628
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,500
...no font and no outlet.

629
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,000
A long, bright river...

630
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,640
...of departed souls.

631
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,990
May you all rest in peace,

632
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:45,660
and find comfort in the kingdom of heaven.

633
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,050
Amen.
- Amen.

634
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,440
You know,
it took us a while...

635
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,070
...to figure out what the women
had to do with it all.

636
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,550
It's a lot, as it turns out.

637
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,515
Amelia DelVecchio.
- Yeah.

638
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,410
She was the woman I found on the tracks.

639
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,550
According to her parents, she'd
been on and off the street for years.

640
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,590
Most of the time, she couldn't
keep a cell phone, but...

641
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,560
...you know, there was
a month long stretch last fall...

642
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,620
...where she had the one
her mother gave her.

643
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,890
And once we had her name,

644
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,260
we were able to look into the records.

645
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,660
Some pretty damning evidence
against Lafferty in there.

646
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,170
Apparently, a few of the women
started threatening...

647
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:24,240
...to expose him for the drugs if he...

648
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,740
...you know, didn't stop demanding favors.

649
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,280
That's when he freaked,
began going after them.

650
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,580
I think Lafferty is the one who killed them.

651
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,750
But I do think Ahearn
was involved somehow.

652
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:38,950
My guess is he benched Lafferty to try
to distance himself from the whole thing.

653
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:41,920
But Ahearn denies it all.
Fucker won't talk.

654
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,560
God. Maybe he'll talk when they
throw a plea deal his way.

655
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,300
Maybe, or maybe Ahearn
will just keep on doing...

656
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,030
...exactly what he's been doing...

657
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,830
...all his career...
- Mm.

658
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,930
...all his life.

659
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,645
Maybe he'll never get caught.

660
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,320
So, am I hearing right?

661
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,160
You're gonna quit the force?

662
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,510
Well, IA's investigating.

663
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:08,880
They're probably gonna fire me anyway.

664
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,400
So I figured I'd beat 'em to the punch.

665
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,135
Well, you know, IA cleared you.

666
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,470
When?

667
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,190
After I told them you were telling the truth,

668
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:22,490
that I heard it all...

669
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,180
...on your cell phone.

670
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,745
I thought my cell phone died.

671
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,800
Yeah.

672
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,620
So how much did you really hear?

673
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,710
Enough to know that you shouldn't quit.

674
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:38,360
The force needs cops like you.

675
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,050
Cops who are inept?

676
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,350
Cops who care.

677
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:47,550
Imagine what this place would
be like if we had more of them.

678
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,430
Hey.

679
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,885
You got a second to talk?

680
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,090
I don't think...
- Just hear me out.

681
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:25,190
Just let me apologize.

682
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,920
And then I'll go, I promise.

683
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,050
Okay.

684
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,900
I'm sorry, Truman...

685
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,525
...for ever believing that you could
be anything but what you are.

686
00:52:40,608 --> 00:52:43,753
You're the best person I've ever met.

687
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,210
And the sad part is.

688
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:50,950
I didn't believe it,
that you were the killer.

689
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:55,725
But I wanted to show Kacey
that I believed her for once.

690
00:52:55,813 --> 00:52:57,813
Does that make sense?

691
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,140
Wrong apology?

692
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,950
Yeah.

693
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,115
You pulled a gun on me, Mickey.

694
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,385
We can't come back from that.

695
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,760
Even if I wanted to.

696
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,310
I understand.

697
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:47,460
So, anyway, I quit the force.

698
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,340
I guess we both knew that I
shouldn't have become a cop.

699
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,415
I don't know what I'm gonna do now.

700
00:53:55,508 --> 00:53:57,180
It's a little late in life...

701
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,360
...to figure out who I want to be
when I grow up.

702
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,840
All right, um...

703
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,350
I'm gonna go.

704
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:31,720
You'll never truly understand...

705
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,750
...the amount of regret
that I'll carry with me...

706
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:38,145
...for the rest of my life.

707
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,420
You're right, you know.

708
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,995
You were never meant to be a cop.

709
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,675
You should've been a music teacher.

710
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,230
I told you the first time I met you.

711
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,940
You got that...

712
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,170
...vibe.

713
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,750
Thomas.

714
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,230
Bye.

715
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,380
How was school today?

716
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,620
Great.
- Yeah?

717
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,890
Yeah.
- How was music class?

718
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:45,290
You still liking it?
- Yeah. I'm loving it.

719
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,410
Give me that. Good.

720
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,830
So what are your three things?

721
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:04,080
How is she doing?
- Which she?

722
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,110
Both of them.
- They're both great.

723
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:10,970
She wanted a minute alone
before she lets the cavalry in.

724
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,730
Have you decided yet? On a name?

725
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,020
No.

726
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,350
Mm-mm. Every time I think
I have one, I get scared.

727
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:49,720
And I just think...

728
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:54,510
...that's what she's gonna be
called for the rest of her life.

729
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,610
And it stops me.

730
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:09,355
Is that what Thomas sounded like
when he was born?

731
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,820
But it's not what she sounds like.

732
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,840
I know, sweetheart.

733
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,960
They say that um...

734
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,800
...that she doesn't need that,
the medicine.

735
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,470
They say that she's doing good without it.

736
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,805
Do you think they'll be okay?

737
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,370
Who?

738
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:01,970
The baby.

739
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:06,210
All the babies in here.

740
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:14,515
Do you think they'll be okay?
