1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,490
We got the guy.

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,390
Who is it?
- Sean Kelly.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,790
I didn't do this,
what they're saying.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,230
Taylor Yoon went to PYC?

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,760
And so did Elizabeth O'Connor.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,300
They both had Simon as their counselor.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,730
He used this place as a market to
shop for girls, and now they're dead.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,770
Yeah, I know that girl. She was in
here with this guy, Jimmy Scanlon.

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,710
I remember because
they were fighting really bad.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,510
Got ahold of Scanlon's text messages.

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,240
The last one he sent
was to a woman named Melissa.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,780
Company that made the deposits
into Jimmy Scanlon's bank...

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,750
...is a subsidiary
of a Chinese consulting firm.

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,800
Why would the Chinese consultants
be paying a sheet metal worker?

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,200
Mick, come here.

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,530
Gee, how long has
that window been busted?

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,600
A week ago or something.

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,660
Was it Kacey?

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,500
These are from our dad.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,430
And some of these letters
are dated after he died.

21
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,760
All this time, I was looking for
her, scared that she was dead.

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,570
And she was just hiding.

23
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,880
She doesn't want to see me either.

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,810
Well, I think she does. Probably
why she left the letters.

25
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,380
It wasn't about you, Mickey.
It was about Thomas.

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,290
What I did to her,
I did for him.

27
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,150
A woman from the Avenue said that
we need to be looking at a cop.

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,290
Well, who is she?
- Paula Mulroney.

29
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,290
I think you should come into my office.

30
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,535
Looking like an OD.
- It wasn't an OD.

31
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,460
It's not an OD.

32
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:43,450
Do you think Paula was murdered?

33
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,550
Do you think this has something to do
with the other women who were killed?

34
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,890
I think there's a reason that they're all dead.

35
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,190
Paula's been using for 15 years.
It could be an OD.

36
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,200
Yeah, well, we'll see
what the tox report says.

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,260
They didn't order one.

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,900
What?
- I tried, Mickey, but Ahearn shut me down.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,780
Said they have a pretty airtight
case against the suspect in custody.

40
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,550
I'm so sorry, Mick.

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,260
You stay away from me.
You're gonna get me killed.

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,910
I know you two were close.

43
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,750
I know you've been going
through a lot with work,

44
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,220
with Kacey missing...

45
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,700
Kacey's not missing anymore.

46
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,410
Found her.

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,760
How is she?

48
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,280
She's not good, Mick.
I didn't know who else to call.

49
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,250
Hi. Uh, ma'am,
there's no smoking in the room.

50
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,350
Does this look lit?

51
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,555
We just need to borrow him for a bit.

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,005
We discussed this, ma'am.

53
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,440
Where are you taking him?

54
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,410
To the NICU, just to monitor him
for a little while.

55
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,550
For what? Monitor him for what?

56
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,520
I'm gonna get clean.

57
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,400
I told the doctor.
He knows, all right?

58
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Okay.

59
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,690
Mick? Mickey, wait.

60
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,980
Mickey, your sister needs you.
- Excuse me.

61
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,565
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Is he gonna be okay?

62
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,805
He's in withdrawal, isn't he?

63
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,795
I was scared of what might happen to him.

64
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,400
That's why I did what I did.

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:26,225
That's why you thought Thomas had
been taken, that night Bethany left.

66
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,035
You could've told me, Mick.
- I didn't tell anybody.

67
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,480
I didn't want you to think
I was a terrible person.

68
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,630
Why would I think that, Mickey?

69
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,360
My boyfriend slept with my sister.

70
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,820
A lot of people might think
that I took Thomas out of spite.

71
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Did you?

72
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,605
Simon told me that
she had come on to him.

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,530
That he had given in to her
in a moment of weakness.

74
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,540
And I was in such denial
about the whole thing.

75
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,270
I didn't want to believe it.

76
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,090
I didn't want to believe her.

77
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,330
My own sister.

78
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,630
Didn't want to believe that
the man I loved preyed on her,

79
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,000
forced himself on her when she was
so out of it, she couldn't consent.

80
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,070
But you stayed with him.

81
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,250
No, I ended it when I found out
she was pregnant.

82
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,480
I should have believed her about that.

83
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,660
I just didn't believe
that she could get clean...

84
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
...for him.

85
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
For Thomas.

86
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,185
Listen... I've always had
a soft spot for Kacey.

87
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,180
She's... she's got a good heart.

88
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,035
But when I watch you with Thomas,

89
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,580
when I see you with the chess,

90
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,150
and the music, and the homework,

91
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,460
and the... the...
opera, YouTube,

92
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,660
or whatever it is...
- Stop.

93
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,130
I'm serious.

94
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,660
You know how little it means
to have a good heart...

95
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,730
...when your kid doesn't have
food on the table?

96
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,540
When that kid's afraid you may
not wake up in the morning?

97
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,590
I do know that. Yeah.

98
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,680
I've known what that's like
since I was four years old.

99
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,160
Well, maybe you should've
listened to your sister.

100
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,445
I can't soften that for you. And
I don't think you want me to.

101
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,770
But Kacey is safe now.
She can heal.

102
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,870
And you can heal.

103
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,545
What about the rest of the women?

104
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,905
I can't let what happened
to Paula happen to them.

105
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,500
Paula said the perp was a cop,
and now she's dead.

106
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,540
Okay, let's go down that road.

107
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,670
You tell Ahearn,
she ends up dead.

108
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,080
Now, feelings for Ahearn aside,
that's a big accusation.

109
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,810
I'm not saying Ahearn is a killer,

110
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,080
but if the perp is a cop,
maybe he was protecting them.

111
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,890
And it wasn't just that Paula said it
was a cop, it was the way she said it.

112
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,890
She thought that I knew who the cop was.

113
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,320
You still think it's Simon?

114
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,030
We only eliminated Simon as a suspect
because Sean Kelly got arrested.

115
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,160
Think about it, Truman.
Two of the victims went to PYC.

116
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,970
Paula said the cop in question
demanded sexual favors.

117
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,235
I need to find out the truth.
I owe that to Paula.

118
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,860
And Kacey. Even Thomas.

119
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,610
How do you suggest we do that?

120
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,105
No cop in his right mind is gonna...

121
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:24,880
...question Simon with
the evidence we've got.

122
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,980
I know.

123
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:29,370
That's why I'm gonna do it.

124
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Hey.

125
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,940
Hey.

126
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,740
Okay.

127
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,710
I'll be right here.

128
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,770
What are you doing here?

129
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,890
Look, if this is about
Thomas... It's not about Thomas.

130
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,170
It's about...

131
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,690
...where you go at night.

132
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,890
What? You want to talk about
where I go at night? Okay. Uh...

133
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,960
Tell me why that's your business.

134
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,490
Well, you made it my business when you
started killing women on the Avenue.

135
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,120
What the fuck are you talking about?

136
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,010
I saw you.
I saw you in Kensington.

137
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,595
I saw what you were doing with that girl.

138
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,850
So you're stalking me now?
Is that it?

139
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,150
You know what they've been saying, right?

140
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,435
They're saying the killer is a
cop who's doing the same thing.

141
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,790
Y... you're nuts.

142
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,690
You're absolutely fucking psychotic.

143
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,760
Part of why I liked you at first.

144
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,260
I remember that. I remember
that, calling me crazy.

145
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,900
That's what you say when you're...
- Get the fuck out of here.

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,270
You know what...
- I know who you are, Simon.

147
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,640
I know what you're capable of.

148
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,270
You remember how old I was when you
met me? When you singled me out?

149
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,370
I was 14.

150
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,850
Fourteen. How old
is that girl you got right now?

151
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,950
Singled you out?
- Yeah.

152
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,350
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

153
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,760
It was you who was following me around.

154
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,030
You wouldn't leave me alone.
You came after me, Mick.

155
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,200
Yeah. You wanted everything you got.

156
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,130
Fuck you! Fuck you!

157
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,695
There she is. I remember her.

158
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,310
Want to know what makes me different...

159
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,410
...from whatever sick fuck is out
there killing girls on the Avenue?

160
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,510
I pay for what I get.

161
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,910
I paid for that girl
you saw me with in Kensington.

162
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,495
I paid for your sister when I fucked her.

163
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,020
I paid for you, too.
I gave you a home to live in.

164
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,460
I gave you a career.
And now I pay for Jill.

165
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,830
I pay for the clothes she wants.
I pay for her car.

166
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,650
I even paid for a trip to Salem.

167
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,410
You took her to Salem on Halloween?

168
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,440
Whole weekend?
- I did it. It was great.

169
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,540
She loved it.

170
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,335
You used to love it, too.
- Huh.

171
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,565
I loved a lot of things
when I was 18 years old.

172
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
She's 20.

173
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,540
I spent so much time...

174
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,490
...thinking I hated you.

175
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,915
Almost a decade of my life.

176
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,220
And you know what I realized?

177
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
It's not hate.

178
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,020
It's...

179
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
...embarrassment.

180
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,930
You okay?
- Simon's not the killer.

181
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,430
You sure?

182
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:10,290
He was in Salem when the first
three victims were killed.

183
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
It's not him.

184
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,010
Kacey! No, pause, stop!

185
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,110
No.

186
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,270
Paula!

187
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Are you okay?

188
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,310
Yeah.

189
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,880
Yeah, of course.

190
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,955
Do you not want to go back to work?

191
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,530
You know...

192
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,120
I don't.
- Could you stay home?

193
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,590
Because a lot of the moms,
like Carlotta's mom,

194
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,220
she's worked from home ever since COVID.

195
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,480
For most of those jobs,
you need a college degree.

196
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,300
Can you get a college degree?

197
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,160
Come on. Clear your dishes.
You're with Mrs. Mahon today.

198
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,940
Your face looks good.
It's almost normal again.

199
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Thanks, buddy.

200
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,650
That's a real...

201
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,380
...confidence booster.

202
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,480
Anytime.

203
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,520
Mickey. Hey. I heard about what
happened to you. How are you feeling?

204
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,660
Fine. I'm better.
- Good.

205
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,500
Well, Ahearn said you didn't get a
good look at the guy who did this.

206
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,420
Well, it's good to have you back.

207
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Yeah.
- Hey, Davis.

208
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,180
Did you hear about Paula Mulroney?

209
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,780
No. Who's that?

210
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,705
Come on. Why don't we
step into my office?

211
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,490
Um...

212
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,000
Paula Mulroney died...

213
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,000
...on... Christmas Day.

214
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,490
She was my sister's best friend.

215
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,150
She was family.

216
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:59,140
She grew up in Kensington. She
worked the Ave. , and she looked tough.

217
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
But...

218
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,495
...she wasn't, not on the inside.

219
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,195
And she came in as an overdose.

220
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,750
Like the other women.
- Yeah.

221
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,380
Was it insulin?

222
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
I don't know.

223
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,390
There was no autopsy ordered.

224
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,550
If we could find out for her family,

225
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,410
if you could find out for me.

226
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,560
Of course,
I'll call the ME right away.

227
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Thank you.
- Yeah.

228
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,450
Mickey, I'm...
I'm sorry about Paula.

229
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,290
Me, too.

230
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,460
Thanks.

231
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,340
Hey, Sean Kelly was in custody
when she died.

232
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,870
I know.

233
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,030
Ahearn's not a killer.

234
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,760
He's a dipshit with a complex,
but a murderer? I can't get there.

235
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,030
What if he's covering for one?

236
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,390
Mickey names Paula Mulroney as
someone to identify a dirty cop.

237
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,470
Paula then dies.

238
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,810
Yeah, she ODs.

239
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,240
Yeah, all the murdered women ODed?

240
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,540
Look, he may still be out there.

241
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,295
Unless your guy killed her
from behind bars.

242
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,390
I mean, I'll poke around.
- Thank you.

243
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,690
But I gotta ask.
This for you or for her?

244
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,340
Both, I guess. Does it matter?

245
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,500
Look, we've been friends a long time.
- Yeah.

246
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,700
So I'm gonna say something.

247
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,170
I don't know if you're
sleeping with this girl or what.

248
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,440
Mike, we're not doing this.
- We are doing this.

249
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,710
First, you come to me about
Simon Cleare being the perp,

250
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,340
and now you're asking questions
about Kevin Ahearn.

251
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,780
To my mind,
we already got the guy.

252
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,280
Now you're a pretty solid cop.
But you're not behaving that way.

253
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,440
And this girl feels like the reason.

254
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,330
A woman from the Avenue said that
we need to be looking at a cop.

255
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,810
Who is she?
- Paula Mulroney.

256
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,660
Has she had any other children
or lost any other children?

257
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,590
No.

258
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,000
About how long
has she been using opioids?

259
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,780
At least seven years.

260
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,640
Do you believe your sister
used throughout her pregnancy?

261
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,335
Does she show any desire
to get into recovery?

262
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,580
No.

263
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,570
In the event the mother is deemed
unable to care for the child,

264
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:27,940
is there a family member who
might be equipped to provide care?

265
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes.

266
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,370
Me.

267
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,380
Excuse me.
May I take a look at the victim?

268
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,280
Sorry. Who are you?

269
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,980
I'm Mickey Fitzpatrick from the 30th.

270
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,490
I'm following up on a lead. My
sergeant thinks that the victim...

271
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,560
James Scanlon might be tied
to a case in our precinct.

272
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,295
Sadly, there isn't much to see.

273
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,770
Probably been in that water
for over a month.

274
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,840
He drowned?

275
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,510
Yeah. Right after he was shot in the back.

276
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,700
I'd say he floated downstream
quite a long way.

277
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,450
Riverway's a boating company.

278
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:44,250
It says here, they do booze
cruises, boat rentals.

279
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,990
It looked like an employee jacket,
like Scanlon worked for them.

280
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:51,000
What's a sheet metal worker
doing at a boating company?

281
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,285
DPD didn't seem to have a record
of him on Riverway's payroll.

282
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,000
But I'll head over there.

283
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,970
Ask about it.
- The ME said that the body...

284
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,810
...had been in the water for over a
month. He was shot in the back.

285
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,480
He probably drifted down
from somewhere upriver.

286
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,750
Emily Morris was found upriver, too.

287
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,250
Maybe they were shot at the same time...

288
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,850
...by the same person.

289
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,890
But Jimmy's last text said that he
was meeting somebody named Melissa.

290
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,960
A lot of women in the city go by a different
name, right? You told me that yourself.

291
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,525
Yeah. Emily could be Melissa.

292
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,480
Hm.

293
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,500
She checked herself out of Lutheran.

294
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,320
She's not gonna be easy to find.

295
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,450
I wonder...

296
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,320
...maybe she'll be at Paula's funeral.

297
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,025
You want me to come with you?

298
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
To a funeral?
- Yes.

299
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,010
But... I think I should go alone.

300
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,690
Colder than a witch's tit out there.

301
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,380
Would you like to come in?

302
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,860
Just like your sister taking
off without saying a thing.

303
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,170
Told you, didn't I say it?

304
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,660
Still, glad she showed her face.

305
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,900
Are you? Glad?
- Of course I am.

306
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,770
I care about Kacey. I care
about you. That's why I'm here.

307
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,610
Why I kept your dad away...
Didn't trust him.

308
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,130
You girls...
already lost your mom.

309
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,835
Didn't need another heartbreak.

310
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,070
I didn't either.

311
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,170
I understand...

312
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,820
...why you told us he was dead.

313
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,935
But... do you know how it feels
to be a kid with no parents?

314
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,775
For them to just be gone?

315
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,770
We deserved to know the truth.

316
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,015
You should have told us he was alive.

317
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,860
I'm...

318
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Sorry?

319
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,620
I was gonna say thirsty.

320
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,650
Don't suppose you have anything
harder than water to drink?

321
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,740
You saw her? Kacey?

322
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,490
For two seconds before she
shut the door in my face.

323
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,800
And Daniel came out after.

324
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,070
How'd she look?

325
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,170
Sober.

326
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,780
And pregnant.

327
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,790
Hm.

328
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,800
Who's the father?
- Her boyfriend. Name's Dock.

329
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,755
That's where she disappeared.

330
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,700
She was hiding.

331
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,250
From me.

332
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,960
She was scared that I would try
to take this new baby, too.

333
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,560
You had every right to do what you did.

334
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,540
You stepped up, Mickey.

335
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,660
You knew what we all knew.

336
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,095
Thomas didn't have a shot.
Not with her raising him.

337
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,650
It ain't her fault.

338
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:53,600
Kacey had the cards stacked against her.

339
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,960
Born in withdrawal.
It's like a curse.

340
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:08,050
I didn't know that.
That Kacey was born addicted.

341
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,425
I remember Mom sleeping a lot
before she died.

342
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,590
But even after I knew what that meant.

343
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,750
I thought...
I always thought that...

344
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,270
...she started using after Kacey was born.

345
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,890
No. Right after you.

346
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,630
All this time, I blamed Kacey for using,
for making that choice the first time.

347
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,280
And it wasn't a choice at all.

348
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,840
Thomas...

349
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,130
He was cursed, too.

350
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,230
No, no.

351
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,970
No, no, it's my fault.

352
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:59,770
Kacey turned out the way she did, my fault.

353
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,335
Won't be the same for Thomas.

354
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,580
How can you be so sure about that?

355
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,780
Because Thomas has you raising him.

356
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,130
And Kacey had... me.

357
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,840
What if they tell him? Thomas.

358
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,060
That I'm not his...

359
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Aunt Lynn and them
won't say nothing to nobody.

360
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,800
I'll make sure all the O'Briens
know the deal. Okay?

361
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,000
When he gets older, you can
tell him or not tell him.

362
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,810
Don't waste time on guilt when
you're just doing what family does.

363
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,680
And if you ain't his real mother,

364
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,010
you're the closest thing he has to it.

365
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,860
Mom?

366
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,760
Yeah.

367
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,985
How come you look so sad?

368
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,640
Thomas, you know, the other day,
you asked me if I was all right?

369
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,350
Well, the truth is, I've been...

370
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,010
I'm having a hard time with something.

371
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
I made a mistake.

372
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,290
The kind that you can't fix.

373
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,210
It's never too late to fix a mistake.

374
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,750
All you have to do is apologize
to the person you hurt.

375
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,995
What if I can't talk to them anymore?

376
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Are they dead?

377
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,690
Teacher Dana talks about this.

378
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,750
You know what the Quakers say?

379
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,750
What do the Quakers say?

380
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,230
You apologize in your heart.

381
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,830
You think the apology...

382
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
...just quietly.

383
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,790
Okay.

384
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Ready?
- Yeah.

385
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,390
Let us pray.

386
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,500
O God, to whom mercy
and forgiveness belong,

387
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,530
hear our prayers for Your servant, Paula,

388
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,775
whom You have called from this world.

389
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,425
And because she has put her hope
and trust in You,

390
00:30:00,483 --> 00:30:04,880
command that she be carried
safely home to heaven,

391
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,270
and come to enjoy her eternal reward.

392
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,260
And we ask this in the name of Jesus.

393
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,300
Your son, who lives and reigns with you,

394
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,220
and the Holy Spirit as one God
forever and ever.

395
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,490
Amen.

396
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,540
Please be seated.

397
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,060
We are reminded of a quote
from the 'Book of Wisdom.'

398
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,235
'The souls of the righteous
are in the hands of God.

399
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,050
'Torment will ever touch them.

400
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,405
'In the eyes of the foolish,
they seem to have died.

401
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:53,250
'And their departure
was seen as a disaster.

402
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,735
'And their going from us,
utter destruction.

403
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,200
'But they are at peace.'

404
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,190
Jimmy worked here on and off for a year,

405
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:27,160
up until uh... about a month
ago, he stopped showing up.

406
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,810
And what did Jimmy do for you?

407
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,240
Uh, we leased his boat,
and he ran it.

408
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,170
Booze cruises, family
outings, that kind of thing?

409
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,510
Yeah. I mean, those were
our bread and butter.

410
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,680
But we brought Jimmy in to
run the launch vessels for us.

411
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,850
What's a launch vessel?

412
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,250
Okay, since 2020, Philly's
ports were humming, right?

413
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,220
Sometimes so busy
that these big cargo ships...

414
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,960
...have to wait at bay for a few days...

415
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,290
...in order to get a spot at the port.

416
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,460
Launch vessels are the small boats...

417
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,030
...that take supplies to the crew
while they wait,

418
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,200
and sometimes they take away
the garbage, too.

419
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:08,460
Any reason why you were paying Jimmy off
the books to drive his launch vessel?

420
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,840
Um...

421
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,510
Basically removing trash. I didn't
think I needed a 1099 for that.

422
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,010
Why are you asking?

423
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,680
Well, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this.

424
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,320
But Jimmy's body was found
washed up in the Delaware River.

425
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,420
He'd been shot.

426
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,570
Jesus.

427
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,010
Any chance he was
moving more than trash?

428
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,650
Like what?

429
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,750
Like drugs.

430
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,710
Well, if he was, I certainly
didn't know anything about it.

431
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,330
I'll be right out, okay?

432
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,550
Sue... I'm so sorry.

433
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,220
Mickey, thank you.

434
00:32:53,320 --> 00:33:00,120
I always felt better knowing you were
patrolling the Avenue. Watching over Paula.

435
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
Mrs. Mulroney?

436
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:13,400
My girl!
I want her back.

437
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,960
Me, too.

438
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,420
I want her back.

439
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,700
Yeah, I know.

440
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
I know.

441
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,610
Kace.

442
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,580
You look good.

443
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,000
Dad said that you stopped using.

444
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,180
That's great. It's...

445
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,615
...it's really... it's great.

446
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
I'm really sorry.

447
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,190
For which part?

448
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,290
All of it. Everything.

449
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,680
For everything that happened with Simon,

450
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:24,555
for making you think
that you had to hide from me.

451
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,860
And, um...

452
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
...for Paula.

453
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,610
I can't do this.
Not with you, Not now.

454
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,660
Yeah, I'm clean.

455
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,085
And I did it without you.

456
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm keeping this one.

457
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,570
I know that.

458
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,590
You don't think I know that?

459
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,690
No.

460
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,750
I don't.

461
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,860
Hey, why'd you leave the letters? Kace?

462
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,105
Why'd you leave those letters for me?

463
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,400
Hey.
- Hi.

464
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,600
The tox report for Paula came back.

465
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,570
Already?

466
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,790
A Detective Danjarat put a rush on it.

467
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,270
Insulin was in normal range.

468
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,830
It was an overdose.

469
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,530
Synthetic opioid.

470
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,190
Mickey, you okay?
- Yeah.

471
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,890
It's just she didn't deserve this.
She didn't deserve any of it.

472
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,890
I know. You want me to come
over? I get off in an hour.

473
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:28,495
No, thank you. I'm spent.
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

474
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,700
Okay.

475
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,775
Call if you need anything.
- Thanks.

476
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,940
I left the letters because I thought
you deserved to know that Dad was alive.

477
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,990
Is that the only reason?

478
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
No.

479
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,750
How long you been clean?

480
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,980
A couple of months.

481
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,460
Since the murders began.

482
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,705
I'm sorry I made you worry. I just...

483
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,850
But I didn't know how to do
this, and us at the same time.

484
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,520
And what you said at the church,
I mean, I was... I was scared.

485
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,425
That I would take this baby, too?

486
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,730
That you'd be right to take her.

487
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,115
Do you know what happens...

488
00:38:09,168 --> 00:38:11,750
...to your body after you give birth?

489
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,850
No.

490
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,540
Well, you're a fuckin' mess.

491
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,630
Um... there's a lot of blood.

492
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,080
Everything hurts.
You cry a lot.

493
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,220
Hormones, they tell you.

494
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,920
And then your milk comes in.

495
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,760
And your boobs...

496
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,280
...engorged, they call it,
they hurt so fucking much.

497
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,505
My body tried. I was trying
so hard to feed him.

498
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,510
You know, when you nurse a baby, there's
a chemical, your brain sends to you...

499
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,735
...to make you feel good?

500
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,430
I never got that.

501
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,450
He never got it.

502
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,850
So I asked for a pump, and after I
used it, you know what they fuckin' did?

503
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,670
They threw my milk in the trash.

504
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,460
Because they thought what you thought.

505
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,025
That I was poison to my baby.

506
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:14,510
And if you thought that,
it must be true.

507
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,780
I needed you to believe in me, Mickey.

508
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,930
If you just freakin'...
believed in me.

509
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,230
I'm sorry.

510
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,750
I'm so sorry that I didn't believe.

511
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:38,630
I'm sorry that I couldn't see that
Simon had done this to both of us.

512
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,815
And I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

513
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,360
Maybe I should have
given you another chance.

514
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,420
Maybe we could've raised him together.

515
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:14,955
Or maybe everything happened
the way it was supposed to...

516
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,710
...for him,

517
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,430
for you.

518
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:26,585
And for me. I mean, maybe I wouldn't have
gotten here without all of that happening.

519
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,380
Would you like to see him?

520
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,850
Dun-Dun

521
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,925
He never goes anywhere without him.

522
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,300
Neither did I.

523
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
I know.

524
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,360
Oh, my God.
It's my fault she's dead.

525
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,890
I mean, we don't know that.

526
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,730
Aura said it was an overdose, right?

527
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,200
I don't care what she said.
- No, you were trying to help her.

528
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,670
You still can, Mick. I mean, Paula
said the killer was a cop, right?

529
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,770
She thought I knew him.

530
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,240
She thought it was Simon.

531
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,380
But it's not. I checked.

532
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,230
Still would make sense.

533
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,740
It's Truman.
- Take it.

534
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Hi.

535
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,630
Right now is not good.

536
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,640
Okay. I'll meet you there
tomorrow. Good night.

537
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,800
So what do we do now?
- I'm not sure.

538
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,670
We had another lead,
but we can't find her.

539
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:45,160
I think she worked the Avenue, too.

540
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,260
What was her name?

541
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,330
Emily Morris.

542
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,490
Might also go by the name Melissa.

543
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,140
Dark hair, skinny as shit?
- Yeah.

544
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,190
Um...

545
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,290
I might know where to find her.

546
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,790
I'm not involving you, Kacey.

547
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:07,670
I'm already involved. It's my fucking
friends who are getting killed.

548
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,970
I'll start looking for Melissa in the morning.

549
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,700
I'm coming with you.

550
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,770
No.

551
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,710
Kacey, you're pregnant,
and you're newly sober.

552
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,610
I'm not letting you go alone.

553
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:22,360
I have to go alone, Mickey.
She's not gonna talk to a cop.

554
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,750
Okay, um...

555
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,620
Then, you just have to check in
with me the whole time.

556
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,015
I need to know you're okay.

557
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,480
Thank you for coming.

558
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,585
Thank you for letting me back in.

559
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,025
Thanks for letting me back in, too.

560
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,260
Come on, Kace.

561
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,720
Hey, this is Kacey.

562
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,100
Leave a message, or don't.

563
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,720
Hey.

564
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,060
You forget about our meeting?

565
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,490
Shit. I did forget.

566
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,000
So Scanlon takes an off-the-books
job as a launch boat captain.

567
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,730
And starts receiving
mysterious payments...

568
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:51,000
...from a Chinese consulting
company at the same time.

569
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,070
Doesn't take rocket scientist to figure he's
getting paid to take away more than trash.

570
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,970
Mm. How do any of the women fit into this?

571
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,620
Hopefully, Kacey can find out.

572
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,250
Hey, what's wrong?

573
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:06,740
She was supposed to check
in with me. She hasn't.

574
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,390
Now she's not texting me back.

575
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:12,230
Hey, maybe she slept
in, or changed her mind.

576
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,840
You're worried about her.
- I'm always worried about her.

577
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,760
It feels like ever since I was a kid,

578
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,270
25% of my brain's always
been busy with a problem.

579
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:27,940
If Kacey was using, the problem
would be that she might die.

580
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,460
If she was clean, it would be
that she might start using again.

581
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,685
There's never been quiet.

582
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:39,275
I don't know what it would be like...

583
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,900
...to have quiet.

584
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,420
And this time,
if she goes right back to it.

585
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,985
I don't know what I would do.

586
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:53,618
Hey. She might be stronger than you think.

587
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,180
Yeah, maybe.

588
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,250
I really, really want to believe that.

589
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,310
Get back on your beat. I got
the boat routes from Riverway.

590
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:07,210
Jimmy used to pass a spot
where Emily Morris climbed out...

591
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,450
...every shift he worked.

592
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:12,850
I'm gonna go back, see if he
had any reason to stop there.

593
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,890
Do you remember that warehouse nearby?

594
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:17,270
You remember what it said on the side?

595
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,420
Port Richmond Yards.

596
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,090
It's where Gee used to work
in his longshoreman days.

597
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,030
He was talking about it on Christmas.

598
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,300
An old Marine terminal
might still have docks.

599
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,030
It might. It would be
a very easy place to drop...

600
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:33,485
...whatever Scanlon might have been
offloading from those ships.

601
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,745
I'm gonna lose my mind
worrying about Kacey.

602
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,910
I'm gonna come with you.

603
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,250
What about your patrol car?

604
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,350
What about it?

605
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:00,135
Hey, do you know Melissa?

606
00:47:00,198 --> 00:47:02,748
You know a girl named Melissa?

607
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,515
I am sorry to bother you.

608
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,460
Oh, my God.

609
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,310
Yo! Hey, You all right?

610
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,760
Where'd you go to score?

611
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,410
Looks like once DPD
tipped me off to Scanlon,

612
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,120
we were following the same trail.

613
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,020
There's a whole lot of product there.

614
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,490
So we were right about what
Scanlon was doing with his boat.

615
00:47:55,590 --> 00:48:00,520
If Jimmy was bringing it in, maybe the
women were taking it out to the streets.

616
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,590
I don't know about that.

617
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,260
Do you know any dealers
who would trust someone...

618
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,400
...in active addiction
to run their supply for them?

619
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,930
You can't be here.
- I got him.

620
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:12,650
I got him. That's my buddy from the DPD.

621
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,750
Name's Martinez.

622
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,180
You hang back.
I'll talk to him first.

623
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:18,601
Truman.

624
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:20,980
You're not even supposed
to be here, Mickey.

625
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,370
There's a whole lot of eyes out there.

626
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,470
And you're in uniform.

627
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:38,050
After we discovered
the Riverway connection,

628
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:41,150
we went to Scanlon's house,
searched the boat in his driveway.

629
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,520
Its GPS led us here.

630
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,390
If he was being paid to offload product...

631
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,410
...and bring it here
until a runner picked it up...

632
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,390
...what did he do that got him killed?

633
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:51,830
I mean, why pay someone
you're gonna ice?

634
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,500
Well, that's the thing. He
wasn't getting paid anymore.

635
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,955
Scanlon's payments stopped a week
before he was last seen alive.

636
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:04,340
And the girl who crawled out the
river into the lot next door...

637
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,990
...how does she fit into this?

638
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,630
That, we don't know yet.

639
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:12,520
I think I know.

640
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,250
Scanlon meets Taylor Yoon at 7 Brothers.

641
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,550
They have an argument.

642
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:19,720
Shortly after that, SOK Holding
stops paying Scanlon, meaning...

643
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,390
Meaning that Scanlon stopped running
product shortly after he met with Taylor.

644
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:26,830
Then, a few days later, she turns
up dead from an insulin overdose.

645
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:27,244
Mm-hmm.

646
00:51:27,344 --> 00:51:30,100
And then Scanlon exchanges
text messages with Melissa.

647
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,540
They both get shot.

648
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,810
And then Paula says that the
guy in the video is a cop,

649
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,270
and then she ends up dead.

650
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:39,480
We've been cross-referencing Scanlon
with all the women on the Avenue.

651
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:44,255
But maybe we should've just
been crossing him with cops.

652
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
What?

653
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:52,520
I don't know, Mick.

654
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,620
You don't know what?

655
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:58,400
If we should be going down this path.

656
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,560
If it's police behind all
the drugs in that warehouse,

657
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,300
this thing is far bigger than we thought.

658
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,870
And it's not just one rogue
maniac killing women for kicks.

659
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,170
It's a goddamn operation.

660
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:10,310
If someone catches you
cross-referencing a dead drug smuggler...

661
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,910
...with your co-workers, you're
gonna get yourself killed.

662
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:16,650
You have no idea how far cops
will go to protect their own.

663
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,750
Sounds like maybe I do.

664
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,720
Come on, Mickey.
- Oh, my God...

665
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,060
I just want you to be careful.

666
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,320
I don't get it. It finally
feels like we're getting closer,

667
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,490
and then you want to back off?

668
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:30,590
I didn't say back off.
I said be careful.

669
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:34,260
You really want what happened to
Paula to happen to you, or Kacey?

670
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,870
Exactly why I need to keep going on
this, okay? By myself if I have to.

671
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:40,340
Mickey, please. Let's just...
- I don't have time for this.

672
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,810
I have to find Kacey.

673
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:46,245
I shouldn't have let her go alone.
- Mickey. Mickey!

674
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:48,500
Have you seen her? No?

675
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,940
Excuse me.
Have you seen this girl?

676
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,040
No?

677
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,000
Kace.

678
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,415
Oh, my God! Oh, God!
Hey, what happened?

679
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,810
What happened?

680
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,910
Uh...
- What happened?

681
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:53,310
Kace...

682
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:56,215
I need to get out of here.
- Wait.

683
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,800
Hey.

684
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,900
What? What's wrong?

685
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,030
Tell me. Please. Please.

686
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:06,750
I found her.
I found Melissa.

687
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,480
Where is she?

688
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,950
She split.
- What do you mean, she split?

689
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,420
Did you... What did she say to
you? Did she tell you who shot her?

690
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,990
Kace? Did she tell you?

691
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,820
She said the killer is Truman Dawes.
