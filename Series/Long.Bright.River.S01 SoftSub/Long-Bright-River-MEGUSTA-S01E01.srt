1
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,560
Help! Somebody!

2
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,300
Listen closely, Thomas.

3
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,730
This is the symphony
I was telling you about.

4
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,470
It's about a man named Faust.

5
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,570
What instruments do you hear?

6
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,360
Um, flutes.

7
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,010
Yep, and piccolos,

8
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,915
and the horns.
What kind of horns?

9
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,130
French horns.

10
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,230
And English horns.

11
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:54,190
And what do you think of this music?

12
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,440
What words would you use to describe it?

13
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,970
Um...

14
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,070
Loud.

15
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,230
Yes, it's loud.

16
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,200
And some other words
I would use are... intense.

17
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,760
Passionate,
and somewhat frightening.

18
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,150
Mom, what's happening in this part?

19
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,910
That's a very good question.

20
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,730
Do you know what the devil is...

21
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,900
...conceptually?

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Uh... Yes.

23
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,620
Okay, well, basically,
it's about a man...

24
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,490
...who makes a very bad choice to
enter into a bargain with the devil.

25
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,260
What happened to him?
- Nothing good.

26
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,870
There are certain choices
that you can never undo,

27
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,270
so that's why it's really
important to make good choices,

28
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,195
because every single one
of your actions is...

29
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,580
Choice.
- Yes.

30
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,500
Yes.

31
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,260
So,

32
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,400
make good choices today.

33
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,070
Have a great day.

34
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,180
So I'm telling her,
'Look, I'm done.'

35
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,050
I have two kids of my own.
- That's...

36
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,020
That's Jeannie walking this way.

37
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,086
'Not trying to raise a
third,' is what I told her.

38
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:36,660
That's Helen.

39
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,560
'Get your shit together,' that's what I said.

40
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,315
Never date anybody in their 20s, my advice.

41
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, yeah, that's...
That's Mary.

42
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,730
I tell you, this new doctor I'm
going to see about my... My GERD...

43
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,740
This new doctor says
I gotta sleep at an angle.

44
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,390
Apparently, it helps.

45
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,830
GERD.

46
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,780
And that's Nicole.

47
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,150
What's going on there?
- ...fucking bitch.

48
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,450
Get off my fucking washing machine.

49
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,250
You're bleeding all over the place.

50
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,650
Fucking dirty slut!

51
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,150
Yo, wake up!
This ain't your sofa, honey.

52
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,890
Damn junkies!

53
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,990
What's going on, Nicole? What's going
on? She's driving away my business.

54
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,090
All right, I got it.

55
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,230
They took 'em.

56
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,030
Your shoes? Can you just
get her out of here, please?

57
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,805
I'm gonna have you sit right
down on the laundry basket.

58
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,890
All right.
I'm gonna bandage you up.

59
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,570
Stay away from, Jim, all right?

60
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,870
I don't get it.

61
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:45,990
I mean, how could somebody
choose to live like that?

62
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,790
Like what?

63
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,395
This... This neighborhood
used to be normal, I mean...

64
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,930
We used to play baseball
up here when we were kids.

65
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,300
I'm sure it was a rough dump,
but nothing like this.

66
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,740
Yeah, well, it's got its good parts,
its bad parts like any neighborhood.

67
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,970
Yeah, huh?

68
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,840
But someday you're gonna have
to show me the good parts.

69
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,910
Body found on the A Street Tracks.

70
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,010
Probable overdose.

71
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,230
56201 responding.

72
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,240
Dead bodies
give me the creeps, you know?

73
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,890
Yeah.
- Tell me it gets easier.

74
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,090
It doesn't.

75
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,080
Are you guys shook up like this? -Sure.

76
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,550
Never would have guessed that. You
always seem, you know, very composed.

77
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,520
You just follow the rules,
all right?

78
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,170
You know the procedure, right?

79
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,960
You take the pulse.

80
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,390
I have to warn you that the condition
of the body might be a little unpleasant.

81
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,955
The caller didn't indicate...

82
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,020
Indicate what?

83
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,290
You... You okay?

84
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,640
Hey, what do you want me to do here?

85
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,890
Mickey.

86
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,230
Mickey.

87
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Mickey.

88
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,540
Truman.

89
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,530
Truman.

90
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,830
Hey. What's going on with her?

91
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,670
I don't know.
She's been like that for a bit.

92
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,310
Just saying,
ever since they took the...

93
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,510
The mural down...

94
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,610
...birds can't win a ring.
- Right.

95
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,000
Especially now that Kelce retired.

96
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,610
Oh, yeah...

97
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,770
What's in there?
- Receipt.

98
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,250
That's all she had.
- No, ID?

99
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,720
No. Only thing in her pockets.

100
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Possible homicide.

101
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,460
Possible homicide.

102
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,090
I'll call in forensics.

103
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,460
Oh. What for?

104
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,520
Uh, blood in the mouth.
- Doesn't happen with ODs?

105
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,600
Not usually. Sometimes foam,
but not usually blood.

106
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,170
Uh, those kids, and the man
that we passed coming in,

107
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,285
can you get a statement from
them? See if they saw anything?

108
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,130
Two kids split already.

109
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,390
The other guy had nothing much to say.

110
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,860
Said he didn't see anything.

111
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,615
Definitely, he's coming down off something.

112
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,060
Are you gonna...

113
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,650
...tell me what happened back there?

114
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,045
I thought I recognized her.

115
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,150
And did you?

116
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,420
Hey, I get it.

117
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,590
I'm not judging.

118
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,960
Can I tell you something,
between us?

119
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,290
I lost my job in construction.

120
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,230
Sergeant Ahearn and I have known
each other since we were kids,

121
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,260
so he was the one who convinced
me to take the police exam.

122
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,900
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure I'm
cut out for this type of work, you know?

123
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,710
I think I got into it too late or something.

124
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,490
How old are you?

125
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,590
Forty-five.

126
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:36,000
I mean, I had two other careers before this.

127
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
So did I.

128
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,850
What?

129
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,220
Huh. Just we've been working
together, like, a month now,

130
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,505
and that's the first time you
told me anything about yourself.

131
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,140
Sergeant Ahearn,
you wanted to see me?

132
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,320
So you want to tell me
about what happened today?

133
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,930
Dehydration.

134
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,780
That's really all it was, huh?
- Uh-huh.

135
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,380
Well, you gotta talk to the doc,
to be sure.

136
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,420
Yeah. I don't need to see a doctor.

137
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,470
Well, Union says you do.
Take it up with them, please.

138
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,570
Um...

139
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,760
Will you let me know when
you get an ID on the victim?

140
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,860
Don't hold your breath.

141
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Hey.

142
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:27,956
You talked to Truman lately?

143
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,350
No.

144
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,440
Why?

145
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,310
Well, maybe you should.

146
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,380
Lafferty said when you were
having your little episode,

147
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,690
you were calling his name.

148
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,890
Hi.
- Hey.

149
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,770
Hi, Mom.
- Hey, Thomas.

150
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,270
I couldn't find the sauce.
- That's okay.

151
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,530
Good job. Thank you.

152
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,280
Okay, have a good night,
Bethany.

153
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,850
Oh, thanks. You, too.

154
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,860
Thanks for nothing.

155
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,040
You're so funny.

156
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,620
Mom, what are you doing?

157
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,760
I just missed you today.

158
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,380
Three things, go for it.
What are your three things?

159
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,610
Um...

160
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,310
Watershed.
- Definition?

161
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:53,520
It's like a place that collects all the
rain and snow and sends it to a river.

162
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,400
Okay. What's next?

163
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,860
Um, sleep hygiene.

164
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,820
Are you learning that in health class?

165
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,630
I love that you're learning about
sleep hygiene. That's amazing.

166
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,830
Okay, well, go ahead.
What is it?

167
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,130
So, basically, it's, like,
no screens before bed.

168
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,770
Exactly.

169
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,240
So when you come to my room in the
middle of the night, and you say to me...

170
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,210
Oh, 'Can I sleep with you?'
And you always say no.

171
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,240
It's not because
I don't want to be by your side,

172
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,480
but learning how to fall asleep on your own,

173
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,850
that makes you what?

174
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,380
Um, independent?

175
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,750
It makes you self-sufficient.

176
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,850
Sleep hygiene. Yes.

177
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:27,820
Okay. Last but not least.

178
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,575
Um, genealogy.
I have to make a family tree.

179
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,880
Oh, boy. Well, that's...

180
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,800
...very presumptuous of your teacher.

181
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,650
You know, not everybody
has a family like that.

182
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,215
Can we call Gee-Pop for help?

183
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,490
Okay.

184
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,520
You want one?
- Mm-mm.

185
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,650
What'd you learn at roll call this
morning, about the victim from yesterday?

186
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,750
Any updates or ID?

187
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,860
That's ridiculous.

188
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,260
If she'd been found in Society Hill...

189
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,715
...with a pool of blood in her
mouth, she'd be on national news.

190
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,420
Hey, um,
can I ask you something?

191
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,670
Yep.

192
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,785
Look, some of the guys were
talking about your last partner.

193
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Truman?

194
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,310
They said you two were
close, that's all, you know.

195
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,420
What happened to him?
- He got injured, on the job.

196
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
He's on medical leave.

197
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Do you still talk?

198
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
No.

199
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,430
How come?

200
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,740
We don't... We just don't.

201
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,470
Why are you pressing me on it?

202
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,740
Do you think it was my fault he got hurt?

203
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,140
Is that what Ahearn told you?

204
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,890
He can believe whatever he wants.

205
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,210
Hey, Mickey, look...

206
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,710
Look, the only reason I told Ahearn
about that thing is because...

207
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,850
I was worried about you.

208
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,630
Hey, Alonzo.

209
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,810
I got nothing for you.

210
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:15,905
I haven't seen Kacey.

211
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,980
It's just been a while.

212
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,220
I know. I'm sorry.

213
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Thanks, Alonzo.

214
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,750
That's, Nicole.

215
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,850
Over there is Paula.

216
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:42,820
That's Alonzo's.
He's a nice guy.

217
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,490
He'll let you use the facilities anytime.

218
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,460
That right there is uh...

219
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,230
I forget her name.

220
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,600
Maura... Maureen.
Something like that.

221
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,900
Anyway, she's a nice person.

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,370
Down that way is a Police Youth Club.

223
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,040
Oh, I... I know it.

224
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,770
I used to go after school when I was a kid.

225
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,110
You grew up here?

226
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,740
You've been here all your life?

227
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,940
Yeah, pretty much.

228
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,950
I mean, I went to Penn for a year.

229
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,880
Okay, Ivy League.

230
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,880
How'd you end up on patrol?

231
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,220
Well, I wasn't there that long.

232
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,825
Kensington girl, huh?
That's why you transferred here?

233
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,265
I know people like you,
got that teacher vibe.

234
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,280
Quiet, proper.

235
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,970
Those are the kind of people who
have the best kind of stories.

236
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,700
Truman, I don't have any stories.

237
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,520
Hey, I'm not judging, or prying.

238
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,210
These women are good people.

239
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,010
The men, well,
they're a different story.

240
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,050
Hey, you read?
- Oh, I love reading.

241
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,050
I'm reading this book
right now about choices.

242
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,380
It says we all have two
choice-making systems.

243
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,645
System one is fast,
based on emotion and instinct.

244
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,460
System two, slow,

245
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,990
based on logic and deliberation,
you understand?

246
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,230
Just like these women out here.

247
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,000
When they first started using,
they might have had a choice.

248
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,570
They might have been using
system two, slow one.

249
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,940
On the other hand,

250
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,270
they might have been kids, or had
a parent who used, or a boyfriend,

251
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,510
might have gone looking for a
way to feel something different.

252
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,610
Whatever.

253
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,830
What I know is...

254
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,100
...it's not a choice for them anymore.

255
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,685
That's not the right word for what it is.

256
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,510
Evening, Mrs. Mahon.

257
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,040
Evening, Thomas.
How was your day at school?

258
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,680
Terrific. How was your day at...

259
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,550
Wait. What do you do? Uh,
Thomas, that's not polite.

260
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,350
I don't mind.

261
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,620
I'm retired, Thomas.
I don't work anymore.

262
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,060
Come home, bub. Let's go.

263
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,990
How's the apartment treating you?

264
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,405
Uh, it's lovely.
It's... It's very nice.

265
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,030
Michaela, a man stopped by for you today.

266
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,970
I'm sorry.
- I...

267
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,270
He rang my bell asking if you were here.

268
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,940
He must have thought
you lived in my house.

269
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,810
He didn't say anything else?
No name?

270
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,350
No. He just asked if you were here.

271
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,650
I said no,
and he went on his way.

272
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,280
Very tall, neatly dressed,
very handsome,

273
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,940
if you want to know what I think. -It's Dad.

274
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,490
Yeah. Um, thanks.

275
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,590
Sorry. Yeah.

276
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:35,930
Can you call Daddy? Can you tell
him to come home when we're home?

277
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,860
I will try.

278
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,830
Guess what? I talked to Gee-Pop today,

279
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,040
and we're going to go over
to his house on Sunday.

280
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,670
We are?
- Yes.

281
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,770
Yes!

282
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,410
Mom, do you think we need
to worry about robots...

283
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,185
...taking over our planet
in the very, very near future?

284
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,790
Probably not in the very, very near future.

285
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,890
Hmm.

286
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,930
Mom, I can feel you looking at me.

287
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,030
Oh, sorry.

288
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,810
Faust was scared of the devil.

289
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,110
He knew he should stay away from him.

290
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,850
But Faust also knew that the devil
could make all his wishes come true.

291
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,965
His biggest wish was that this
girl Gretchen would love him.

292
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,060
So, he made a choice.

293
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:46,740
Gee-Pop.

294
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,360
Hey, buddy.

295
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,430
He gave up his soul
to get the life he dreamed of.

296
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,670
And because of that one bad choice.

297
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,250
Faust's life was damned,
way before he ever went to hell.

298
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,390
You understand, Gee-Pop?

299
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,220
He likes the music.

300
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,310
You like the music.
He likes you.

301
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,350
I got something better
than a record for you. Here.

302
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,740
Thomas, take this.

303
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,160
What is it? It's a little slot machine.

304
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,330
Twohey got it for you,
down the casino.

305
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,425
Have fun. Go play!
Stop with the doom and gloom.

306
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,550
Thanks, Gee-Pop.
- Yeah.

307
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,220
Mm.
- Oh.

308
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,810
If I were to kiss my great grandpop like that,

309
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,910
he would've...

310
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
So...

311
00:21:41,754 --> 00:21:42,980
...how's your life going?

312
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,205
It's fine. It's the same.

313
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:47,937
Still getting mail for your ex.

314
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,680
He came by the house yesterday.

315
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,230
We weren't home.

316
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,050
What the hell do you think that's all about?

317
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,730
Honestly, I have no clue.

318
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,470
He stopped sending child support,

319
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,970
stopped sending money to the school,

320
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,400
stopped showing up for your kid's
life. Why show up out of nowhere?

321
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,870
He wants something.
- Motherfucker!

322
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,240
Oh, shut your dirty mouth.
- There's a kid in the parlor.

323
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,410
How is he not dead yet?
Isn't he, like, 103?

324
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,480
Carmichael will never die.

325
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,980
He's a tough customer,
just like his dad.

326
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,020
Is that chocolate? That
can't be good for him, right?

327
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,245
It hasn't killed him yet.

328
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,030
Anyway, he's up to something.

329
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,300
Carmichael?

330
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,770
Don't be fresh. Simon.

331
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,300
You need to cut him out for good this time.

332
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,340
Don't need him or his money.

333
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,810
He's Thomas's father.

334
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,710
Just because Simon can make a
baby doesn't make him a father.

335
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,080
Thomas doesn't need whatever
fancy school you got him in.

336
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,220
You never went to no fancy school,
and you turned out just fine.

337
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,850
I also don't have dyslexia.

338
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,550
Oh, for Christ's sake.

339
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,570
Thomas is smart, just like you.

340
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,240
Nobody can tell me different.

341
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,700
You don't need Simon.

342
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,220
The only family Thomas needs
is sitting in this room.

343
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,150
You understand?

344
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,810
And another two
armed-robberies last night.

345
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,050
Both outside the MAC machine
at Kensington and Clearfield.

346
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,220
All right.

347
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,850
The encampment on Emerald.

348
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,850
Toll Brothers are starting
construction in a week,

349
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,620
and Mayor wants
all the tents out by Saturday.

350
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,330
Let's be gentle this time, folks.

351
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:40,150
Last thing we need
is the Inquirer on our ass.

352
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh. One last thing.

353
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,470
There might be a bad batch
of something out there.

354
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,710
We've noticed an increase
in ODs all over the city.

355
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,640
Two females deceased in our
district alone last night.

356
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,750
Unclear how long they were there
before they were discovered.

357
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,280
Well, just ask around about it if you can.

358
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,590
Storeowners, locals, whatever.
That's all.

359
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,580
How do we know that they were ODs?

360
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,600
In light of the possible
homicide a few days ago...

361
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,100
...that was called in as an OD,
and it wasn't.

362
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Jesus, Mickey.

363
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,510
I haven't even had my coffee yet.

364
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,810
Let's give the conspiracy theories
a rest until lunchtime at least.

365
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,110
Yeah, but, shouldn't we at
least run an autopsy to be sure?

366
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,050
These were ODs. Just like the other
1,200 we're on track for this year.

367
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,290
Don't need to waste
taxpayers' dollars to prove it.

368
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,390
That's all.

369
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,235
Sergeant Ahearn? Do you
have an ID on the victims?

370
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,770
One's Elizabeth O'Connor,
20 years old.

371
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,570
Lived in the encampment off Emerald.

372
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,070
Boyfriend, David Miller,
reported her missing a week ago.

373
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,920
And the other girl?

374
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,860
No ID yet.

375
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Can I go now?

376
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,600
Normally, I wouldn't call
you for something so small.

377
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,835
But she keeps doing this.

378
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,990
That's Kacey.

379
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,090
Sweet kid.

380
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,920
She's been on and off the Avenue
for the last five years.

381
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,020
Hey, Kacey.

382
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,160
How you doing?

383
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,110
What did she take?

384
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,210
Just a birthday card.

385
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:18,510
It's for a one-year-old.
Somebody's birthday.

386
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,310
Okay. Come on, Kacey.

387
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,580
Let's get up.

388
00:26:23,676 --> 00:26:25,676
Come on, let's go.

389
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,390
Come on, Kacey.

390
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,450
I was wondering when you'd show up.

391
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,020
Am I that predictable?

392
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,290
You're gonna get me canned if you
keep showing up for every Jane Doe.

393
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,920
I thought it might be Kacey.

394
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,520
I get that.

395
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,260
How's the new place?
Thomas adjusting?

396
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,830
Yeah. Yeah. Thomas could
be happy living in a box.

397
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,970
Oh, he's got his mom's sunny disposition.

398
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,130
They both just came in.
Do you recognize them?

399
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,160
No, but there's been a lot of new
people in the neighborhood lately.

400
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
Oh, poor kid.

401
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,980
Look at the abscesses.

402
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,310
She must have been in a lot of pain.

403
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,820
Ahearn believes that there is a
bad batch of something out there,

404
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,150
but the first victim had blood in her mouth.

405
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,450
Yeah. Caught that.

406
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,360
The blood was from lacerations
on her tongue. She had a seizure.

407
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,460
A seizure from what?

408
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,200
That's the strange thing.
I ran a tox screen.

409
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,690
There wasn't enough of anything
in her system for it to be an OD.

410
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,950
So what was it?
- Insulin.

411
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,860
You want to know what's weird?

412
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,445
I have no evidence that she was diabetic.

413
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,980
You think somebody killed her?

414
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,880
Not sure.
No one in their right mind...

415
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,620
...would inject themselves
with that much insulin.

416
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,950
But right mind is the operative term here.

417
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,590
Unless the other bodies were injected, too.

418
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,020
Are you going to do an autopsy?

419
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,360
I wasn't planning on it. Both of
them came in as accidental ODs.

420
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,755
You know something I don't?

421
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,860
Three bodies discovered in four days.

422
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,730
Similar demographics on the victims.

423
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,900
And one of them
might have been murdered.

424
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,740
If there's a bad batch
of something out there,

425
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,140
then these girls need to know what it is.

426
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,720
If there isn't, then they need
to know to watch their backs.

427
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,115
And if I don't tell them...

428
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,020
What are we doing here again?

429
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,090
Helping 'em move or something?
- We just got to let them know...

430
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,860
...that they have to be on their
way by the end of the week,

431
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,800
or the city's gonna make them.

432
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,020
Great. Can't wait.

433
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,400
You uh...
You can take those tents.

434
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,795
I'll take the street.
- Hmm.

435
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,910
Excuse me.
Do you know a David Miller?

436
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,410
David Miller.
Elizabeth O'Connor?

437
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,420
Please, do you know a David
Miller, Elizabeth O'Connor?

438
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,100
They're not in trouble. I'm
just trying to help them out.

439
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,025
The starry tent down there.
- Okay, thank you.

440
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,210
David?

441
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,610
It was taken at graduation,

442
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,710
three years ago.

443
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,670
She looks very happy.

444
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,960
Are you David Miller?

445
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,930
You reported her missing?
- About a week ago.

446
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,860
She never left the tent
for more than a few hours.

447
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,450
I mean, she'd hit the Ave,
but she'd always come back.

448
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,015
I'm very sorry for your loss.

449
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,310
Did she say or do anything
unusual before she left?

450
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,610
No. -Maybe she met
somebody new on the Avenue?

451
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,980
No. She...

452
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,905
Can you think of anybody
who'd wanna harm her?

453
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,770
Harm her?

454
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,970
Cops told me she OD'd.

455
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,950
'7 Brothers?'

456
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,095
Would Elizabeth have any reason
to be down in Tinicum?

457
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,530
The airport?
- Yeah.

458
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,210
We keep our private jet on standby there.

459
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,320
You know, maybe she knows
somebody who works there.

460
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,320
No, she would have no reason
to be down there, okay?

461
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,720
Been living on the streets
a couple months now,

462
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,860
haven't left the whole time.

463
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Everything okay here?

464
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,600
Okay.

465
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,995
Thanks, David. Sorry again.

466
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,620
What the fuck, Mickey?

467
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,370
Okay.

468
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,590
We didn't just come down here
to clean out some encampment.

469
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,560
Hey.

470
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,660
Who was that guy?

471
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,220
All right. The receipt you found
on the girl down the A Street tracks...

472
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,460
...is from a gas station
outside the airport, right?

473
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,430
The girl that OD'd this week
had a napkin from 7 Brothers.

474
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:00,400
So they were both down there.
- Yeah, for no apparent reason.

475
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,300
I know these women. They
don't leave the neighborhood.

476
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,370
Okay. why are you
looking into this, all right?

477
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,510
I mean, isn't that what the
detectives are supposed to do?

478
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,980
Yes, but they don't care.

479
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,440
This is the problem.
You saw Ahearn this morning.

480
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,470
He could barely be bothered
to give me an ID on the victim.

481
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,050
Look, just because I grew up with Ahearn...

482
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,090
...doesn't mean I'm going to be
all on his side, all right?

483
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,490
Just want you to know
you can tell me stuff.

484
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,590
I'm not gonna tell him.

485
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:50,300
Are you fucking kidding me?
- Why do you keep walking away?

486
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Mickey.

487
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
Paula.

488
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,810
Hey, Paula.

489
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,560
Fuck off, Mickey.

490
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,760
Mickey!
- Wait.

491
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,900
Who are you looking for?

492
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,550
What the hell?

493
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,140
Okay. Whoa, whoa, who is that?

494
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,810
Do you know her?
- I'm going to get a coffee.

495
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,910
I'll be right back.

496
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,790
I haven't seen anything, Mick.

497
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,220
If Paula comes back,
will you call me?

498
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,635
Maybe she's seen her.
- Yeah, of course.

499
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,010
All right.

500
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,140
Mickey. What? What is it?

501
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,340
Nothing. -What the
hell's going on with you?

502
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,780
Uh, what are you talking about?

503
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,730
What are you, fucking
jokin' with me right now?

504
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,250
I... Look.

505
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,120
I feel like I'm a people person.
You know, I'm good with people.

506
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,220
But with you, it's like...

507
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,930
Look, did I do something wrong?

508
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,160
I mean, you don't like me or something?

509
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,100
No, nothing.
- Then what?

510
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,430
You miss Truman?
- It has nothing to do with that.

511
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,370
Then what is it? Look, I'm
trying to do my job here, okay?

512
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,070
I'm trying to be your partner,
but I can't do it...

513
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,240
...when all you do is leave me in the dark.

514
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,420
I tell you what you need
to know. -No, you don't.

515
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,080
And every time I ask you,

516
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,780
you duck into this fucking 'papi' store.

517
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,190
You don't tell me where we're going,

518
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,790
or what we're doing, or why.

519
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:41,080
And you certainly don't tell me why you
have such a frickin' hard-on for these girls.

520
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,030
'These girls?'
What is that supposed to mean?

521
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,700
It means you seem to take it personally.

522
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,170
And you won't tell me why.

523
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,570
At least it seems like it.

524
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,270
I mean, if you knew one of
these victims or something...

525
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,040
No, I don't have to know the victims...

526
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,210
...in order to care about
what happens to them.

527
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,810
The question is why you and Ahearn...

528
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,040
...and all your cop buddies you play
baseball with don't seem to give a shit.

529
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,880
That's not...
I give a shit. Okay?

530
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
I do give a shit.

531
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,930
Look...

532
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,020
I'm gonna get a coffee.

533
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,945
But maybe it's not
such a bad thing, you know?

534
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,890
What's not such a bad thing?

535
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,990
Don't get me wrong.

536
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,150
It's a shame when anyone dies, okay?

537
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,170
But what kind of life, right?

538
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,220
I mean, you know,
maybe they're...

539
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,750
Maybe they're what?

540
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,080
I just feel bad for them.

541
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,460
I don't think that's what you meant.

542
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,300
You wanna know why
I don't tell you anything?

543
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,100
You got your answer.

544
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
Simon.

545
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,240
Simon, are you coming?

546
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,340
In a moment, babe.

547
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,000
The man who stopped by the other day,

548
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,270
did he say anything else?

549
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,910
Like why he was here,
what he wanted?

550
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,340
No. He just asked if you were here.

551
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,360
When I told him you weren't home, he left.

552
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,610
Okay, well,
if he stops by again,

553
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,180
can you just tell him that we've moved,

554
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,850
or that we don't live here anymore?

555
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,620
Whatever you want.

556
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,150
Just so long as you're not
bringing trouble around here.

557
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,420
I don't like trouble.

558
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,160
He's my ex. He's not trouble.
He's not dangerous.

559
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,260
I'm just... I, uh...

560
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,705
We just don't talk anymore.

561
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,230
Is there anything else I need to know?

562
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,500
He drives a blue Mustang.
You can't miss it.

563
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,360
Oh, the man who stopped by here
wasn't driving a Mustang.

564
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:12,028
Wh... Uh...
Well, then what was he driving?

565
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,490
Red truck, pickup like.

566
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,545
You sure you're not having a problem?

567
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,500
What happened in here?

568
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,575
I kinda got into trouble at school.

569
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,310
Trouble?

570
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:47,745
It was my turn to do
favorite things for my class...

571
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,320
...and I told Teacher Carmen
about the song you were playing,

572
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,290
the one about Faust
and making bad choices.

573
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,390
Okay.

574
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,430
Might have told her about
his deal with the devil,

575
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,590
and how he ended up in hell forever.

576
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,080
Should I...

577
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,780
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

578
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,620
Listen...

579
00:38:13,717 --> 00:38:15,840
That was my fault.

580
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,940
I should have put it in context for you...

581
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,080
...because it's a really intense,
very religious way of phrasing it.

582
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,020
And we're not particularly...

583
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:31,490
Did... Did Teacher Carmen get
upset that you used that word?

584
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,330
No, she just told me that's not
how the story ends.

585
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,630
She said that Faust doesn't end up in hell.

586
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,860
She said that Gretchen
saves him with her love,

587
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,335
and that Faust was so sorry that he
took the deal that the devil let him go.

588
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,740
I suppose that's...

589
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,340
...the narrative that
most people subscribe to.

590
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,340
But that's the beauty of stories like this.

591
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,500
We each have our own interpretation.

592
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,320
How come you think that?

593
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:06,290
Well, as an officer, I see
people make bad choices every day.

594
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,230
And I think after they've
made that bad choice,

595
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,400
it's just really,
really hard to save them.

596
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,500
And sometimes, you just have
to let that person go,

597
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,360
because there are dark forces
out there, that are just...

598
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,790
...too powerful.

599
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,690
Understand?

600
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,950
But, Mom, your job is a police officer.

601
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,410
Isn't saving people what you do?

602
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,920
Yeah, and I try to, every day.

603
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:38,885
But in my experience, not everybody
can be saved, and that's my point.

604
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
You don't agree?

605
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,530
I don't know, Mom.
I just think...

606
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,100
...if there's someone who's in trouble.

607
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,665
I'd want to try to save them.

608
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,185
Even if the devil is out there?

609
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,305
Especially because the devil's out there.

610
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,830
What are you doing here?

611
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,700
Thought a lot about
what you said the other day,

612
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,150
and I just wanted
to explain something to you.

613
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,200
I told you that there's good
parts and bad parts of Kensington.

614
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,690
You said, 'Oh, someday you
should show me the good parts.'

615
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,765
I'm showing you a really good part.

616
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,020
I grew up here.

617
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,420
I went to the elementary school
down the road,

618
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,410
and I played in the high school
orchestra two blocks from here.

619
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,510
You know what?

620
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:48,690
So did a lot of the girls
who are working the Avenue.

621
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,830
We all came from the same place.
We all had the same dreams.

622
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,530
None of them thought they were
going to end up where they are.

623
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,650
They thought they were going to be
a doctor, or a nurse, or a teacher.

624
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,385
It's our job to protect them...

625
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,915
...no matter what they've done,
or who they are.

626
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,450
And we can't do that if
you are questioning...

627
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:14,140
...whether they're worth protecting
in the first place.

628
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,320
I would like to request solo duty.

629
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:24,775
I think that Lafferty should be
paired with a different officer.

630
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,570
How to Win Friends and Influence People.

631
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,720
The Fitzpatrick edition.

632
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,320
This 'cause of what happened to Truman?

633
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,420
No.

634
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,700
You know,
I partner people for a reason.

635
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,280
If I had the budget,
which I don't.

636
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,580
I'd see everybody partnered up.

637
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,220
You don't want to get out there
and be in a situation...

638
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,040
...where nobody's got your back.

639
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,050
With all due respect, sir,
I already have that.

640
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,290
I'm so sorry. Mrs. Yoon.

641
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,290
Can you fucking imagine?

642
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,630
They haven't heard from her
in two years before today,

643
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:34,405
and the first call they get
is that she's been murdered.

644
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,620
Murdered.

645
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,250
You were right.

646
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,640
I ran autopsies on all three women.

647
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:49,060
And all three came back with a lethal
amount of insulin in their system.

648
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,900
Looks like someone's
going after these girls.

649
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,810
How long has it been
since you've seen her?

650
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,460
How you been, Kace?

651
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,860
Yeah, I'm good.

652
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,170
Haven't seen you around
in a bit. You just get out?

653
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,940
You got someplace to stay?
- Yeah.

654
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,290
You're gonna be staying
with us for a little while.

655
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,560
Hey, Mick.

656
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,370
Mickey.

657
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,875
What's going on? You all right?

658
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,580
Can we let her go?

659
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:38,200
What, you mean Kacey?

660
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,765
Yeah. I will never ask again.

661
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,050
Tell me why.

662
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,640
Is it about the birthday card?

663
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,510
It's sad...

664
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:56,455
I get it's sad, but... -I am
never going to ask you again.

665
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,570
Ever. Please.

666
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:11,010
Come on, Kacey.

667
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,070
You stay safe out there.

668
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,655
Kacey's been gone for too long this time.

669
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,610
What are you gonna do?
- Find her.

670
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,710
Whatever I have to do.

671
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:49,850
I'm worried about what you're going to find.

672
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,420
So am I.

673
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:19,310
I lied to you when you asked me if I
had any stories, and I said I didn't.

674
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,410
But you do.

675
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,580
We all do.

676
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,760
Listen, what happened to these girls,

677
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,860
it's not their fault.

678
00:45:29,956 --> 00:45:32,676
But we can't let all of them go.

679
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
I know.

680
00:45:37,897 --> 00:45:40,787
It's still our job to police them.

681
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,270
Maybe they'll be better if they
know someone was watching 'em.

682
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,370
She won't be better.

683
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:54,195
It's like you said, they don't
really have a choice anymore.

684
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,945
But I just had to let her go.

685
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,010
You know her.

686
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,780
She's my sister.

687
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,750
Hello? Hey,
Mickey. It's Alonzo.

688
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,950
You asked me to call you if I see Paula.

689
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,620
She just walked out the shop.

690
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,720
Thank you.

691
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,010
Paula, Paula.

692
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,660
Hey.
- No.

693
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,930
I'm trying to find Kace.
- I got nothing to say to you.

694
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:34,930
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm just trying to find Kacey.

695
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,230
Yeah?
- Yeah.

696
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,640
Good for you. -I haven't
seen her in over a month.

697
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,770
Please.
- Okay.

698
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:40,940
I'm just worried.
- So now you're worried?

699
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,340
Fuck off!
- Paula, take it.

700
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,830
Tell me what... Tell me
what you know, please?

701
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,210
Please.

702
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:53,240
That's fucking low, Mick,
That's so low. Give me that shit!

703
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,890
She got in a car with a John
about a month ago.

704
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:03,360
I haven't seen her since. -Who? Who?
Who was it? Do you remember the car?

705
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,260
You remember the guy? Do you
remember anything? -No. No.

706
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,910
Come on. Paula.
- Can I go now?

707
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,850
Paula, please.

708
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,320
Paula.

709
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,480
She disappeared the night of, uh...

710
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,100
October 2nd.

711
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,370
Think it was, like, around 8:00.

712
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:44,000
Okay. Thank you.

713
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,225
I'm not doing it for you.

714
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,850
Alonzo, the cameras
outside, they still working?

715
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:05,305
I need to see all of your footage
from the night of October 2nd.

716
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,675
All right. This should be it.

717
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,620
There she is.

718
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,570
No.

719
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,670
No, no, no, no, no.

720
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,300
Bethany, hey. Thomas is gonna
have a sleepover tonight,

721
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,500
so can you just pack up some
of his stuff? I'll be home soon.

722
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,600
Come on, Thomas.

723
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,570
Come on. Come.

724
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,670
Watch your step.

725
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:14,295
It's all right, let's go.

726
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,080
Get in.

727
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,250
I need your help.
