1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,820
We got the guy.
- Who is it?

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,220
Sean Kelly.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,866
Sean Kelly?

4
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:14,190
The guy you arrested
on DV a few days ago.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,710
You need to step back.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,660
You're not taking my girls.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,900
Colleen, it's gonna be easier for
them if this goes smooth, okay?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Another young woman was found.
Emily Morris.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,870
Uh, insulin overdose?

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,110
It's a gunshot.
She's still alive.

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,210
Who did this to you?

12
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:33,180
Was it a cop?

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,255
We think he's going to do it again.

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,750
You ever need to hide something,
you put it in here.

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,760
You ever need to tell me
anything, you put it in here.

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,690
And if you ever need to tell me something...
- I'll put it in here, too.

17
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,330
A woman from the Avenue said that
we need to be looking at a cop.

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,260
Who is she?

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Paula Mulroney.

20
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,870
Sean Kelly? He's not a cop.

21
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,000
It seems Paula was wrong.

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,240
Just like me,
so fuckin' wrong.

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,995
I don't remember the last time I was right.

24
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,810
No, no, no, no.

25
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,615
There goes that beautiful mind.

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,520
Spinnin' out. Second guessing.

27
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,480
You know what?
- What?

28
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,600
I'm gonna make things
easy on us this morning.

29
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,850
Oh.

30
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,300
First, I'm gonna get dressed.

31
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,740
Pants. Shirt.

32
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,420
Shoes. In that order.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,290
Then...
I'm gonna sneakily,

34
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,180
and stealthily make you some tea.

35
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,870
And I'll be out the door...

36
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,970
...before you have time to freak out,

37
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,070
or Thomas wakes up.

38
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,670
Whichever one happens first.

39
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,900
Where'd you go?

40
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,830
Sean Kelly.

41
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,680
I guess I just can't wrap my head around it.

42
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,340
I know Simon makes more sense,
for a lot of reasons.

43
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,220
But you heard what DiPaolo said.
- I know.

44
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,580
You gotta let it go, Mick.

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,060
For your own sake.
- I can't.

46
00:03:21,145 --> 00:03:23,380
For Kacey's.

47
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,390
If Kelly's the guy,
then where the hell is she?

48
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,730
At least if it was Simon,
I might know where to find her.

49
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,490
Six months. She's never
been gone this long.

50
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,800
She's not at Gee's,
she's not at Ashley's.

51
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,330
Nobody's seen her on the Avenue.

52
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,150
She'll turn up. She always does.

53
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
That's reassuring.

54
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,210
I don't think you actually wanna find her.

55
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,870
I know you've never liked her.

56
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,665
Yeah. It's on me.'Cause Kacey's
always been such a huge fan of mine.

57
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,450
I should never have let her
walk out of our house that day.

58
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,800
It wasn't your choice.

59
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,440
It was hers.

60
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,730
This isn't your fault.

61
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,230
Look... I've already got buddies
in the 30th looking out for her.

62
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,100
But there's only so much we can
do if she doesn't want to be found.

63
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,290
You got to let it go.

64
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,655
I'll let it go when I find her.

65
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,650
Thomas, you almost done getting ready?

66
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,210
Bethany's gonna be here in ten minutes.

67
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,120
Oh, yeah.
Getting dressed now.

68
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,490
I thought you didn't like Bethany.

69
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,395
That was just a misunderstanding.

70
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,370
Oh.
- Good morning.

71
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,600
Good morning.
Just wanted to give you this.

72
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,440
Thomas left Dun-Dun
at my house yesterday.

73
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,610
I thought he might be needing him.

74
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,710
Thank you.

75
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,010
And thank you for everything last night.

76
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,130
I don't know what I would've
done if something had happened.

77
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,230
No thanks necessary.

78
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,700
Thomas is a pleasure to be around.

79
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,260
Look, I don't get too many
visitors these days.

80
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,030
So if you want me
to watch Thomas again today,

81
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,400
it probably will be a good thing
for me, too. Not just Thomas.

82
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,600
He can help decorate
my tree for Christmas.

83
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,290
Thank you for the offer,
but we've got today covered.

84
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,490
Not Winnie-the-Pooh.

85
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,110
Winnie-the-Pooh?

86
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,240
Bethany?

87
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,450
Dresses like him anyway.

88
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,230
I... I don't wanna know
as much about her navel as I do.

89
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,510
I'll watch Thomas.

90
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,380
You're desperate, dear.

91
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,130
But you're not that desperate.

92
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,920
Maria. Hey,
is Sean Kelly still in holding?

93
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,590
Uh, yeah, he's still here, but he's
about to be transferred to Riverside.

94
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,665
Soon as, uh,
Sam gets off his break.

95
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Okay. Thank you.

96
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,570
Mickey, you got a sec?

97
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,942
Assuming you heard the
news about the perp...

98
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,210
...you arrested in the
domestic violence case?

99
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,680
Looks like he could also be
the perp in those murders.

100
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,795
Lafferty mentioned you two saw
him at the first crime scene.

101
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,635
You don't remember me,
do you?

102
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,960
I don't remember much.

103
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,620
Lafferty was the one who spoke to him.

104
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,690
Well, he said Kelly seemed pretty jittery.

105
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,230
Thought at first he might've
been coming down from something,

106
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,060
but, you know,
now he's not so sure.

107
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,230
And we're sure he's the guy?

108
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,140
It's just, I arrested him
on a domestic assault call,

109
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,740
and he didn't present as somebody
who was trying to cover up a murder.

110
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,580
Or murders. If anything,
it was the opposite.

111
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,210
Well, we've got his DNA so far
on two of the victims.

112
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,046
He's got a history of abuse. We're...

113
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:24,220
...searching his home
now, talking to his wife.

114
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,230
Trying to establish
a timeline for the murders.

115
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,625
Hey, don't worry, all right?
We're investigating every avenue.

116
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,350
You set me up.

117
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,535
I set you up?
You told me you remembered me.

118
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:20,240
And now I know where from.

119
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,340
I was just playing with you.

120
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,780
Do you really think I would've
been fucking with you like that?

121
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,610
Remindin' you that I was on those tracks...

122
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,130
...if I was the one who had
murdered those girls? Hm?

123
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,490
I didn't do this.
What they're saying.

124
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,620
DNA says you did.
- Please.

125
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,560
I ain't the first guy in Philly
to peel off a ten-spot for a trick.

126
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,465
And I probably won't be the last.

127
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,260
Seen this girl?

128
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,630
Huh.

129
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,260
You really think I'm gonna help you?

130
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,095
So you can set me up again?

131
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,850
I didn't fuck her.

132
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
That girl.

133
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:27,135
But, uh...

134
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,760
...everybody else did.

135
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,660
Hey, Maria, have you
seen Lafferty this morning?

136
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
No, I haven't seen him.

137
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,100
Hey, guys,
have you seen Lafferty?

138
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,050
He's on leave.

139
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,100
Why?

140
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,400
What happened?

141
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,670
Well, now you're concerned about him?

142
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,200
You were the one who requested solo duty.

143
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,400
So, I'm pretty sure this falls
under 'none of your business.'

144
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,920
Yeah.
Hold your horses. I'm coming.

145
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Mickey.

146
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,640
What are you doing here?

147
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,580
I just came to check on you.

148
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,080
Ahearn said that you called out of work.

149
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,890
What?

150
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,740
Nothing. I just didn't think that you... Yeah.

151
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,310
Sorry. Come on in.

152
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Please.

153
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,940
Sorry about the mess.
The kids just left.

154
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,540
They never know how to leave
the place the way they found it.

155
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,190
I understand the feeling.

156
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,080
Of course, you knew.
Who am I talking to?

157
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,250
Hey, uh, you want a beer? I got
a couple lagers in the fridge.

158
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,350
Well, I'm on duty.

159
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
But thanks.

160
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,110
Oh.

161
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,920
Truth is, they benched me.

162
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,330
Why?

163
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,275
'Failure to follow through
on tasks,' is what Ahearn said.

164
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,845
Well, I told you I wasn't cut out for this.

165
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,680
I think my head's fucked up, you know?

166
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,075
With all those girls dying.

167
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
That's normal.

168
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,950
Means you care.

169
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,050
Does it?

170
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
I don't know.

171
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:01,510
You know what really fucks me up?

172
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,380
I talked to him for five minutes.

173
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,960
Sean Kelly.

174
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,245
I talked to the actual murderer
for five minutes and... and...

175
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,850
I missed it.

176
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,510
I mean, what if I could've
stopped him from doing it again?

177
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,820
Maybe he's not the killer.

178
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,320
I don't think he did it either.

179
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,350
Maybe your instincts were
correct the first time around.

180
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,740
I just keep going over it in my head,
you know, thinkin' about what I missed.

181
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,340
What? What do you see?

182
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,990
A guy who looked guilty.

183
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,450
He was shakin'.

184
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,970
He was lookin' over at the scene.

185
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,940
Kept lookin' like he wanted
to get the fuck outta there.

186
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,760
But I was just so distracted
by that dead body.

187
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,750
Did you tell Ahearn all that?

188
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,420
Oh, yeah. It's probably why he benched me.

189
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Maybe he was right to.

190
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,570
But, uh...

191
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,655
...honestly, I don't even think he cared.

192
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,330
I mean, we go way back, right?

193
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,580
Sometimes you can't...

194
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,395
...know a person fully. You know?

195
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,040
What do you mean?

196
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,810
I don't know. Listen,
he's been different, you know.

197
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,710
Closed off since I started.

198
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,380
Like he's hiding something?
- No.

199
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,920
Maybe I was just askin' him
too many questions, you know.

200
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,485
Gettin' in his face too much.

201
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,110
I tried my best.

202
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,910
That beat though...

203
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,000
...that neighborhood is hard.

204
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,180
Temptation on every corner.
It's all out in the open.

205
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,340
And no one seems to care.
But...

206
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,690
...you gotta fit in, you gotta
provide for your family,

207
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,180
so you roll with it.

208
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,110
And that means lookin' the other way.

209
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,110
And in the end, you're so used
to lookin' the other way...

210
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,040
...that you forgot why you became
a cop in the first place.

211
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,140
You know what I mean?

212
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,180
I think Ahearn got lost,
if I'm being honest.

213
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,710
Do you know the resident Sean Kelly?

214
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,130
Hey, find anything that ties
Sean Kelly to the victims?

215
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,545
Nothing worth a shit,
but still looking.

216
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,240
Hey, Colleen. How you doin'?

217
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,160
They took my girls is how I'm doing.

218
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,430
I don't know when they're coming back.

219
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,880
I told the social worker
that you were protecting them.

220
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,230
From him.

221
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:05,430
CPS just has to do their due
diligence, then they'll be back.

222
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,870
Was one thing when Sean
was coming after me, but...

223
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,990
...my babies? Hell no.

224
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Now he's...

225
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,840
...been arrested for murdering them girls.

226
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,030
Do you think he's capable of that?

227
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,245
I think he's capable of anything.

228
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,190
Uh, have you seen this girl?

229
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,080
I, uh, remember her from high school,

230
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,750
if that's what you're gettin' at.

231
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,850
She's my sister.

232
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,200
Kacey Fitzpatrick.

233
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,490
She's been missing.

234
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,415
From around the same time
the murders started.

235
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,190
And...

236
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,830
...do you think that Sean
had somethin' to do with that?

237
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,075
I don't know.
That's why I was asking.

238
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,070
I haven't... I haven't seen her.

239
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Uh, maybe...

240
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,710
...a couple of years back I saw her,

241
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:22,400
you know, with, uh, some
folks from high school, but...

242
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,750
You were wrong about high school.

243
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,850
How's that?

244
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,825
I didn't think I was better than anybody.

245
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,880
It was actually the opposite.
I was just really quiet.

246
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,430
Snobby.

247
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,900
What?

248
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,310
Folks thought you were snobby
'cause you didn't say too much.

249
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,110
You know, the truth is,
I wanted to be like you.

250
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,410
Why... why...

251
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:58,185
...why in God's name would you
want somethin' like that?

252
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,900
I don't know. You were just
one of those people that...

253
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
...everybody liked.

254
00:19:04,095 --> 00:19:06,360
You and your friends, you...

255
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,930
...seemed like you were
on the inside of everything.

256
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,150
Everybody was gravitating towards you.

257
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,480
I bet you're rethinking that now, huh?

258
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,950
No.

259
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,240
Not at all.

260
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,880
I... I... I saw the way
your little girls looked at you.

261
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,700
It was, like,
the same back then.

262
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,720
Um, you're gonna get 'em back.

263
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,955
I'm gonna protect 'em this time, I swear.

264
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,330
My mother lives up in Bucks.
I'm gonna...

265
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:49,105
...take 'em up there, and I'm
gonna leave Sean for good.

266
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,495
I just hope it'll be enough,
you know.

267
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,240
What do you mean?

268
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,050
They're still his kids,
you know. I just...

269
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,530
...wonder how much of him...

270
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,730
...is in them.

271
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,010
Hey. Was wondering when I was
gonna hear back from you.

272
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,510
I saw Sean Kelly.
- And?

273
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,410
I just don't think he's the guy, Truman.

274
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,050
Lafferty seems to think he is.

275
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,490
I've been driving all over town
trying to find answers but...

276
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,180
I don't know. And Emily
Morris AMA'd from the hospital.

277
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:47,825
If we could find her or Paula.

278
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,450
You okay?

279
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Yeah.

280
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,880
Um...

281
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,980
...are we okay?

282
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,190
You mean...

283
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,760
I mean, uh.

284
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,620
I... Yeah, we're...
we're... we're fine.

285
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,890
Now, there's a vote of
confidence if I've ever heard one.

286
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,980
You know, try not to overwhelm
a guy with your enthusiasm.

287
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,230
Yeah, sorry.

288
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,460
Probably not what you signed up for.

289
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,385
No, Mick. I know exactly
what I signed up for.

290
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,970
Mick. Come here.

291
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,970
Who's that?

292
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,070
Nicole.

293
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,480
She wants to talk to me.

294
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,065
I wonder what she wants.
- I have no idea.

295
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,170
Mickey?

296
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,945
Can you hear me?
Mickey? Mickey?

297
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,810
Wait.

298
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,130
Oh, God.

299
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,950
It's 2:00 a.m.

300
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,385
Jesus Christ, Mickey,
you scared the shit out of me.

301
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,600
Where have you been?

302
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,080
What?
I... I was just out.

303
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
Where? Where were you?

304
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,030
Um...

305
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,080
You're...
you're not gonna...

306
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,380
...you're not gonna wanna hear it.
- Hear what?

307
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,010
What?

308
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,590
I've... I found Kacey.

309
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,090
Is she okay?

310
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,210
Tell me. What? What?

311
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,710
She's okay. She's... she's good.

312
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,680
She's clean. Yeah, she's clean.
- She is?

313
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,350
She's got a boyfriend.
Yeah. Yeah. She's...

314
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
So, where's she living?

315
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,960
She wouldn't tell me.

316
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,970
So wh... why...
why wouldn't she tell you that?

317
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,150
Did she not want you
to know where she is?

318
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,790
No. She, uh...

319
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,780
...she... she didn't want you to know.

320
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,400
She doesn't wanna see you.

321
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,495
She... she thinks you're the...

322
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,370
...you're the problem in her life.

323
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,765
The reason she's an addict.

324
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,525
Said she's better when you're not around.

325
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,990
Hey.

326
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,105
Doctor said you broke a couple of ribs.

327
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,595
That's what that pain is.

328
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,320
So you gonna tell me
what happened out there?

329
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,910
Uh, Nicole, Jeannie...

330
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,140
Helen.

331
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,220
I... I didn't... I didn't really...
I didn't really see who else.

332
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,540
But... I don't know what happened.
They just started attacking me.

333
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,480
Yeah, I heard some of it on the phone.

334
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,640
I called 911,
but when I got there...

335
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,350
...they were gone. You were gone.

336
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,890
I think Dock might have been with them.

337
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,250
Dock?

338
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,660
I don't know. Maybe I'm imagining that part.

339
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,500
But why you? Doesn't add up.

340
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,300
It does if what Paula said was true.

341
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
The killer's a cop.

342
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,900
Maybe they think I know him.

343
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,210
What if I don't find Kacey?

344
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,310
Hey.

345
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,800
I'm scared I'm never gonna find her.

346
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,110
She feels so far away.

347
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,800
I have to find her.

348
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,960
I... I have to.
- You will. You will.

349
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,390
We will.

350
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,010
Together.

351
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,780
But you gotta get better first.
- Okay.

352
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,430
I'm worried about you, Mickey.

353
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Out there on your own.

354
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,880
It's always been that way.

355
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,640
It doesn't have to be.

356
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Not anymore.

357
00:26:52,425 --> 00:26:53,830
You've got me.

358
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,310
Yeah.

359
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,660
You got Thomas.

360
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,930
Oh, God. Thomas.
- He's fine.

361
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,800
I spoke to him about an hour ago.

362
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,020
You did?
- Yeah, he's playing Clue with Mrs. Mahon.

363
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,140
He's worried about you, though.

364
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,310
I need to get him.

365
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,170
Doctor said you still
need to stay another night.

366
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,440
No. Truman.
- Mickey.

367
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,523
I need to see Thomas.
Please, please. Please.

368
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:13,910
Okay.

369
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,310
All right, all right.
I'll go get the nurse.

370
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,410
Okay.
- All right.

371
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,600
Hey, hey, let me...
Come on.

372
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,830
Be careful.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

373
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,900
I got it.
- Mom!

374
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,090
Buddy, hi! Hi. Hi. Oh!

375
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,780
It's okay. It looks a lot worse
than it is, I promise you.

376
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,940
Your mom's a tough cookie.

377
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,250
Mm, but why did this happen to you?

378
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,950
I was...

379
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,920
Thomas, you know,
we've talked about this.

380
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,355
Good can't fight evil
without getting a few bruises.

381
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,230
You know what?

382
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:05,430
The upside is that I'm off for
a week to rest and get better.

383
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,560
Are those stitches under there?
- Mm-hm. See?

384
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,710
Looks like those stitches
need to be cleaned up a little.

385
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,810
I can do that for you if you like.

386
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,540
Oh, um, it's okay.
I don't wanna...

387
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,180
Mickey, let her help.

388
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,580
In the meantime, Thomas
and I'll go make some tea.

389
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,315
How's that sound, buddy?
- Yeah.

390
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,190
The trick with stitches
is to keep them clean and dry...

391
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,415
...for at least two days.

392
00:28:33,498 --> 00:28:34,530
Oh.

393
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,990
You got a little blood under there.

394
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,745
I'll clean it up,
and you'll be good as new.

395
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,920
How come you know
so much about stiches?

396
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,170
Well, I was a nurse before I retired.

397
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,435
Seven years in emergency.
Seven years in the NICU.

398
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,730
Oh.

399
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,830
Before that...

400
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,750
I was a nun.

401
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,975
A Sister of Saint Joseph.

402
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,390
Wow.
I was not expecting that.

403
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,880
God has a way of surprising us all.

404
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Why'd you leave?

405
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,830
I met a man.

406
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:18,370
I realized I... loved him
so much, I couldn't stay.

407
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,470
His name was Richard.

408
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,990
He passed a few years ago.

409
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,075
Anyway, I left and I never looked back.

410
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,820
I decided I could help people
in a different way.

411
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,300
This is gonna sting a bit, dear.

412
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,020
Why the NICU?

413
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,220
I don't know, something about
babies, and, uh, a clean slate.

414
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:49,275
It felt like we were starting
from the same place.

415
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,370
It must have been
challenging work, though.

416
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,470
At times it was.

417
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:00,930
I imagine not all babies
start out with a clean slate.

418
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,570
No.

419
00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:07,635
They don't.

420
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,520
But the ones who make it
are stronger for it.

421
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,440
And that is something to see.

422
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,790
I should get back to Thomas. But
thank you very much for your help.

423
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,660
Yeah, anytime.

424
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,820
He's a wonderful boy,
Mickey. Thomas.

425
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,200
Yeah.

426
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,370
I've never seen a child so
attuned to his mother's needs.

427
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,975
The music he listens to,
the games he wants to play...

428
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,060
You're in every decision he makes.

429
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,260
Which means,
your worry is his worry.

430
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,055
Children are resilient, and adversity
can be good for growth. But...

431
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,840
...whatever it is you're up against,

432
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,870
whatever demons you're battling,

433
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,350
he feels it.

434
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,470
Thomas is special.

435
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:40,360
And maybe he can handle
more than most, but...

436
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,190
...sometimes, a little boy just...

437
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,050
...needs to be a little boy.

438
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,480
All right. Let's go find her.

439
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:05,205
Hey, Mom. It's just the way you
like. With peppermint and honey.

440
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,750
Thanks, buddy.

441
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,830
Mm.

442
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,020
All right,
I'll leave you two to it.

443
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,620
You're not gonna stay?

444
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,020
Yeah. Stay, Truman.

445
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,820
I thought we could watch a movie.

446
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
Thomas' choice.

447
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,115
Well, how could I say no to that?

448
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,810
Hello, Bedford Falls!

449
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,820
Merry Christmas!

450
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Merry Christmas!

451
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,185
All right, who wants
more? Anybody want more?

452
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:27,850
I'm stuffed.

453
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,850
Same goes, double for me.
- Okay.

454
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,950
All right.

455
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,250
What? What is it? What?

456
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,300
What're you guys doing?

457
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,470
We want you to open your present tonight.

458
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,970
I'll open them tomorrow morning
at Gee's house.

459
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:48,215
But... Truman won't be here tomorrow.

460
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Kid's got a point.

461
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,730
Please, Mom? Please?

462
00:33:53,805 --> 00:33:55,805
Yes, fine.

463
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,670
Go ahead.

464
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,510
Uh-oh.

465
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,940
Wow.

466
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,950
Oh. What is it?

467
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,650
Open it.

468
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,860
You guys...

469
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:54,245
Thomas and I both thought it should
be back with its rightful owner.

470
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,120
She's crying 'cause she likes it.

471
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
That part, I got.

472
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,320
I...

473
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,755
Oh, I've never had a more
perfect moment in my life.

474
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,650
Thank you.

475
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,990
You don't need to fold the paper.

476
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,150
Uh, give that one to your mom,

477
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,310
and that skinny one is for you, too.

478
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,330
Wow, this is nice.

479
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,960
The receipt's somewhere in there
if you don't like it.

480
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,330
No, I like it.

481
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:57,425
Shoulda got you a ski mask
to cover up your mug.

482
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,370
If you need any more evidence that
your chosen profession is a bust,

483
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,740
just sneak a peek at your face in the mirror.

484
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,250
Thanks. Oh, my God.
- Motherfucker!

485
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,420
Shut your mouth, Carmichael.

486
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,150
I should have lost the bet
that won me that bird.

487
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,250
Give that to Gee.

488
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,930
Hey, look, Carmichael.
We got a new...

489
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,030
...book.

490
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,300
An old book.

491
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,715
We got you new music, too, Gee-Pop. Oh.

492
00:36:29,768 --> 00:36:31,768
A-ha!

493
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,210
Thank you.

494
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,710
Go ahead, Thomas.
Open up the skinny one.

495
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,450
An umbrella?
- It's not an umbrella. It's a parasol.

496
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,150
The Mummers' parasol!
- Wow.

497
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,220
Thank you.
- Oh, yeah. Hey.

498
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,820
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You're welcome.

499
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,630
Can we play one of our albums
so we can practice our strut?

500
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

501
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,730
Let's do it.

502
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,330
Kid sure does love the Mummers.

503
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,970
How can you not?
Probably shouldn't tell him...

504
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,410
...about the Mummers holiday tradition
of cultural appropriation.

505
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,110
Cultural what now?
- It's all bullshit.

506
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:15,250
Our theme is Angels and Demons this year.

507
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,050
Been working
on those costumes for months.

508
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,920
Parade starts at 9:00 am,

509
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,890
and there's some buses leaving from
right down in front of the clubhouse.

510
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:27,930
Maybe you can loosen the leash,
and he can go with me. I mean...

511
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,230
Sure, Gee.

512
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,400
Sure, what? I'm asking you if...

513
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,010
Yeah, Thomas can go with you. Sure.

514
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,270
Just like that?

515
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,100
He can hang out with good-for-nothing,

516
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,640
no-PC, gambling Mummers? Really?

517
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,210
You must've gotten hit in the head...

518
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,580
...worse than I thought.

519
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,460
Probably stop talking
before I change my mind.

520
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,450
What the hell's going on with you?

521
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:51,250
You're acting so...

522
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,050
...different.
- Different how?

523
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:57,690
I don't know, happier or something.
Less of a pain in the ass.

524
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,230
I'm just trying to be present for Thomas.

525
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,610
Huh. Eight years old.

526
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,360
Best age, in my opinion.

527
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,970
Your mother was an angel at that age.

528
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,370
Favorite thing in the world...

529
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:14,440
...was watching her
and your Mom-Mom together.

530
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,060
They used to sing all the time.

531
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,455
Liked music, just like you.

532
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,150
Ah, everything was good back then.

533
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,350
Home. Even work.

534
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,420
The Marine Terminal
was still in Port Richmond,

535
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,590
center of shipping in Philly.

536
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,160
I could just walk to work back then.

537
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,810
That's what killed Kensington.

538
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,730
What do you mean?

539
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:39,060
When the Port Richmond Yard shut down,

540
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,770
all the good jobs...

541
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:45,035
...going down to South Philly
and then overseas...

542
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,940
Just a lot of people left behind.

543
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,510
With not enough to do.

544
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,245
That move fucked everything up.

545
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Uh...

546
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,050
Just hold on to Thomas is my
point, while things are good.

547
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,620
'Cause they don't stay.

548
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,520
They sure didn't stay that way for us.

549
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:10,200
Gee-Pop, you got any,
uh, triple-A batteries?

550
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,300
Down the cellar.

551
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,740
Oh! Jeez.

552
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,870
God, you okay?

553
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:25,610
Oh, I'm fine. Your lousy
shit ex fucked up my back.

554
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,685
Sit down.
I'll get you another beer.

555
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,320
Oh, my fucked up back,
your fucked up face...

556
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,630
I don't know what's worse.

557
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,910
Your sister came home drunk
and broke the fuckin' window!

558
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,910
Gee, how long's that window been busted?

559
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,050
A week ago or somethin'. Holidays,
so nobody is available to fix it.

560
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,980
Was it Kacey? Was she here?

561
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,190
I don't know. Didn't see her.
Could have been, I guess.

562
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,690
How come you didn't tell me that?

563
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,890
You know that I've been looking for Kacey.

564
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:18,060
Nothin' to tell. Kacey busts
into places and steals shit.

565
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,330
Not exactly breaking news.

566
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,370
What'd she take?
She take anything?

567
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,300
Nothing was missing.

568
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Did she leave anything?

569
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,300
Where'd you get those?

570
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,440
These are from our dad.

571
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
And?

572
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,635
Some of these letters
are dated after he died.

573
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,310
You had no right to keep this from us.

574
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,620
I had every fuckin' right.

575
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,410
I was protecting you both.

576
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:47,190
Your low-life father is the reason
my baby got hooked on that stuff,

577
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,650
the reason she's dead.

578
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,760
Wasn't gonna let that happen to you.

579
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,710
So, yeah,
I sent the letters back.

580
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,630
That wasn't your choice to make.

581
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,470
Hey, get off your high horse!

582
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,695
You made the same choice.

583
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,070
Hey, Paula.
Have you seen Kacey?

584
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,670
No, I haven't seen her.

585
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:11,940
What about her boyfriend?
Do you know where he lives?

586
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,210
Kacey doesn't have a boyfriend.

587
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,520
But Simon told me she did.

588
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,280
Any idea where I can find her?

589
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,380
Kace? Hey.

590
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:35,050
Kace. Come on.
Hey. Kace, it's me.

591
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Hey.

592
00:42:40,005 --> 00:42:41,710
Come on, I'm gonna get you out of here.
- Mickey.

593
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,440
Yeah, yeah. There you go.

594
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,260
Come on.

595
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,360
What?

596
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:51,870
Come on.
- I tried to tell you.

597
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,360
Tell me what?

598
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,270
Thomas?

599
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,370
Uh, yeah?

600
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,930
Get your stuff together.

601
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:10,620
You're gonna spend the rest
of the day with Mrs. Mahon.

602
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:31,140
I miss dad. How come you
never talk about him?

603
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,470
Oh, my God.

604
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
Kace.

605
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,510
I tried to tell you.

606
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,610
Tell me what?

607
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,980
Who's the father?

608
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,330
Is it Simon?

609
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,920
I'm... I'm...

610
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,140
I'm sorry, I can't.

611
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,610
I'm so sorry.

612
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,850
I'm so sorry...

613
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,620
Mickey.

614
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:46,330
Sophia, this is Mickey.

615
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,320
Hi.
- Mickey, this is Sophia.

616
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,075
This is my girlfriend's granddaughter.
- Oh.

617
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,490
Uh, uh, hey, Soph, um...

618
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:03,135
...why don't you go back inside, and then
Pop-Pop will be back in a sec, okay?

619
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,170
Mickey, you... you look...

620
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,060
God, you look like her.

621
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,790
So how long has she been with you?

622
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,690
A couple months.

623
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,860
I came looking for you both.

624
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,960
And you came to my house?
- Yeah.

625
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,610
Uh, a lady there sent me away.

626
00:47:32,705 --> 00:47:35,670
Stopped by a couple more times,
but you were never home, and...

627
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,890
I thought that maybe
there was a reason behind that.

628
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,270
Maybe you didn't wanna be found.

629
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,310
I wasn't sure what Gee had told you.

630
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,580
Gee didn't tell me anything.
I thought you were dead.

631
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,590
Oh, he was probably
just trying to protect you.

632
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,180
Years back,
he told me if I got clean...

633
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,120
...and stayed clean, that he'd...

634
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,685
...he'd let me see you,
and...

635
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,360
I tried but...

636
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,000
Time and time again,
I just couldn't make it stick.

637
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,600
What... what changed?

638
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,205
I don't know. Something happened
when Sophia was born.

639
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,710
Oh, I looked at her, and I just
kept thinking about you girls...

640
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,850
...when you were little.

641
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,480
Did the work,
I got clean.

642
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,745
Started looking for you.
I just found Kacey first.

643
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,315
She's been with you the whole time?

644
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,740
She's doing great.

645
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,560
Really good.

646
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:39,760
And it wasn't easy. She spent a
week lying on my basement floor.

647
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,180
She stuck it out.

648
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,540
And, uh, the baby?

649
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,400
Uh, guy named Dock's the father.
But she hasn't seen him.

650
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,820
She doesn't wanna see me either.

651
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,800
No, I think she does. Probably
why she left the letters.

652
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,195
Maybe she's just not ready.

653
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,840
Mickey...

654
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:16,800
I would like to have
a relationship with you...

655
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,875
...if you're open to it.
And Thomas.

656
00:49:19,973 --> 00:49:22,070
When... when the time is right.

657
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:25,825
I understand why
that's complicated for you.

658
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,900
For her...

659
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
All this time.

660
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:36,565
I was looking for her,
scared that she was dead.

661
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,460
And she was just hiding from...

662
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,725
No, it wasn't about you, Mickey.
It was about him.

663
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,680
Thomas.

664
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,350
Because I took him from her.

665
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,120
I didn't mean...

666
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,300
What I did to her,
I did for him.

667
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,110
I know.

668
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,560
Uh, for what it's worth.

669
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:22,030
I... I think part of the reason she
worked so hard to get clean this time...

670
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,600
...was to prove to you that she could do it.

671
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,440
As much as she needed
to prove it to herself.

672
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,980
She'll find her way back, I...

673
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,080
I believe that.

674
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,780
Pop-Pop, cocoa's ready.

675
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,880
Okay, I'll be right in.

676
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:43,520
I should... I should get going.

677
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:48,040
I'd invite you to join, but it...
- No, I... I can't.

678
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,310
I'm glad you came.

679
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:58,190
Merry Christmas, Mickey.

680
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,750
Merry Christmas.

681
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,240
Hi.

682
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,670
Hey, Mick. I'm sorry
to call you on Christmas.

683
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,870
But I think you should come into my office.

684
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,970
Why? What is it?

685
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,380
Is it another victim?

686
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,000
I think it's just better if you come in here.

687
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,100
Aura, who is it?

688
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,210
I'm so sorry, Mick.

689
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,395
I know how close you were with Paula.

690
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,690
Was she...

691
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,790
Looking like an OD.

692
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,750
It wasn't an OD.
