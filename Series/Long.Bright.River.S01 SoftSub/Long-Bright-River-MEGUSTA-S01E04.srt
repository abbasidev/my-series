1
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,560
Three females have been found dead.

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,430
All three were determined to have lethal
amounts of insulin in their system.

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,860
What's going on?

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,130
Danjarat found a video of the
perp in those girls' murders.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,130
Well, this,
coupled with the witness account...

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,130
...from the second victim's crime scene,

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,240
tells us we may have our perp.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,940
Yeah, I know that girl. She's
been here a couple of times.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,410
She was in here
with this guy, Jimmy Scanlon.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,680
Let's talk to this Jimmy Scanlon's family.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,250
Do you recognize this woman?

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,810
No. Why?

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,520
They both went missing around the
same time that your husband did.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,390
What are you thinking about?
- My birthday party.

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,150
Oh.
- I want to have a real one this year.

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,490
Okay.
- I wanna invite Dad.

17
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,990
Three-alarm fire at 222 Braddock Street.

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,830
Paula!

19
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,140
I got a video of the perp.

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, my God, Mickey.
Are you serious?

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,600
You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,840
You know him, too.

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,940
'Cause he's a cop.

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,220
That's all Paula said?

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
It was a cop?

26
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,310
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,310
Mickey.
- She also said that the cop...

28
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,320
...was using his badge
to extort women for sex.

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,690
And you believe her?

30
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:54,060
I've known Paula my whole life.
She has no reason to lie to me.

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,330
What about Dock?

32
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,615
Dock has an alibi. He was locked
up during two of the murders.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
And that's the only reason
you asked me here?

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,980
Just to tell me what Paula said?

35
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,630
No.

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,660
I just don't know where to start.

37
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,605
How about we start with why
you went to Dock's without me?

38
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,680
I should have been there with you, Mickey.

39
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,140
I was afraid of what Kacey
might have told Dock about me...

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,045
...that I hadn't told you myself.

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,300
Like what?

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,440
Come on, girls. Let's go.

43
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,275
Thanks for joining the Police Youth Club.

44
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,030
Stay out of trouble.

45
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,050
Wait.

46
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,820
What? I gotta get to work.
- I want to go back to settlement.

47
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,920
And I want to go on a tropical
vacation with Ann-Margret.

48
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,400
But that ain't gonna happen.

49
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,320
Your sister didn't get in.

50
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,830
But I just made section leader
for Woodwinds.

51
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,810
I'm way too old for this...
- Stop. Where she goes, you go. That's it.

52
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,670
So go play tag or something.

53
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,770
Be a kid.

54
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,210
Look at this like a life lesson, okay?

55
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,285
You don't always get what you want.

56
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,410
Come on. It beats sitting at home, right?

57
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,370
Where are we supposed to go?
Do we check in or something?

58
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Paula!

59
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,670
I thought you said
you weren't coming to PYC.

60
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,740
My mom had to work.

61
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,640
Come on.
We're going outside.

62
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,510
Come on, Mickey.
- Come on.

63
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,650
It's okay.

64
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,100
You go ahead.

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Come on, Kace.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What are you reading?

67
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,970
Steinbeck?

68
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,140
I love that book.

69
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,140
I'm Officer Cleare.

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,530
I have a sneaking suspicion...

71
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,540
...that nobody else here
is reading Steinbeck.

72
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,290
What does that have to do with Dock?

73
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,540
Nothing.

74
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,480
It had to do with her.

75
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,240
And how I let someone come between us.

76
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,975
But that's not the whole story.

77
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,095
Some more coffee, please?

78
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,690
Everybody plays Minecraft.

79
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,790
I don't.

80
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,430
Where did you see this game?

81
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,130
Lila had it.

82
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,230
Lila has a phone?

83
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,330
Lots of kids do.

84
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,930
Great.
- It's really educational.

85
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,340
It teaches you geometry, and
how to build a good foundation.

86
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,570
Where did you hear that?

87
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,260
That's what you said when I started Legos.

88
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,110
Okay. Now...

89
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,110
What do I do?
- I'll download it.

90
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,780
Thanks, Mom.

91
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,930
Okay.

92
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Oh.

93
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,770
Thomas.

94
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,800
Hey, you can just show me
after dinner. Yeah?

95
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,900
Here you go.

96
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Okay.

97
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,800
What would you call this tempo?

98
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,240
Um... Allegretto.

99
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,145
Could you play this on your horn?

100
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,060
Uh...

101
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,970
I don't think it would sound good on a horn.

102
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,420
Are you excited about your birthday?

103
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,320
Maybe we could play Minecraft.

104
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,660
Or maybe you could play something where
you actually connect with each other.

105
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,390
Okay? Without screens.

106
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,630
Mom, you can play Minecraft together.

107
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,500
I'm gonna show you, okay?

108
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,460
Okay. Okay.

109
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,070
I can't wait.
- You're gonna love it.

110
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,170
Am I?

111
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:38,300
And can I have snakes?

112
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,140
What?
- Oh, for the goodie bags.

113
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,560
Oh, yeah, I'll try.

114
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,130
What's wrong?

115
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,180
I... I...

116
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,850
I know you wanted
your dad to be at the party,

117
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,290
but I've left several messages
and he's not responded.

118
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,685
And we did talk about this.

119
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,930
This has nothing to do with you.

120
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,950
But Gee's gonna come.
And that'll be fun.

121
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,490
Well, you go ahead.

122
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,050
You know, technically,
that's illegal, right?

123
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,020
Arrest me.

124
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,970
Thought you guys weren't into,
you know, intoxication.

125
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,560
Drugs are haram.

126
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,330
Keeping people alive so they can recover...

127
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,460
...that's different.

128
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,110
To me, at least.

129
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,130
How are you feeling?

130
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,530
Good days.

131
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,100
Bad days.

132
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Are you still gambling?

133
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,490
No.

134
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,880
That's good.

135
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,780
By the way, I may have
spoke too soon about Dock.

136
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,520
It seems like that guy is making
enemies everywhere he goes.

137
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,780
Yeah? How do you mean?

138
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,820
You know his abando
got burned down yesterday.

139
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,320
Word on the street,
it was his old supplier.

140
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,090
Old supplier,
means there's a new one.

141
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,190
Always is.

142
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,200
Have you heard anything
in the neighborhood lately...

143
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,400
...about a cop using his badge
to extort women?

144
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Of course there is.

145
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,640
You know about this?
- Mm-mm.

146
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,310
I know about the police.
That's what I know about.

147
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,960
You know you can't trust them.

148
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,030
You're different.

149
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,580
You know who this cop might be?

150
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,845
You're better off asking
which cop it couldn't be.

151
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,900
When I lost my sons, you know
two cops walked right on by...

152
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,930
...while I was out there yelling for help,

153
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,025
when that good-for-nothing
ambulance never came.

154
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,010
You were the only cop who stopped,

155
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,340
only cop I knew back then
to carry Narcan on him,

156
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,060
only cop who gave a shit.

157
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,490
You don't know
how many cops I see each day...

158
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,820
...walk straight past human suffering.

159
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,630
Therefore, it don't surprise me...

160
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,970
...that some among you cause it.

161
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,680
Garcia.

162
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,780
Brooks.

163
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,940
It'd be one thing if they just forgot about us,

164
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,710
if they could only just turn a blind eye,

165
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,910
because what they're doing out there...

166
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,550
...fanning the flames, making bad
things worse in this community.

167
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,050
We don't need protection from each other.

168
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,125
We need protection from the police.

169
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,420
Excuse me, is this footage
taken from outside your store?

170
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,650
Looks that way.

171
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,980
I was assigned to check back in
with you guys.

172
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,120
See if you or any of your
coworkers have spotted this guy.

173
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,390
We think he may have something
to do with the Kensington murders.

174
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,490
Nah. I don't know him.

175
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,150
Maybe I can check your camera.
- Someone broke it last week.

176
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,250
Did you file a report?

177
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,740
Do you want to?

178
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,610
Sure, sounds great.
Why don't you file a report?

179
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,390
Actually, better yet, I could
just show you why we didn't.

180
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,490
Okay.

181
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,550
So there's a cop across the
street just watching us.

182
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,820
How lucky we are to have him, right?

183
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,460
Then this dude rolls up,
busts the camera.

184
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,730
And what do the cops do? Nothing.

185
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,720
Sitting there,
smoking a cigarette.

186
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:40,025
The only thing folks can count on
anymore is that you can't count on them.

187
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,700
So he just sat there?

188
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,930
He didn't even get out of
his car. It was embarrassing.

189
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,000
I was embarrassed to be a cop.

190
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,870
Did you recognize him?
- No.

191
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,870
It's like these women,
Taylor Yoon, Elizabeth O'Connor,

192
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,140
that Jane Doe they found by the tracks...

193
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,725
...looks like they've all been forgotten.

194
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,670
Mr. Winton's right.

195
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,420
Something's changed in the neighborhood.

196
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,560
I'm talking about trust,

197
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,990
and respect,

198
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,575
and how there used to be some, both ways.

199
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,510
Now there's none.

200
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,870
When I was growing up,

201
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,000
a lot of the cops came
from the neighborhood,

202
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,170
and now I feel like I'm the only one left.

203
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,180
I was thinking if I was living on the streets,

204
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,150
and something bad happened to me...

205
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,620
...right now, today...
- Who would you call?

206
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Who does Kacey call?

207
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,715
I'm the only cop that she has left.

208
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,710
Not the only one.

209
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,930
Calling all units.

210
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,195
Possible domestic assault
in progress.31 G Street.

211
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,270
56201 responding.
Okay, I gotta go.

212
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,370
All right.

213
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
56201 on site.

214
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,510
Roger that.26284.

215
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,640
Oh, hey. Hi.

216
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,240
Are you okay?

217
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,560
Are your parents home?

218
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,490
They're back there?

219
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,630
Okay. Are you hurt?

220
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,870
My sister.

221
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,750
I'm gonna go check on your sister.

222
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,290
Can you sit right there?

223
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:50,235
And don't go anywhere, okay?
Can you do that for me? Okay.

224
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,340
Do you think you can
talk to me like that, huh?

225
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Look what you did.

226
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,760
No! No!

227
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:13,955
Sir, you need to calm down. You
need to step back. Step back.

228
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
We're okay.

229
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
You guys okay?

230
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Keep going.

231
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,990
Thank you.

232
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,290
What the fuck is that?

233
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,730
I'm gonna give you an IV
to help with the pain.

234
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,465
I can't have none of that shit.

235
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,240
Oh, no, she's not taking my girls.

236
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,050
When there's a domestic assault,
there's usually a brief period...

237
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,090
...of separation and evaluation, okay?

238
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,490
Mrs. Kelly.
- You're not taking my girls.

239
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,090
I'm Clara, with social services,
there's nothing to worry about.

240
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,730
But it is standard procedure.

241
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,730
I don't give no fucks about
your procedures. Colleen.

242
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,930
Colleen, it's going to be easier
for them if this goes smooth, okay?

243
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,005
I saw how you protected your girls.

244
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,170
Okay.

245
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,140
Okay, girls. All right. Um...

246
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,340
You go with the nice lady, all right?

247
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,840
All right? You be brave.
Mommy loves you.

248
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,700
No.
- Hey.

249
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Come on, sweetie.

250
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,990
So we have to go, okay?

251
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,450
You've got to listen.

252
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,730
Hey. Hey.

253
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,610
You don't remember me, do you?

254
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,970
But I remember you.

255
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,340
Hey.

256
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,605
Sean Kelly going down to
holding. Yes, that's him.

257
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,170
Thanks.
- Yeah.

258
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Come on.

259
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,440
Hi.
- Hey, it's me.

260
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,725
I just got a call from my buddy
at Delaware PD. You got a sec?

261
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,410
Mick, you okay?

262
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,330
Yeah.

263
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,330
I just had a weird encounter with a perp.

264
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,430
You all right?
- Um...

265
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,060
So, DPD, what'd they say?

266
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,860
And did they find Jimmy Scanlon?

267
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,730
No, not yet.

268
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,160
But he did have a bank account that
his wife didn't know anything about.

269
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,960
Was getting some pretty hefty payments...

270
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,000
...from a company called S.O.K. Holding.

271
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,770
What kind of company is that?

272
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,670
I don't know, but pretty suspicious
for a sheet metal worker, right?

273
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,910
Particularly since he was
hiding it from his wife.

274
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,240
Maybe that's what he was arguing
about with Taylor Yoon at 7 Brothers.

275
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,380
Yeah, or maybe he was
hiding something else.

276
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,220
DPD got ahold of Scanlon's text messages.

277
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,590
The last one he sent
was to a woman named Melissa.

278
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,490
They were supposed to meet
after work at the 'usual spot,'

279
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,960
but his wife didn't know
anything about her.

280
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,290
Maybe she was his girlfriend.

281
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,060
Maybe they disappeared together.

282
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,260
Maybe she killed him.

283
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,720
Or maybe Melissa is also a sex worker.

284
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,730
Maybe she knows
what happened to those women...

285
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,810
...and Kacey.

286
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,523
See if Scanlon was ever busted for...

287
00:21:02,623 --> 00:21:04,640
...solicitation. Maybe
that'll lead us somewhere.

288
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,150
And I'll see if I can find
out anything on S.O.K. Holding...

289
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,920
...and Scanlon's bank account.
- God.

290
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,150
Mick?
- Yeah.

291
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,270
Watch your back around the office, okay?

292
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,370
We're gonna find her.

293
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,870
All right. I gotta go.

294
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,845
Are you looking to get out of Philly?

295
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,310
Maybe I'll join you.

296
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,190
Delaware taxes, right?

297
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,450
Hm.
How's the job coming along?

298
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
Truly?

299
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,725
I don't know.
Ahearn's on my ass all day long.

300
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,280
It's like I can't do anything right.

301
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,780
I mean, I didn't expect special
treatment because we go back,

302
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,150
but I didn't expect him
to put a shit pile on me...

303
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,735
...at every opportunity,
either, you know?

304
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,270
I'm starting to...

305
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,370
...to I doubt myself.

306
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,360
Everybody makes mistakes.

307
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,520
You just keep at it,
follow protocol.

308
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,540
Two pair, jacks and queens.
- Ah!

309
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,850
I'm telling ya, he cheats.

310
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:46,310
Nobody's cheating. You're
just a man who happens to be...

311
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,110
...exceptional at losing.

312
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,910
It's that fricking bird.

313
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,250
He's got it trained to signal him
if you're holding a losing hand.

314
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,150
If I could train Carmichael to do that.

315
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,890
I wouldn't be sitting here
with you two chuckleheads.

316
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,040
I'd be in Atlantic City
making some real dough.

317
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,150
Come in. It's open.

318
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Hey.
- Hey, Mickey.

319
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,670
What are you doing here?

320
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,255
Hey, you know your grandpa cheats, right?

321
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:19,310
Can I talk to you...
- Yeah.

322
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,350
...for a second?

323
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,010
Carmichael, play my hand.

324
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,720
See?
That bird knows things.

325
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,270
Didn't think I'd see you
so soon after the other night.

326
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,790
You need to yell at someone or something?

327
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,590
I'm throwing a birthday party for Thomas,

328
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,500
and I would like you to come.

329
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,400
Hm. Simon's not taking him to the Sixers?

330
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,050
He won't answer my calls.
So, no.

331
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,700
Good.

332
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,490
Kid doesn't need that deadbeat in his life.
- So will you come?

333
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,680
It's important.
Thomas needs his family around.

334
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,210
Yeah, of course.
I'll come to the kid's party.

335
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,650
Thank you.

336
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,780
No, don't need to thank me.
That's what family does, right?

337
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,570
Like I told you before, the
two of us is all Thomas needs.

338
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,730
You still ain't found your sister.

339
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,680
No.
- Leave it be.

340
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,090
You're better off.

341
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,590
Mickey, they're really good.

342
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,290
You okay?

343
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,940
Kacey was supposed to be here.

344
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,380
The concert was optional.

345
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,115
She's probably back at the PYC.

346
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,560
I want to hear the whole orchestra one day.

347
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,690
I'm sure you will.

348
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,260
Oh, I love Dvorak.
That horn solo...

349
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,400
...it just sounded so...

350
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,180
...content.

351
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Just calm,

352
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
satisfied,

353
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,410
unperturbed.

354
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,540
'Unperturbed,' huh?

355
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,980
Yeah.
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

356
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,410
I loved it.

357
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,380
When I was still at settlement, I thought
I'd study at the Curtis Institute one day.

358
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,390
You still could.
You should audition.

359
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,320
No. You don't get into a school
like that unless you have parents...

360
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,260
...who put you in lessons
when you're three years old.

361
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,430
Being the best in your high
school orchestra doesn't exactly...

362
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,030
...qualify you.

363
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,130
Hey, here's the thing.

364
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,240
You are different.

365
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,810
I mean, it's hard to explain,
but you just got something...

366
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,480
...potential,
whatever you want to call it.

367
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,460
I noticed that the first day I met you.

368
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
They might notice, too.

369
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,170
I'll see you Monday.

370
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,350
Hey.
- Hi.

371
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,640
Where the hell were you?

372
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,850
I was at the concert.
- What concert?

373
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,020
I told you it was a Youth Club trip.

374
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,380
Remember, you said...
- Whatever. Whatever. I don't give two shits.

375
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,360
While you were out with your little
friend, your sister came home drunk,

376
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,925
and broke the fucking window.

377
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,380
She's 12, for Chrissake.

378
00:27:28,435 --> 00:27:30,200
I... Okay.

379
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,400
Hey.
- Oh.

380
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,200
If you'd get your head out of
your ass and do a better job...

381
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,500
...looking out for your sister,

382
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,770
this kind of crap wouldn't happen.

383
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,335
Okay. I'm sorry.
You're right.

384
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,650
Come here.

385
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,680
Get off me!
- Let me help you.

386
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,780
I don't need your help.

387
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,950
Why do you do this?

388
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,590
Why can't you make
smarter decisions, Kacey?

389
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,560
Every time you get
in trouble, Gee blames me.

390
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,600
I guess only you can be right all the time.

391
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,100
I didn't say that.
- But you meant it.

392
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,430
Because you always do the right thing.

393
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,900
Just let me help you. I...

394
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,220
Kace...

395
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Kace.

396
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,060
We're all we've got, okay?

397
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,995
We have to be there for each other.

398
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,890
But you're not, Mickey.

399
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,830
You're out there.

400
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,195
Not if you can be with him.

401
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,170
When I was a kid,
they didn't have gift bags.

402
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,710
You went to a party,
you brought a gift.

403
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,310
What about when your girls were little?

404
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,420
Oh, Sheila used to spend
so many hours on those.

405
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,490
She'd hand-wrap the cookies,

406
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,225
curl ribbon around the handles.

407
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,410
But she was way over the top with it.

408
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,190
These are gonna be great.

409
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,560
Did you find anything out about the
holding company that was paying Scanlon?

410
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,070
Hm. You know what's weird?

411
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,300
I checked the Department of State website.

412
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,870
S.O.K. is a registered business in Delaware,

413
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,840
but there's no other information as to
what they do or who the principles are.

414
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,980
The address is a P.O. Box
and there's no phone number.

415
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,905
So we don't know why
Scanlon was getting paid.

416
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,020
You remember my friend Aura,
the medical examiner?

417
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,220
She has a husband who works for the DA.

418
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,460
He's mainly been working on
corporate litigation cases, so...

419
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,630
...maybe he can figure out what Scanlon
had to do with those dead women.

420
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,360
You gotta be careful, Mick. You're
not supposed to be looking into this.

421
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,270
You know, the DA's favorite job is
catching cops not toeing the line.

422
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,370
Mm-hm.

423
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,560
Are you sure you can trust this guy?
- I can.

424
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,310
I trust Aura, anyway.

425
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:35,425
And she's got good taste in
men, better than I do, at least.

426
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,620
You know, you gotta make sure that
all these bags have the same toy,

427
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,055
or else you're gonna have
a rebellion on your hands.

428
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Jolly Rancher.

429
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,120
Is that bad?
- Nope. Very popular.

430
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,070
What if Melissa's not even her real name?

431
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:07,270
What if that's what one of the
victims went by on the street?

432
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,950
Maybe we should check in
with her next of kin.

433
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,590
Elizabeth O'Connor lived
in an encampment...

434
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,090
...on Emerald with her boyfriend
that was cleared out last week.

435
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,190
So we're not gonna be able to find him.

436
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,690
But...

437
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,510
Taylor Yoon's parents may know why
Taylor was hanging out with Scanlon.

438
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,200
I can check in with them.

439
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,300
And it's a plan.

440
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,250
What?

441
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,790
What?

442
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,015
Were you gonna invite me?

443
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,850
Oh, my God, Truman, I am so
sorry. I... With everything...

444
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,925
Relax. I'm just busting your chops.

445
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Will you come?

446
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,350
I thought you'd never ask.

447
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,370
You're hitting Joe's sweet spot.

448
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,770
He just finished a case in front
of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court...

449
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,740
...arguing abuse of corporate power.

450
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,140
Do you think it matters that S.O.K.
Holding's registered in Delaware?

451
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,810
Joe's favorite thing about Joe
is that he has connections.

452
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,150
I'll ask him tonight.

453
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,430
Thank you.
- Wait one sec before you go.

454
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,590
For Thomas.

455
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,820
Oh, you can give this to him
at his birthday party.

456
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,520
Mickey, much as I love Thomas,

457
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,590
one of the biggest perks
about my child-free lifestyle...

458
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,930
...is not having to go to
birthday parties at Land-O-Fun.

459
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,760
Okay. Yeah, I figured. Yeah.

460
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,900
I can't believe he's already eight.

461
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,420
He's growing up so fast.

462
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,990
Is Simon going?

463
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,060
No.

464
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,780
That a good thing?
- Maybe.

465
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,110
But I did invite Truman.

466
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,210
Hm.

467
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,205
Stop. We are just friends.
- Okay.

468
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,690
He was my partner.

469
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,590
Okay.
- You're impossible.

470
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,720
I'm just saying, let yourself
have some fun. All right?

471
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,090
Oh, my God.

472
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,230
Now, unless you want to stay
for the festivities...

473
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,900
I'm sure he's a lovely guy,
but duty calls.

474
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,880
There you go.

475
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,420
But I want a burger and fries.

476
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,050
We've talked about this.
It's veggies today, okay?

477
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,340
But he's having a burger.

478
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,330
That kid's gonna turn into a criminal
if they keep feeding her salad.

479
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,460
I should have had an option for them.

480
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,065
Why, it's the Land-O-Fun.
Everybody knows what to get.

481
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,020
They look all right.

482
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,685
You should go talk to them.

483
00:34:22,763 --> 00:34:28,118
Go ahead, I'll make sure none of
the kids drown in the ball pit.

484
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,720
Thank you for coming.

485
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,120
Carlotta could not stop
talking about this party.

486
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,360
She loves Thomas.
- Thomas feels the same way.

487
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,890
So any other family or just the two of you?

488
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,780
Uh, that's his great-grandfather.

489
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
Oh, that's so nice.

490
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,410
We're gonna be so sad to see Thomas go.
- I'm sorry?

491
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,940
Oh, I guess... Thomas just
mentioned something to Lila.

492
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,780
You know...

493
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,850
Last year, there was another family
who had a situation like yours.

494
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,380
It's because of my job.

495
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,390
I... I work odd hours, so I
need Thomas to be closer to work.

496
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,840
That's why he has
to go to a different school.

497
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,940
Would you excuse me?

498
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,330
Your education is the most important thing.

499
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,170
That's not what Gee thinks.

500
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,600
It's not Gee's decision.

501
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,470
Both my parents are dead.
- So it is his decision.

502
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,470
He won't sign my FAFSA forms. So...

503
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,240
I'll help you fill out the applications.

504
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,180
I...
- What is it, Mickey?

505
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,615
We've talked about this.
- I can't just abandon her.

506
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,320
Look, she's getting into trouble all the time.

507
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,320
She's got friends who aren't good for her.

508
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,500
What's it gonna be like
if I'm not around at all?

509
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,400
I know you love your sister.

510
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,410
But you need to worry
about yourself sometimes.

511
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,970
I'm all she's got.

512
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,610
Mickey, look at me.

513
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,740
I know you.

514
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,410
I know your sister, too.

515
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:09,200
You've always been the responsible
one, but now it's your turn.

516
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,360
You have to think about your future.

517
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,970
You can't just think about
Kacey. You got to think about you.

518
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,070
What do you want?

519
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,790
Daddy!

520
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,260
Hey, buddy.

521
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,730
Simon.

522
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,410
What are you doing here?

523
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,760
I thought you said you weren't coming.

524
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,060
I... I just wanted to drop off the
present and tell you in person that...

525
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,900
Daddy, come to the slide with me.

526
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,900
No, no, I'm just saying Happy birthday.
I just wanted to give you this.

527
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,300
Do you want a burger or something?
- Yeah. I can't stay.

528
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,740
I'm just dropping this off.

529
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,910
Daddy, come to the slide with me.
- Thomas, I can't.

530
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:10,626
Thomas. Thomas. I can't.

531
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:11,980
Come to the slide... Come
to the slide with me.

532
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,830
I can't. I have to go.

533
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,930
I gotta go, okay?

534
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,980
Please, Daddy, no.

535
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,950
Thomas, please. Get...
Thomas!

536
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,090
No, please.
- Thomas, please.

537
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,620
Mickey, a little help, please?

538
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,460
Simon, what did you think
was going to happen? Daddy, no.

539
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,830
No, no, no, no. Stop.
- Thomas, bubba. Hey. Come here.

540
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,960
You fucking deadbeat jitbag.
- Come on.

541
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,560
You got some balls showing up here.

542
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,800
I knew this was a mistake.
- Damn right it was.

543
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,300
What I get for trying to do the
right thing, end this the right way.

544
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,300
Here you go, buddy.
- Daddy!

545
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,317
You're the worst fucking thing
that ever happened to that kid.

546
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:39,570
Daddy! Daddy!

547
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,640
Thomas, you've gotta
let him go. He's gotta go, okay?

548
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,470
I got Thomas, go get Gee.
- Come here, asshole!

549
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,950
Don't you walk away from me!

550
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,780
Daddy!
- Sweetheart.

551
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,453
Listen, listen. Hey.

552
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:52,830
I got Thomas. You go get Gee. Go get Gee.

553
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,075
Thomas, Thomas.
- Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

554
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,520
I don't wanna fucking...

555
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,390
You want to fucking fall with me?

556
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,490
Get off of him!

557
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,330
Get... get off!

558
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,500
Just go!
- Hey.

559
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,530
'Nice' just doesn't fucking work
with you or your family.

560
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,540
I dropped off the goddamn gift,
and now I'm done.

561
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,110
Don't ever fucking call me again.

562
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,490
Babe, let's fucking go.

563
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,170
Those fucking psychos.

564
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,210
Hey, Thomas,
will you do me a favor...

565
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,810
...and split the chocolate shake with me?

566
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,630
I don't think I can finish a whole one.

567
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,730
Go ahead.

568
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,440
The kid okay?

569
00:39:10,535 --> 00:39:12,535
Yeah, he'll be fine.

570
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
What about you?

571
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,000
Let me tell you...

572
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,170
Twenty years ago, I'd have kicked his
sorry ass up and down the fucking street.

573
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,760
Oh, I know. I know.

574
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,500
What kind of place
won't even sell you a beer?

575
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,610
I gotta go.
- Wait.

576
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,105
Don't forget your goodie bag.

577
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,410
Happy birthday, kid.

578
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:56,410
May the road rise up to meet you,

579
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,310
may the wind be always at your back.

580
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,650
May the sun shine warm upon your face,

581
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,180
and to those who don't wish you well,

582
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,570
may they kiss your ass
in Wanamaker's front window.

583
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,760
It's a nice jersey.

584
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,570
He's not even on the team
anymore, Mom, he was traded.

585
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,730
It's the thought that counts, right?

586
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,540
I'm sorry for what happened at your party.

587
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,640
It wasn't your fault.

588
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,860
Why does Gee hate my dad?

589
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,695
Well, he hated my dad, too.

590
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,390
He just loves us,
and wants to protect us.

591
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,490
He was going to fight.

592
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,970
Some people express their love in...

593
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,650
...unusual ways.

594
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,570
That's Gee's way.

595
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,560
And it's not going to be your way.

596
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,110
Happy birthday.

597
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,210
Thanks, Mom.

598
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,570
Good night.
- Good night.

599
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,150
Hello?

600
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Yes, this is she.

601
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,105
Thank you for calling me back, Mrs. Yoon.

602
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,300
Is... is now a good time?

603
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,150
Hey.
- I thought you were on days.

604
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,290
I'm covering for somebody. I'm
gonna be back as soon as I can.

605
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,390
Okay.

606
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,130
Hey, I'm en route to the Yoons
right now. Can you meet me?

607
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,770
I can't. I'm having
dinner with my daughters.

608
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,520
Okay, I'll call you in the morning.

609
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,040
Mick.
- Yeah.

610
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,010
It's okay to let the world
turn without you for a night.

611
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,390
You and Thomas have had
a pretty dramatic day.

612
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,040
It's okay to be home with him.

613
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,800
Yeah, I can't.

614
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,875
Not with her still being out there.

615
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,250
Have fun with your girls.

616
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,170
Thanks, Mick.

617
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,270
Good night.

618
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,890
I'm not sure how helpful I can be.

619
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,630
Taylor...

620
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,390
...stopped talking to us before she...

621
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:31,040
She thought I was judging her.

622
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,755
But I just wanted her to come home.

623
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:46,940
The last time you saw Taylor, did you
notice anything out of the ordinary?

624
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,430
Did she mention anyone new
she'd been socializing with?

625
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,530
Or associating with?

626
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,700
I don't...

627
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,620
I wish I did.

628
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,940
She was there,
and then she wasn't.

629
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:06,810
She just slipped away,
and we didn't know what to do.

630
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,920
Does the name Jimmy Scanlon
mean anything to you?

631
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,920
No.

632
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,570
Melissa?

633
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,740
Did she ever mention anyone named
Melissa, or did she go by that name?

634
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,600
No. Why would she do that?

635
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,740
I'm just being thorough.

636
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,230
If I'd only tried harder,
then she...

637
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,740
I was her mother.

638
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,010
I was supposed to protect her.

639
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,645
She was such a good baby.

640
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,260
Always smiling.

641
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:08,740
I look at these and try to find
the place where it all changed.

642
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,380
May I see this?

643
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,250
Mm-hm.

644
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,570
Could I take it out of
the frame? Do you mind?

645
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,670
Yeah.

646
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,660
Hm.

647
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,600
Taylor went to the Police Youth Club.

648
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,700
Yeah. Why?

649
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,750
It beats sitting at home, right?

650
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:16,825
You go ahead.
I'm gonna stay inside.

651
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,730
Look at this like a life lesson, okay?

652
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:29,805
You don't always get what you want.

653
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,515
Come on, Mick.
Come with us.

654
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:03,000
You guys should not be out here, and
you definitely should not be smoking.

655
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,270
'And you definitely shouldn't be smoking.'

656
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,970
Paula, I just don't want
you guys to get in trouble.

657
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,810
Stop playing fucking cop,
Mickey.

658
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,290
I'm not. I'm working, Kacey.

659
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:15,700
It won't kill you
to have some fun for a change.

660
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,900
Come with us.
- I can't right now.

661
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,350
You can't ever.

662
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,790
That is not true.

663
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,890
Please, come inside.

664
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,560
Come on, Kace. Let's go.

665
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:29,840
Look, I'm telling you,
you're going to get in trouble.

666
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,410
Who's gonna bust us? You?

667
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,260
Come on.

668
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,580
Her fucking boy toy.

669
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,010
It's okay. You got me.

670
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:50,405
Where are we off to?
- Uh...

671
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,350
Truman, hey,
I need you to meet me.

672
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,740
Mick, you okay?

673
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,050
That's Taylor Yoon.

674
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,920
Taylor went to PYC?

675
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,780
And so did Elizabeth O'Connor.

676
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,440
Simon was their counselor.

677
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,200
They both went to Youth Club. They
both had Simon as their counselor,

678
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,550
and Paula said that the guy
in the video was a cop.

679
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:54,865
Do you think Simon could be the killer?
