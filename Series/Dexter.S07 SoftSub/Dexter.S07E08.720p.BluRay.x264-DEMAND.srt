1
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:11,012
Previously on Dexter:

2
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:15,809
She accepts both sides of me.
The whole Dexter.

3
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:19,229
How in the hell does the most crucial
piece of evidence...

4
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:21,773
...against Isaak Sirko just disappear?

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,610
I did what you wanted. Evidence against
Sirko is gone. I want Nadia's passport.

6
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:28,988
She's done with you and your whole
shitty fucking organisation.

7
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:30,532
That's not gonna happen, Joey.

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,909
So you think real hard
about your next move.

9
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:35,203
I'm at a dead end
on Bay Harbour Butcher.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,330
Everything we've done,
all the evidence...

11
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:41,042
...it still points to Sergeant Doakes.
At some point, we have to face facts.

12
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:47,048
Harrison is only going to Orlando
for a few weeks, Dexter.

13
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:48,967
He's gonna be fine.

14
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:51,428
All he'll want to do
is follow Cody around.

15
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:54,097
Every time the shit hits the fan,
I go to him.

16
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:55,515
He's your safe place.

17
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:59,477
You're making it sound like
I wanna be with him or something.

18
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:01,020
Well, do you?

19
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,231
You didn't kill Viktor
out of vengeance.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,235
I have a feeling that
you're a different kind of animal.

21
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:09,863
I can't even drink with someone
without them dying.

22
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,115
Sorry, I wish
I could tell you what happened.

23
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:14,951
I know what happened.
Hannah McKay.

24
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,706
Sal Price was writing a book on you.
You didn't like it, so you poisoned him.

25
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:22,125
- That's crazy.
- Report's back...

26
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,918
...on the tox screen on Sal Price.

27
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,921
ME ran it twice.
Negative both times.

28
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,133
That fucking bitch is gonna
get away with it again.

29
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:34,095
Hannah McKay killed Sal Price
and she's gonna walk.

30
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,974
I want you to make it right.

31
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,643
Do what you do.

32
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:40,513
Was Deb's call just a bad dream?

33
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,477
Or does she really want me
to kill Hannah?

34
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,563
Morning.

35
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,900
- How did you sleep?
- Okay.

36
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:56,946
Special herbs from my garden.
It's my secret ingredient.

37
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:03,745
How can I help?

38
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,623
You can dice.

39
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:18,509
It's more my style.

40
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:40,406
I sometimes lose track of time,
but your calendar goes beyond that.

41
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:45,328
Oh, it's not so much a calendar
but a reminder.

42
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,122
That's the year you took off
with Wayne.

43
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:49,791
It's not about Wayne.

44
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,211
It's Argentina.

45
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,755
What was so special
about Argentina?

46
00:04:55,964 --> 00:05:00,885
Nothing, really, I just--
I like the picture. It looks like...

47
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:03,721
Nice, happy-

48
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,348
A home.

49
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:17,902
My sister,
who's also my lieutenant...

50
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:20,238
...so I should probably
get to work soon.

51
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,701
Your sister is the lieutenant?

52
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,995
Yeah, I didn't mention that.

53
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,580
No, you didn't.

54
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:36,754
Is this crazy?

55
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:38,840
"This"?

56
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:45,346
You and me, just sitting here,
eating breakfast.

57
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:48,599
I always eat breakfast.
It's important.

58
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:57,859
I know that we decided
to never see each other again...

59
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,777
...so I just want you to know that...

60
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:04,907
...if last night was a one-night thing
for you, then I'm okay with that.

61
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:06,784
Okay.

62
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:11,664
But if you want to never see each other
again tomorrow night...

63
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:13,916
...then I'm okay with that too.

64
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,585
Okay.

65
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,130
You're very agreeable.

66
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:21,674
Yep.

67
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:29,015
I need to find some way
to get her out of Debra's head...

68
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,809
...even if I can't get her out of mine.

69
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,196
Hey, come on in.

70
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,655
Do you want coffee?

71
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:47,241
There's plenty.
I couldn't fucking sleep.

72
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,701
Sure.

73
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,090
- Deb?
- Yeah?

74
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:06,427
What you said last night,
you didn't mean it.

75
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:07,720
Did you?

76
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:11,766
Yeah, Dex, I meant it.

77
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,854
The good news is
I've already vetted her for you.

78
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:21,150
She killed three people that we know of,
not including what she did with Wayne.

79
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:25,404
And Price had a tissue sample
and a lab report on Beverly Grey...

80
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,657
...that proved she was poisoned
with aconite.

81
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:31,452
But go figure, some asshole
broke into his apartment...

82
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,621
...and disappeared
all the files on Hannah.

83
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,666
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

84
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,960
You don't know she killed Price.

85
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,045
You don't even know
Price was murdered.

86
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:44,006
You want to know
what he was doing the day he died?

87
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,968
He was recording this.

88
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:53,182
Then she just kept screaming
and there was so much blood.

89
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,684
What did you do?

90
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,608
I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.

91
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,446
- Deb, she was 15.
- You want more?

92
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:11,159
Let's talk about how she didn't allow
her husband's body to be embalmed.

93
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,621
She fits your code, Dex.

94
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,542
I'm not killing Hannah McKay.

95
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,305
You know how hard it was for me
to ask you that?

96
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:37,268
I have been going around
in my head in circles...

97
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,228
...trying to come up
with something...

98
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:42,982
...with anything that I can fucking use,
but I've got nothing.

99
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,445
Sal and I were so close.
If that body hadn't decomposed...

100
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,282
...we'd fucking have her.
She'd be locked up.

101
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,659
He would be alive.

102
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:57,163
But he's dead and Hannah McKay
is walking around, free to kill again.

103
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,665
And she will fucking kill again,
Dexter.

104
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:02,001
That's who she is.

105
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,670
And I can't let that happen.
Not after Speltzer.

106
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,008
I wish there was another way.

107
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:14,013
You're all I have left.

108
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,076
What's up?

109
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,786
It's Astor.

110
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,038
"Grandpa's kidney stones
are acting up again.

111
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:43,376
Grandma's taking him to the doctor.
Hopefully it's not too serious."

112
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,551
Deb, you told me you didn't wanna be
a part of what I do.

113
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:54,553
Before I realised--

114
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,890
You could hardly live with yourself
when you lied to Batista for me.

115
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,977
How will you live with knowing
you're responsible for a murder?

116
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:04,438
Don't tell me
what I can and can't handle.

117
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,150
Turns out there's a fuck of a lot
that I can live with these days.

118
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:12,446
No, you can't. Ever since you found out,
you've been teetering on the edge.

119
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,032
- You've covered up evidence, lied--
- For you.

120
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,368
That's why I can't let you
take it any further.

121
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:19,203
- For your own good.
- For my own--?

122
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,915
Oh, please, do not parent me, Dexter.
You sound like Dad.

123
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:25,334
Because that's probably
what he'd say.

124
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:27,920
This isn't who you are.

125
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:34,093
Deb, I care about you too much to let
you do something you're gonna regret.

126
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,721
I'm sorry, the answer is no.

127
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:43,602
Well, I guess it's
your fucking decision, isn't it'?

128
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,148
Even though everything
I just said is true...

129
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:50,234
...it doesn't make me
any less of a liar.

130
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,265
Excellent.

131
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:24,894
The police will follow Jurg and
your bodyguard around all afternoon.

132
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,312
And then what?

133
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,564
The cops are dicks,
but they're not morons.

134
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:30,691
They'll figure out
you're not in the car.

135
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,485
Eventually, sure.

136
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,113
But by then, I'll have taken care
of my business.

137
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:41,660
Business? What business?

138
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,080
This isn't about Dexter Morgan
again, is it?

139
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,625
You're not thinking straight here.

140
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,210
He works for Miami Metro.

141
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:53,422
We take out one more of theirs,
they shut this place down for good.

142
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:57,426
We have inventory to move tonight.

143
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,140
Come on, man, just let it go.

144
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:05,935
Go home.

145
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,378
Deb's got 24-hour
police surveillance on Isaak...

146
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,381
...which means
I know where he is at all times.

147
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,258
He's moved into Viktor's apartment...

148
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:41,262
...and hardly gone anywhere other than
The Fox Hole and a few restaurants.

149
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,806
Hey, Dexter. The usual?

150
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,016
Yeah, thanks.

151
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,478
Do you have any Boston creams?
It's my sister's favourite.

152
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,647
Got some fresh ones
coming out now.

153
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:54,525
- Take just a minute.
- Thanks.

154
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:58,070
Is that your plan to keep Debra
from going over to the dark side?

155
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,991
- Give her a massive sugar rush?
- I don't exactly have a plan yet.

156
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,618
I can think of an obvious one.

157
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:09,081
I'm not gonna stop seeing Hannah
just because she's a murderer...

158
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,876
...and my sister wants to kill her.

159
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,170
Do you hear how that sounds?

160
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,106
- What the hell?
- I don't know.

161
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,692
Those fucking gang kids
are at it again.

162
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,987
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I'm calling the police.

163
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:49,455
While you played house with Hannah,
Isaak found a way to shake the police...

164
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:51,874
...which likely means
he'll come after you again.

165
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,919
Well, if he can get past
Miami Metro Homicide, so can I.

166
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,504
Grandpa's gone to surgery.

167
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,172
- We have to stay with you.
- Shit.

168
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,840
What?

169
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,761
- The kids are coming.
- Kids as in plural?

170
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,013
Grandpa has to have surgery.

171
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,350
I need to send Jamie
to Orlando to pick them up.

172
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,982
It was Isaak, wasn't it?

173
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:22,488
- How did he get away from the cops?
- Does it matter?

174
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,240
- Did you see him?
- Yeah.

175
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,617
Then you're a fucking witness.
I can arrest him.

176
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,827
You already tried that once.
It didn't work.

177
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:34,542
You really want an investigation into
why Isaak Sirko is trying to kill me?

178
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,502
So, what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

179
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,295
Just let me handle it.

180
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,257
It's not like I have much of a choice.

181
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,134
Just be careful, okay?

182
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:47,888
There's one other thing.
I got a call from the kids' grandmother.

183
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:49,932
- Harrison okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

184
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,768
But Bill has to
have emergency surgery...

185
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:55,479
...and Maura wants me
to watch Harrison...

186
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,815
...and Astor and Cody for a few days.

187
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,568
- Now is not a good time.
- I know, but what could I say'?

188
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,571
- Jamie's picking them up.
- They can't stay at your apartment.

189
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,698
Isaak probably
has his own key by now.

190
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,326
Any ideas?

191
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:15,082
Yeah, they can stay at my place.

192
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,128
I'll get patrol cars
to cover my house, just in case.

193
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,006
How are you gonna
explain that to LaGuerta?

194
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:28,596
I'll tell her that I'm afraid lsaak's
gonna come after me for his arrest.

195
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,348
Your house isn't exactly kid friendly.

196
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,726
- What does that mean?
- Well, you have a gun.

197
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,561
I'll lock it up.

198
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,315
And the pay channels. Cody's 12.

199
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,693
Okay, I'll lock up the remote.
Anything else?

200
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,863
Anything in your kitchen
besides salsa and beer?

201
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,906
There was some cheese
when I moved in.

202
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,701
I'll have Jamie stock the fridge.

203
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,747
This is gonna be great. I love kids.

204
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,835
I don't love kids in general,
but I love your kids.

205
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,757
And Astor and Cody,
it's been a long time.

206
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:08,093
I'll give you a heads-up when
I know when they're getting in. Thanks.

207
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,345
Yeah.

208
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,306
What's that?

209
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,683
I'm gonna pay
Hannah McKay a visit.

210
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,352
Why?

211
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,146
Just because you're not gonna do
what you do...

212
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,775
...doesn't mean she gets to live
happily fucking ever after.

213
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:28,113
I guess it was foolish to think Deb
would simply walk away from this.

214
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:35,412
Hey, I heard about your donut shop.

215
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:39,458
Oh, yeah. Pretty scary.
Francisco thinks it was gang-related.

216
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,378
Showdown between
the crullers and the fritters?

217
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,923
Deb, if you need me,
I'll be on my cell phone.

218
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,342
Something UP?

219
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,594
Just some business
on the other side of town.

220
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:52,846
Dexter. Ladies.

221
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:56,266
If you get a chance,
stop by Papa's after work today.

222
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,436
- It's under new management.
- Shut up. You got the restaurant?

223
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:02,815
The landlord and I
came to an agreement with the lease.

224
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,817
Call me Papa.

225
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,861
No, I will not do that,
but I will stop by for a drink later.

226
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,906
- Dex, you're in?
- No, I've got the kids coming into town.

227
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:13,367
It's a family place. Bring them.

228
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,662
Angel.

229
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,375
I'm really happy for you.

230
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:26,714
One cubic yard of cocoa mulch,
25 pounds of--

231
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,300
Let me get back to you.

232
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,680
Lieutenant.

233
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,225
You in the market for
some orchids?

234
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,686
I'm not buying anything from you.

235
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,939
- Look, I think you have the wrong idea--
- Shut up.

236
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:48,527
I'm not interested in anything you have
to say, because you're a fucking liar.

237
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,321
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

238
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:56,326
Well, I think you'd be surprised at the
things that you don't know about me.

239
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:59,621
Sal Price shared everything with me.

240
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,208
So you may think you're safer because
he's dead, but actually it's worse.

241
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:07,045
He was just a writer. I'm a cop.
Whatever you're hiding, I'll find out.

242
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,673
Sal Price was a storyteller.
He wanted to sell books.

243
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,717
He didn't care
if they were true or not.

244
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:16,263
You admitted to him on tape
that you killed with Wayne.

245
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:20,851
How convenient that he died before
he had a chance to write about it.

246
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,897
Lieutenant, what were you doing
when you were 15 years old?

247
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:29,067
I'm guessing you were probably on
the soccer team or something, right?

248
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:32,196
Me, I was just some dumb farm girl...

249
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,573
...who was wakened in the middle
of the night...

250
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,535
...by an older boy that I had a crush on
who said, "Let's go on a trip."

251
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,623
I was in over my head.

252
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:47,211
You knew exactly
what you were doing then.

253
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,671
You're in over your head now.

254
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,884
Well, I don't know why
I care so much about what you think...

255
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,678
...but somehow I do, so I'm sorry.

256
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,848
You haven't even begun to be sorry.

257
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:11,443
I'm not suggesting a coup here.

258
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,112
More like a realignment.

259
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:18,033
I'd never do anything without
the support of the Brotherhood...

260
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:21,370
...but I feel like something
has to be done...

261
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,998
...or this whole thing's
gonna explode in our faces.

262
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,419
Okay.

263
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,464
Consider it done.

264
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,734
You wanna stick around?
Watch your girl?

265
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,194
Drinks on me.

266
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:57,531
I've got a better idea.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

267
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:01,994
- Come on, Joey.
- No, don't "Come on, Joey" me.

268
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,330
We had a deal and you fucked me over,
so we're done.

269
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:09,001
Look, I'm sorry
I couldn't get you Nadia's passport.

270
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:13,297
I tried, man, but the guys in Kiev,
they pull the strings.

271
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:16,008
What I do have is some cash.

272
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:20,512
If you do one more job for me,
you can buy something for Nadia.

273
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,098
See, I don't want your fucking cash.

274
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,892
And if you take that out on her...

275
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,603
...I'll have ICE down here
faster than you can count...

276
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:30,564
...checking on the immigration status
of all your employees.

277
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,025
So go fuck yourself. Bye.

278
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,778
Miami Metro believes they know
where Isaak is at all times...

279
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,907
...but obviously I can't count on that.

280
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,203
Hope he enjoys his last meal.

281
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,540
When he gets home
to Viktor's apartment, I'll be waiting.

282
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,047
- Hey, Jamie.
- Hey, Dex.

283
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:58,300
We just made a quick pit stop.
I warned Cody about the Big Gulp.

284
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:02,596
But we're about three hours out
depending on traffic.

285
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:06,058
Great. Why don't we meet
at your brother's new restaurant?

286
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,644
If he's got macaroni and cheese,
we'll be fine.

287
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,313
Apparently that's all
Harrison's willingly consumed...

288
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,857
- ...since he got to Orlando.
- It is his favourite.

289
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,152
- God, Cody, we don't want to stop again.
- But I'm thirsty.

290
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,279
Can't we leave him
by the side of the road?

291
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:22,950
No, Astor, we can't just leave him
by the side of the road.

292
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,035
Sounds like you got your hands full.

293
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,788
We'll see you in Miami, Dexter.

294
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,290
Drive safe.

295
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:50,394
People always say they'd like
to die at home.

296
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:55,357
I'll leave his body here and let
the police blame it on the Colombians.

297
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,286
Who the hell are you?

298
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,081
I'm the building super.
I came to fix the faucet.

299
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,291
I didn't know anyone was home.

300
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:17,004
You're not the super.

301
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,798
Sure I am. Who are you?

302
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,634
I'm the Avon Lady.

303
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,052
Well, that's just silly.

304
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,096
You're here
for the same reason I am.

305
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,223
- Which is?
- To kill Sirko.

306
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,767
Look, I don't know
who sent you here...

307
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:34,312
...but I'm not going halfsies
with anyone. This is my job.

308
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,952
We could have just gone halfsies.

309
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,876
With all the people who want
to kill Isaak...

310
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,879
...why is it so hard to get him dead?

311
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,559
Not this guy.

312
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,313
This one either.

313
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,069
Dexter Morgan.

314
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,196
This guy had a slip.

315
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,531
Had? Meaning he doesn't
have one anymore?

316
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,118
No, he moved a few years back.
I remember because it was odd.

317
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:33,371
He had eight months to go
on his lease.

318
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,665
When exactly did he move?

319
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,543
May, 2007.

320
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:44,966
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

321
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,768
You're getting heavier.
What did they feed you up there?

322
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:58,063
Mac and cheese.
And more mac and cheese.

323
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:01,817
- Wanna play on the beach after we eat?
- Oh, I can take him now.

324
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,736
Astor and Cody were fighting
the entire drive down.

325
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,780
I need a break.

326
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:10,617
- Mojitos on the house.
- All right.

327
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,868
For the grown-ups.

328
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:17,040
Sodas for the kids.
Sorry, I gotta keep my liquor license.

329
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:20,669
- Everything good here?
- It's perfect. Thanks, Angel.

330
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:24,589
Perfect because
it has a built-in security system.

331
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,009
Dexter, check out
my "Angry Birds" score.

332
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:31,263
Dexter doesn't wanna see your
"Angry Birds" score. Put it away.

333
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:36,017
- I've missed you guys.
- We missed you too.

334
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,478
So how's school?
Is math still kicking your ass?

335
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:41,773
Butt. Kicking your butt.

336
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,776
That's what I said.
Is math still kicking your butt?

337
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,904
I'm a year ahead in math now
and I'm taking A.P. Bio.

338
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,489
Impressive.

339
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,409
She passed out
when they dissected the fetal pig.

340
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:55,620
Can we not talk about fetal pigs
at dinner?

341
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,334
Can we not get through dinner without
you doing something disgusting?

342
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,712
Can you stop acting
like Miss Perfect?

343
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,798
You can't even make it through
a weekend without smoking pot.

344
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,551
Oh, my God.
You know how many cops are here?

345
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,554
- You wanna get arrested?
- God, what is wrong with you?

346
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:17,934
Guess I should go talk to her.

347
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,770
I'll be your backup.

348
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:33,074
I don't do it a lot, I swear.
Just when I get really stressed out.

349
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,994
You wanna tell me what's going on?

350
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:37,245
It's just pot.

351
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:40,207
In some states,
it's not even against the law.

352
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,335
It's always against the law
for someone your age...

353
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,712
...which is for your own good,
by the way.

354
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,173
Thanks for the
public service announcement.

355
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:51,885
Dexter's right. Sometimes things that
seem like a good idea in the moment...

356
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,095
...are things you'll end up
regretting later.

357
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,183
Astor...

358
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,354
...I know how...

359
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:07,108
...certain vices can be used
to relieve stress.

360
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:15,784
But sometimes those vices can cause
more problems than the original stress.

361
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,370
Okay, I get it, pot is evil.
Are we done?

362
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,540
Sure, we're done.

363
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,849
Kids are all asleep in your room.

364
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,227
I put Harrison on your bed.
I hope that's okay.

365
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,312
Yeah, sure.

366
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,731
He doesn't wet the bed, does he?

367
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:48,775
Not always.

368
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:51,069
You owe me.

369
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,405
Jamie will be here first thing
in the morning.

370
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,115
Hey, Dex...

371
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,578
...maybe you were right...

372
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:02,706
...about Hannah.

373
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:09,337
I mean, don't get me wrong. If anyone
deserves what you do, she does.

374
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,842
But it must have been hard to resist
and I know you did it for me.

375
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:18,013
So thanks for caring.

376
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:22,100
You don't have to thank me.

377
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:28,189
Thanks for taking everyone in.

378
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:31,860
My home is their home.

379
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:34,738
My family-.

380
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:37,240
All that's left of it is here,
under one roof.

381
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,534
It should feel like home.

382
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:43,079
So why do I want so badly
to be somewhere else?

383
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,674
Look who's not here again.

384
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,259
Is this a bad time?

385
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:01,639
Fortunately, you've managed to
catch me in between gentleman callers.

386
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:04,100
Well, I guess it's my lucky night.

387
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,894
What brings you DY?

388
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,813
Or is this your version
of a booty call?

389
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,317
- What's a booty call?
- Seriously?

390
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:16,696
Actually, I just stopped by because
I'm gonna be busy for the next few days.

391
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:20,617
So you came by to see me
because you can't see me?

392
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,827
Something like that.

393
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:25,622
So, what's got you so busy?

394
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,292
Nothing, I just...

395
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:34,589
The head of the Koshka Brotherhood
wants to kill me.

396
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,219
You're not kidding.

397
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:44,974
Well, I don't know what a Koshka
Brotherhood is, but it sounds bad.

398
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:50,397
It's kind of Ukrainian mafia.

399
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,316
What did you do to piss them off?

400
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,403
Not them. Just Isaak Sirko.

401
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:59,114
He has this personal vendetta
against me.

402
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:00,949
Why?

403
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,327
I killed one of his key guys.

404
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,288
Well, it happens.

405
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:11,918
So, what do you know
about this Isaak Sirko?

406
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:16,339
I know that he wants to kill me
and that I need to kill him first...

407
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:20,343
...and that it's harder than
I thought it would be.

408
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:22,387
Well, you want my advice?

409
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:25,265
Sure.

410
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:29,894
You spent a lot of time finding out
all about me before you...

411
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:34,691
- Before I tried to kill you.
- Right.

412
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,070
This is different.
I had to make sure that you fit my code.

413
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,072
I already know lsaak's a killer.

414
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:45,034
Still, it seems like you have a system
and it's working for you, right?

415
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:46,286
Most of the time.

416
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:49,330
Well, so why don't you
try the same thing on this guy?

417
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:53,001
Figure out who he is
and why he really wants to kill you.

418
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,129
Here.

419
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:01,342
Take my van.
He might know your car.

420
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:07,182
Besides, it'll give you a decent excuse
to come by and not see me again.

421
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:25,325
I have never been able to talk
to anyone about my kills before.

422
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:28,870
Not like this.

423
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:32,999
No judgment, no fear, no panic.

424
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:37,420
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

425
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:40,673
I'm kind of tired of talking.

426
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,052
Maybe I can show you
what a booty call is.

427
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,897
Come on, Joey. It's not that bad.

428
00:30:57,106 --> 00:31:01,069
I only have to work for George for two
more years. Then I'll have my freedom.

429
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:05,448
- You believe that?
- He likes his dancers young.

430
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:08,660
There are always more girls
who want to come here.

431
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,122
I'm sorry I let you down.

432
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:17,210
Just promise me you'll never do
anything for them again.

433
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,754
Not even for me.

434
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,716
I promise.

435
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:28,680
- Okay, I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

436
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:54,247
How'd I know
I'd find your horny ass here?

437
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:57,750
I got something to show you.

438
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:04,090
- I'm not interested.
- Oh, I think you might be.

439
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:08,219
But Isaak Sirko, he wants you
to lose the blood evidence...

440
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:11,222
...linking him
to the Colombian murders.

441
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:14,726
Let me skip to the good part.

442
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:19,564
If I do this, Nadia's a free woman.

443
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:22,900
You give me her fucking passport,
understand?

444
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:28,072
Deal. And I'll do you one better.
You can even keep the cash.

445
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,658
Now do we understand each other?

446
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:35,455
If I go down,
you're going down with me.

447
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:39,167
It won't exactly ruin my reputation.

448
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:41,419
I got the Koshka Brotherhood
behind me.

449
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,713
You saw how long
Sirko stayed behind bars.

450
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:47,800
Who's gonna save your ass?
Miami Metro?

451
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:49,344
What do you want'?

452
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:51,888
Same kind of shit
you used to do for us.

453
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,931
We have some product
that needs to move.

454
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,768
I need a cop around
to make sure nothing goes wrong.

455
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,603
If you help us,
you make some money.

456
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:02,732
And if you don't, that recording
goes on the fucking cloud.

457
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,195
I'm sorry to twist your arm, buddy,
but you really left me no choice.

458
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,906
I'll see you tonight.

459
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,210
No one else here.

460
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,587
Not anymore, anyway.

461
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,839
Do you recognise him?

462
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:30,093
- He's one of George's men.
- Sent here to kill me.

463
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,306
George wouldn't make a move without
getting approval from the boys in Kiev.

464
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,850
- So much for brotherhood.
- This can be fixed.

465
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,478
- We can go home, we can call--
- No.

466
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,106
I'm a dead man there.

467
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:48,486
You've already gone above
and beyond the call of duty, Jurg.

468
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,988
Your loyalty could get you killed.

469
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:53,616
Where you go, I go.

470
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,080
My offshore accounts
should last some time.

471
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:02,250
But I won't have access
to the corporate accounts.

472
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,919
Bloody hell.

473
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,796
Then there's this.

474
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,798
We're gonna need
another place to stay.

475
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,758
Who do you think killed him?

476
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:15,346
Well, that's a job for the police,
isn't it?

477
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:18,933
Why don't you go
and give our friends downstairs a call?

478
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:31,821
Looks like the gang's all here.

479
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:39,454
So you have no idea
what he was doing in your apartment?

480
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:41,289
Not a clue.

481
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:45,209
But I'm sure your trusty blood spatter
analyst could figure it out.

482
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,962
Mr. Sirko, the gun that we found...

483
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,757
...would suggest that
he came here to kill someone.

484
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:56,012
And since you live here,
that someone may very well be you.

485
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,139
What a frightening thought.

486
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,641
Then perhaps
I need some sort of police escort.

487
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:05,229
- Oh, I already have that.
- We'll have to confirm with the ME...

488
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,815
...but judging by the lividity
and state of rigour...

489
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:11,569
...I'd estimate the time of death
as sometime yesterday afternoon.

490
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:15,573
Let me see.
Now, where was I yesterday afternoon?

491
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:18,951
Perhaps these kind officers
could refresh my memory.

492
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,078
Unis tailed him all day.

493
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:22,705
He wasn't here.

494
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:26,626
Seems I have an alibi.
I hope they're trustworthy.

495
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:30,838
- Dex, what have you got?
- Yes, please, Dex, tell us your theory.

496
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:33,049
I'm so curious.

497
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:37,136
Well, judging by the photo
found in the victim's pocket...

498
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,514
...he was lying in wait for Mr. Sirko.

499
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:41,682
Here you go.

500
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:44,852
These scuff marks
indicate a struggle.

501
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,604
They fell to the floor.

502
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:51,609
And then the killer
cut his carotid artery...

503
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:55,696
...with one swipe
of a very sharp knife.

504
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:57,573
My, my-

505
00:35:57,782 --> 00:36:01,244
You couldn't have described that better
if you'd been there yourself.

506
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,996
Thanks.

507
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,125
I have plans with the kids today.
You think you can finish this up?

508
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:11,462
Fine, but one of these days, I'm gonna
track down some of my kids...

509
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:14,257
- ...so that I can skip out on work.
- Thanks.

510
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,260
Vince is gonna take it from here.

511
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:19,262
Keep him occupied as long
as you can.

512
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,430
Kill you later, Isaak.

513
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,809
Yeah.
Oh, that's gonna be really good.

514
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,811
See, get it all up in there.

515
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,941
Yeah. That's a strong castle, mister.

516
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,694
You're doing so good.

517
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:40,032
- Want that?
- He did it all himself.

518
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:43,244
- That's pretty awesome.
- Yummy.

519
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:47,832
You know what? I think you need
a little bit more sunscreen, Harrison.

520
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,668
Hey, buddy,
you know what this place needs?

521
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:54,672
A moat. Keep the bad guys out.

522
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,808
I'll be back in a minute.

523
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,228
Can I have some of that leg?

524
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,489
I miss the beach.

525
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:22,867
It reminds me of Mom.

526
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:26,954
Yeah, she used to take you guys
here all the time.

527
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:30,374
Atlanta doesn't feel like home,
but here doesn't either.

528
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:34,295
It's like there's no place
I actually belong.

529
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,088
You know what I mean?

530
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,884
Actually, yeah, I do.

531
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,096
If my grandparents find out
about the pot...

532
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:47,016
...they'll think I'm just turning into
my dad or something.

533
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:50,770
I feel like they're just waiting
for that to happen anyways.

534
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:57,652
You know, when I was younger,
someone told me who I was...

535
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,113
...and I pretty much took
his word for it.

536
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:07,495
If I'd taken the time
to decide for myself...

537
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:10,873
...I would have turned out different.

538
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:13,209
Different how?

539
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:17,546
I don't really know,
but I kind of wish I did.

540
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,885
For the record,
you didn't turn out so bad.

541
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:34,063
For the record,
the pot will stay off the record.

542
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:46,450
Just give me a sec.

543
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:52,289
- Hey, Hannah.
- Hey, I'm sorry to bother you...

544
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:55,251
...but I accidentally left
my greenhouse keys in the van.

545
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:59,547
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
I could bring them by in a few hours.

546
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,799
Just tell me where you are
and I'll swing by.

547
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,721
Home Beach. Tower 1.

548
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:09,306
Okay, great.
I'll call you when I get there.

549
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:25,364
- Is this the one?
- Yeah, thanks.

550
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,535
So, what are you doing out here?

551
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,788
Hey, Dexter. Look.

552
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,044
Oh, right.

553
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:40,629
Of course.
I should've seen that one coming.

554
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,840
No, she's not--

555
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:46,677
She's my nanny.

556
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:48,721
Your nanny?

557
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:53,893
Yeah, that little guy is my son.

558
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:56,979
Harrison. He's 3.

559
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:01,233
I told you about his mother,
how she passed away.

560
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:04,820
The other two are Astor and Cody.
They're my step-kids.

561
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:08,491
They live in Orlando
with their grandparents.

562
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:11,660
Harrison lives with me...

563
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:13,829
...most of the time.

564
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:18,042
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

565
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,298
You didn't trust me or you
were afraid it would push me away?

566
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,301
Maybe a little of both.

567
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:31,889
Well, I'd love to meet them sometime.

568
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:37,686
- You're lucky, Dexter.
- Lucky?

569
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,688
No matter where I go...

570
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:43,526
...I'm Hannah McKay,
the spree killer's girlfriend.

571
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:45,861
Nobody has a clue who you are.

572
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:51,909
You get to have this normal life
with kids and...

573
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,206
Is that something you want?

574
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:59,416
It was, once upon a time.

575
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:02,044
Wayne and I talked about
having 10 of them.

576
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:05,005
Could you imagine what a train wreck
that would have been?

577
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:07,716
Then when I got married to Jake,
I thought:

578
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:10,803
"This is how it's supposed to be,"
you know?

579
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,514
But when that whole thing
went to shit...

580
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:17,184
...I just figured it wasn't really
in the cards for me.

581
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,646
That's what I used to think too.

582
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:23,566
Dex, get over here.

583
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:26,152
Well, I won't intrude.

584
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,905
- Enjoy your time with them.
- Okay.

585
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:49,758
Hey.

586
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,927
Everyone asleep?

587
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:54,263
Yeah, finally.

588
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:59,018
Dexter, you did not tell me that bedtime
is, like, this two-hour process.

589
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:02,605
And that reading those Dr. Seuss
books out loud is really fucking hard.

590
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:05,232
Sorry I missed that.

591
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:07,526
Teenagers are great.
You tell them what to do.

592
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:09,778
I mean, my house
has never looked so clean.

593
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:11,280
I love families.

594
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:16,577
Does Hannah fit
into my family somewhere?

595
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,172
What's that doing here?

596
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:35,346
I borrowed a oar from a friend
so Isaak wouldn't recognise me.

597
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,725
Does that friend
happen to be Hannah McKay?

598
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:48,025
- I was going to--
- Oh, my God.

599
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,282
Are you fucking her?

600
00:42:57,993 --> 00:42:59,828
- I can explain.
- I know what fucking is.

601
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:02,498
No explanation necessary.

602
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,876
Is that why you wouldn't kill her?

603
00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:09,046
Partially.

604
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:17,471
I am the biggest asshole
on the planet.

605
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:21,225
All that bullshit about you caring
about me too much...

606
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:24,478
...to let me do something
I would regret? I fucking bought it.

607
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:26,939
Deb, everything I said was true.

608
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:36,115
Yes, I didn't kill Hannah
because I have feelings for her...

609
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:38,951
...but that doesn't make
what I said to you any less true.

610
00:43:39,118 --> 00:43:43,122
Feelings? Are you in love with her?

611
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:46,041
I don't know.

612
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:50,004
Is it because she's a serial killer?

613
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,464
Does that turn you on or something?

614
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:58,679
What do you all do, sit around and talk
about who you're gonna take out next?

615
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:03,767
Oh, my God.

616
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:06,437
Price?

617
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:09,356
Did you fucking help her with Price?

618
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:11,066
No.

619
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:13,485
I don't even know
why I fucking ask you, Dexter.

620
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,821
Every time I think I know exactly
who you are...

621
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:17,614
...you tell me something worse.

622
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:19,158
Being with Hannah is worse...

623
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:21,618
- ...than being a killer?
- Yes.

624
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,538
No. I don't...

625
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:31,295
I know you're not gonna stop killing.

626
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:34,465
I mean, you've made that very clear.

627
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:37,968
But you can stop seeing her.

628
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:41,221
I don't wanna stop seeing her.

629
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:44,850
Look what happened
to her husband, Dexter.

630
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:47,227
She doesn't have
the best track record with men.

631
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:50,105
I don't even want to talk
about the fucking body trail...

632
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:52,316
...that you've left in your love life.

633
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:55,361
I'm not asking your permission, Deb.

634
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:58,280
So you don't care
what it does to me?

635
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:02,576
- I don't want to hurt you.
- Well, guess what. You did.

636
00:45:03,077 --> 00:45:05,579
You picked the one way
that you could hurt me...

637
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:08,791
...worse than you could ever
fucking understand.

638
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:13,629
You told me you accepted
me being a killer.

639
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:17,508
- If you love me, you'll accept this.
- If I love you? If I love you.

640
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:20,803
I went to the church that night
that you killed Travis Marshall...

641
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:23,764
...to tell you that I'm in love with you.

642
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,024
You're...

643
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,984
...in love with me?

644
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:39,655
Fuck. Oh, my God.

645
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:43,492
Was.

646
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:48,330
I don't even know
if I fucking like you.

647
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:50,082
Just...

648
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,043
Forget it.

649
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:00,717
What do you mean,
you're in love with me?

650
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:10,602
I didn't mean to say that. I don't...

651
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:17,818
I know it's weird and it's gross
and it's fucked up, but...

652
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:22,239
And I know you don't feel the same.

653
00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:26,410
I don't even know if I feel the same.

654
00:46:26,577 --> 00:46:28,829
It's one thing to be in love
with your brother...

655
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:32,082
...but it is a whole other level to be
in love with your brother...

656
00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:35,669
...who's a goddamn fucking
serial killer.

657
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:44,094
You're a serial killer
and I'm more fucked up than you are.

658
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:58,609
Well, aren't you gonna
say anything?

659
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,619
I'm sorry.

660
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:17,503
I don't know what to say.

661
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:20,339
Oh, God, you never do.

662
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:28,263
Will you please just go?
I really-- I can't look at you.

663
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:45,322
Are you gonna just keep following
Isaak around all night?

664
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:47,032
I can really use a kill tonight.

665
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:49,159
After what just happened
with your sister?

666
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:50,869
She's not...

667
00:47:51,203 --> 00:47:53,413
She's not in love with me.
That's insane.

668
00:47:53,622 --> 00:47:55,332
You have to admit, it explains a lot.

669
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:59,044
Why she didn't arrest you.
Why she keeps believing all your lies.

670
00:47:59,253 --> 00:48:02,297
Why she's willing to give up
everything she believes in for you.

671
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:06,176
What am I supposed to do?
I can't feel what Deb wants me to feel.

672
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:09,680
You don't even know how
she wants you to feel. You just left.

673
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:11,390
She asked me to leave.

674
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:13,267
Dexter...

675
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:15,561
...calm down.

676
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:18,981
Oh, well, you know
what I do to calm myself.

677
00:48:25,404 --> 00:48:26,989
Where is Isaak going?

678
00:48:27,573 --> 00:48:29,700
Looks like a bar.

679
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,336
I'll give him half a dose, walk out
the back so the police don't see me.

680
00:48:41,503 --> 00:48:44,631
I'll look like a friend walking
his drunk buddy to his car.

681
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,009
He could be leading you into a trap.

682
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:50,512
Not to mention,
the police are only 100 feet away.

683
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:12,743
What a pleasant surprise.

684
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:15,579
We both know you can't kill me here.

685
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,456
Oh, I can.

686
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:19,875
But I won't.

687
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:24,338
Has to be some vestige of civility left
even in this corner of the world.

688
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:27,299
You call shooting at me
in a donut shop civil?

689
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:29,176
I was short on time and opportunity.

690
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:33,138
Barman, can I have a beer
for my friend, Dexter Morgan?

691
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:35,891
Now we can both relax.

692
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:40,937
Unlike most places on the planet,
everyone's welcome here.

693
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:55,869
You thought your enemies
wouldn't follow you into a gay bar?

694
00:49:57,204 --> 00:49:58,330
No.

695
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:02,876
I thought I'd feel comfortable
in a gay bar.

696
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:08,256
Ironic, isn't it?

697
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:12,761
I always feared the Brotherhood would
learn my secret and turn against me.

698
00:50:12,928 --> 00:50:16,431
Now they've turned against me anyway,
and none the wiser about this.

699
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:19,434
I will have to thank you
for slitting that assassin's throat.

700
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:21,186
You might have saved my life.

701
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:25,941
But you must explain to me
your aversion to guns sometime.

702
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:31,196
- It's complicated.
- I can imagine it is.

703
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,869
You should cut your losses, Isaak.

704
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:39,538
Go back to Kiev.

705
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:45,127
There's nothing waiting for me
back in Kiev...

706
00:50:45,335 --> 00:50:47,713
...except for a large,
well-staffed house...

707
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:51,550
...and an attractive secretary who
occasionally pretends we're an item...

708
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:54,052
...to keep the rumours
from circulating.

709
00:50:58,557 --> 00:51:01,059
The one thing that made my life
worth living in Kiev...

710
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:03,437
...you tossed in the ocean
a few weeks back.

711
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:08,817
- You and Viktor were--
- Lovers. More than that.

712
00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:18,702
You took from me the one thing
that money and power can't bring back.

713
00:51:19,995 --> 00:51:24,916
And now thanks to you,
also the luxuries are gone too.

714
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:29,713
Not because of me. Because of this
vendetta you're holding on to.

715
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:33,049
And what did you do to the man
who murdered your spouse?

716
00:51:33,884 --> 00:51:36,344
Nothing you wouldn't have done.

717
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:40,265
Nothing I wouldn't do
a thousand times over again.

718
00:51:41,892 --> 00:51:44,728
- Did it help?
- She's still dead.

719
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:51,818
I can see that Viktor
meant a great deal to you...

720
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:55,614
...but he was a killer
and he got what he deserved.

721
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:57,365
My wife was innocent.

722
00:51:58,784 --> 00:52:02,370
And if she weren't,
you'd feel the same.

723
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,707
That's how love is.

724
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:08,794
It's a powerful weapon.

725
00:52:09,586 --> 00:52:13,256
It can work for us
or against us, can't it?

726
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:18,094
I don't understand much about love.

727
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:21,515
Well, that's because
you're a scientist.

728
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,059
Love defies reason.

729
00:52:24,601 --> 00:52:27,103
Nothing defies reason.

730
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:32,234
Logically, Viktor and I
shouldn't have been together.

731
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:34,611
I mean, aside from
the obvious social stigma...

732
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,739
...Viktor was impulsive,
foolhardy even.

733
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:40,158
Always out to prove something.

734
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:46,665
I suppose the heart knows something
that we just don't know.

735
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:53,463
Or maybe the heart is just wrong.

736
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:54,798
Oh, I doubt that.

737
00:52:55,006 --> 00:53:00,387
Love can be inconvenient,
perhaps inappropriate.

738
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:02,764
It can be dangerous.

739
00:53:02,973 --> 00:53:05,892
Make us do things
we wouldn't dream of doing.

740
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:09,354
But wrong?

741
00:53:12,983 --> 00:53:15,527
That just depends...

742
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:19,114
...on where we end up, doesn't it?

743
00:53:23,702 --> 00:53:27,539
- We don't have to do this.
- I do have to do this.

744
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:29,457
And then what?

745
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:32,919
Then?

746
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:35,630
Well, I hadn't really thought about it.

747
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:40,427
Suppose I'll take my funds, find some
little attractive corner of the world...

748
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:45,015
...and while away my days in comfort
and anonymity.

749
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:47,142
Argentina.

750
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:51,229
Actually, I was thinking more like
Micronesia, but each to their own.

751
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:55,817
We're outsiders, you and I.

752
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:58,612
On the periphery.

753
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:01,323
Watching everybody else.

754
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:04,576
Pretending we're just like them,
but knowing we're not.

755
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:11,249
Best we can hope for is to find a place
where we don't have to pretend.

756
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,422
It's a shame, really.

757
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:22,052
Under different circumstances, I think
we could have been great friends.

758
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:36,191
Till next time.

759
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:51,873
Everyone wants an Argentina.

760
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:56,086
A place where the slate
is wiped clean.

761
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:05,261
Isaak, I'm at the airport in Miami.
I'll be home soon.

762
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,395
Isaak, I'm at the airport in Miami.
I'll be home soon.

763
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:21,569
But the truth is Argentina
is just Argentina.

764
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:40,755
No matter where we go, we take
ourselves and our damage with us.

765
00:55:51,558 --> 00:55:56,187
So is home the place we run to
or is it the place we run from?

766
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:09,034
Only to hide out in places
where we're accepted unconditionally.

767
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:12,537
Places that feel more
like home to us...

768
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,393
...because we can finally
be who we are.
