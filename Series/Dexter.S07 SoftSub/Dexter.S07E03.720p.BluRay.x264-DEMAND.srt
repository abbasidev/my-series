1
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:11,805
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:15,600
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it all the way.

3
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,436
We're gonna eat together.
We're gonna watch TV together.

4
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:21,856
We're gonna drive
to fucking work together.

5
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,901
Why did you send me the hand?

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,613
I came to you for help with my game
and you said no.

7
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:30,949
Your game?

8
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:35,787
Kaja was dating someone. Tony Rush.
He's one of the bosses here.

9
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:39,207
The night that Kaja died,
she left the club with Viktor.

10
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:44,587
Viktor never made his flight. I checked.

11
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:47,048
Well, I don't understand.
Where is he, then?

12
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,138
You loved her, didn't you?

13
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:55,306
- What?
- Kaja.

14
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:57,434
Maybe that's why
you talked to the police.

15
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:59,894
You know what? I didn't say a word.

16
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:06,943
This pretty face
belongs to Wayne Randall.

17
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,779
Fifteen years ago,
Randall and his teenage girlfriend...

18
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:13,032
...went on a three-state killing spree
that ended here in Miami.

19
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:16,703
Hannah used to think
I was something special.

20
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,873
Now she sees me as just a killer.

21
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,375
There's just one last person
I need to kill.

22
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:27,297
Randall couldn't take life in prison.

23
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,301
Can I?

24
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:34,048
Hey, excuse you.

25
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,426
I feel trapped,
like there's no escape.

26
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,847
And it's not because
I'm at the post office.

27
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,734
She's got me penned in
like a caged animal.

28
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:57,947
And an animal is never more dangerous
than when it's backed into a corner.

29
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,460
Dexter.

30
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:14,088
How much longer are you gonna be?
We have a briefing in 20 minutes.

31
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:16,925
I'll be out in a minute, Deb.

32
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,218
Why do you look so guilty?

33
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:20,929
Next.

34
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:22,639
I can't do anything about Deb...

35
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:25,433
...but there's one irritation
I can get rid of.

36
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,269
Louis.

37
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,332
The morning briefing.

38
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,711
It's the only time Deb's looking
at everyone and not just me.

39
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:58,758
Let's get started. Batista, where are we
on the Mike Anderson investigation?

40
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,135
Specifically with
Baskov Fuckwad-enov over here.

41
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:04,180
We're still chasing our tail.
BOLO turned up squat...

42
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:07,266
...so if Baskov is still in the U.S.,
he's gone way underground.

43
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,893
If he did manage to leave...

44
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:13,022
Okay, he's talking
but why's she staring at you?

45
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:17,402
All right, well, let's keep digging around
the Russian expat community.

46
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,072
If Baskov is hiding out locally,
then someone must be helping him.

47
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,658
The club's owned
by Ukrainian business interests...

48
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,495
...with ties to organised crime
so I wouldn't count on anybody...

49
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:30,748
- ...getting too talkative.
- She's still staring. Is she mad at you?

50
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:34,419
Moving on, Simms and Miller brought
in a suspect on the I-95 shooting.

51
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,213
Dexter, I'm gonna need you
to get a standard.

52
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:40,091
I'm definitely picking up a chill
in her voice.

53
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,969
You fucked up, didn't you? You did.
You screwed the pooch.

54
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,810
We're coming up on the end
of the month.

55
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,562
You guys are working open cases.

56
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,689
If you need help, anything I can do...

57
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:58,735
...make sure you're asking for it.
We need to get our numbers down.

58
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,488
Okay.

59
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,159
You're under arrest.
The DNA swab isn't optional.

60
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,410
Fuck you.

61
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,913
I can get
some uniforms to come in...

62
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,874
...and hold your mouth open for you.

63
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:16,878
What's the matter, you too much
of a pussy to do it yourself?

64
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,841
No, I'm just on edge today.
You probably shouldn't push me.

65
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,093
I am quaking in my boots.

66
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,142
What the fuck?

67
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,104
He was being very uncooperative.

68
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:38,483
- He tried to kill me.
- Shut the fuck up. Get outside.

69
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,361
Help.

70
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,075
What the fuck is the matter with you?

71
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:49,452
- You. Watching me all the time.
- Me?

72
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,412
Living with you is driving me crazy.

73
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:55,291
- I have to watch you, Dexter.
- Why? When I had the urge to--

74
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,251
I called you.

75
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,921
Didn't I? And you talked me down.
It worked.

76
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:03,007
- Why can't you back off?
- Can you promise if I wasn't on you...

77
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:04,217
...you wouldn't slip?

78
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:07,178
If you don't get off my ass,
something bad is gonna happen.

79
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,722
- What's that mean?
- If I don't control my need...

80
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,642
- ...it's gonna control me.
- I am trying to help you.

81
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:16,813
- I am trying to help you control it.
- No, you're trying to suppress it.

82
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:19,607
To lock it away.
But the lock is not gonna hold.

83
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:21,776
You saw what happened in there.

84
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:25,238
The only way I control it is to channel it
the way Harry taught me.

85
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,824
No. I do not accept that.

86
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,075
Dad was wrong.

87
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:34,622
I'm not so sure. Sometimes I think
he knew me better than I know myself.

88
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,296
Think about Harrison.

89
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,382
What you could be exposing him to.

90
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,135
I think about him all the time.

91
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:50,096
Sooner or later,
this is gonna catch up to you...

92
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,889
...and to him.

93
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:58,938
I'll give you some space.

94
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:01,774
I'll back off.

95
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,651
Just hang in there with me, okay?

96
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,297
I can't go on like this,
living by Deb's rules.

97
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,683
Ray Speltzer.
Just paroled for assault.

98
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:39,145
But there have been
more serious charges.

99
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,982
Ann Feig disappeared
after a date with Speltzer.

100
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,027
And another date,
Nina Fleischer, turned up dead...

101
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,405
...but the police
couldn't make anything stick.

102
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:54,744
Did Nina lose her earring
in the struggle?

103
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,462
Speltzer will most likely kill again
unless I take him out.

104
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:11,636
A groundskeeper in a cemetery.
That's appropriate.

105
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,263
But he didn't get those muscles
pushing a lawnmower.

106
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:22,188
Speltzer's grown his hair,
but he seems no less hostile.

107
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,108
Is Speltzer just blowing off steam...

108
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:29,820
...or is this the ritual he goes through
before he kills?

109
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,201
- Hey, Deb.
- Hey, what are you up to?

110
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,328
I'm just trying out a new gym.

111
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,666
- What's wrong with the old one?
- Well, this one has a smoothie bar.

112
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,835
Yeah.

113
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,421
Look, I gotta go.
I wanna keep my heart rate up.

114
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,132
Thanks for checking in.

115
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,107
- Nadia.
- Hi, Joey.

116
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:09,402
- What are you doing here?
- I came to ask you a favour.

117
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:15,074
Another one? Oh, it's like giving milk
to a stray cat. Here, sit down.

118
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,661
- I remind you of a dirty cat?
- No, no.

119
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,540
I was trying to be clever,
which is sort of out of my wheelhouse.

120
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,709
What can I do for you?

121
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:28,087
Kaja was wearing a bracelet
the night she was killed.

122
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,756
I know she would want
to be buried in it.

123
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,758
It's the least I could do for my friend.

124
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,094
If it's been cleared for DNA,
you can have it.

125
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:38,889
I got a list of her personal effects.
Here we go.

126
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,979
There's no bracelet listed.

127
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:49,317
Are you sure?
I know she was wearing it that night.

128
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,986
I don't know what you're implying...

129
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,947
...but I'm the only dirty cop
in this station.

130
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,741
And I didn't take it $0...

131
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:00,745
A dirty cop is better than a dirty cat.

132
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,997
- I believe you. Thanks.
- Wait.

133
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:07,251
I was wondering if you'd like to
go outwith me sometime.

134
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,920
Or you could come to my place
and I'll make you dinner.

135
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,757
Why don't I cook you dinner?

136
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,592
I was hoping you'd say that.

137
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,528
Did you see the list
with your own eyes?

138
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,614
Sit down.

139
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,325
No.

140
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:42,328
How do you know the detective
wasn't lying about the bracelet?

141
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,165
Because he likes me.

142
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,918
He likes you?

143
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,379
Do you understand
what's at stake here?

144
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:54,632
If the cops find that dead GPS chip
in that bracelet...

145
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,551
...they're gonna figure out
we use them to track our mules.

146
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,014
- And if they get on to our system--
- They'll shut down your heroin business.

147
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:06,852
Which is a lot more lucrative than
the tits-and-ass business, Nadezhda.

148
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,646
George...

149
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:12,566
...maybe you should accept good news
when you hear it.

150
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:20,199
Your name is Nadezhda,
but you go by Nadia.

151
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,868
I always hated Nadezhda.

152
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,703
You shouldn't.

153
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,832
It's a beautiful Russian name.

154
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,335
Did you know that
the greatest mezzo-soprano...

155
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:34,463
...of the Bolshoi Theatre
was also named Nadezhda?

156
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:39,427
- No.
- Nadezhda Obukhova.

157
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:43,347
It was said that her voice could unlock
the mysteries of the heart.

158
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:47,143
She died before I was born...

159
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,271
...but I still listen to her recordings
of The Snow Maiden.

160
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:57,528
My music teacher, Mr. Chillich...

161
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:02,992
...he said to me,
"lsaak, you think you're strong...

162
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,411
...but you are not strong
if you don't feel."

163
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,290
He gave me an F...

164
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,459
...so I pushed him down
a flight of stairs.

165
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,210
I felt bad about it.

166
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:20,176
After that, my father shipped me off
to a disciplinary school in England.

167
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,554
Now I'm afraid my love of opera...

168
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,849
...is all that's left of my sensitive side.

169
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,229
I want you to get close
to this detective.

170
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:35,065
Find out what the police know
about Viktor.

171
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,236
You'll do that for me, won't you,
Nadezhda?

172
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,614
Good.

173
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,285
You can go now.

174
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,472
Viktor is smart.

175
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:10,226
He probably took the bracelet
to keep the police from getting it.

176
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,603
He probably has it
and is hiding out somewhere.

177
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:16,315
But we'll never know because
the signal died over a week ago.

178
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:18,817
With technology,
there's always a way.

179
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,862
Find the IT man
who set the system up.

180
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,448
If we can track the bracelet...

181
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,326
...we can find Viktor.

182
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,794
So she called and I said,
"Okay, let's do a double-dater."

183
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,422
Five p.m., we're laying down there
on the couch...

184
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,008
...and I feel this hand
kind of go up my back.

185
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:46,011
This is what my life has become?

186
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,317
Time to start prying one monkey
off my back.

187
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,112
Got a package here addressed
to Miami Metro forensics.

188
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,697
Oh, yeah, I'll take it.

189
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,074
- There you go.
- Thanks.

190
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:11,078
I think I drunk-ordered from the Hustler
store and that never turns out well.

191
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,549
What the fuck?

192
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:40,107
"Dear Mr. Greene, when I bought
the Ice Truck Killer's hand...

193
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,736
...I assumed it would be in mint condition,
not with lines over its palm.

194
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,238
Please refund my money immediately."

195
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,536
You had the hand the whole time?

196
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:54,663
And you sold it online?

197
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,166
- No, I swear--
- After all I've done for you...

198
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,959
...you stab me in the fucking back?

199
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,337
- You are so fucking fired.
- Vince. You gotta--

200
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,838
Out. Now.

201
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,691
I have the worst luck with interns.

202
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,571
One more step and Louis
will be out of my life for good.

203
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,076
Now to focus on where
I can find Speltzer next.

204
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,372
Lieutenant, I have someone here
who'd like to speak to you.

205
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,041
This is Donna Randall.

206
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,709
Wayne's mama.

207
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:44,004
The one who suicided out there
on the highway.

208
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:48,676
Ms. Randall, I'm so sorry for your loss.
How can I help you?

209
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,969
It's me might be able to help you.

210
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,973
I got some stuff here
that might interest you.

211
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:59,186
Wayne sent it to me 15 years ago,
just before he got caught.

212
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:03,023
He said it was some sentimental items
and would I hold it for him...

213
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,276
...till he got settled someplace
away from the law.

214
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,113
Ms. Randall, why didn't you
turn this over years ago?

215
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,240
Look, I know my boy did wrong...

216
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,868
...but I wasn't about to help
the state of Florida kill him.

217
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,538
Anyway, now that he's gone...

218
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:22,000
...I figured maybe something in there
might help bring some...

219
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,629
...peace to the families,
you know, of the victims.

220
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,092
It's mostly just junk
that Wayne and that girl...

221
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,927
...collected on their little tear.

222
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:36,724
There was some cash in there too
but I spent that ages ago.

223
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,144
It might be a waste of time
but have the lab go over it.

224
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:43,021
Just when you think a case is closed,
it pops open again.

225
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,608
Another book of matches
from Stuckey's.

226
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:50,154
You would think one memory
of that place would be enough.

227
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,740
Anything interesting?

228
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:54,366
Not so far.

229
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:58,829
One tightly wrapped
young woman's T-shirt.

230
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:04,001
And inside,
we have a little plastic giraffe.

231
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,840
And a lighter.

232
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,926
And a necklace.

233
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:16,138
It looks like more of the same
but why was that stuff wrapped up?

234
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,932
Maybe they have a special meaning.

235
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,810
"Janice."

236
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,854
Name of the woman
Randall said he killed.

237
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,899
- Might be a trophy.
- Means Wayne was telling the truth.

238
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,067
Her body must be buried out there
someplace.

239
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:32,529
If the giraffe and lighter are trophies too
there might be more bodies.

240
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,699
I just got a call. The bouncer
from the Fox Hole, Tony Rush...

241
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,410
...they found him with a screwdriver
through his head.

242
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:39,745
We just interviewed him.

243
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,956
The Koshka Brotherhood were
trying to send a message about oops.

244
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,417
Just got that much harder
to find who killed Mike.

245
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,129
No matter what we do,
there's always another body.

246
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:52,925
Yo, Mary Poppins, wait up.

247
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,260
Deb, I'm not gonna
be home for dinner tonight.

248
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,095
I'm gonna hit the new gym.

249
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,486
Hey, babe. What's going on?

250
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,572
I'm just watching a video.

251
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,533
Wanna see it?

252
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:23,080
Idea: a video diary app.

253
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:26,834
One touch, device starts recording.
Tap again and it uploads directly to--

254
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,462
Still waiting.

255
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,130
Yeah, I'm almost done.

256
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:36,468
Your hour's almost up.
I'm only thinking of you.

257
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:44,184
Oh, God.

258
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,354
There will never be an app for this.

259
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,982
That was before we started dating.

260
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,653
You're wearing the shirt I gave you
for your birthday, asshole.

261
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,073
It was a hooker.
It's not cheating if you pay for it.

262
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:00,909
Oh, my God, you are a pig.

263
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:04,955
If I catch anything from you,
I'm gonna kill you.

264
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,207
How did you get that disc?

265
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,919
It was mailed to me anonymously,
probably by your hooker.

266
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:14,006
- What did you do, cancel her cheque?
- Dexter sent it.

267
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,217
Dexter? He broke into your apartment
and he stole your porno?

268
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:21,013
Yeah, and he just got me fired.
He's trying to ruin my life.

269
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:26,268
You are fucking crazy.
I don't ever wanna see you again.

270
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:30,731
Fuck!

271
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:44,578
Gym, huh? Lying little shit.

272
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:57,674
- Morgan.
- Ordered you a beer.

273
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,801
You knew I was following you.

274
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,763
I made it easy for you.

275
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,729
You lured me here.

276
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,356
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

277
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,274
Little attitude adjuster.

278
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,902
Think I'm gonna need
a little more adjusting.

279
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,613
What's this about?

280
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,743
- Do you remember this case?
- Yeah.

281
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,371
Ray Speltzer, he was guilty as fuck...

282
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,248
...probably of two murders
but we couldn't prove it.

283
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,334
I think he's getting ready
to do it again.

284
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,170
- What are you talking about?
- He shaved his head today.

285
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,801
His head had been recently shaved...

286
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:44,471
...when he was questioned
about Ann Feig's disappearance...

287
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,724
...and when he was arrested
for Nina Fleischer's murder.

288
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:51,103
I think it's part of his killing ritual.

289
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,148
I think he's hunting his next victim
right now.

290
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,651
How the fuck would you know that?

291
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,411
Christ on a fucking cracker, Dexter.

292
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,997
You got me here
to help you stalk Speltzer...

293
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:12,791
- ...so you could kill him?
- I don't need you to help me.

294
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,335
- I just need you to understand--
- Goddamn it.

295
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,838
- Deb, sit down.
- This is not what we agreed to.

296
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:21,258
- You fucking lied to me.
- Not here. Come on.

297
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,554
Get the fuck off.

298
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,183
Deb, I lured you here
because I thought...

299
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,519
...maybe if I let you in
on my process...

300
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,856
...you'd appreciate that there
is some value to what I do.

301
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:38,150
I don't believe this.
You want my approval?

302
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,695
I wanna continue
to be honest with you, Deb.

303
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,488
I have to be free to be who I am.

304
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:46,116
It is a capital of fence
to be who you are, Dexter.

305
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,618
I'm taking out the trash.

306
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,830
Trash that would otherwise
be left to putrefy.

307
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,042
I know I've said this,
but there is a legal system for that.

308
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,586
Speltzer got off.
That doesn't mean it doesn't work.

309
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,964
If it worked as well as you think it does,
I wouldn't be so busy.

310
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,884
Dad knew that.

311
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,219
Dad taught me that.

312
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,224
What is it about your personal law...

313
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:15,479
...that is so much better than the one
that the rest of us agree to live by?

314
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,231
- Sometimes it is.
- How?

315
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,569
Speltzer would have to murder somebody
for you to arrest him. I can stop him.

316
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:26,198
Are you trying to tell me that's why
you do this, so you can save lives?

317
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:30,160
End result is the same.
Some girl is gonna be dead soon...

318
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:34,372
- ...if I don't take Speltzer out.
- Based on what fucking evidence, Dexter?

319
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,624
A haircut?

320
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,043
Dexter, you can't kill people...

321
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,921
- ...you think might murder.
- That is not how I do things.

322
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,256
You can't prove
that he killed Nina Fleischer.

323
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,217
I will. I'm not done vetting him yet.

324
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,677
- Vetting?
- I am trying to tell you...

325
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:51,848
...that I will not kill Speltzer until
I am absolutely sure that he is guilty.

326
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:55,143
Oh, fuck. No. I...

327
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,645
This is done.

328
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:01,983
And nothing better happen
to that bald piece of shit over there.

329
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,911
I'm not done with Speltzer.

330
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:14,996
I've been out roaming free and I like it.

331
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,876
I just have to find the proof
that will convince Deb.

332
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,719
Speltzer went in that mausoleum
20 minutes ago.

333
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,101
Since when does a groundskeeper
keep the grounds...

334
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:40,397
...inside a private tomb?

335
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,998
Why is this mausoleum so special?

336
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:18,059
The last body interred here
was over 50 years ago.

337
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:21,813
If it was a friend of Speltzer's,
then Ray is holding up really well.

338
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,698
- Hey, Deb.
- Why aren't you at work?

339
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:33,950
- I'm kind of in the middle of--
- I need you.

340
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:36,953
Okay, okay. Yeah, I'll be right there.

341
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,748
- Now, Dexter.
- Bye.

342
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:52,135
What's up?

343
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:54,596
Fortunately, we set up
a secure cloud framework...

344
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,348
...that syncs up to the receivers.

345
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:58,892
You're able to reconstruct
the GPS tracking points?

346
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,810
Now get to the point, the bracelet.

347
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,355
Chip kept moving
after the girl was dead.

348
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,482
- Where?
- Viktor's apartment.

349
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,569
- And from there?
- Miami airport.

350
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,863
Then a marina.

351
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:17,035
Then eight miles out to sea,
where the signal stopped.

352
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:22,040
Maybe he took a boat offshore
to avoid the police...

353
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,377
- ...and then he threw the bracelet--
- He's dead.

354
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:28,171
He was dumped in the ocean
like a load of garbage.

355
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:33,051
Whoever killed him
left from this marina.

356
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,056
Can you pinpoint the exact slip?

357
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:39,891
I'll need some time.

358
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,230
It's worth the wait.

359
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,528
Okay, I'm here.

360
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,823
You don't have to fire me.

361
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,368
Tell me you weren't stalking
Ray Speltzer.

362
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,496
I was at the cemetery
where he works as a groundskeeper.

363
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:02,706
Goddamn it, Dexter.

364
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:07,085
He was lingering inside a mausoleum,
treating it like it was sacred ground.

365
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,087
I think he's hiding something
in there...

366
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:12,924
- ...something that may prove his guilt.
- "I think he may." That's not evidence.

367
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,219
I'd already have the evidence
if you hadn't ordered me back here.

368
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:19,723
But even without it,
I can tell Speltzer's gonna kill again.

369
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,726
An alarm is going off
inside my lizard brain.

370
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,061
Great, now my brother
has a lizard brain.

371
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,481
The amygdala. The most primitive part
of the brain that senses danger.

372
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,276
- Harry taught me to listen to mine.
- You'll excuse me...

373
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,737
...if I don't put my faith
in your amygdala.

374
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:38,033
But you already have, Deb,
dozens of times.

375
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,327
All the murderers
I've helped you catch...

376
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:43,204
...who got brought down
because of my hunches.

377
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,916
My lizard brain has been
your secret weapon all along.

378
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,127
You just didn't know it.

379
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:55,175
- You're fucking with my head.
- Don't take it on faith. I'll give you proof.

380
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:57,385
I'll go break into the mausoleum
right now.

381
00:27:57,552 --> 00:28:00,138
No. If you're right
and get the evidence illegally...

382
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,850
- ...then I can't use it in court.
- That doesn't make it any less true.

383
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:08,396
- Which is why you need to let me do it.
- No, we follow the law, remember?

384
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:09,773
I'll get a search warrant.

385
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:13,026
If evidence is there, I'll put him away
before he can hurt anyone.

386
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,111
You're not listening. There isn't time.

387
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,989
I just said that I will take care of this.

388
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:22,077
Do not fuck with me on this,
or I swear to God...

389
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:23,703
...I will take us both down.

390
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,415
Am I being clear this time?

391
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,501
- Yeah, that's pretty clear.
- Good.

392
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,920
Now I have a job for you.

393
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,506
I need you to go with Batista
to visit Hannah McKay.

394
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:37,926
- What?
- Randall's sidekick from his killing spree.

395
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,428
If we're gonna find those bodies,
we need her help.

396
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,430
That's the detective's job.
Why do I go?

397
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:45,600
I need her DNA. She was a minor
at the time of the crime...

398
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,977
...so she was able
to get her record expunged.

399
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,563
You're giving me work
to keep me away from Speltzer.

400
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,524
It's important we find those bodies.

401
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,610
And yes, I am trying to keep you
away from Speltzer.

402
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:00,490
- Dexter, ready to roll?
- Yeah.

403
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,161
We just gotta make a quick stop
on the way.

404
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,177
You piece of shit.

405
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,596
I know what you people
did to Tony Rush.

406
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,766
Excuse me.

407
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:31,271
You wanna talk to me?
How about we do it in my office?

408
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:49,122
You're making me nervous.
Why don't you sit down?

409
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,876
- I'm waiting for someone.
- Aren't we all?

410
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,753
Doesn't mean we can't enjoy ourselves
in the meantime.

411
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,089
Have a drink, or a lap dance...

412
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,800
...or festoon a thong
with neatly folded dollar bills.

413
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,093
Yeah, I'm fine.

414
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:06,764
So you're not interested in alcohol
or looking at naked women.

415
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,726
You may be in the wrong place.

416
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:13,062
I could say the same of you.
What brings you here?

417
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:18,359
- Me? I'm looking for something.
- Aren't we all?

418
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:24,282
- So we're both here just killing time.
- Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing.

419
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:26,659
Killing time.

420
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,373
Ironic, isn't it? We're both here
for a different reason...

421
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:35,877
...than these other leering cretins
and yet the net result is the same.

422
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,254
And what's that?

423
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,550
We're frustrated.

424
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,436
Let's go.

425
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:56,523
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

426
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,535
So Hannah McKay.

427
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,537
Were you around
for the spree killings?

428
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:13,164
I was still in uniform
but I remember it pretty well.

429
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:16,125
Hannah was, like, 15
when she ran off with Randall.

430
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:19,796
She wasn't in on the murders,
just a kid who fell for the wrong guy.

431
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,882
She testified against him
for a reduced sentence.

432
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,218
Did six years in juvie.

433
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:28,471
Since she got out, she's laid low.
Now she owns this nursery.

434
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,224
Sounds like she really managed
to change her life.

435
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:35,144
Yeah, I think I envy her.

436
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:37,772
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

437
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:39,816
Since Mike's death,
I've been thinking...

438
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:43,486
...maybe there's more to life.
I used to think murder police was it.

439
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:47,323
Maybe there's something else out there
for me. Something new and exciting.

440
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,659
And sometimes
there's nothing more exciting...

441
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,829
...than getting back
what you had and lost.

442
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:54,664
Can I help you?

443
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,501
- Ms. McKay?
- That's right.

444
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:02,714
Sergeant Batista, Miami Metro.

445
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,091
I'd like to talk to you
about Wayne Randall.

446
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,385
What a surprise.

447
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:10,096
He's the detective. What are you?

448
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:12,348
- Lab geek.
- This just gets better and better.

449
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:15,351
I'm sorry, I'm a sergeant
and this is Dexter Morgan.

450
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,645
He's a forensic analyst.

451
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:21,107
I've said everything I have to say
about Wayne Randall.

452
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:24,193
It was a long time ago
and I just wanna put it behind me.

453
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:27,030
Ma'am, this is very important.

454
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,532
Now, I could bring you
in to the station house...

455
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:32,160
...but I'd rather not put you out
if I don't have to.

456
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:35,747
Fine. But I have work to do.

457
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,505
So you know nothing
about these other people...

458
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:46,924
...that Wayne claimed to have killed
and buried?

459
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:50,303
- How is that possible?
- We weren't joined at the hip.

460
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,514
I don't know what he did
when I wasn't with him.

461
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,935
Careful. The leaves are sharp.

462
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:03,232
How do you stand this humidity?

463
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,777
If it bothered me,
I'd be growing cacti.

464
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,655
- Are we done?
- Not quite.

465
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:12,200
Wayne's mother recently
brought in a bag of mementos...

466
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,661
- ...from your time together.
- Lovely woman.

467
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:16,663
Mind taking a look at these photos...

468
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,123
...and letting me know
if you recognise anything?

469
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,167
Yes. Yes, I would mind, detective.

470
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:24,170
- Sergeant.
- Sergeant, I'm sorry.

471
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:27,590
Look, I feel terrible
about what happened back then.

472
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:33,680
It's something that I have to live with
for the rest of my life and I deserve that.

473
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:37,308
But the only way that
I have been able to survive...

474
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,102
...is to move on with my life.

475
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:42,772
What about the families of the victims?

476
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,316
Don't you think
they deserve some closure?

477
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:48,861
Absolutely, but they're not
gonna get it from me.

478
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,780
I've told you everything that I know.

479
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:55,493
Now I would appreciate it
if you would both just leave me alone.

480
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:58,454
Fine.

481
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,791
But before we go, my colleague
has to get a DNA sample...

482
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,793
- ...from you to exclude--
- I understand.

483
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:07,255
I understand more about police work
than I care to.

484
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,634
You wanna show me that court order
in your back pocket, Mr. Morgan?

485
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,811
Dexter's fine.

486
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,021
If I were you,
I'd stick with "Mr. Morgan."

487
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:26,649
Please be quick.

488
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,862
I Will.

489
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:38,202
If you don't mind, I'm gonna go
and crank up the AC in the car.

490
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,121
Nice to meet you, Ms. McKay.

491
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:47,962
All right, I'm just gonna
get a quick swab from your cheek.

492
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,338
This won't hurt.

493
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:52,842
But then you probably know that.

494
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:00,767
Shit.

495
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,351
You do this for a living?

496
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,147
Sorry.

497
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,751
Okay.

498
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:32,965
That should do it.

499
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,259
Thanks, Ms. McKay.

500
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,679
- Hannah.
- No, you were right.

501
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:41,974
I think we should keep things
on a last-name basis.

502
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:56,197
How would you like
to catch this fuck?

503
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:03,079
Ray Speltzer.

504
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:07,041
- I still lose sleep over this one.
- He's hiding something in a mausoleum...

505
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,669
...that might connect him
to Nina Fleischer's murder.

506
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:12,046
I can't get Judge Perez
to sign a warrant...

507
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:15,550
...so I need you to wet the wheels
a little bit.

508
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:17,969
What was your probable cause?

509
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,513
There's some circumstantial stuff.

510
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,140
It's thin...

511
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:25,768
...but basically,
Speltzer is setting off an alarm...

512
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:27,061
...in my lizard brain.

513
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:29,647
Interesting.

514
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,441
So you'll talk to Perez?

515
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,903
No, not on behalf of your lizard brain.

516
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:40,074
- I know it sounds fucked up.
- Look, Debra...

517
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,701
...I think you're a good cop.

518
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:44,412
If you think this is worth pursuing,
I trust you...

519
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,248
...but that's not gonna get you
a warrant.

520
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,458
Tried getting permission
from the family...

521
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,086
- ...who owns the mausoleum?
- I can't track them down.

522
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:57,091
- Stay on it. You'll find someone.
- If you knew there was a murderer...

523
00:36:57,258 --> 00:37:00,094
...and you could do something
to stop him before he killed...

524
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,805
...could you let it go?

525
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:07,435
We're the police, Debra.

526
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:09,812
We have to follow the law.

527
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:20,072
You could put a patrol car on Speltzer.

528
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,158
Watch him.

529
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:24,785
But I better not see it on the budget.

530
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:47,808
That one.

531
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,902
Nice boat, you arrogant asshole.

532
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,738
Too bad it won't be afloat too long.

533
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:03,866
Kiss my ass, you ginger freak.

534
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:06,410
Is this your boat?

535
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:10,373
Yeah, this is my boat.
That's why I'm on it.

536
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:14,669
Who are you?

537
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:18,297
Are you a cop
or some kind of security?

538
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:19,966
Who are you?

539
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:23,219
I don't have to tell you anything.
Show me a badge.

540
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:26,514
- Why did you kill Viktor?
- What? What are you talking about?

541
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:29,225
- Hey, just get the fuck out of here.
- I want answers.

542
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:31,435
I will call the cops--

543
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,734
I am gonna put your eyes out.

544
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:42,822
Now, the trick is,
to keep from drilling into your brain.

545
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,329
Look, look, I don't...

546
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:53,874
Look, I don't know anything.

547
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,919
Look, I didn't kill anyone. I swear.
This isn't even my boat.

548
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:00,548
Why did you say it was?

549
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:03,050
It belongs to this douchebag
named Dexter Morgan.

550
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:04,593
I hate this guy's guts.

551
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:06,637
I came down so I could sink his boat.

552
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:10,224
- Who is Dexter Morgan?
- Like I said, he's just a jerk...

553
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,977
...who works for Miami Metro Homicide.

554
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:21,360
Now, can I please go?

555
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:27,116
Yes.

556
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:33,372
Get rid of him.

557
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:17,124
- Morgan.
- Lieutenant. This is Officer Hewitt.

558
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,793
We followed Speltzer home.

559
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:21,003
There's been no activity
for over two hours.

560
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:24,215
Seems like he's in for the night.
We just got dispatched on a 211.

561
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:27,134
Can we take it?
Or do you want us to stay on Speltzer?

562
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:29,053
Negative on Speltzer. Take the 211.

563
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,847
- Copy that. Good night, lieutenant.
- Good night.

564
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,102
This is a waste of fucking manpower.

565
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,814
My father worked sometimes
three jobs to take care of us so...

566
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:43,109
...I decided the best way I could help
was to leave home...

567
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:46,112
...so he has one less mouth to feed.

568
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:50,116
He'd be so ashamed if he knew
what I do to make money.

569
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:53,869
Hey. You're not gonna be stripper
your whole life, right?

570
00:40:54,078 --> 00:40:56,872
No, I have big dreams.

571
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,626
I want to start my own
dog-walking business.

572
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:06,382
No matter what happens,
rich people will always be lazy...

573
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,717
...and they will always have dogs.

574
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:13,681
What's wrong?

575
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:17,101
I like you, Joey.
I don't want to lie to you.

576
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,813
About what?

577
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:25,943
My bosses at the club...

578
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:29,613
...they ordered me to get close to you...

579
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:33,492
...so I could find out
what the police know about...

580
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:36,453
...Viktor Baskov
and their business dealings.

581
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:38,622
So that's why you said yes
to the date?

582
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:41,542
No, I said yes before
they told me to do this.

583
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:46,755
- So then you do really like me?
- Yes.

584
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:49,466
But I'm scared.

585
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,428
These men are dangerous.

586
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,889
I can't go back to them with nothing.

587
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:56,182
Don't be scared.

588
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,601
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

589
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:03,189
Look...

590
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,862
...maybe there's a way
we could help each other out.

591
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:11,864
What do you mean?

592
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:15,201
Well, I could give you
enough information...

593
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:18,871
- ...to keep your bosses happy.
- What if the other cops find out?

594
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,539
They won't.

595
00:42:21,165 --> 00:42:25,211
And, in return, if you hear anything
around the club...

596
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:28,047
...about Mike Anderson's murder...

597
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,799
...you pass it along to me.

598
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:32,760
I can do that.

599
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:35,846
I'm still worried for you.

600
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:38,599
You should not get involved
with the Koshka Brotherhood.

601
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,935
Don't worry about me.

602
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:44,813
If I can protect you
and catch a cop killer...

603
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:47,858
...it's worth sticking my neck
out a little.

604
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,238
It is a nice neck.

605
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:28,148
Hey, Ray. I got off work early...

606
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:30,276
...thought I'd take you up
on your offer.

607
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:35,155
Well, you will not be disappointed.
I make the best mojito in Miami.

608
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:36,907
Awesome.

609
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:03,058
Looks like Speltzer's taken over
the family shrine.

610
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:07,479
Nina Fleischer's missing earring.

611
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:12,026
She didn't lose it in the struggle.
Speltzer took it as a trophy.

612
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:14,945
If I take it, he'll know I was here.

613
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:17,948
But I can still show it to Deb.

614
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:30,377
No cell service in a mausoleum.

615
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:38,052
Goddamn it.

616
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:43,599
This is Dexter. Leave a message.

617
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:45,684
Dex, it's me.
I just wanna let you know...

618
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:47,770
...I'm gonna be late
getting home tonight.

619
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:51,648
You've got me paranoid about Speltzer
so I'm gonna drive by his house...

620
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:54,068
...make sure he's tucked in
for the night.

621
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:57,237
Thank you for fucking up
my evening, bro.

622
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:07,289
So how long did you say
you've been here?

623
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:08,499
A few days.

624
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:12,252
I promise I'm going furniture
shopping this weekend.

625
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:14,963
I mean, you could have
at least taken the plastic off.

626
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:16,382
I'll get around to it.

627
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,384
Have a seat.

628
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,428
Okay.

629
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:30,270
- How about some music?
- Soon.

630
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,315
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

631
00:45:34,024 --> 00:45:35,943
I'll get us a drink.

632
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:09,977
- Ray.
- Yeah?

633
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:13,397
I gotta be honest with you.
This mojito sucks.

634
00:46:13,564 --> 00:46:16,150
There's, like, no alcohol in it.

635
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:18,819
Well, you have to be in control
of your faculties.

636
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,988
Otherwise, there's no challenge.

637
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:25,117
Well, you certainly are confident.

638
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:35,752
You look strong.

639
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:38,755
Thanks.

640
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:40,924
I guess.

641
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:48,932
I like it when they're strong.

642
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:54,438
What are you talking about?

643
00:46:57,524 --> 00:47:00,027
Let's play a game.

644
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:08,076
Night-night, fuckface.

645
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,860
Hey, Dex, it's me.
I just wanna let you know...

646
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:43,987
...I'm gonna be late
getting home tonight.

647
00:47:44,154 --> 00:47:47,407
You've got me paranoid about Speltzer.
Gonna cruise by, make sure...

648
00:47:47,616 --> 00:47:49,660
- Shit.
- ...he's tucked in for the night.

649
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:03,525
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

650
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:54,076
Freeze!

651
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:17,849
Oh, fuck!

652
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:40,706
- Deb.
- Motherfucker.

653
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:43,709
He has a girl in here.
We have to find her.

654
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:56,888
Beat the shit out of her.

655
00:50:57,097 --> 00:51:01,184
Speltzer took her earring as a trophy,
just like he did with Nina Fleischer.

656
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:03,395
I found hers at the mausoleum.

657
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:28,170
Put a BOLO out on Speltzer
but there's nothing yet.

658
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:30,380
House was a foreclosure
that he broke into...

659
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:32,924
...to set up his fucked-up maze.

660
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:36,261
We found burned plastic in the oven.

661
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:39,806
Explains why there weren't any prints
or DNA on the things we found.

662
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:43,310
I sent some unis
over to the mausoleum...

663
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,520
...and the door was open.

664
00:51:45,729 --> 00:51:48,690
Nina Fleischer's earring
was missing.

665
00:51:50,192 --> 00:51:52,235
I think he's in the wind.

666
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:57,240
Behind you.

667
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:05,141
Oh, you're up early.
The coffee is fresh, if you want.

668
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:10,397
You were right.

669
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:13,650
If I'd let you do things your way,
Speltzer would be dead.

670
00:53:13,817 --> 00:53:19,406
That girl would be alive.
But he's out there, free to kill again.

671
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:23,535
Well, you can't change
the way you think overnight.

672
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:25,787
I haven't.

673
00:53:26,872 --> 00:53:29,833
I mean, I have but I haven't.

674
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,087
I get it.

675
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:38,133
What you do. I hate it but I get it.

676
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:44,723
So you accept it?

677
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,398
I understand it.

678
00:53:53,607 --> 00:53:56,401
I understand that it might be...

679
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:00,196
Might be...

680
00:54:00,572 --> 00:54:02,240
...a necessary evil.

681
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:07,746
But what I don't understand
are the blood slides.

682
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:12,167
They're trophies.
They're like Speltzer's earrings.

683
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:15,420
- I'm nothing like Speltzer.
- But on some level, Dexter...

684
00:54:15,629 --> 00:54:18,048
...you like to kill.

685
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:23,303
I like the way it makes me feel.

686
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,639
Same thing.

687
00:54:26,348 --> 00:54:29,684
Deb, I can't change who I am.

688
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,438
I know.

689
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:37,025
And I can't change who I am.

690
00:54:38,026 --> 00:54:39,653
What are you saying?

691
00:54:39,861 --> 00:54:41,863
I don't know what I'm saying.

692
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:46,993
But I think you should move out.

693
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:49,621
I think you should move back
to your place.

694
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:55,543
Okay.

695
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:01,508
Deb...

696
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:06,388
...I'm still your brother.
Nothing's changed.

697
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:10,433
Everything's changed.

698
00:55:10,642 --> 00:55:14,020
I don't know
if it can ever be the same again.

699
00:55:24,531 --> 00:55:27,283
I'm finally out of my cage.

700
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:32,914
But freedom comes with a cost.
