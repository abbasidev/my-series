1
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:11,971
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,599
You really believe in nothing?

3
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:17,227
I suppose I believe in a certain set
of principles...

4
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:20,021
...so that I don't get into trouble.

5
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:23,191
- Like something I might teach a puppy.
- Is that so bad?

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,195
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

7
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:28,822
If I could have feelings...

8
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:31,950
...I'd have them for Deb,
she's the only person who loves me.

9
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:36,162
You've been the one
constantly good thing in my life.

10
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,583
- There's something inside.
- Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!

11
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,460
- So it's begun?
- Yes.

12
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:45,630
- It's begun.
- No!

13
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:48,800
Is this Doomsday?

14
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:51,136
I'm taking a lot of heat
on Doomsday.

15
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:52,554
Are we making any headway?

16
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:55,306
I'm about to interview my top pick
for detective.

17
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:58,685
So far, our Doomsday killer
has given us three tableaus...

18
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:02,230
...most likely referencing Revelation,
chapters eight through 10.

19
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:05,525
- I think I found a new lead.
- Who's this?

20
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:08,111
Latest and greatest intern
from my forensics class.

21
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,530
The game is about homicide...

22
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,783
...but in my game,
you can be the serial killer.

23
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:17,996
I think this is offensive.
Who would choose to be a serial killer?

24
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:23,376
Are you out of your mind?
You fucked a person of interest?

25
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:26,254
- Maybe you're jealous.
- This is a job of trust...

26
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:28,506
...and I can't have a partner
I can't trust.

27
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:31,426
I don't know how to act,
what to do, who to hire.

28
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:34,053
You're too smart to think
this was gonna be easy.

29
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,555
Did you really think...

30
00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:38,183
...Matthews made you Lieutenant
because you're ready?

31
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:40,226
It's all politics to get back at me.

32
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,520
Every time shit hits the fan,
I go to him.

33
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:43,772
He's your safe place.

34
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,108
You're making it sound like
I wanna be with him or something.

35
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:48,693
Well, do you?

36
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,530
You didn't really think you could foil
God's plan, did you?

37
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:57,160
- I have to stop him.
- What happened to saving him?

38
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,162
Travis' dark passenger
is a part of him.

39
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,915
He can't be saved from it
any more than I can from mine.

40
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:05,001
I think Travis is gonna kill again.

41
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,128
The eclipse is here, Travis.

42
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,423
This is not how it's supposed to be!

43
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:14,260
It is exactly as it should be.

44
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,350
Oh, God.

45
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:23,241
It's simple human nature
to keep little secrets about ourselves.

46
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,659
We all do it.

47
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,079
I dye my hair.

48
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:31,749
I watch internet pornography.

49
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,753
But what if your whole life
is a secret?

50
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:38,131
- A lie.
- How can I help you?

51
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:41,759
One economy class ticket, flight 449.

52
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:45,388
- To Budapest.
- Correct.

53
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,224
And exposing the truth
could destroy everything you are.

54
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,018
What do you do?

55
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:53,688
- Run?
- Oh, God.

56
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:01,195
- Get the fuck away from the body.
- Deb, it's me.

57
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:05,491
- Who's on the altar?
- Travis Marshall.

58
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,453
Dexter, what the fuck?

59
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,584
- Oh, shit.
- Talk to me.

60
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,378
Could you lower your gun?

61
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,423
Please?

62
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:31,142
I came to do one last forensics sweep
like you asked me to do...

63
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,187
...Travis was here.
He came at me with his sword.

64
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:36,105
I fought him off.

65
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,734
I knocked him out.

66
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,780
How did he end up
wrapped in plastic on the altar?

67
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:48,117
I snapped.

68
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:50,078
You Snapped?

69
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,039
What the fuck does that mean?

70
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,087
There's been a lot of anger inside me
since Rita died...

71
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:03,091
...and when I looked at Travis
and thought about everything he did...

72
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,345
...I wanted him dead, so I killed him.

73
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:14,477
That still doesn't explain
why he's wrapped up like that.

74
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,025
I didn't even think about it.

75
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:24,946
I'm a forensics expert.

76
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:28,241
I guess it's just second nature
not to leave a trace.

77
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,868
Jesus, Dex.

78
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,957
Why the fuck didn't you call me?

79
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:40,962
I wasn't exactly
in the best state of mind.

80
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:51,305
- Are you hurt?
- No.

81
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,809
Physically, I'm okay.

82
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:05,903
- Who are you calling?
- The station.

83
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,239
- I've gotta get everyone down here.
- No.

84
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:10,783
Please wait.

85
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,495
Why?

86
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:16,914
How does this look?

87
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:23,004
- Pretty fucking weird.
- Exactly.

88
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,339
An investigation
could complicate our lives...

89
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:28,718
...more than either of us
are prepared to deal with.

90
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:32,722
But it was self-defence.

91
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,729
Yeah.

92
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,865
But it's pretty fucking weird.

93
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,746
I have to call this in.

94
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,586
You had a moment
of temporary insanity.

95
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,964
We can fix this.

96
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:08,466
How?

97
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,387
I'll get you the best fucking lawyer
in the city.

98
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:18,017
Even if I'm lucky enough to get off
due to temporary insanity...

99
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:21,854
...they'll still put me in some
psych ward.

100
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,775
I'll lose my job, my career.

101
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,154
And probably even Harrison.

102
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,999
- So what then?
- Travis is dead.

103
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:48,422
- Yes.
- Nothing's gonna change that.

104
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:52,426
Maybe we should just get
rid of the body.

105
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:56,639
What?

106
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,600
I could put it in my car,
take it somewhere and dump it...

107
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:01,978
- ...where no one would ever find it.
- No.

108
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,438
- If I'm careful--
- No. Use your head.

109
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:08,401
If you get caught with the body,
everything's ten times worse.

110
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,903
We're not moving
the fucking body anywhere.

111
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:13,030
Okay.

112
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,710
We make it look like a suicide.

113
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,133
Frustrated the world didn't end
like he predicted...

114
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,845
...Travis committed ritual suicide
at the church altar...

115
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,681
...stabbing himself with his sword.

116
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:44,270
Maybe.

117
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,189
But not before first
setting the church on fire.

118
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,110
Fire...

119
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,821
...is biblical.

120
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,285
One last tableau.

121
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,163
And it'll erase any trace
that we were ever here.

122
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,831
How do we do that?

123
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,167
It would have to burn so fast.

124
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,378
Gasoline. There's a station nearby.

125
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,394
- I'll go get a couple of gallons.
- No, Deb, go home. I'll do it.

126
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:29,940
- I know what I'm doing.
- Bullshit.

127
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,452
Jesus, Debra.

128
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:46,999
He's a good doggy.

129
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,002
- Hey, Deb.
- His name is Banjo.

130
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:54,006
- Where did that dog come from?
- The Millikans' dog had a litter.

131
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:56,675
- I couldn't resist.
- No dogs in this house ever.

132
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,803
- But why?
Because.

133
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:02,264
- Harry, look how much Debra loves--
- End of discussion.

134
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:06,894
Dexter.

135
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,106
Don't even think about it.

136
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:16,404
I have to do whatever it takes
to keep Deb from the full truth.

137
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,490
I have to keep my secret safe.

138
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:32,211
Otherwise, my life, her life,
will never be the same.

139
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:10,541
Oh, fuck, Dexter, I don't know
if this was the right thing to do.

140
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,419
It's only a matter of time
before we get called back here.

141
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,796
- We have to go.
- Go where?

142
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,591
- Go home.
- I don't wanna be alone.

143
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,134
I don't want you to be alone.

144
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:23,762
Well, just follow me.
We can't stay here.

145
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,741
This is all wrong.

146
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,827
I should be on my boat right now
dumping the bags overboard.

147
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,038
I can't let this get away from me.

148
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:05,971
Morgan.

149
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,648
All right, everyone knows their jobs.

150
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,483
Let's do this.

151
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,787
The arson investigator said...

152
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,706
...the fire started somewhere
in the middle of the church.

153
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,376
The melted remains of a gas
can seem to confirm that.

154
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,003
I was also able to get
one fingerprint...

155
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,339
...that does give us
preliminary confirmation...

156
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,007
...that this is Travis Marshall.

157
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:45,553
Travis appears to have doused himself
in gasoline as well.

158
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,764
He then climbed up on the altar,
grabbed his sword at the hilt...

159
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:52,351
...and plunged it into his heart.

160
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,020
One final tableau.

161
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:03,487
- He died instantly.
- Please tell me he felt a little pain.

162
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:05,197
It makes sense.

163
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,950
World didn't end like he predicted
so he had to end his.

164
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,244
Good. Saves us the trouble
having to do it.

165
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,290
Cheer up, Lieutenant.
This is a big win.

166
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,376
Would have been better
to catch him alive.

167
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,719
Plastic.

168
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,931
After all he did? Fuck him.

169
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,183
Masuka. Masuka.

170
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,894
Is it possible to kill yourself
with a sword?

171
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,563
Oh, yeah, sure.

172
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,441
The ancient art of hara-kiri
has been well established...

173
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,818
...particularly amongst
my own ancestors...

174
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:45,362
...as a penance for
various embarrassing...

175
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:48,073
...and humiliating transgressions.

176
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:49,908
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

177
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,120
Miami has one less murderer
on the loose.

178
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:57,249
- Thank you.
- There's a large press gathering outside.

179
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,795
This is a good opportunity for you
to make a statement.

180
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:04,840
Still a lot to be done in here.

181
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,843
She's not as comfortable lying
to the world as I am.

182
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:12,056
It's okay, Lieutenant. You can go.
We're just wrapping things up.

183
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:15,267
- Go talk to them.
- Come on. I'll be right behind you.

184
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,478
I'll sneak out back.
If the press sees me...

185
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:21,857
...they'll only want to talk to me
and you're the hero this time.

186
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,870
But it's more heroic if you do it...

187
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,915
Hey.

188
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,359
Hey, you. Come here.

189
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,991
Would you make sure
this gets logged'? Thanks.

190
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:20,416
Even if I put Deb in the uncomfortable
position of lying for me...

191
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,585
...at least I've kept the bigger truth
from her.

192
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,213
It'll all be okay.

193
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,300
Oh, hey, Dexter.

194
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,681
- What are you doing here?
- Jamie's putting Harrison to bed.

195
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,349
I didn't wanna wake him.

196
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,604
You used my computer
without my permission?

197
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,315
I just wanted to check
the basketball scores.

198
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,526
- I thought it would be okay.
- It's not okay.

199
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:49,653
Okay, well, I'm really, really sorry.

200
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:53,991
I don't give a shit if you're sorry,
Louis. Never touch my things.

201
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:58,746
- Louis, here you are.
- Yeah, here he is.

202
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:02,207
What are you doing here?
This is Dexter's side of the apartment.

203
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,587
I didn't realise there were
different sides. I'm, like, super sorry.

204
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:12,009
- Is Harrison asleep?
- Yeah. He's out.

205
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,678
- You should go home.
- Okay.

206
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,133
Shit.

207
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,896
It'll all be okay.

208
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:27,042
You know, everyone acts
like Dexter's such a great guy...

209
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,087
...but he's really kind of
a pompous jerk, don't you think?

210
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,340
No.

211
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,008
Come on.

212
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,427
He's all like,
"Don't touch my shit, man."

213
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,472
- What a dick.
- Louis.

214
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:41,807
What is your problem?

215
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:47,437
Dexter's my boss, okay?
And he happens to be very good to me.

216
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,024
I still don't understand
why you were on his side.

217
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,361
Well, I told you.
I just wanted to get some water.

218
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,696
Right.

219
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:01,910
You know, the more I get to know you,
the weirder and weirder you get.

220
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,155
And we go live to this
Breaking News 9 special report.

221
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:43,201
I can only speculate but I think it's fair
to say that Travis Marshall felt...

222
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,496
...the intense pressure of Miami Metro
zeroing in on him...

223
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,374
...and that led to his decision
to commit suicide.

224
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,920
Lieutenant, are you ruling out
the possibility that this was a murder?

225
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,761
- Hey, Mike.
- Just had a thought.

226
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,763
Where was his car?

227
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,182
- Whose car?
- Travis Marshall's.

228
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:09,019
His car wasn't found at the scene,
so how'd he get to the church?

229
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,982
I'm guessing that a man that was
about to stab himself in the heart...

230
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:19,071
...with a sword probably wouldn't see
a long walk as a big deal.

231
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:23,158
Probably right, but still...

232
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,243
Sure. Yeah. You should check it out.

233
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:28,622
I Will.

234
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,168
First thing in the morning.
Good night, Lt.

235
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,311
- Need some help?
- No. No, thank you.

236
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:57,484
- It's okay. I can fix it.
- Relax. I'm a cop.

237
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,363
- Where's your lug wrench at?
- No!

238
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,764
How were you so perfectly
prepared to kill Travis?

239
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,558
- What do you mean?
- The plastic wrap?

240
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:13,894
You just happened to have
that with you?

241
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,689
I found it in the storeroom.

242
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,107
What about the knives?

243
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,985
You said Travis came at you
with a sword.

244
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:25,238
Where did you get the knives?
There was like a whole roll of them.

245
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,824
Travis had them with him.
They were his knives.

246
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,452
I don't know where he got them from.

247
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,497
You weren't in your regular
work clothes.

248
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,878
You changed.
You had a rubber apron.

249
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,965
Plastic sleeves.

250
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,057
I'm just trying to put this together.

251
00:23:56,937 --> 00:24:00,690
Deb, I'm sorry
I put you in this situation.

252
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:08,990
- You look pretty stressed.
- Yeah.

253
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:10,367
But...

254
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,078
You know, my job can get messy.

255
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,914
I always keep a change of clothes
in my car.

256
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:19,918
And the apron, all that other stuff,
is just part of my kit.

257
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,754
Every blood spatter guy's got them.

258
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:29,010
What about when you said,
"I know what I'm doing"?

259
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,723
When you tried to get me to go,
you said, "I know what I'm doing."

260
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,016
What did you mean?

261
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:37,602
I meant I work crime scenes
every day.

262
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,732
I know what people like me look for,
so I know what to cover up.

263
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,901
This doesn't feel right.

264
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:51,950
I know it doesn't.

265
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:05,797
Deb, I never meant to get you involved
in any of this.

266
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,096
But I am.

267
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,358
We gotta go to work.

268
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,917
What's wrong?

269
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,254
We had to give Banjo back.
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

270
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,174
I never should have gotten him
without talking to your dad.

271
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:53,261
- This is all my fault.
- I want Banjo back.

272
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,640
No. It's all my fault.

273
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,149
Deb.

274
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,610
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I admit it.

275
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,112
But other than saying I'm sorry
again and again...

276
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,240
...I don't know what else to say.

277
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,412
Morgan. What?

278
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,122
When?

279
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,000
Jesus, fuck.

280
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:26,670
That was Dispatch.
Mike's been shot.

281
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:28,338
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

282
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,674
- I'm right behind you.
- Now, Dex.

283
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,594
Deb, I gotta find my keys,
put my bag together.

284
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,430
I'll get Dispatch
to text me the address.

285
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,266
I'll be two minutes behind you.

286
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:54,614
My getaway pack.

287
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,371
I don't want to run.

288
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:06,251
But if Deb doesn't let up,
that may be my only option.

289
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:33,486
Mike Anderson. One of our own.

290
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:38,074
Whoever did this to Mike
is gonna be very sorry.

291
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,995
- He'll be very fucking dead.
- Hey.

292
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:46,082
We do everything by the book.
We're cops, not killers.

293
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:50,879
But being a killer would feel
so very good right about now.

294
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,717
She suffered blunt force trauma
to the head.

295
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:58,678
From something narrow
and cylindrical.

296
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:02,640
- Steel pipe? Tyre iron?
- Yeah, something like that.

297
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,769
The first blow was the left side
of the head...

298
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:10,899
...and then three more blows to the top
much harder. She...

299
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,734
Her skull was fractured...

300
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,362
...and she haemorrhaged,
as evidenced by the blood...

301
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,697
...that's trickling from her ear.

302
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,036
When will she believe me?

303
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:27,624
- What happens if she never does?
- When do you think she bought it?

304
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,669
Rigour has set in. She hasn't been
moved from this trunk...

305
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,797
...and judging from the lividity...

306
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,216
...and pooling on the right side
of her face...

307
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:41,679
- ...I'd say eight to twelve hours ago.
- Not long after we all left the church.

308
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,393
- Yeah.
- What a fucked up couple of days.

309
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,144
I couldn't agree with you more.

310
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,151
We're looking for one shooter
at a minimum.

311
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:58,780
The shooter hits this girl,
dumps her in the trunk, speeds off.

312
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:00,532
Gets a flat tyre.

313
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,327
He repays Mike's kindness by
shooting him and fleeing in Mike's car.

314
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:08,289
His car was found in an industrial park
near North West 52nd.

315
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:12,168
- I've got people there. Start canvassing.
- And here? Any witnesses?

316
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:14,170
None so far.

317
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,339
Maybe somebody saw something.

318
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,259
I'm on my way to talk to Mike's wife.

319
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,637
All of her family's in Chicago
and she's gonna need all our support.

320
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:23,930
Anything she needs.

321
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,391
Hopefully Dexter and I will win
the DNA lottery...

322
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,643
...because it looks
he wiped the car clean.

323
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:31,146
Nothing on prints, except for hers.

324
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:34,941
Well, judging by her attire
or lack of it, she was a stripper.

325
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,070
And on duty at the time of her death.

326
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,699
I've got an ID on the fingerprints.
A Kaja Soroka.

327
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,076
Same person this car's registered to.

328
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,036
We'll find out where she works.

329
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:51,666
The steering wheel, shifter,
door handles, seatbelt buckle...

330
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,168
...they're all wiped clean.

331
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:56,796
But there's always one place
they forget to clean: the turn signal.

332
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,374
- You're clear.
- Oh, fuck.

333
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,626
The road's clear.

334
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:38,796
Thank you.

335
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:46,221
Fuck.

336
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:17,794
Excuse me.

337
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,421
I need to see the files
on the Ice Truck Killer case.

338
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,174
- Row F-17.
- Thank you.

339
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:30,074
Kaja Soroka was a Ukrainian national
here on a work visa.

340
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:33,328
She worked at the Fox Hole
gentleman's club in Pinecrest.

341
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:37,081
The same owner is listed as having
five other strip clubs in Miami.

342
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,667
Looked into them with Narcotics.
Figured they were...

343
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:42,879
...using the places to launder money
but we never got anywhere.

344
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,464
Let's get somewhere now.

345
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,633
Quinn and I
is gonna take the Fox Hole.

346
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:50,094
The rest of you split up
the rest of the clubs. Let's go.

347
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:54,932
All the prints belong to Miss Soroka
except the one from the turn signal.

348
00:32:56,351 --> 00:33:01,481
But there aren't any matches
in Florida AFIS, FBI or DHS.

349
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,525
There's always Interpol.

350
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:17,789
I had this weird flashback
of being on Rudy's ta...

351
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,750
Brian's ta--
Whatever the fuck you wanna call him.

352
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,168
Your brother's table.

353
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:25,630
Sorry. That must have felt
not good for you.

354
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,173
It didn't.

355
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:33,346
But what bothers me about it
is that I was set up on that table...

356
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:37,266
...the same way Travis Marshall
was set up on the altar.

357
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:39,727
- Deb--
- I mean, how do you explain that?

358
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,857
I don't know, I was there too.

359
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:48,194
- I pulled you off that table.
- I was on that table.

360
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,571
I almost died on that table.

361
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,491
You would think that I would remember
every fucking detail.

362
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:57,495
But even I don't remember it
that clearly.

363
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:01,040
Dexter, you were somehow able to...

364
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:05,002
...perfectly duplicate
how he set everything up.

365
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,296
The same positioning.

366
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:10,425
The same amount of plastic wrap.
They are the same, Dexter.

367
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:14,053
They are exactly the same.

368
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:17,140
Because Brian was imitating me.

369
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,436
This is crazy, Deb. I know that.

370
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,479
It's crazy that I did what I did.

371
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:27,942
It's crazy that you just happened
to walk in and see me doing it.

372
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,862
I mean, what were you doing
in the church, anyway?

373
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,323
It was just...

374
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:41,956
I was just fucking checking to see
if everything was okay.

375
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,044
I'm sorry for all the questions.

376
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:52,675
I'm just-- Dexter, I'm trying
to make sense of this.

377
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,552
Deb, it's not gonna make sense.

378
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,694
- Did you find anything in the car?
- No, not yet.

379
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,375
Give up, Deb.
Give up and just leave this alone.

380
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,341
We have a match.

381
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,971
Viktor Baskov.

382
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:44,101
When you're losing control
of your entire life...

383
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,312
...it helps to focus on
what you're good at.

384
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:47,605
My little secret.

385
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:30,857
I shouldn't be doing a kill now.

386
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:38,865
The irony is that's the only way
I can maintain control...

387
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,200
...the only way I can keep this
from Deb.

388
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:46,247
Someone packed in a hurry.

389
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,125
Blood.

390
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,466
And gunshot residue.
Looks like you're our man, Viktor.

391
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:00,970
How careless were you, Viktor?

392
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:07,894
One first class one-way ticket to Kiev,
Ukraine leaving in less than two hours.

393
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:09,562
Very careless.

394
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,030
How can I help you?

395
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:22,658
One economy class ticket, flight 449.

396
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:26,120
- To Budapest.
- Correct.

397
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:30,207
That will be $1890, please,
Mr. Hartwell.

398
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,004
- Dog track.
- Lucky you.

399
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:37,506
Yeah, lucky me.

400
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:39,133
- You're all set.
- Thank you.

401
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:44,138
- Step through.
- Please wait.

402
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:48,392
- Wait, sir. What are these for?
- Diabetes.

403
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,645
I have a prescription
if you wanna see it.

404
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:53,522
Go ahead.

405
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:09,163
Hello, Viktor.

406
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:15,336
Right here, sweetheart.

407
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:26,597
- Kill the music.
- Good afternoon, everyone.

408
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:29,892
I'm Sergeant Batista
from Miami Metro Homicide.

409
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:35,523
We are investigating the suspected
homicide of one Kaja Soroka...

410
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:38,901
...as well as the homicide
of a Miami Metro police officer.

411
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,529
And no one is leaving
until they've been questioned.

412
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:44,073
Employees of the club
up against this wall.

413
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,950
The rest of you perverts, this wall.

414
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:48,828
- Is there a manager here?
- Yeah, I'm the manager.

415
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,496
- You heard him.
- Let's go.

416
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:53,749
- George Novikov.
- Oh, my God.

417
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:57,169
An employee and a pervert.
I don't know which wall you go to.

418
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,922
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, he was a low-level scumbag.

419
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:03,759
- Now I guess he's a mid-level scumbag.
- Nice to see you, Detective Quinn.

420
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:10,016
What can you tell me
about Miss Soroka?

421
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:12,184
Kaja wasn't the smartest girl
in the world.

422
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:13,602
No?

423
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:17,106
These girls come here from
little villages, still stinking of cow shit.

424
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,692
They think they're gonna land
some rich husband.

425
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:22,278
Hook up with the wrong guys,
end up over their heads.

426
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:25,948
- Is that what you think happened?
- I really have no idea what happened.

427
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:31,537
Look, I'm sorry Kaja's dead, you know?
She was a sweet kid.

428
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:34,206
And I'm sorry about
your police officer too.

429
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,208
Their deaths have nothing to do
with us.

430
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:39,962
We can start with you supplying me
with a list of all of your employees.

431
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:41,714
Sure.

432
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:44,633
Can I get a head count list
at the main bar'?

433
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:46,177
Something cold to drink?

434
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:49,013
- Your name, please?
- Foxy Raven.

435
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,310
All right. Is that the name
your mother gave you?

436
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:57,146
And maybe you could show me
some form of ID.

437
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:02,234
- I do not speak English.
- No, of course you don't.

438
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,862
One of our guys found blood
outside the door.

439
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:38,646
- Sir, I have your wheelchair.
- I don't need a wheelchair--

440
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:53,828
It never matters your destination.

441
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:58,624
The smart traveller must be prepared
to make last-minute adjustments.

442
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,730
- Lieutenant, you got a second?
- Yeah, what's up?

443
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:25,192
We shut down the strip club questioned
everyone, but didn't get shit.

444
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:28,612
We know she worked last night.
She signed in at 10, never signed out.

445
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:32,533
We found blood in the parking lot
which we believe belongs to Soroka.

446
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,827
With that,
we still haven't gotten anywhere.

447
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,537
- No one saw her leave?
- No.

448
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,789
No one remembers any customers
she might have talked to.

449
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:42,418
No one remembers seeing her car
in the parking lot. No one saw shit.

450
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:46,547
- She's a fucking ghost in a G-string.
- Bullshit. She walked out of a club...

451
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:48,674
...in the middle of her shift.
Someone saw.

452
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:51,468
These places are mobbed up,
Russian, Ukrainian crime.

453
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:54,054
Strippers who are brought in,
they know not to talk.

454
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:57,433
- How would you like us to proceed?
- Shut down every club...

455
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,226
...every night until someone talks.

456
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:01,312
We're on it.
I'm gonna need more coffee.

457
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,730
- Coffee truck?
- No.

458
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:05,733
I already got so much caffeine
in my head, I can barely think.

459
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:08,611
You know what, you're not gonna
get anything done tonight.

460
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:11,363
Just go home.

461
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:13,699
It's been a very long,
very fucked-up day.

462
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:17,328
I'm too worked up to sleep
but I could use a drink.

463
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:20,539
- Knock one back in Mike's honour?
- Lead the way.

464
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:22,625
- You coming, Lieutenant?
- Rain check.

465
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,127
- But slam a double for me.
- Sure.

466
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:26,462
- Good night.
- Night.

467
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,214
Good night.

468
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,846
- What's up, Lieutenant?
- Any progress?

469
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:39,934
We know our shooter
was wearing size ten Prada shoes.

470
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:42,686
Very pricey.
We know he was right-handed.

471
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:46,815
So that narrows it down
to about 800 million people.

472
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:48,609
- Dexter here?
- No.

473
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,445
I told him I'd work late
if he came in early.

474
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:59,495
Scotch and whatever my friend
is having.

475
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:00,871
I'll have a vodka.

476
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,165
Don't you mean Shirley Temple?

477
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:04,708
What, I can't toast to Mike?

478
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:11,966
- To Mike.
- To Mike.

479
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,681
What if your union rep sees?
Aren't you in some kind of programme?

480
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:20,015
I start next week.

481
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:22,518
Good. Sooner you address
your problem, the better.

482
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:25,145
- I'm tired of your shit.
- Still breaking my balls?

483
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:27,731
You lose one girlfriend
and the wheels come off.

484
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,025
- I'm a sensitive guy.
- I lost two wives...

485
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:31,860
...and countless girlfriends.

486
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:33,737
I managed to keep my shit together.

487
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:37,116
I wish my life was more like yours.
You're living the fucking dream.

488
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:40,869
Keep it up. I'll put in for that transfer.
I don't care what the union says.

489
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:44,873
- I'll make it happen.
- I thought you put in for my transfer.

490
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,876
Didn't quite get around to it.

491
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:50,921
So you were just fucking with me?
You didn't want me to leave.

492
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,174
- You were trying to get me to shape up.
- A lot of good that did.

493
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:57,344
- You still fucking love me.
- Fuck you.

494
00:43:57,553 --> 00:44:01,682
I try to help you and you go running
to your union rep like a little bitch.

495
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:03,559
That was weak.

496
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,811
- Well, actually--
- What?

497
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,149
I plan on talking with him
as soon as I find out who he is.

498
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:13,110
- What about this programme you're in?
- That's bullshit.

499
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:15,446
You know I don't have
a drinking problem.

500
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:17,948
Or maybe that's just me in denial.
Who knows?

501
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:21,285
- We may never get to the bottom of this.
- Just deal with your shit.

502
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:26,665
Mike was a hundred times better cop
than we'll ever be.

503
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,043
I'll drink to that.

504
00:44:41,055 --> 00:44:43,015
Hello, Viktor.

505
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:46,143
Where am I?

506
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:49,813
You're in a place
where things are forgotten.

507
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:56,403
Never to be used or seen
or touched again.

508
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:00,741
It seems fitting for a cop killer.

509
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:04,787
Not to dismiss Kaja Soroka.
She counts too.

510
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:08,582
- Who are you?
- Good question.

511
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:13,295
It all depends on who you ask.

512
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:16,173
Who sent you?

513
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:22,638
You should not fuck with me.
I have very dangerous friends.

514
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:25,516
If you knew how many times
I've heard that over the years.

515
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:29,395
What do you want? Money?
I can get you a lot of money.

516
00:45:29,603 --> 00:45:32,398
- I've heard that a lot too.
- Why are you doing this?

517
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:35,567
You want the long version?
That could take a couple of hours.

518
00:45:36,402 --> 00:45:37,486
Short version.

519
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:41,615
Because I have to.

520
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:44,451
Because I need control.

521
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:50,624
I'm trying to make things go back
to the way they were.

522
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:53,877
You're crazy.

523
00:45:54,086 --> 00:45:57,756
There's really no need
for name calling, Viktor.

524
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:06,723
Is there anything I can do
to keep you from killing me?

525
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,062
- No.
- Then get it over with.

526
00:46:15,149 --> 00:46:17,985
Normally, I don't take orders.

527
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,946
But in this case...

528
00:46:31,248 --> 00:46:33,250
How can I help you?

529
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,885
- This is Isaak.
- Viktor left on an evening flight.

530
00:46:43,093 --> 00:46:46,138
He arrives in Kiev
at 5:25 p.m. your time.

531
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:49,808
Good. What about
the dead police officer?

532
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:54,104
That's still a problem
but they don't have shit on us, so...

533
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:58,734
- I'll make it go away.
- Good.

534
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:14,249
Ridding the world of people like Viktor
is the one thing I'm good at.

535
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:17,044
When I'm stressed
near to the breaking point, like now...

536
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:19,171
...it centers me.

537
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:22,424
Maybe nothing has to change
with Deb.

538
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:04,258
Hello?

539
00:48:06,343 --> 00:48:10,472
- Hi, Jamie. ls Dexter there? It's Deb.
- No, he's working late.

540
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:14,518
- He's at work?
- Yeah.

541
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:18,146
He said with Mike's shooting and
everything, he might be there all night.

542
00:48:18,355 --> 00:48:20,065
Oh, yeah, right.

543
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,320
Does that happen a lot?

544
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:29,825
I mean, I know I should know his hours
and everything.

545
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,286
It's just that
I'm always juggling things, $0...

546
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:35,372
Oh, yeah, he works crazy hours.

547
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:40,002
Lots of nights till 3, 4 a.m.

548
00:48:41,712 --> 00:48:45,549
- All right. Okay, thanks.
- Want me to have him call you?

549
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,385
No.

550
00:48:49,136 --> 00:48:51,346
No, I'll see him at work tomorrow.

551
00:48:51,555 --> 00:48:54,266
- Okay.
- Good night.

552
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:20,834
- What's his name?
- Banjo.

553
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:23,837
- Are you okay?
- No.

554
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:26,673
Why did Daddy
take the real Banjo away?

555
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:30,218
- What did I do wrong?
- You didn't do anything.

556
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:32,512
It's me. It's my fault.

557
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:34,723
Why? What did you do?

558
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:42,356
Dexter's allergic to dogs, sweetie.
That's why we can't have them.

559
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:46,818
Sorry.

560
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:51,073
- What were you going to tell her?
- The truth.

561
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:52,616
What is the truth?

562
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:55,994
That you got rid of the dog
because you thought I might kill it.

563
00:49:56,203 --> 00:49:58,830
- But I wouldn't.
- I couldn't take that chance.

564
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,334
But what's more important
is that you mustn't ever...

565
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:05,128
...tell Debra the truth about yourself.

566
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:09,007
- Why?
- If you think she's upset now...

567
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:13,136
...that's nothing compared to how
she'd feel if she learned what you are.

568
00:50:13,345 --> 00:50:16,098
- She'd be terrified.
- But she loves me.

569
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:19,351
Dex, she loves
who she thinks you are.

570
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:22,729
If she ever saw the real you,
she'd never get over it.

571
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:26,274
Son, your mother and I
aren't gonna be around forever.

572
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:28,944
Someday Debra will be
all you have left.

573
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:31,363
You don't wanna lose her, do you?

574
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,287
My mistake was stepping outside
the code.

575
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:43,750
I should have killed Travis the instant
I met him rather than try to save him.

576
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:47,254
Compassion does not fit me.

577
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:18,285
- You're ready?
- Yes, I'm ready to join you.

578
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:21,955
But I can't. Not Deb.

579
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:29,921
No, you can't be a killer and a hero.

580
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:47,731
Vincent.

581
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,902
- You're working late.
- Yeah, well, lots to do.

582
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,237
Everyone's doing double shifts.

583
00:51:54,446 --> 00:51:57,657
I know you're working on Mike's case
and that's top priority.

584
00:51:57,866 --> 00:52:01,703
Wondering if anyone had a chance to go
through the evidence from the church.

585
00:52:01,912 --> 00:52:06,416
Sorry. It's all in those boxes over there
but I'm kind of swamped here.

586
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:07,918
Of course.

587
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:16,676
Hey, does our forensics team ever take
blood slides at crime scenes?

588
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:20,180
No. If any of the evidence
is transportable, we bag it.

589
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:23,391
Otherwise, if it's blood,
we absorb into cotton squares...

590
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,060
- ...then we bag it.
- I see.

591
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:28,480
Only one person who ever worked at
Miami Metro ever took blood slides.

592
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:30,899
- And that was?
- Sergeant Doakes.

593
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:34,945
And that was only because of his
side gig as the Bay Harbour Butcher.

594
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:42,202
Right. Of course, Sergeant Doakes.

595
00:52:43,912 --> 00:52:45,789
Thank you.

596
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:49,417
None of us want to be
fully revealed...

597
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:53,171
...all our faults and weaknesses
laid bare for the world to see.

598
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:57,425
All the more reason to make sure
I never again stray...

599
00:52:57,592 --> 00:53:00,011
...from what Harry taught me.

600
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:37,883
Did you kill all these people?

601
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:46,308
I did.

602
00:53:50,604 --> 00:53:51,646
Are you...

603
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:56,318
Are you a serial killer?

604
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,489
Yes.
