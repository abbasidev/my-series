1
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:11,429
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:14,641
LaGuerta found a blood slide
with Travis Marshall's blood on it...

3
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:15,975
...at the fucking church.

4
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:19,729
Talked her into letting me help with the
Bay Harbour Butcher investigation...

5
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:21,815
...so I can keep tabs
on what's happening.

6
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,441
You what?

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,445
That toy isn't bringing back memories
of being scared.

8
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:29,614
She was straddled by her assailant.

9
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:36,037
Wayne didn't kill that woman.
Well, it was someone smaller.

10
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:38,873
Stabbed the woman
until the knife got so bloody...

11
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:42,085
...her hand slipped along
the edge of the sharp blade...

12
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,045
...cutting her palm very deeply.

13
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,172
Everything you've said is a lie.

14
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,175
That's my story...

15
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:51,886
...and I'm sticking to it.

16
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:53,680
Did you get the blood report back?

17
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:56,182
From the bodies from the dig?

18
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:57,809
Yeah.

19
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,644
Anything I should know?

20
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:02,522
Nope.

21
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:04,315
Just forget about work.

22
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,777
Joey Quinn. Used to have
an understanding with him.

23
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:12,031
Leave a bag of cash in his car
and he'd do whatever we asked.

24
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,081
He drew his gun as the attacker fired.

25
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:25,003
This blood
is from a defensive wound.

26
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:31,259
So you got arrested, there'll be a trial,
you'll go to prison for a long time.

27
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,303
Does that mean this is over?

28
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:35,805
No.

29
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:38,386
Hannah McKay.
She stabbed a woman five times.

30
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:42,557
And since I found out, all I can think
about is giving her what she deserves.

31
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,767
Maybe she deserves a little slack.

32
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:47,478
When she killed that woman,
she was only 15.

33
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:51,566
Scared of Wayne. On the run.
It could have been a one-time thing.

34
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:56,154
I saw the way she touched
her trophies. Nostalgic.

35
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:59,198
And when you like to kill,
you don't just stop.

36
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,492
She must have killed again
since Wayne.

37
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,369
You have no evidence
to support that.

38
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:06,205
Her husband died
of a heart attack at 40.

39
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:08,291
Perfect health, no family history.

40
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:11,628
- Seems suspicious.
- You're really reaching here, Dexter.

41
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,880
I know she killed her husband.
I can feel it.

42
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,549
I just need proof.

43
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,509
Don't you have
more pressing concerns?

44
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:20,929
Debra, LaGuerta, Isaak.

45
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:23,097
Why do you think I need a kill
so badly?

46
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:31,731
- Where do you think you're going?
- To talk to her.

47
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,193
Get her to slip up about her husband.
Give me a lead.

48
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,779
What makes you think
she'll tell you anything?

49
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,448
Last time you saw her,
you accused her of murder.

50
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,368
Good point.

51
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,496
I need a peace offering.

52
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:50,625
And this is a big opportunity
for the department.

53
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,544
Arresting the head
of the Koshka Brotherhood is good.

54
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,213
Sorry I'm late.

55
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,760
I can't even be late
without making Deb angry.

56
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:02,470
You all did great work.

57
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:04,931
The arraignment went well.
Sirko was denied bail.

58
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,977
He has a small army of lawyers, and
they're putting his bail up for review.

59
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,228
No way he'll get out.

60
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:12,730
- Not on three counts of murder.
- Hope you're right.

61
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:16,484
So do I. As long as Isaak's behind bars,
I'll have time to deal with Hannah.

62
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:19,153
Of course he's right.
The guy killed three Colombians.

63
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,698
Plus, we have evidence
that puts Sirko at the scene.

64
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:23,157
None of that will matter...

65
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:26,077
- ...if his team claims self-defence.
- It's a solid case.

66
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:27,578
We still need to make sure...

67
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,623
...the captain is prepared
for any questions the DA may ask.

68
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,460
Look, we have all seen cases that we
thought were a sure thing go south.

69
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:37,755
The right lawyers, the right jury,
anything can happen.

70
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:40,550
Which is why the DA wants
to make sure it doesn't.

71
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,814
At least I can make a peace offering
to one woman in my life.

72
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,901
If I want Hannah to give me
the time of day...

73
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:01,154
...I need to show her I'm not a threat.

74
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,489
And how do you intend to do that?

75
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,659
I haven't filled out the blood report
for those bodies we dug up.

76
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,619
I could fudge it.
Omit some key facts.

77
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,916
Forget to run the blood on
the victim's dress for Hannah's DNA.

78
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,586
The cops think Wayne Randall
killed those people.

79
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:19,422
If I don't tell them otherwise,
they won't know different.

80
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:21,132
Didn't you promise your sister...

81
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:23,259
...you wouldn't take cases
from the police?

82
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:25,386
Hannah has immunity.

83
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:30,266
Nothing the cops can do.
Telling Deb will only make her crazy.

84
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,854
Then what? You think you'll just show
Hannah this report and she'll confess?

85
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:37,356
Tell you she killed her husband?

86
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,526
What other choice do I have?

87
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,794
You're blocking my view.

88
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,174
It's a wall.

89
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,802
To you, perhaps.

90
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:09,764
To me, it's a blank canvas.
A projection screen for the mind.

91
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:13,226
You killed three of our boys, smartass.

92
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:17,313
You're not gonna sound so smart
when you're bleeding like a stuck pig.

93
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:24,237
Right.

94
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:30,701
You and your Colombian friends
haven't really thought this through.

95
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,288
Now, as a businessman, I've found
you have to weigh short-term gains...

96
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,040
...against long-term consequences.

97
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,628
True, you and your men could retaliate.
In the short-term, I'd be dead.

98
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,089
But I'm not the only member
of the Koshkas.

99
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:48,136
I could have 100 men here should
anything happen to me, understand?

100
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:50,471
Yeah.

101
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:54,392
We outnumber you. We out gun you.

102
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,477
Quite frankly,
we're smarter than you.

103
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,565
So I'm afraid in the long-term...

104
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,608
...your plan falls a little short.

105
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:09,866
Now, the art of any deal
is negotiation.

106
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,784
Have we come to terms?

107
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,037
Yeah.

108
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:35,725
Hi, you've reached George Novikov.
Leave me a message.

109
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:40,605
George, it's Isaak. I need you
to pay me a visit. It's urgent.

110
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:52,325
Hannah should be on her way back
from the flower mart right about now.

111
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,702
I'll be able to catch her
before I go to work.

112
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:05,796
I've watched her for days.
She never changes her schedule.

113
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:30,613
Hannah.

114
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,699
Great, you're a stalker.

115
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,913
- What happened to Peter Cottontail?
- Poison.

116
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,083
Rabbits kill my plants, so I kill them.

117
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,252
You could just trap them
and let them go.

118
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,922
When you do that, they come back.
I do what I have to do.

119
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:52,218
Remind me to never show up
on your property uninvited.

120
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:54,303
Too late.

121
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:58,140
So you've accused me of murder,
animal cruelty.

122
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:02,395
- Anything else?
- Actually, I came to apologise.

123
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:08,901
It's a copy of the blood report
from the bodies you helped us find.

124
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,070
Wayne Randall's victims.

125
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:14,782
Wayne's victims, huh?

126
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:19,328
The blood evidence was inconclusive.
I realised it when I got back to my lab.

127
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:21,914
I shouldn't have accused you.
I'm really sorry.

128
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:24,250
Thanks.

129
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,254
It takes a real gentleman
to admit when he's wrong.

130
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,929
- What?
- You have a little...

131
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:41,559
Dirt.

132
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:46,647
Occupational hazard.
I can get pretty dirty.

133
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:48,566
Right.

134
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,778
Remember why you're here.
Dead husband.

135
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:56,032
Since I'm here, I could use
a plant for my apartment.

136
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,451
Really? A plant?

137
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,371
Follow me.

138
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:16,010
- Any idea what you're looking for?
- Just a plant. Something planty.

139
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,220
You're the expert.

140
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,307
Well, why don't you tell me
about your place?

141
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,059
So I can get a better idea.

142
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:28,522
It's a one bedroom on the water,
lots of sunlight.

143
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,983
- You live alone?
- Currently, yeah.

144
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,736
- You?
- Currently, yeah.

145
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,822
- And before?
- I was married for a little while.

146
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:40,284
Unfortunately, he passed away.

147
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,704
How about this one?

148
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,165
If you take good care of it,
it'll last for years.

149
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:49,418
Really? I always figured
once you took flowers home...

150
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,253
...they had already started to die.

151
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:53,881
- That's kind of a morbid outlook.
- Is it?

152
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:57,468
Yeah, I guess I'm kind of
maybe a morbid guy.

153
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,432
So how'd he die, your husband?

154
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,936
Heart attack, but we really don't need
to talk about it.

155
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:15,569
We can though if you want to.
I mean, I understand. My wife died too.

156
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,239
Oh, what happened?

157
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,241
She was murdered.

158
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:21,659
Oh, God, that's...

159
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,494
That's awful.

160
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,663
Yeah.

161
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:29,542
Different from your situation,
obviously.

162
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,585
Yeah.

163
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,380
All this doom and gloom.

164
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:37,341
You mind if we change the subject?

165
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,178
I do, actually. If her husband's
off-limits, I'll have to take another tack.

166
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:45,015
- So how long have you had this place?
- About a year.

167
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:47,143
Worked for the previous owner
before that.

168
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,603
Beverly Grey, amazing woman.

169
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,481
I've kept the business exactly the same
as when she ran it.

170
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,985
Same clients, same schedule.
I even kept her handyman on.

171
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:59,447
- Where is she now? Retired?
- She passed away about a year ago.

172
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,824
That's when I took over.

173
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,951
Dead husband, dead mentor.

174
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,580
It was actually a really sad time,
so I'd...

175
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,081
I'd rather not talk about it.

176
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:11,709
Sorry, I wasn't going
for more doom and gloom.

177
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,836
Seems you have a knack.

178
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:21,343
- I should get going. I gotta get to work.
- But you still haven't picked a plant.

179
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,097
That one.

180
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:28,767
Pink. Really?

181
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,772
What do I owe you?

182
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,401
Consider it a gift.

183
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,071
Thanks.

184
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,698
See you around.

185
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,994
Since Hannah stabbed her first victim,
two people close to her have died.

186
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:51,415
Seems I'm not the only one
with a knack for doom and gloom.

187
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,588
Beverly Grey. The deceased mentor
of Hannah McKay.

188
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,091
I paid a visit to the clerk of county.

189
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,512
Beverly's will listed Hannah
as her lone beneficiary.

190
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:09,350
Makes sense.
No children, no immediate family.

191
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:12,728
Why wouldn't Beverly
leave Hannah her legacy?

192
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:16,106
But if Hannah
were Beverly's heir apparent...

193
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,692
...it'd give her motive
for murder.

194
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:25,115
The question is,
is Hannah responsible for her death?

195
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:29,286
- Cause of death, heart attack.
- Just like her husband.

196
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,581
- Seems suspicious.
- Or not.

197
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,709
Heart disease is the leading cause
of death in this country.

198
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,878
Hell, it got me.

199
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:42,258
What about poison?
That's the way women usually kill.

200
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:47,096
- Safe. Detached.
- She poisons rabbits, Dexter.

201
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,431
It doesn't mean she poisons people.

202
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,685
Why are you so convinced
she's still a killer?

203
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,276
I know that face.

204
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,113
Sal Price.

205
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,617
Maybe he can tell me something
about Hannah I don't already know.

206
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,875
Hey, was that Sal Price?

207
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,461
- Yeah. What do you care?
- I read his book. I'm a fan.

208
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,255
Since when do you read true crime?

209
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,757
Since we started working
on the Wayne Randall case.

210
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,634
I'm learning new things about you.

211
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:27,511
What was Price doing here?

212
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,055
He heard we dug up more
Wayne Randall victims.

213
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:33,475
He wants to reissue his book.
He asked if he could see the case files.

214
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,728
- I said I'd have copies made.
- Shit.

215
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,230
The case is closed.
What's the big deal?

216
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,232
I fudged the blood report
for starters.

217
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:43,777
No, it's just... Was he leaving?
I wanna ask him to sign my book.

218
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,488
Went to the coffee truck
while I'm having copies made.

219
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,073
I'm sure he'd love to.

220
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:56,206
- Coffee.
- Mr. Price?

221
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,252
Hi. Dexter Morgan. I'm a big fan.

222
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,838
I was hoping
maybe I can get an autograph?

223
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,549
Yeah, sure. Of course.

224
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,384
Morgan.

225
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:11,138
- Any relation to the lieutenant?
- Yeah, she's my sister.

226
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:14,975
She says you're writing an update
on the new bodies. That's exciting.

227
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,144
Is she single?

228
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,480
Yeah, last time I checked.

229
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:23,609
Look, I should warn you, since we're
talking about a solved crime...

230
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:25,944
...I didn't put much time
into my blood report.

231
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,698
That's okay, I usually have my own guy
take a look. Just in case.

232
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,867
What are you hoping to find?

233
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:33,702
I have a little theory...

234
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,622
...that Hannah McKay deserves
her own sequel.

235
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,208
So does your sister date, or--?

236
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,293
You're writing a book
about Hannah McKay?

237
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,337
What are the highlights?

238
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:47,049
Come on, give me something.
Just a teaser for a fan.

239
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,638
Only if you put in a good word
for me with your sister.

240
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,431
Sure.

241
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,266
So? Hannah McKay?

242
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,686
Right, so get this.

243
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,481
Right out of juvie,
Hannah moves into a halfway house.

244
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,359
Seems like all's well
until she accuses some counsellor...

245
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,403
...of abusing her sexually.

246
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:10,823
- So, what happened?
- Nothing. Guy gets a slap on the wrist.

247
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,076
But a couple of weeks later,
he drops dead.

248
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,619
Rat poisoning.

249
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,539
Sound like a coincidence to you?

250
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:19,873
Wow, I don't know.

251
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,584
Three makes a pattern.
Maybe they all got in her way.

252
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:26,296
Well, that's all you're getting out of me.
You want the rest, read the book.

253
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:30,759
I'm gonna go check on those files.
Pleasure to meet you, Dexter Morgan.

254
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,974
I will read your book, Mr. Price.

255
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,643
But I won't be waiting
for it to come out in hard copy.

256
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,396
You are now officially
my favourite lieutenant.

257
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,399
Can I buy you an adult beverage
as a token of my appreciation?

258
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,568
Some place dark and not too loud?

259
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:48,861
That sounds like a date.

260
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,947
Not to me. it sounds
like a beautiful police lieutenant...

261
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,242
...sharing an evening
with a handsome crime writer.

262
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,119
Can I take a rain check?

263
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,496
- Sorry.
- Don't be. I get it.

264
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,165
Me coming here, asking you out.

265
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,167
You think I'm trying
to write your story.

266
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,294
- Which, I'm not by the way.
- My story?

267
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,212
Being engaged
to the Ice Truck Killer.

268
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,548
- I'm sure you got--
- That hadn't occurred to me.

269
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,341
- That what you're doing?
- I wasn't.

270
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,469
How do I know
that's not some tactic?

271
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,053
Are you always this defensive?

272
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:22,978
Sorry, I didn't mean to be defensive.
I'm just not really in a dating mode.

273
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:25,647
Dating mode. That's a thing.

274
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,525
My life is really fucking complicated.

275
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:32,738
Fine, but for the record,
I like complicated.

276
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:37,159
So if you happen
to change your mind, give me a call.

277
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,302
Oh, sorry, had garlic for lunch.

278
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,887
You have gum in here, yes?

279
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:00,808
What is that?

280
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,102
George left it in my car
the last time I was at the club.

281
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,479
Figured you knew about it.

282
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,232
Why would he do that?

283
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,611
He used to give me cash
to look the other way...

284
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,446
...when I worked Narcotics.

285
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,868
I thought you were joking
when you said you were a dirty cop.

286
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:23,539
I was joking. I'm a good cop.

287
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,625
- I also like money.
- Joey.

288
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,418
I know.

289
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:32,047
I figured George was gonna
ask me for something small...

290
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,675
...but now that lsaak's been arrested
I'm not sure...

291
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:38,470
...I wanna do whatever it is
they're gonna ask me to do.

292
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,222
You're sure you didn't know?

293
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:43,433
If I did, I would have told you
to give it back.

294
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:47,896
- You're giving this back, right?
- I'm thinking about it.

295
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,815
Joey, these are dangerous people.

296
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,109
You know,
there's like 10 grand in that bag.

297
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,696
What good is money if you're dead?

298
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,961
I'm not for sale.

299
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,381
Take care of yourself.

300
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:28,103
Price is going through my evidence
at the police station.

301
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,772
Turnaround is fair play.

302
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,827
Hopefully his thoughts about Hannah
are a little more organised.

303
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,840
Looks like Price and I
share an obsession.

304
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,469
But he's had years
to follow Hannah's every move.

305
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:02,971
I need to catch up.

306
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,986
Price's source material.

307
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,364
I'll have to come back to see what
he has on me.

308
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:23,200
Right now, I have to get in
and get out.

309
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,041
A blood test
for Hannah's mentor Beverly Grey.

310
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:36,421
Whatever it means,
I'll bet Price wrote about it.

311
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,609
Yeah, I'm good. Fine, fine.

312
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,320
- So have you heard from Louis?
- No.

313
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,364
Thank God.

314
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,158
I mean, hookers?

315
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,661
Gross. Who does that?

316
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,373
Yeah.

317
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,583
Gross.

318
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:16,503
So, what do you think of this place?

319
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:19,006
I guess it's cute.

320
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,299
Kind of a dive.

321
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,969
Because the owner's thinking
about selling...

322
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,721
...and I'm thinking about buying.

323
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,432
How are you gonna find
the time to run a restaurant...

324
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,183
...with all the hours you put in?

325
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,187
I could just retire.
I've put in my 20 years.

326
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,982
- So you're just gonna quit?
- Retire.

327
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,317
- Do something else?
- Yeah.

328
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:44,072
Look, Angel, you're my brother
and I love you.

329
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,992
But this is a big decision.

330
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,327
And we both know you're impulsive.

331
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,997
You get these crazy ideas,
like, you wanna buy a--

332
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,541
- I don't get--
- You do and then you end up divorced.

333
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:59,337
With a broken down Trans Am and
barely enough money to pay the rent.

334
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:12,601
I see you brought Jurg.

335
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:15,604
So good to see you both getting on
in my absence.

336
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,689
You kidding?
Since you've been arrested...

337
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,567
...can't take a shit without Lurch
breathing down my neck.

338
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,820
Well, someone has to keep an eye
on you while I'm in here.

339
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,366
So, what's the big emergency?

340
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,828
You need to get me out of here
as soon as humanly possible.

341
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:36,249
- What happened?
- Nothing. Yet.

342
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:40,003
But I'd really like
to avoid killing anyone in here.

343
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,799
It would get in the way
of my being released.

344
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,637
Have you heard
from Detective Quinn?

345
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,099
He...

346
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:53,433
He gave back the money.

347
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:59,147
Which is weird, because he's never
turned down a payoff before.

348
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,278
George.

349
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,573
Do not disappoint me.

350
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,221
Hi.

351
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,348
Quinn. Reservation for two.

352
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,142
Your other party's already arrived.

353
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,435
- Right this way, Mr. Quinn.
- Okay.

354
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,196
Enjoy your dinner.

355
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,744
What the fuck is this?
Where's Nadia?

356
00:24:57,873 --> 00:25:01,877
If you hurt her, I will put a bullet
through your motherfucking head.

357
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,504
Easy, detective. Don't make a scene.

358
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,425
Nadia is a valuable commodity.

359
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:12,053
We wouldn't do that.
Not unless we had to.

360
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:26,735
- What do you want from me?
- I don't want shit. But Isaak Sirko...

361
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:30,280
...he wants you to lose the blood
evidence linking him to the murders.

362
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,450
- Why the fuck would I do that for you?
- You took our money.

363
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:36,077
And I gave it back.
I don't owe you shit.

364
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:37,996
Not the way Isaak sees it.

365
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,249
Now, he did you a favour by taking out
those Colombian scumbags.

366
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,127
As soon as you let him go,
he'll head back to the Ukraine.

367
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:46,129
You'll never hear from him again.

368
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:48,673
- It's not that big a deal.
- Then find someone else.

369
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:52,177
Now, why would we do that
when we have you?

370
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:58,183
Joey, come on.
You know we got you.

371
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,313
What happens if I don't cooperate?

372
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:09,945
I'm thinking of transferring Nadia
to one of our sex clubs in Dubai.

373
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,197
But she's a strong girl.

374
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:15,075
She'll last a couple weeks
before she slits her wrists.

375
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:20,205
If I do this...

376
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,959
...Nadia's a free woman.

377
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:27,128
You give me her fucking passport,
understand?

378
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,339
Deal.

379
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:32,968
And I'll do you one better.
You can even keep the cash.

380
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,642
See, Joe? Just like old times.

381
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,371
It's Nadia. Leave a message.

382
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,833
Nadia, it's Joey.
Call me as soon as you get this.

383
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,633
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

384
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:19,681
- How was the meeting with the DA?
- Fine.

385
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,767
He's confident that we have
enough evidence to put Sirko away.

386
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,645
Thank the sweet fucking
baby Jesus.

387
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,981
That's not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

388
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:34,279
I had my last two interviews
yesterday.

389
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,364
With families
of the missing persons...

390
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:39,326
...who could have been victims
of the Bay Harbor Butcher?

391
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,036
And? Any leads?

392
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:42,704
Not a one.

393
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,040
It's frustrating.

394
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:48,293
So I started looking into open cases.

395
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:53,089
I figure a lot of homicide suspects
vanish into thin air.

396
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:56,134
What if the Butcher
took some of them out?

397
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,471
That's good thinking.

398
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:03,308
- Did you find anything?
- Maybe.

399
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,226
Remember the barrel girls?

400
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:09,064
A swamp full of blonds in barrels,
all of them...

401
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:12,692
...raped, electrocuted and embalmed?
Yeah, how could I forget it?

402
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:17,655
All five suspects, including
self-help guru Jordan Chase...

403
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,700
...went missing before we could build
a case against them.

404
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,578
You're thinking
the Butcher could have killed them.

405
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,458
- There were two vigilante killers.
- Maybe he took on an accomplice.

406
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:32,170
One of the victims
who was looking for justice.

407
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:36,549
I know it's a reach.

408
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:40,095
But it's possible.

409
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:44,849
Wasn't the theory that Jordan Chase
killed the accomplices...

410
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,559
- ...then fled the country?
- Yes.

411
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:50,688
But even if Chase killed
the other four suspects...

412
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:54,109
...the Butcher still could have
killed Chase.

413
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,201
I don't think so.

414
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:07,288
Jordan Chase was very high profile.

415
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,457
It would be too risky.

416
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,377
Still...

417
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,505
It's worth looking into.

418
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,024
Find what you're looking for?

419
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,695
It says here Price bribed
the funeral director to get access...

420
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,906
...to Beverly Grey's body
before she was cremated.

421
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:47,245
He stole a blood sample
and ran it for aconite.

422
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:48,788
Aconite?

423
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,582
The queen of all poisons.

424
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,336
Ingesting it causes a heart attack.

425
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:59,466
Price says it's been growing on
the greenhouse property for years.

426
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:02,719
Poison. You were right.

427
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,555
- Didn't show up on the autopsy?
- It wouldn't have.

428
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,057
Not if they didn't know
what they were looking for.

429
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,018
Her blood test.

430
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:15,732
Positive for aconite.
Proof that Beverly was poisoned.

431
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,985
But not proof
that Hannah did the poisoning.

432
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:22,697
Hannah said her handyman was there
when Beverly was still alive.

433
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,533
That could be worth a conversation.

434
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:32,874
Jesus, now she's showing up
where I live.

435
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:50,517
- What are you doing here?
- You picked the wrong plant.

436
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:53,269
I knew I could do better.
Hopefully you won't kill it.

437
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:57,148
- What is it?
- It's a spotted phalaenopsis.

438
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:00,026
See the red on the petals?
Remind you of anything?

439
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:03,488
- Blood spatter.
- Which reminded me of you.

440
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:06,866
You came all the way out here
just to bring me that?

441
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,370
- How did you find me?
- Google.

442
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:12,080
Now who's the stalker?

443
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,044
I should ask her to leave.

444
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,004
So you wanna come in?

445
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:24,175
Yeah, sure.
I'll help you find a place for it.

446
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:30,348
I need a spot near a window,
but not directly in front of it.

447
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:39,315
No, that's the bedroom.
No plants in here. Not enough light.

448
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:41,067
You could open the shades.

449
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,487
I like the dark.

450
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:46,030
So do I.

451
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:47,865
Why is she here?
What does she want?

452
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,002
There.

453
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,754
Now you can look at it
when you wake up...

454
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:04,090
...and when you go to bed.

455
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,555
Sorry, I gotta take this.

456
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,392
Hey, Deb. What's up?

457
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,186
Nothing, just that LaGuerta might have
another theory...

458
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:18,855
...that could royally fuck us.

459
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:21,816
- Can you meet me?
- I'm in the middle of something.

460
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:24,527
Dex, this can't wait.

461
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:27,655
All right, I'll meet you in 20.

462
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:37,957
I'm telling you, Dexter, LaGuerta's
not just gonna forget this one.

463
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,251
Jordan Chase is long gone.
So are the others.

464
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,337
There's nothing
to trace them back to me.

465
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,299
Are you sure about that?

466
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,011
There are no loose ends?

467
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,805
What about the person
you were working with?

468
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:56,934
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know what I'm talking about.

469
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:59,812
There were two vigilante killers,
not one.

470
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,316
Who was helping you?

471
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,737
She wasn't helping me.
I was helping her.

472
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:11,324
- Was she one of their victims?
- It doesn't matter.

473
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:15,161
If LaGuerta tracks her down,
which is next to impossible...

474
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,789
...she won't incriminate herself
or me.

475
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,833
- How do you know that?
- Trust me, I just do.

476
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:26,172
Motherfucker.

477
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:31,219
You were together.

478
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:34,389
Like a couple.

479
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:40,103
I remember having a thought...

480
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:43,731
...that whoever was doing this
was doing it for love.

481
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:47,860
That was right after Rita died.

482
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:53,366
You had that tenant
with that weird fucking name.

483
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,368
Lumen.

484
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,288
- It was her, wasn't it?
- It doesn't matter.

485
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:01,082
It was.

486
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,876
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.

487
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:07,171
You moved your girlfriend
into the house...

488
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,216
...where Trinity murdered your wife...

489
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:16,389
- ...so you could kill together?
- It wasn't like that.

490
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:19,100
I felt guilty
about what happened to Rita.

491
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:23,396
I thought
that maybe if I helped Lumen...

492
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:30,319
- I was trying to make things right.
- Of course.

493
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:33,573
By murdering five other people.

494
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:42,206
Why can't the past stay in the past?
Do we have to keep talking about this?

495
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,667
We do, as long as LaGuerta
has a bug up her ass.

496
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:48,588
Let me worry about LaGuerta, please!

497
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:52,216
You just worry about yourself.

498
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:57,972
Go out. Have fun.

499
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,099
Go on a date.

500
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,437
That guy, Sal Price. He was into you.

501
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:06,439
Get out of my house.

502
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,191
What did I say?

503
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:22,413
I really need to kill someone.

504
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:31,214
Hannah's become a real thorn
in my side.

505
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,762
Maybe her handyman can give me
what I need to finally fix my problem.

506
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,680
Excuse me.

507
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:40,890
Is Hannah here?

508
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:44,477
- She's at the flower market.
- Oh, man.

509
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:47,146
I drove all the way.
You know when she'll be back?

510
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:50,441
An hour or so. It might be sooner.

511
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,401
You could wait.

512
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,999
How long have you been
working here?

513
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:10,795
About 10 years.

514
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:12,922
So you knew the previous owner.

515
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,507
Beverly Grey?

516
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:16,592
Hannah said she passed away.

517
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:19,011
Heart disease. Sad story.

518
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,849
Yeah, Hannah said they were close.
It must have been hard on her.

519
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:27,186
I'm sure it was,
but she never let it show.

520
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:30,231
- Not the emotional type, huh?
- I never saw anything like it.

521
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,900
Even when Beverly got sick,
Hannah never complained.

522
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:34,986
Never asked for help.

523
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:37,738
Help with what?

524
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,532
Taking care of Beverly.

525
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,285
Hannah bathed her, fed her,
took her to the doctor's.

526
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:43,911
All alone?

527
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:46,289
She was stubborn, man.

528
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:50,126
I figured it had something to do
with growing up on a farm, you know?

529
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:53,379
Just ploughing through.
Look, I tried to help out.

530
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:56,382
Hannah dug her heels in.
Wouldn't let anybody near Beverly.

531
00:36:56,591 --> 00:37:00,511
Which means Hannah was the only one
who had the access to poison her.

532
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:09,896
Hey, Hannah mentioned a purple
wildflower that grows on the property.

533
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,898
Thought it would look great
in my place.

534
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,650
I'm thinking I could take a look
while I wait.

535
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:18,571
All the wildflowers are over
in the southwest corner.

536
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,634
Aconite.

537
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,428
Price is right. Yet again.

538
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:46,098
Beautiful and dangerous.
Just like Hannah.

539
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,897
She's harvested it.

540
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,775
Maybe she's set her sights
on a new target.

541
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,401
You're after her.

542
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,029
Who's to say she isn't after you?

543
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:01,614
But Why?

544
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:06,994
She doesn't think I'm a threat.
She accepted my apology.

545
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:08,287
Don't be naive, Dexter.

546
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:11,290
You think she's a killer
but not a liar?

547
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:12,875
Dexter?

548
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,128
What are you doing here?

549
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:18,798
I was in the neighbourhood.

550
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:22,843
Well, come on in.
I'll make some coffee.

551
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,608
Careful, it's hot.

552
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:43,406
And potentially deadly.

553
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,036
Hannah, I wish I had more time,
but I gotta get to work.

554
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,373
You know, I don't understand you,
Dexter.

555
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:55,334
I can't figure out what it is
that you really want.

556
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:58,087
- Nothing. I don't want anything.
- You want something.

557
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:01,340
- You keep making excuses to see me.
- They weren't excuses.

558
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:03,843
It's getting creepy
that you keep coming by.

559
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,803
Creepy? You came to my place too.

560
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:08,848
Why don't you just save us
both the trouble and spit it out?

561
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,891
I wanna take you out.

562
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,935
On a date?

563
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:16,814
- That'll work.
- Well, that's sweet.

564
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:20,067
But I don't date.

565
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:24,822
- I get too attached.
- Really?

566
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:28,284
- You don't strike me as the type.
- Well, I'm not who people think I am.

567
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:29,702
So who are you?

568
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:31,996
On the inside?

569
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:37,877
Probably still that 15-year-old girl
who ran away with Wayne Randall.

570
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:40,629
The girl who stabbed a woman
in cold blood.

571
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,882
Except now I know better.

572
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,301
What do you mean?

573
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:48,429
I mean, he promised me everything.

574
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:53,017
He was gonna take me to Disney
World and Santa's Holiday Adventure.

575
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:57,438
Some little Christmas-themed
shithole just outside of Miami.

576
00:39:57,897 --> 00:39:58,939
You know it?

577
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,573
It's the only place in Florida
where you can see the snow.

578
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,742
I was obsessed.

579
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:13,245
Then we were gonna live
in Argentina on a farm...

580
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:15,539
...and have this picture-perfect life.

581
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:17,416
Sounds pretty good to me.

582
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,960
Yeah, it was all I could think about.

583
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,421
I longed for it.

584
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,341
I needed it,
and I knew that until I had it...

585
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:27,968
...I would never be satisfied.

586
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:32,348
The craziest part is that somehow
I had myself convinced that Wayne...

587
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,642
...was the only one
who could give it to me.

588
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,435
Wayne? Really?

589
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:38,104
Why?

590
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:41,565
I had it in my head
that he was the answer.

591
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,737
That he was gonna fill
the emptiness that I felt inside.

592
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:51,534
So I didn't care when he turned
out to be the bad guy.

593
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,954
I didn't care if he shot somebody.

594
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:58,582
I didn't even care
if I ended up in juvie.

595
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,752
Not until later anyway.

596
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:05,214
It was worth it...

597
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,760
...just to hold on to the fantasy.

598
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:12,054
You still feel that way?

599
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:19,436
No, now I do whatever it takes
to make sure I don't lose myself...

600
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:21,313
...like that again.

601
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:26,735
But I do still wish
I had gotten to see the snow.

602
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,451
You know I'm not Wayne, right?

603
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,920
I'm not gonna land you in jail.

604
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:48,549
- I still think it's a bad idea.
- Why did you come to my apartment?

605
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:50,092
You know why.

606
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:51,677
Go out with me.

607
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:57,766
Come on,
I'm just gonna keep stalking you.

608
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:02,730
I'm just-- I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

609
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:04,899
Do the wrong thing.

610
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,153
Fine.

611
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:10,738
One date.

612
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:14,950
- But if I end up in jail--
- I'll pick you up at 8.

613
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:26,420
A date?

614
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:27,922
Really?

615
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,425
She caught me off guard.
I had to think of something.

616
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:42,102
Nadia, it's Joey. I stopped by the club
last night and you weren't there.

617
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,605
I know I've called 50 times.
I'm worried about you.

618
00:42:44,772 --> 00:42:48,108
Please call me back.
Let me know you're okay.

619
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:50,486
You got a sec?

620
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:53,405
- Not really, I--
- Do I seem impulsive to you?

621
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,741
Jamie says I make bad decisions.

622
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:59,536
But I have this opportunity,
and I'm thinking about retiring.

623
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:01,080
Holy shit.

624
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,082
- You're retiring?
- No, I didn't say that.

625
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:06,543
- I'm just considering my options.
- Can we talk later? I got shit to do.

626
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:11,090
Hey, you know Angel's thinking
about retiring?

627
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:12,424
Masuka.

628
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:13,801
Is that true?

629
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:16,303
I wanna buy a restaurant.

630
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:19,014
- Give us a minute?
- Yeah. For the record...

631
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:22,268
...studies show that men who retire
are usually dead in five years.

632
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:24,395
It's a fact. Look it up.

633
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:33,153
Where is this coming from?

634
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:39,118
Is this
about Mike Anderson's murder...

635
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:42,746
- ...because we've been through this.
- I think I'm burnt out, Deb.

636
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,457
I don't date.

637
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,502
I hardly see my kid.

638
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:52,089
I'm so focused on work
that I forgot to have a life.

639
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,050
And I know this may sound crazy...

640
00:43:55,259 --> 00:44:00,973
...but the idea of buying this restaurant
actually makes me happy.

641
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:07,771
Doesn't sound crazy at all.

642
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,725
Sal Price.

643
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:47,519
Sal, hey, it's Debra Morgan from--

644
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:50,105
Lieutenant Morgan
with the potty mouth.

645
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:51,607
Right, with the potty mouth.

646
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:54,902
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- Are you still up for that drink?

647
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:58,322
Yeah, absolutely.
But I thought you said--

648
00:44:58,489 --> 00:44:59,907
I think I need to get a life.

649
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,159
Yes, you do.

650
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:12,378
- Case number?
- Nine-eight-seven-six-zero.

651
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:15,005
That's the Dixon case.

652
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,096
I gotta testify in court next week.
Need a refresher on the evidence.

653
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:26,225
Dry section. Bin 51, shelf four.
Third one over.

654
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:28,352
Back and to the right.

655
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,608
- Case number?
- Case 16258.

656
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,362
It's Layva.
Should be two or three boxes.

657
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,323
It goes to arraignment next month.

658
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,456
Fuck me.

659
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:36,545
Oral fixation?

660
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:40,632
Sorry. Bad habit.

661
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:42,718
When I quit drinking,
I picked up smoking.

662
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:45,304
When I quit smoking,
I picked up chewing on things.

663
00:46:45,471 --> 00:46:47,764
Straws, pens, toothpicks.

664
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:50,142
Turns out I have a problem
with moderation.

665
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,936
Me too.
That and an obsessive personality.

666
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:57,524
Which is great for work,
but it's really shitty for relationships.

667
00:46:57,733 --> 00:47:00,068
Are we talking about me or you?

668
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,407
So, what are you working on right now?
You're updating your book, right?

669
00:47:05,574 --> 00:47:07,326
That and another project.

670
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:10,537
Which I probably
shouldn't tell you about.

671
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:12,331
Why? Is it a secret?

672
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:16,126
- Because trust me, I can keep a secret.
- I don't know.

673
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:19,880
You're the Lieutenant of Homicide, and
when I tell cops about my theories...

674
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:22,007
...they tell me to go fuck myself.

675
00:47:22,216 --> 00:47:24,801
That won't happen here, I promise.

676
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:28,555
Come on, don't be a cop-tease.

677
00:47:29,515 --> 00:47:32,893
A good theory
totally gives me a girl boner.

678
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,271
Okay.

679
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,524
Off the record.

680
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:41,652
You know that stuff in my book
about Hannah McKay...

681
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,487
...being this innocent young girl?

682
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:46,365
A victim
of Wayne Randall's influence?

683
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:49,535
- Yeah.
- Well, I think it's bogus.

684
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:54,248
I think Hannah killed her first victim
right along with Wayne.

685
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:56,416
And I think she kept right on killing.

686
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:57,751
Go fuck yourself.

687
00:47:59,378 --> 00:48:01,755
If that's true, we're fucked.
We gave her immunity.

688
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:03,048
It's true.

689
00:48:03,257 --> 00:48:06,343
I have evidence to back it up.
It's in my bag right now.

690
00:48:06,552 --> 00:48:07,844
Wait, you have it here?

691
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:10,514
- Why, do you wanna see it?
- You have to show it to me.

692
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:14,685
- I'm the Lieutenant of Homicide.
- Look at you. Like a dog with a bone.

693
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:19,189
If you show it to me,
I'll totally make outwith you.

694
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:24,903
Best first date ever.

695
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:28,574
Okay.

696
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:34,121
So these are the spatter photos
from the bodies you dug up.

697
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,541
I've seen those. Dexter said
the evidence was inconclusive.

698
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:39,126
My blood guy disagreed.

699
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:41,545
Well, there's no way.
My brother's never wrong.

700
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:44,423
My guy said the pattern
on this body indicates a killer...

701
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,717
...much smaller than Wayne Randall.

702
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,427
Smaller.

703
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:52,139
Smaller like Hannah McKay?

704
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,857
Fuck balls.

705
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,443
You gotta be kidding me.

706
00:49:26,757 --> 00:49:29,926
I thought this place
was closed for the season.

707
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:31,887
It is.

708
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:34,848
So how are we gonna get in?

709
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,727
How do you feel
about a little breaking and entering?

710
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:43,565
Yeah.

711
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:55,243
All of us have some kind of longing.

712
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:58,580
A need crying out to be met.

713
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:26,191
What is this place?

714
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:27,567
Wait.

715
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,869
Some of us get what we want
and we're happy.

716
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:40,038
The snow.

717
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:45,585
I thought maybe if you saw it,
you could finally get some peace.

718
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:51,258
Thank you.

719
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:53,802
Thank you.

720
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:05,147
But some of us are never satisfied.

721
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:36,261
When I said I wanted to take you out,
this is what I meant.

722
00:51:36,428 --> 00:51:38,722
You said you wanted to see the snow.

723
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:43,685
This is what keeps me up at night.

724
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:48,940
This is what I long for.

725
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:56,198
This is what I need to...

726
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:59,409
...fill my emptiness.

727
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:12,297
Do what you gotta do.

728
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:47,082
Dexter.
