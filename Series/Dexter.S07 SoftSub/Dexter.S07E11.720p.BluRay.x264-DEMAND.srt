1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,680
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:14,391
Our primary suspect
is Sergeant James Doakes.

3
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,852
- Doakes?
- If Doakes really wasn't...

4
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:22,440
...the Bay Harbour Butcher, best thing
to do is look into Doakes' final days.

5
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:26,486
We should start with the cabin
in the Everglades where Doakes died.

6
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,532
- I was renting the place to Jimenez.
- Jimenez?

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,703
He was one of the three men responsible
for killing Dexter Morgan's mother.

8
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:38,540
What if Dexter
is the real Bay Harbour Butcher?

9
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:41,501
If somebody's gonna talk to Dexter,
it's gonna be me.

10
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,421
All right,
tell your boyfriend who you belong to.

11
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:50,635
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Go. Go, now.

12
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:53,054
He died in my apartment.

13
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:56,599
Figured it would kick in while Price
was on the road. An auto accident.

14
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:59,477
- How'd you do it?
- Price liked to chew on his pens.

15
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:01,688
Last one had a little something on it.

16
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,565
She is a killer.

17
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:05,900
You will never be safe with her.

18
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:08,903
When Hannah got out of juvie...

19
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,948
...she killed a counsellor
at a halfway house.

20
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:13,408
She fed him rat poison.

21
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:17,704
Her roommate, a little gal
named Arlene Schram, saw her do it.

22
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:22,041
He won't be bothering you again.

23
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,501
I love you.

24
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:26,337
I think I love you too.

25
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:30,633
I need to find Arlene Schram.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,427
Sure. Who's that?

27
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:36,681
According to a message I got last night
from Hannah McKay's father...

28
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,600
...she's a witness to a murder.

29
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,591
I've never thought about the future.

30
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,346
About growing old.

31
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,443
Maybe because the future
has never been kind to people like me.

32
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,176
Or their loved ones.

33
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,928
Bye, Dad.

34
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:22,055
Bye, Harrison.

35
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:32,148
But, suddenly,
my future seems very possible.

36
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:43,076
And growing old
is not only a possibility...

37
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:46,579
...it seems appealing.

38
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,722
- Hello.
- Am I speaking with Dexter Morgan?

39
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,850
- Yeah, that's right.
- This is Department of Corrections.

40
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,353
Hector Estrada
is having a parole hearing.

41
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,480
- What? When?
- This morning at 10 a.m.

42
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,315
I know this is sudden.

43
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:17,110
Okay. Thank you for letting me know.

44
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,445
You're welcome, sir.

45
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:26,035
That was the Department of Corrections.
Hector Estrada is up for parole.

46
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,496
He thinks there's good chance
he'll get it.

47
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:29,956
Estrada?

48
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:33,418
Remember I told you about my mother
and how she died?

49
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:36,045
Oh, God.

50
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:39,382
Was he--?
Was he one of the men that killed her?

51
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,385
He was the leader.
He gave the order.

52
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,595
What about the others?

53
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:49,517
Dead.

54
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,438
Estrada is the last survivor.

55
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,942
I'm sure you'll have something to say
about that.

56
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:02,613
Look at it this way.

57
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:06,576
Maybe it's the universe
giving you a Christmas present.

58
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:10,997
No one but you
would see it that way.

59
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:19,922
Maybe killing Estrada
will close this chapter of my life...

60
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,926
...and open me up to a future
with Hannah.

61
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:28,056
Panel has reviewed
all the pertinent data in this matter.

62
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:31,726
We find that the prisoner
meets the requirements for parole...

63
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:36,481
...under the
Compassionate Release Statute 463.

64
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,984
Have you read the statute?
You understand your obligations?

65
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:43,780
I understand what's expected of me.

66
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,157
I won't screw up.

67
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,453
At this time, we invite any victims
present to enter a statement...

68
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:54,582
...either for or against
the board's decision.

69
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:57,210
I have no objection.

70
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:00,421
Nadia, it's me again.

71
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,381
This is my fifth message.

72
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,217
Just wanna know where you are.

73
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,802
Give me a call.

74
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,512
Did you get a bad news?

75
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,764
Just trying to find Nadia.

76
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,766
Hey. Taking a survey.

77
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,310
Secret Santa this year
or no Secret Santa?

78
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,729
I got enough presents to buy, man.

79
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,526
Man, the Christmas spirit around here
sucks big reindeer dicks.

80
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,277
Deb.

81
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,904
I found Arlene Schram.

82
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,405
Oh, fucking amazing.

83
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,366
She's living out in Hialeah.

84
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:32,120
Two drug arrests since juvie,
has two kids from different fathers.

85
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:37,708
Temporarily lost custody a year ago
due to her drug abuse.

86
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:41,254
Good to know. I'll have to go hard.
I might have to take away...

87
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:45,842
- ...her Mother of the Year trophy.
- Any luck in locating Hannah's father?

88
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,595
No, zero. He dropped the dime
on his daughter and then skipped town.

89
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,140
Well, he's a drifter.
He could be anywhere.

90
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:57,520
Maybe we should let your brother know
what we're doing.

91
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,857
- We're investigating his girlfriend.
- I told Dexter...

92
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,526
...that if I found anything on Hannah,
I'd act.

93
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:08,156
- I still don't feel right about this.
- And I'm telling you it's my call, okay?

94
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:12,952
Matthews made his choices.

95
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:16,080
Now he spends Christmas alone
with his boat.

96
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,207
How close was I to the same fate?

97
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:22,170
Oh, hand me one of those zip ties
on the table there, will you?

98
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,260
Thanks.

99
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:33,181
Fucking Christmas lights.

100
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:39,145
Every year I put them up, and
every year I wonder why I bothered.

101
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,189
You said you wanted to see me.

102
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:44,108
Yeah. Yeah, thanks for coming out.

103
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,694
Sit.

104
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,074
I wanted to give you a heads-up on this
idea that Captain LaGuerta has got.

105
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:53,659
What?

106
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:56,120
The Bay Harbour Butcher.

107
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:59,081
Maria's convinced
that Doakes was innocent...

108
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,126
...and that the real killer
is still at large.

109
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,840
Actually, she thinks it might be you.

110
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,510
Me?

111
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:15,932
I know. Personally, I think
she's had one too many Mosquitos...

112
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,434
...or whatever they call
that goddamn drink.

113
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:22,063
But, anyway, here we are.

114
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,107
What makes her think
I'm the Bay Harbour Butcher?

115
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,568
She knows your life story,
your childhood...

116
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:30,780
...what you saw
in that cargo container.

117
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:35,868
Most people,
that would screw them up for life.

118
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:41,207
Your brother went through the
same thing, look what happened to him.

119
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:46,254
He saw your mother dismembered
before his eyes...

120
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:50,007
...then he went on
to dismember his own victims.

121
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,221
Drink?

122
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,931
No.

123
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:01,102
The Bay Harbour Butcher
also dismembered his victims.

124
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,563
Of course,
your brother wasn't the Butcher.

125
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:08,317
The murders continued
after his death.

126
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:12,446
But it's weird, huh?

127
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,577
Another thing that's weird,
that cabin where Doakes died.

128
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,246
What about it?

129
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,207
Was rented to a man named Jimenez.

130
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,710
He's one of the men
who killed your mother.

131
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:29,714
I mean, what are the odds?

132
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,551
He's interrogating me.

133
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,764
You knew my father,
you've known me my whole life...

134
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,434
...do you think
I'm the Bay Harbour Butcher?

135
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,063
Of course not.

136
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:50,484
But if I don't ask these questions,
Maria will.

137
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:55,114
You know, I always had a bad feeling
about Doakes.

138
00:10:55,406 --> 00:11:00,619
He obviously didn't like me
too much...

139
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,580
...from the get-go.

140
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:05,624
Not exactly a secret.

141
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,252
But then
that whole Bay Harbour Butcher case...

142
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:11,339
...came along
and something happened...

143
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,966
...that I've never told anyone about.

144
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:17,219
- What?
- I saw Doakes on his boat.

145
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,305
Doakes had a boat?

146
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,556
Yeah.

147
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:24,352
I figured he used it
to dispose of his victims.

148
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:30,483
He kept it at the same marina as mine.
I moved my boat to get away from him.

149
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,193
Why didn't you come forward?

150
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,321
Because I didn't know
what he'd do to me or my sister.

151
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:40,201
Yeah.

152
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:44,246
Doakes was a pretty formidable guy.

153
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,082
Yeah.

154
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,251
I can imagine how scared
you must have been.

155
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:54,215
Sorry to put you through all this,
Dexter.

156
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,343
I'll talk to Maria...

157
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,470
...get her to move on.

158
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,264
No hard feelings?

159
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,683
None.

160
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:10,523
I've given them a boat to search for.

161
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:14,276
Now I just have to make sure
there's something for them to find.

162
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,113
Hey, don't splash your sister.

163
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,198
I'm not gonna tell you again.

164
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:22,868
Sorry, they are non-stop.

165
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,330
No, I have a nephew their age,
so I can relate.

166
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,709
Traded one vice for another.

167
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,547
At least they can't take your kids away
for tobacco.

168
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:38,050
First Christmas clean and sober,
and it won't be the last.

169
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:42,346
Knock on wood. Just wanna
keep looking forward, you know?

170
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:47,518
That's kind of why I'm here, Arlene,
to keep you looking forward.

171
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,646
To keep you out of jail, actually.

172
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:54,358
- Why would I be going to jail?
- As an accessory to murder.

173
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:59,155
He was a counsellor at a halfway house
where you resided 10 years ago.

174
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:02,491
Someone spiked his coffee
with rat poison.

175
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,286
- I don't have any idea.
- I'm not after you.

176
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,706
I'm after Hannah McKay.
She was your roommate at the time.

177
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,125
It was her idea,
but you had part in it.

178
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,419
You either helped or you kept quiet.

179
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,464
- What do you want'?
- I wanna know what happened.

180
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,508
In return, I'll promise immunity
from prosecution...

181
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:23,220
...keep you out of jail, make sure
your kids have their mother...

182
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:25,264
...to put presents under the tree.

183
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,437
I'd like some time
to think about this.

184
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,814
Okay, do that.

185
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,611
And play with your kids. Because
depending on what you decide...

186
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,989
...you might not get to do that
for a really long time.

187
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:43,991
Quiet now.

188
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,705
So turn this way now.

189
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:54,084
Do you remember the first and last time
Dad took us to see Santa?

190
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:57,671
You yanked his beard
and I asked for a gun.

191
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:03,427
Where the fuck are you, the North
Pole? You haven't said anything.

192
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,804
What is it?

193
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,681
You sure you wanna know?

194
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,683
Oh, Jesus.

195
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,519
Tell me.

196
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:15,022
LaGuerta is still looking
into the Bay Harbour Butcher.

197
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:16,941
Shit.

198
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,653
I talked to Matthews.
She's pulled him into the investigation.

199
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,989
- What?
- It gets worse.

200
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,659
They think it's me.

201
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,370
You weren't gonna fucking tell me?

202
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,914
Do they have anything?

203
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:34,667
I don't know.

204
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,547
I need to put them off this
once and for all.

205
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:41,382
How?

206
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,093
Give them proof
that Doakes was the Butcher.

207
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,345
It will mean planting evidence.

208
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,433
You can't do that,
not with those two on your case.

209
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,103
I'll just have to be very careful.

210
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:05,072
Now, were you a good boy?
So, what do you want for Christmas?

211
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:09,660
- Fuck it. It's too risky for you. I'll do it.
- Deb, no.

212
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,705
I'm not gonna let Harrison grow up
without a father.

213
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:16,000
I just want this to be the end
once and for all.

214
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,835
Hey, guys.

215
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,753
Hey.

216
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,551
Hey.

217
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:31,557
- Ready? Say "cheese," everyone.
- Cheese.

218
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:37,146
I'm sorry, I don't think Dexter Morgan
has anything to do...

219
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:40,774
- ...with the Bay Harbour Butcher.
- You're letting your feelings...

220
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,776
...completely cloud your judgment.

221
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:47,781
You're letting whatever you had with
Doakes make you blind to his guilt.

222
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,826
I've heard of people
fucking their brains out, but God.

223
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:56,081
- Well, that's low even for you, Tom.
- Look, let's just follow up on this boat.

224
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,126
Look, if James had owned a boat,
I would have known.

225
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:00,753
Well, call it a wild guess.

226
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,964
But if he was using it to dump victims
into the ocean...

227
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:07,217
...he would have tried
to keep its existence a secret.

228
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:23,317
I swear, I never told anyone
I saw you poison that man.

229
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,945
I don't get how that stanky detective
could know about it.

230
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,616
Must have been my dad.

231
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,785
Why would he do that?

232
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,955
He needed money and I wouldn't give it
to him. You know my dad.

233
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,208
Yeah, unfortunately.

234
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:45,756
I can't go to jail, Hannah.
Lose my kids again, I couldn't take it.

235
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,300
I'm not gonna let that happen.

236
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:53,180
Hey, look at me. When that counsellor
was putting his hands on us...

237
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:56,100
...and I shut him down for good,
you backed me up.

238
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:59,353
Always stuck together.

239
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:02,523
That's not gonna change now, is it?

240
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,487
But that detective's
gonna come back.

241
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:09,947
She's not gonna let up.

242
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,033
I'm gonna figure something out.

243
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:16,495
You just have to stay strong, okay?

244
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,918
Not this one.

245
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,757
This one looks like Doakes.

246
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,936
Did you have to get the biggest tree?

247
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:45,107
Well, anything smaller than this
looks like a Charlie Brown tree.

248
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:50,320
By the way, you still doing Christmas
day with Debra and Harrison?

249
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,364
Yeah. You can join us.

250
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,868
Not sure if Debra and me
in the same room...

251
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,120
...would be very Christmassy.

252
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,046
Okay.

253
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,633
Maybe we could start a new tradition.

254
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,011
Christmas Eve...

255
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,097
...this year and next year,
the year after that.

256
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:20,684
I like that,
except there is one problem.

257
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:24,354
- What?
- I haven't got you a Christmas present.

258
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,733
I don't really need anything.

259
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,651
Suit yourself.

260
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,615
Guess I'm just gonna have to go out
and buy you a pair of socks.

261
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,520
Hold up! Hey! Hey!

262
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,564
That's not the walk of a dying man.

263
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,608
I guess freedom
was the tonic he needed.

264
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:54,027
But I'll soon change that.

265
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,783
- Jenna.
- Hey, Quinn.

266
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,160
I'm looking for Nadia.
Know where she is?

267
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,788
Hey, pal, find your own.

268
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,999
Sorry, does your wife know
you're here?

269
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,543
No, so shut the fuck up.

270
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,169
Nadia's in Vegas.

271
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,423
- What are you talking about?
- She moved there to work.

272
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,925
Got a job in one of the casinos.

273
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,845
- When?
- Couple days ago.

274
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,973
She left you a note. It's in my locker.

275
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:26,018
- I probably shouldn't have read it.
- What did it say?

276
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,937
She's sorry,
but she needed a new start.

277
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,732
Staying here was too hard for her.

278
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,775
She was really broken up.

279
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,779
That all?

280
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:43,327
Oh, that you mean a lot to her and
she'll never forget what you did for her.

281
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,331
I'll be done in a few minutes
and I can go get it.

282
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,957
Thanks.

283
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,757
Last Christmas,
I was down in the Keys.

284
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,635
This Christmas, your garage.

285
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:04,014
- No one's forcing you to be here, Tom.
- Oh, I'm too afraid to leave you alone.

286
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:08,101
You might decide I'm the
Bay Harbour Butcher and haul me in.

287
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,064
- What is it?
- Come here. Take a look.

288
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,734
It's a tackle box.

289
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,624
These are deep-sea fishing lures.

290
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,668
Meaning?

291
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:36,129
Meaning they're the kind you need
a boat to use.

292
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,408
Jeez, what a mess.

293
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,494
Well, it's been empty for years.

294
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:11,540
Doakes probably scrapped his boat
once we were closing in on him.

295
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:16,712
We don't know Doakes used this place.
You're jumping to conclusions.

296
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:21,425
This address came
from the tackle box...

297
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:25,637
...which came from the cabin
where Doakes died.

298
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,015
This isn't jumping to a conclusion.

299
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,308
This conclusion's hanging
from your ass.

300
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:53,749
- That private forensics team of yours?
- Yeah, what about them?

301
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,834
Get them out here.

302
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,550
I think we just struck oil.

303
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:13,018
The blood's too degraded to analyse,
but we found one print on the hilt.

304
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,895
It's a match for James Doakes.

305
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,649
You're certain?

306
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:21,902
No question, captain.

307
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,613
Well, that sews it up.

308
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,364
Tom.

309
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:32,079
This evidence
could have been planted.

310
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,540
Dexter is a forensics expert...

311
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,502
- ...and he has the skills--
- Maria, it's over.

312
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,046
The fat lady isn't singing,
her song is done.

313
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,423
She's getting humped
in her dressing room.

314
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,050
Jesus Christ, Tom.

315
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,595
What is wrong with you?

316
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,681
Maria, why can't you let this go?

317
00:23:56,853 --> 00:24:01,066
I guess because I feel I owe it to James
to clear his name.

318
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:05,070
Why?
Because you two were a couple?

319
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,823
Because he was innocent.

320
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:11,076
You're not an investigator, Maria.

321
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,913
Your talent's in playing the game,
and you play a great one.

322
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,207
Hell, you beat me.

323
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,960
But either way...

324
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:22,087
...I'm done here.

325
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,215
Now, I expect you to live up
to your end of the bargain.

326
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:29,052
Forty-year pay scale on my pension.

327
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,056
I remember, Tom.

328
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,685
Don't worry,
you'll get what's coming to you.

329
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:37,936
I expect to.

330
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,150
Feliz Navidad, Mafia.

331
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,375
What the hell are you doing here?

332
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,377
Don't tell me we're neighbours.

333
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,672
I'm not here to fight with you
or trade insults.

334
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:09,426
That's a good thing,
you probably wouldn't last one round.

335
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,889
I came here to talk to you
about Dexter.

336
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,933
Dexter?

337
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:20,020
If you care about him,
listen to what I have to say.

338
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,939
Just hear me out, that's all I ask.

339
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:24,900
I'm all ears.

340
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,651
Dexter is happy..-

341
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,321
...and I know him well enough
to understand...

342
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:32,115
...that this is a pretty big deal.

343
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:37,204
He's been through a lot of trouble
and a lot of pain.

344
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:41,458
- I can't deny that.
- I think for the first time...

345
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:45,754
...in really a long time, he's actually
looking forward to the future.

346
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,965
He talks about it.

347
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:53,345
About me and him together.

348
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,934
And I think that Dexter
could be a whole lot happier...

349
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:02,395
...if he knew that you and I
could find some common ground.

350
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,941
- For Dexter's sake.
- Yeah.

351
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:17,035
He really does seem
to like having you around.

352
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:20,038
I love him.

353
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,667
- And I know that you do too.
- Yeah, you bet I do.

354
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,086
Can't we work out our issues?

355
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,926
I think we can.

356
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,435
It's because I love Dexter...

357
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:47,023
...that I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to protect him from you.

358
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,820
I'm not gonna give up until your
murdering ass is behind bars for good.

359
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,948
That's how we're gonna work out
our issues.

360
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,783
But, hey...

361
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:00,078
...thanks for stopping by.

362
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,332
Okay.

363
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,512
Son of a bitch.

364
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:18,805
You got a dead one.

365
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,267
Yeah.

366
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:26,896
Well, it's gonna have to stay dead.
There's only so much a man can do.

367
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:30,317
- What brings you around?
- Merry Christmas.

368
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:34,821
- I noticed you were on empty.
- Thanks.

369
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,659
I was thinking
about the last conversation we had.

370
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,411
I owe you an apology.

371
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:45,081
I should have come forward
with my suspicion about Doakes.

372
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,752
- More people would be alive.
- If anyone should apologise, it's me.

373
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,045
I was stupid.

374
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:54,507
I should never have entertained Maria's
theory about you being the Butcher.

375
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:58,428
- You think she'll ever accept the truth?
- She already has.

376
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:01,973
- We found Doakes' boathouse.
- Really?

377
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:05,977
What's even more amazing
is what we found hidden inside it.

378
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:11,066
I won't go into details, except to say
it leaves no doubt as to Doakes' guilt.

379
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,694
Believe me, you won't have to worry
about LaGuerta anymore.

380
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:21,868
Well, I gotta say, that's about the best
Christmas present I could've imagined.

381
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,829
You and me both.
Have a good Christmas with your boy.

382
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,374
We Will.

383
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:32,045
Christmas just got a lot less merry
for Hector Estrada.

384
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:35,673
My late lamented Dark Passenger
would be very pleased.

385
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:38,593
If I can break this last strand
from my past...

386
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,929
...do I get the future I want?

387
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,432
- Yeah.
- I went to see Matthews again.

388
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:47,018
They're calling off the investigation.

389
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:48,895
You sure?

390
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,731
Yeah. They bought it. Everything.

391
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,484
Well, let's hope they stay bought.

392
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,569
Thanks, Deb.

393
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:08,540
- You're Hector Estrada?
- I know you?

394
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,543
You do now. Steve Gaskill.

395
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,671
Come on, man. You're a legend.

396
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:18,091
You're gonna be a stain if you
don't crawl to where you came from.

397
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,719
I know I'm way out of line.
I gotta tell you about my situation.

398
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:24,931
I have this contact in Honduras,
an old Army buddy.

399
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,976
He sends me a crate of sativa
every other month.

400
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:31,896
I've been trying to lay it off. You know,
college campuses and whatnot.

401
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:35,024
But it keeps piling up.
It's too much for me to move.

402
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:38,903
- How much are we talking about?
- Enough to make you shit your pants.

403
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:42,115
I've been trying to find a way
into the Hispanic market.

404
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:45,118
- Here you are. It's Kismet.
- Kiss who?

405
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:49,038
It's good luck for both of us.

406
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:51,249
I can show you the stuff.

407
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,461
If you're interested,
maybe we can work something out.

408
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,754
Let me hear you say
you're not a cop.

409
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,840
I'm not a cop, man.

410
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,135
Jeez, we know a lot of the same people.
Tuerto, Pepe Chap.

411
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:05,472
- I've sold plenty of shit to them.
- Fuck.

412
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,766
Long time since I've dealt
with those guys.

413
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,773
- Where and when?
- Thirty-five Quayside Road. Tonight.

414
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:19,736
Ten o'clock. Unless you got something
else to do on Christmas Eve.

415
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:22,489
I'll see you then.

416
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:29,454
- Yep.
- Dex, it's Angel.

417
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:32,749
Debra's at St. Joseph's.
She's been in a car accident.

418
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,834
I'll meet you at the hospital.

419
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:44,093
Did you fill out all the questions?

420
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,764
- Dex.
- How is she?

421
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:49,599
She's fine.

422
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:53,436
Her wrist is broken, lots of bruising,
but she'll be out by tomorrow.

423
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:54,687
What happened?

424
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:57,899
Apparently, she blacked out
or something behind the wheel.

425
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:02,070
Does Debra have a prescription
for anti-anxiety medication?

426
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,656
Not that there's a problem.
Most people do.

427
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,616
Yeah, she does. Why?

428
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,452
Doctor said there was a lot of that
in her system.

429
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:12,205
Almost three times the normal dose.

430
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,582
Maybe she lost track
on how much she took.

431
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,918
You know, it happens.

432
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:20,088
Well, why is she here in Hialeah?

433
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:21,881
Where was she going?

434
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,843
Debra drove here for an interview.

435
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:28,513
A second interview with a woman,
Arlene Schram.

436
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,892
Now, look, Dex, maybe I should've
told you this before now...

437
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:35,436
...but Deb got a tip...

438
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:40,900
...that this woman, Arlene Schram,
was a possible witness to a murder.

439
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:44,112
A murder committed
by Hannah McKay.

440
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,489
You should've told me.

441
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,908
Debra has a bug up her ass
with this girl.

442
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:52,870
Maybe that's why she took
all those anti-anxiety pills.

443
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,833
Because she's convinced
that her brother is dating a killer.

444
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,213
I don't know what happened.

445
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,466
I was tired. I was driving.

446
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,969
I kept getting sleepier.

447
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:13,016
And, I don't know, I must have
closed my eyes for a second.

448
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:17,270
- But the next thing I knew, I was--
- Hanging upside down in a ditch.

449
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:20,315
Hanging by my seat belt.

450
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:24,360
This is the most fucked-est
Christmas ever.

451
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:27,405
And you were gonna spend it
with Arlene Schram.

452
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,367
Hannah told you?

453
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:34,203
Hannah knew?

454
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:36,914
She was at my house yesterday...

455
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,250
...asking me to back off.

456
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,503
Arlene must've called
after I left her house.

457
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,797
Hannah was at your house
yesterday?

458
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:47,842
Yes.

459
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:54,098
And now I'm here.

460
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,936
- Fucking hell, Dexter. It's like--
- She didn't poison you.

461
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,440
Well, I sure as shit didn't swallow
a handful of pills.

462
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:07,028
The doctor said that it's possible
the drugs built up in your system.

463
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:09,739
I took one.

464
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,868
One. Last night.

465
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:17,038
That drug has a short half-life.

466
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:21,959
Gotta hand it to her.
That's a really good plan.

467
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:27,173
Making it look I accidentally took
too much of a prescription that I have?

468
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:28,883
It's not a hard drug to get.

469
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:32,512
- How would she know you were on it?
- You must have mentioned it.

470
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,889
I never did. No.

471
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:38,017
That's the thing about people
that poison people.

472
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:40,061
They're really fucking sneaky.

473
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:45,608
So she what, poisoned you
while she was at your house last night?

474
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:48,111
I didn't let her inside my house
last night.

475
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,570
- Deb--
- I went for a run.

476
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:52,573
Maybe she broke in after I left
or something.

477
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:55,702
She broke into your house
and did what?

478
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,792
- I don't know how she did it.
- Because she didn't.

479
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,128
Fuck, this is what happened
to Sal Price.

480
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:08,631
He got close to knowing the truth
about Hannah, she killed him.

481
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,050
There's no proof
she killed Sal Price...

482
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:13,553
...and no proof
that she poisoned you.

483
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,264
Well, maybe we need
to find the proof.

484
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:25,314
There's another explanation
for what happened.

485
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:28,359
You took more of those pills
than you think you did.

486
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,570
You've been under a lot of stress,
Deb.

487
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:34,031
No shit, Sherlock.

488
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:38,453
So you took one and you lost track.
You took another.

489
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:42,081
And another.
It's possible. It happens.

490
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,209
You have to admit that, right?

491
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:53,050
Deb's more right than she knows
about what happened to Sal Price.

492
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,803
But Hannah wouldn't do that to Debra.

493
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:58,139
Would she?

494
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:08,816
I make my living at crime scenes,
proving what happened.

495
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:13,488
But now can I prove
what didn't happen?

496
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:17,116
Prove that Hannah
didn't poison Debra?

497
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:47,522
Is this proof that Hannah was here?

498
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,236
Did she break in?

499
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:04,080
Or did she simply walk through
an open door?

500
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:09,001
Or did this fall off me?
Did I track this in just now?

501
00:36:09,669 --> 00:36:14,173
The drug works quickly. Deb would've
passed out minutes after ingesting it.

502
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,302
Sorry for your loss.

503
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,848
- No, my sister's doing fine.
- Yeah.

504
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:24,976
Can't say the same thing
for this poor baby.

505
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,812
You'll have to go in
through the passenger side.

506
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:01,637
I'll see what the lab has to say
about what's in this bottle.

507
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:04,974
Hannah didn't poison Debra.

508
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,644
All I want for Christmas
is for that to be true.

509
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,276
Merry Christmas Eve.

510
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:18,446
We're having a Nochebuena
at the restaurant later.

511
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:22,116
Auri will be there.
You should come by.

512
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:26,454
Thank you, but I'm not up for it.

513
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:29,665
Holidays, family, cheer.

514
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:33,711
They're keeping Debra overnight
at the hospital. You should know that.

515
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,962
I know.

516
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:41,552
You wanna tell me
the real reason you're here?

517
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,682
I've been thinking about
what's next for me.

518
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:47,975
Yeah?

519
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:51,312
I'm enjoying the restaurant,
even with all the headaches.

520
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:55,399
It's real.

521
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:57,360
Straightforward.

522
00:37:57,568 --> 00:38:00,446
You open up, you feed people...

523
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:05,284
...you clean up, you close up,
then you go home.

524
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:06,911
That's it. That's your day.

525
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:09,872
You don't carry it with you.

526
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,833
- Not like this job?
- No.

527
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:16,295
And up until, I don't know...

528
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:17,964
...Mike's death maybe...

529
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,883
...it never got to me.

530
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:24,136
It's time, isn't it?

531
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:27,640
You ever think about what's next?

532
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:31,227
Sometimes.

533
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:35,106
I've been looking back a little too.

534
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:40,111
You know, wondering
about some choices I've made...

535
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,196
...wishing I'd made different ones.

536
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:47,159
Are you talking about me?
Are you talking about you, about us?

537
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:49,829
Are you wishing
that it would've worked out?

538
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:51,372
No.

539
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,957
No.

540
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,376
Okay, just checking.

541
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:59,547
So when are you retiring?

542
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:02,133
Thought about putting papers in
on the first.

543
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,847
Happy New Year.

544
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:10,641
Let's hope.

545
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:15,896
Dexter, hey.

546
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,775
I was worried about you.

547
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,532
- Look who's here.
- Daddy's home.

548
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:30,995
Come here, bud. Oh, yeah.

549
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,832
- Thanks for staying over tonight.
- My pleasure.

550
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:38,169
Ever since I've gone vegetarian,
watching my brother...

551
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:41,338
...roast a whole pig grosses me out.

552
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:44,133
Besides, you guys are family too.

553
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:45,926
Yeah, and so are you.

554
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:47,178
How's Debra?

555
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,138
Yeah, how's she doing?

556
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,474
She's fine.
She should be out tomorrow.

557
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,768
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.

558
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:56,812
Well, I hope you're hungry, Dexter.

559
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:11,077
Look at her. So beautiful.

560
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:25,633
But can you ever fully trust
a poisoner?

561
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:33,724
Okay, Dexter?

562
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,645
Dexter.

563
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,064
Earth to Dexter.

564
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,566
I think your food coma's hitting
way early.

565
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,568
- You're right.
- What do you want'?

566
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:46,987
A little bit of everything.

567
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:53,410
Christmas is a time of expectation.
If you're good, a red-suited fat man...

568
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:56,163
...will break into your house
and leave presents.

569
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,416
But Santa Claus doesn't exist.

570
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:03,671
The most wonderful time of the year
celebrates a lie.

571
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:12,805
Is the future I imagine with Hannah
nothing more than a vision...

572
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,515
...dancing in my head?

573
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:32,867
It's funny how we started off
in Santa's Holiday Adventure...

574
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:36,996
...and here we are,
Christmas Eve together.

575
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,291
A place I never thought I'd be
with anyone again...

576
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:42,543
...much less you.

577
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:47,923
Thanks.

578
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:50,843
I'm not saying this quite right.

579
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,139
All the men that I've been with...

580
00:41:55,347 --> 00:42:00,227
...there was a lot of running away.

581
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:03,564
But when I'm with you...

582
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:05,858
...I don't wanna go anywhere.

583
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,075
Stay with me tonight.

584
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:19,038
No, I can't. I have somewhere to be.

585
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:21,749
Debra?

586
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,631
Estrada?

587
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:33,594
Good for you.

588
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:36,222
He's somebody you've wanted
for a long time.

589
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,933
Someone I thought I'd never get.

590
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:43,729
I imagine that will be
deeply satisfying.

591
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,448
When Deb had her accident...

592
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:58,327
...she was heading
to Arlene Schram's house.

593
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,585
She was hoping Arlene
would give her a statement...

594
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:08,629
...that would let her arrest you.

595
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:13,300
But Deb never made it there.

596
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:16,720
She blacked out behind the wheel.

597
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:25,271
- Does that sound familiar?
- Familiar?

598
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:26,522
Sal Price.

599
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,484
It's what you hoped would happen
to him before you poisoned him.

600
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:35,447
Are you...?

601
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:41,370
Do you think that I had something to do
with Debra's accident?

602
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,499
Did you?

603
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:50,504
Oh, I can't believe you would
even think something like that.

604
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,966
Say something.

605
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:56,802
You will do whatever it takes
to protect yourself.

606
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:58,595
That does not include
trying to poison your sister.

607
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:02,725
You yourself told me Arlene saw you
poison that counsellor's coffee.

608
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:06,312
And I can't tell you how many times
I saw Arlene shoot up.

609
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,190
I was nervous about what she could do,
but then I went to see her...

610
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:11,817
...and she's a mess...

611
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:15,612
...that any law student could discredit.
She's not a threat to me.

612
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,292
But Deb is.

613
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,878
Do you think I would be that stupid...

614
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:34,089
...to try and poison
the lieutenant of Homicide?

615
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:38,886
And to think
that you wouldn't figure it out?

616
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:42,681
Wouldn't exactly bring us
closer together, would it?

617
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,646
You know I love you, right?

618
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:51,690
Yes.

619
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,985
Do you love me?

620
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:57,946
Yes.

621
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,077
I don't know if I believe you.

622
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:06,705
You were at her house last night.

623
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:10,793
I thought if she knew how much I cared
then she would back down a little.

624
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:13,212
But she never will.

625
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:16,673
What happens next week
when Deb has a heart attack?

626
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:18,133
Do you hear yourself?

627
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:21,970
If anything happens, I'll wonder
if you had something to do with it.

628
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:24,556
Well, that's your problem,
your lack of trust.

629
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:26,767
Your inability to trust.

630
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:28,227
God, it's like...

631
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:31,063
It's like you have something
deep inside of you...

632
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:33,982
...that you think is undeserving
of love.

633
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:36,902
- Don't turn this back on me.
- You're accusing me.

634
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:40,239
I ju-- I know what you're capable of.

635
00:45:46,245 --> 00:45:50,249
Okay, I'm not sure
quite how to say this...

636
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:55,170
...but I've never made a mistake.

637
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:01,135
If I had poisoned Debra,
then she would be dead.

638
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:04,054
If you know me
the way that you say that you do...

639
00:46:04,263 --> 00:46:06,056
...then you know that that's true.

640
00:46:10,853 --> 00:46:13,814
Maybe it all was just an accident.

641
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:20,195
It must have been really scary
to see her in the hospital like that.

642
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:22,322
It was.

643
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,076
It's understandable
you would try to make sense...

644
00:46:26,243 --> 00:46:28,996
...of a situation
that doesn't make sense...

645
00:46:29,455 --> 00:46:32,624
...but you're doing that
at the expense of this relationship.

646
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:35,335
I'm not trying to. I...

647
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:38,213
I don't wanna lose you.

648
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:39,882
I'm sure about you.

649
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,802
I'm 100-percent sure...

650
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:47,556
...but you need to be able
to say the same thing about me.

651
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,808
I know.

652
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,354
We could have it all.

653
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:02,029
I think you need to figure out
what it is that you want...

654
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:06,575
...and what type of future
you wanna have.

655
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:05,008
It's right in here.

656
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:11,390
What the fuck is this, huh?
Where's the stuff?

657
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:12,933
Fuck.

658
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:25,153
Estrada.

659
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:27,906
Estrada.

660
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:32,578
Estrada, it's time.

661
00:48:34,538 --> 00:48:37,207
The Department of Corrections
kept that for you.

662
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,626
That was very thoughtful.

663
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:44,673
You've changed a lot
in the past 40 years.

664
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:47,092
So have I.

665
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:50,971
Three men murdered my mother.

666
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:54,266
Juan Pablo Aliso,
shot in another deal.

667
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:55,809
Santos Jimenez.

668
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:59,062
You remember him.
He testified against you.

669
00:49:00,147 --> 00:49:03,942
I cut him into six roughly-equal pieces
with a chain saw.

670
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:06,612
Just like he did my mother.

671
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:08,614
Like I'm gonna do to you.

672
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:11,199
Holy fuck, you're Dickie Moser.

673
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:14,661
Dexter Moser.

674
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:24,087
I am Dexter Moser.

675
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:25,589
And I'm gonna kill you.

676
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:27,924
Is that what all this is about?

677
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:32,387
I was 3 years old
when you left me in that container.

678
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:36,767
Who am I gonna be
when you're dead?

679
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:40,354
Still some fucking freak, probably.

680
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,649
We'll see.

681
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:54,451
You're working with her, aren't you?

682
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:57,621
What?

683
00:49:58,205 --> 00:50:01,833
That fucking cop bitch,
the one who got me out.

684
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:04,753
Oh, yeah, they said
that there was a big push...

685
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:08,799
...for my release
from the captain of Miami Metro.

686
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:11,385
LaGuerta?

687
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:13,929
She fucking set me up.

688
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:16,848
You're not the one who was set up.

689
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:19,518
Officer.

690
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:21,687
We followed him here,
but we lost him.

691
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:24,648
Till we heard the gunshot.
That's when we called you.

692
00:50:24,815 --> 00:50:26,817
- All right. Anything else since?
- No.

693
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:28,402
Show me where.

694
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:57,556
What is going on in this place?

695
00:50:57,764 --> 00:51:02,269
Keep looking for Estrada and anyone
else with him. Estrada's not alone.

696
00:51:12,654 --> 00:51:15,240
Don't make a fucking sound.

697
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:26,543
Around the other side.

698
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:45,479
It wasn't the universe giving me a gift.
It was LaGuerta.

699
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:08,043
I can make sure one member
of the Morgan family...

700
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:10,212
...has a good Christmas.

701
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:19,846
Yes.

702
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:24,100
It's Sergio. You told me to call you
when I ran that water you brought in.

703
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:25,685
What'd you find?

704
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:27,938
That water's like
40 percent alprazolam.

705
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:29,773
That's an anti-anxiety drug.

706
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,526
Someone must have wanted
to knock themselves out.

707
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:35,153
But this time of year,
who can blame them?

708
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,115
- Thanks.
- You got it.

709
00:52:41,535 --> 00:52:42,911
It was no accident.

710
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,497
Hannah dissolved the pills
into Deb's water...

711
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:48,625
...so that she'd pass out
behind the wheel.

712
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:52,128
A problem in Hannah's life solved.

713
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:55,882
Hannah poisoned Debra.

714
00:52:56,716 --> 00:53:00,011
It's not the future I had wanted
with Hannah...

715
00:53:00,637 --> 00:53:03,348
...but maybe it's what I deserve.

716
00:53:15,986 --> 00:53:19,114
You barely said two words
on the ride home.

717
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:26,705
I have something for you.

718
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:29,499
A present?

719
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,419
A new car, I hope.

720
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:36,631
I guess it's a present.

721
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:41,261
It's Sal Price's pen.

722
00:53:43,263 --> 00:53:46,933
If you test it, you'll find traces
of aconite on the end...

723
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:50,020
...and Hannah's prints.

724
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:55,275
So that's how she did it.

725
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:05,660
I found it the next morning.
I kept it out of evidence.

726
00:54:07,913 --> 00:54:10,415
I can't believe
you're gonna turn her in.

727
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:17,380
As long as she's free,
you're not safe.

728
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:23,553
Dex, I know how hard this must be
for you.

729
00:54:42,822 --> 00:54:44,658
You're here.

730
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:52,040
Does that mean
that you know what you want?

731
00:54:52,582 --> 00:54:54,167
Yes.

732
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:03,009
- Hannah...
- You have to kiss me or it's bad luck.

733
00:55:17,607 --> 00:55:19,192
What's the matter?

734
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:21,695
I'm sorry.

735
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:23,780
Sorry?

736
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,042
Hannah McKay, you're under arrest
for the murder of Sal Price.

737
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,305
You should have killed me.

738
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:11,161
I should know better
than to count on the future.

739
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:22,172
All you can ever believe in is now...

740
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,215
...this moment.

741
00:56:28,845 --> 00:56:30,847
Because in a blink...

742
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:32,766
...everything can change.
