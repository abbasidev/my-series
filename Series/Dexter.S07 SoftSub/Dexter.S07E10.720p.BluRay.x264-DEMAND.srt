1
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:10,637
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:13,556
Our primary suspect
is Sergeant James Doakes.

3
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:17,644
- Doakes?
- He is not your man.

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,191
I think the Bay Harbor Butcher
is alive and still in Miami.

5
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,194
Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher,
end of story.

6
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,239
I found a blood slide
at the crime scene...

7
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:33,076
...like the ones we found in Doakes'
car and Doakes never had a boat.

8
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:37,622
Here is a list of Miami Metro personnel
who still do.

9
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,874
Its point of origin...

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,794
...front centre mass
burned upward, downward.

11
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:44,421
Can we close the doors?

12
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:48,341
This void, it's the same thing
that happened with the first car victim.

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,928
"Bobby"? Maybe the victim
was letting us know who did this.

14
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:53,513
You fucked my girl?

15
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:58,017
You could learn a thing or two from
her. She takes her job very seriously.

16
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,982
You always been this afraid
of the water?

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,360
Ever since my father thought the best
way to teach me how to swim...

18
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:10,280
...was to march me down
to the local pond and throw me in.

19
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:12,073
- That's horrible.
- Six years old...

20
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:15,452
and I already knew what it felt like
to be dying.

21
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:18,496
- Look, I think you have the wrong idea.
- Shut up.

22
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:21,082
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

23
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:26,129
Dexter, you don't have to save her.
You shouldn't even be with her.

24
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,506
It's not even like
you have a fucking future.

25
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:31,426
All I know is that
when I'm with you, I feel...

26
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,386
...safe.

27
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,796
I saw a man,
he was coming through the flames.

28
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:35,258
- He was wearing a silver-coloured suit.
- Our Phantom Arsonist.

29
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,844
- He looked like an alien.
- Or a monster.

30
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,471
I swear, he was 7 feet tall.

31
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,560
Monsters, aliens, phantoms,
none of them are real.

32
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:49,063
The thought that an actual person
could do this is too awful...

33
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:53,234
...so our imaginations create a way
to make it easier to take.

34
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,864
But the strongest of imaginations can't
protect us once we know the truth.

35
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,575
I called you last night.
Wanted to go over the case.

36
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:03,453
- We can go over them now.
- Where were you?

37
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,749
Oh, you were with Hannah.

38
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:12,128
- Find anything? DNA? Prints?
- Nope, nada, zip.

39
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:15,506
Same accelerant as the other four fires,
though. Kerosene.

40
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:17,634
He left another "Bobby" in the soot.

41
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:20,219
Fuck, that's five Bobby's
in two weeks.

42
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:23,765
- He's gotta be signing his name, right?
- Only thing that makes sense.

43
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:27,977
None of the victims were named Bobby,
but fuckload of good that does us.

44
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:31,356
There are thousands
of Bobs and Roberts in Miami.

45
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,608
What do we know
about the latest victim?

46
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,819
Mom took her daughter to the
bathroom. Both went up in smoke.

47
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,488
Kid was 6 years old.

48
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:42,200
What kind of sick fuck does that
to a 6-year-old kid'?

49
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:50,541
Maybe the kind who isn't bothered
by the sight of a dead child.

50
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,256
- Hey.
- Hey.

51
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:02,136
How you feeling?
You get your stitches out?

52
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:06,474
Yeah, I'm gonna have
a really sexy scar.

53
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,935
- How was your day?
- It was fine.

54
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,145
You don't sound fine.

55
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:17,610
The Phantom started another fire
today. it killed a mother and child.

56
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,325
- What?
- Why do I get the feeling...

57
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,995
...you wanna wrap him up in plastic?

58
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,163
It doesn't matter.

59
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,125
I promised Deb I wouldn't take
any cases from the police.

60
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,711
If you always listened to Deb,
you wouldn't be here.

61
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,587
I can't kill him, okay?

62
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:37,922
Okay, fine.

63
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:42,218
Sorry. I'm just...

64
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:45,138
"frustrated.

65
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,682
As much as I wanna be here...

66
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,476
...my Dark Passenger wants
to be somewhere else.

67
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,854
I'm sorry. Your "dark" what?

68
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:55,898
My Dark Passenger.

69
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:58,651
- That's what I call my need to kill.
- Why?

70
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,029
It's like this thing living inside me...

71
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:04,032
...telling me what to do,
saying I have to kill...

72
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,658
...not leaving me any choice.

73
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,911
You're not a puppet.
Of course you have a choice.

74
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,705
Actually, I don't.

75
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,541
Come on, Dex. It's just you.

76
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,045
You want the arsonist dead.
And I don't blame you. Who wouldn't?

77
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:19,130
- It's not the same.
- What do you mean?

78
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:22,258
Ignore that. I wanna understand this.

79
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,926
How is it different?

80
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:27,221
A lot of people feel they wanna kill,
but I have to follow through.

81
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:31,642
I follow through
and I don't have a Dark Passenger.

82
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,728
You don't get it.

83
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,313
I'm trying to.

84
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:38,983
But, no, I don't get it.

85
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:44,280
- There's a man in the window.
- What?

86
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:47,200
- Hi, banana.
- Oh, my God. That's my dad.

87
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:53,915
I'm sorry if I surprised you. I didn't
even know Hannah had a boyfriend.

88
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:57,085
- I haven't spoken to you since--
- Go ahead and say it.

89
00:06:57,293 --> 00:07:00,046
Since before I went to prison.

90
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,923
Clint McKay, convicted felon.

91
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,467
Nice to meet you.
No need to get nervous.

92
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:08,888
I was just in for cheque kiting
and I got out early on good behaviour.

93
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:12,642
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- Well, let me just get to the point.

94
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,144
I don't know what Hannah's told you...

95
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:16,771
- ...about me.
- Not a lot.

96
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,315
- Well...
- Just that you almost let her drown.

97
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,692
Well, the truth is...

98
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:26,823
...I was a real, genuine asshole
of a father.

99
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:30,576
And I needed to admit that
to you in person.

100
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,121
Can we please not do this
in front of Dexter?

101
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,207
If you two are together,
then I want him to hear this.

102
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,627
I spent a lot of time with a prison
shrink, working through my issues.

103
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:43,673
It's important to take responsibility,
so that's what I'm here to do.

104
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:49,178
- Okay.
- Now, I don't expect you to forgive me.

105
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:53,432
Don't see any reason that you should,
not after everything I put you through.

106
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:56,727
But it's important you know...

107
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,231
...no matter what,
I always loved you.

108
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,152
I always will.

109
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,202
I've got something for you
in my truck.

110
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:16,247
Let me give it to you
and I'll be on my way.

111
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,835
Surprise.

112
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:23,838
It's your dollhouse.

113
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:27,091
Repainted and rebuilt.
It was in your Aunt Cindy's garage.

114
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,429
I figured you loved it so much as a kid,
you might like to have it now.

115
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,016
Dex, give me a hand?

116
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:50,573
Well, I guess I'll be on my way.
Let you two get back to your dinner.

117
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,952
There's a diner at the Purple Flamingo,
where I'm staying.

118
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:57,914
They say they make
a pretty decent burger.

119
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,749
Okay.

120
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,251
Okay.

121
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:05,254
Well,
I guess I'll see you around then.

122
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:08,758
Nice to meet you, Dexter.

123
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:14,805
You look good, banana.

124
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:18,017
Happy-
Glad to see you're doing okay.

125
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:30,988
I'm sure he meant well, but he
could not have given me a worse gift.

126
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,951
Brings up so much shit.

127
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,078
What kind of shit?

128
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,498
When I was 8,
he took me to a poker tournament.

129
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:44,543
Lied to my mom and said that we
were going to a county fair...

130
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,546
...and stashed me in a motel room.

131
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,591
Went to play cards
and didn't come back for three days.

132
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,471
That's awful.

133
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,266
When he came back,
he brought the dollhouse...

134
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:01,686
...bragging about a big win,
saying he'd never leave me again...

135
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,438
...and making promises
that things would get better.

136
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,441
- And did they?
- No. Of course not.

137
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,072
I don't know. I'm...

138
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:16,367
He's trying, right? Maybe...

139
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:20,621
Maybe this last stint in lockup
did him some good.

140
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,624
Yeah, maybe.

141
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:31,924
Most likely we're looking
for a male suspect.

142
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,719
Egocentric, manipulative.

143
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:38,848
Possibly in or on the outskirts
of law enforcement.

144
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,975
He's methodical.

145
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:44,270
Fastidious in his appearance,
poor social skills.

146
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,231
This list
is by no means comprehensive.

147
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,943
Should give you an idea
of what we're looking at.

148
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:55,114
Bosso's profile of the Phantom,
he may as well be describing himself.

149
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:57,867
An arsonist
who works for the fire department.

150
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,202
- It's almost too easy.
- What else?

151
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,080
Hands-on learner.

152
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,708
Prone to self-aggrandisement.

153
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,543
Thank you, Investigator Bosso.

154
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:10,880
Where are we on tracking the suit?

155
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,550
There's at least a hundred sites
that sell that on the Internet.

156
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,552
Almost impossible to trace.

157
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:20,181
- Are you interviewing witnesses?
- Nobody's seen the guy's face.

158
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,641
- More coming.
- Let me know what you find.

159
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,810
Simms, Miller, any leads
from the tip line?

160
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,020
None so far.

161
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:28,898
Mostly girlfriends trying to get back
at their exes.

162
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,484
Keep at it.
Maybe something will come through.

163
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,236
This fuck has killed seven people
in two weeks.

164
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:37,365
Let's stop him
before he makes it to number eight.

165
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,330
Hannah's wrong.
Of course I have a Dark Passenger.

166
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,083
There's no other way
to explain this compulsion.

167
00:11:57,927 --> 00:11:59,762
I hope she knows what she's doing.

168
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,931
Who's sending you hugs and kisses?

169
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:04,058
No one.

170
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,271
Bullshit. That was a girl.

171
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,690
Was she sexting you?
You got pictures?

172
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,443
Come on,
I gotta restock my spank bank.

173
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:17,696
- Angel, know about Dexter's girlfriend?
- Hannah McKay?

174
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,448
- How did you--?
- Jamie told me.

175
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,285
My man.

176
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,123
Hannah McKay.
Yeah, that is so awesome.

177
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:30,668
Excuse me, what is awesome
about my brother dating a killer?

178
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:34,171
You guys heard Sal Price's recording.
Hannah confessed.

179
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,257
Come on, she was 15
when she did that.

180
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:39,135
When I was 15,
my parents thought that I was retarded.

181
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,095
Hey, hey-

182
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:42,596
I get it.

183
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,015
Hannah is an attractive girl.

184
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,979
But you should probably be careful.

185
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,065
Yeah,
you should definitely be careful...

186
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:56,277
...of getting burned
because she's so freaking hot.

187
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,155
Can I see you in my office, please?

188
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:04,160
I didn't realise you and Hannah McKay
had gone public.

189
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,870
We hadn't until a minute ago.

190
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,456
That's kind of dangerous.
Don't you think?

191
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:12,293
Dating someone so notorious
when trying to stay under the radar.

192
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,753
I don't wanna talk
about Hannah right now.

193
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,338
Can you just leave it?

194
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,216
Fine, yeah. I'll butt out.

195
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,845
I mean, we're all responsible adults,
right?

196
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:27,266
You live your life, I'll live mine,
and Hannah will live Hannah's.

197
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,310
Great. You'll leave Hannah alone?

198
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,229
I'm saying that I'll stay out
of your relationship.

199
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,773
I'm not gonna let her get away
with murder again.

200
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:38,611
- That's not what I meant.
- Dexter, I am fucking serious.

201
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,655
I have compromised the shit
out of myself for you.

202
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,867
I am sure as fuck not gonna do it
for Hannah McKay.

203
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,411
Fine. I get it.

204
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,540
Why are you standing here?
We have a Phantom to catch.

205
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,765
She did say "we."

206
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:09,808
Philip Bosso.

207
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:14,021
In his last 27 arson investigations,
he found the fire's origin point.

208
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:19,568
Either he's great at his job or all he
had to do was look in the mirror.

209
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:35,292
Okay, it says here
that you work as a janitor...

210
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:39,838
...at the Y in Brickell Bay
where the Phantom set the first fire.

211
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:45,177
Did you see anything suspicious
when making your rounds that night?

212
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:48,681
No, I didn't even know it happened
until I saw the fire truck.

213
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,558
It was horrible.

214
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:53,435
Right, right, right.

215
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,939
And did you see anyone
in a fireproof suit?

216
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,817
Don't you think
I would've told you if I had?

217
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,115
Bosso's SUV.

218
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,535
But where did he go?
Is he about to strike again?

219
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,300
Electric fuses and camping fuel.

220
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,720
What are you doing here?

221
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,805
That's not a fireproof suit.

222
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:33,309
Dexter,
you a Civil War re-enactor too?

223
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,894
You here for the battle?

224
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:40,357
- Yeah.
- Which side are you fighting for?

225
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,820
- The North.
- Oh, why you blue belly.

226
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,822
I should buck and gag you right here.

227
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:54,288
Were you there last weekend at the
sixth Maine battery cannon firings?

228
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,957
No, damn. I guess I missed that one.

229
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,502
It's a whole weekend affair.
I was in charge of special effects.

230
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,172
Ground, air bursts, artillery fire.

231
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,674
Which explains what's in his car...

232
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:09,011
...and gives him an alibi
for Saturday's fire.

233
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:13,015
- Wanna see some pictures?
- You bet.

234
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,896
Bosso's not the Phantom.

235
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,773
He's just strange.

236
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:24,026
But if he didn't set those fires,
then who did?

237
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,528
Hang on just one sec.

238
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:41,085
I guess coffee went better
than expected.

239
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:47,174
After coffee, Hannah wanted
to show me the flower mart.

240
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,470
So we're walking around
and I catch a whiff of this flower.

241
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,597
It smells just like liquorice.

242
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:56,767
- I ask Hannah what it is...
- And I tell him it's anise.

243
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:01,021
So I tell the lady in the booth
that her anise smells delicious.

244
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,857
You didn't pronounce it right.

245
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,735
Don't know what I said,
but she did not react well.

246
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,320
Well, do you blame her?

247
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,239
Sounds like you had quite a day.

248
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,785
Yeah, we really did.

249
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,870
How long are you gonna be in town?

250
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,874
Oh, just another day or so.
And then I'm off to Louisiana.

251
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,585
What's in Louisiana?
A poker tournament?

252
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:28,173
No. I am all done with that. I am looking
for an honest way to make a living.

253
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:31,218
And I think I found the perfect thing.
You ready?

254
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,096
- Crawfish.
- Crawfish?

255
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,349
Yeah, a crawfish farm.
I got a line on one near Lafayette.

256
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:42,020
Gonna call it Big Clint's Crawdaddies
and I will ship them fresh anywhere.

257
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,982
- There's a market for that?
- You bet there is.

258
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,317
Hey, ain't nothing like a crawfish boil.

259
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:51,196
Weddings, bachelor parties,
Fourth of July.

260
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,407
Everybody likes crawdads.

261
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:57,536
Well, I'm excited for you, Dad.
And I'm proud of you.

262
00:17:57,745 --> 00:18:00,330
Well, thank you, honey. Means a lot.

263
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,753
Why don't you check out of that motel
and come and stay with me?

264
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,131
You're starting a business.
You're gonna need to save.

265
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,549
No. I couldn't do that.

266
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,968
- I wouldn't wanna intrude.
- Oh, you're not.

267
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,888
Yeah. Don't worry.
I was going home tonight anyway.

268
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:20,225
Why don't I bring you guys breakfast?
Best doughnuts you ever tasted.

269
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,229
Okay.

270
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,965
- What are you doing, man?
- Get out!

271
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,675
Everybody, come on!

272
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,302
Come on! Come on!

273
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,817
Man, it's like I died
and went to heaven.

274
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,945
I think if I had one more of those,
I probably will.

275
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,280
I'd like
to make an orange juice toast...

276
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,617
...to the cutest damn couple
I have ever seen.

277
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:21,245
Outside of me and Bubba in prison.

278
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,747
- That's just a little joke.
- Right.

279
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:26,333
Well, to you, Dad.

280
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:27,793
The king of crawfish.

281
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,628
There's no stopping me.

282
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,048
I just gotta get the money together.

283
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,428
So where are you at with that?

284
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,139
That's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

285
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,560
Figured you might like to get in
on the ground ﬂoor.

286
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,520
- What do you mean?
- Well, invest.

287
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,605
I only need about 20 grand more.

288
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,733
No, it's a great opportunity.

289
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,695
There's a guaranteed 10 percent a year
back on investment.

290
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,823
I'm sorry, Dad. I can't.

291
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,908
My money's tied up in the business.

292
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,160
Oh, come on, now.
Not all your money.

293
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,913
There's gotta be a little wiggle room
there somewhere.

294
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:08,000
- You could re-mortgage your place.
- I don't think so.

295
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,919
- Gotta be worth a pretty penny.
- It's not gonna happen.

296
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,380
Well, fine.

297
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,507
Whatever. Forget it.

298
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,969
I'm sorry. I just don't have the funds.

299
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,680
What kind of daughter won't even help
her own father?

300
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,182
Jesus, Dad.

301
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,644
Look, I need some air.
I'm gonna go for a drive.

302
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,271
Dad, you don't have to go.

303
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,863
You think I was wrong
telling him I couldn't?

304
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,533
- Of course not.
- But I feel like I should help him out.

305
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,830
- Why?
- Because he's my dad.

306
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,710
The same dad
who almost let you drown?

307
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,795
Who left you alone for three days?

308
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,339
He's trying to change.

309
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:56,965
I doubt it.

310
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:01,261
I know he's done some bad things,
but there's good inside of him as well.

311
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:07,142
Right, you've known him for 24 hours
and you think you understand him?

312
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,604
- I have a sense for this thing.
- Oh, yeah, you and your Dark--

313
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,731
Whatever-- Part of you.

314
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,109
- That you don't think exists.
- Because it doesn't.

315
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,620
I gotta go to work.
It's the arsonist again.

316
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:31,208
Look, I'm just trying to help here.

317
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,961
I know. I know.

318
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,254
I appreciate it. I'm sorry.

319
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,257
I'll be fine. Go.

320
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,552
Okay.

321
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,375
I gotta check.

322
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,169
Sorry what happened to your sister.

323
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,630
Another "Bobby."

324
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,881
"It's Bobby."

325
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,384
He added an "it's."

326
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,013
Like we didn't know it was Bobby.

327
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,724
Make sure you get this.

328
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,691
Well, did you see anything?

329
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,484
I really have no idea.

330
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,487
Did you see Bosso?

331
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,282
- Sniffing the body.
- Probably for accelerant.

332
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,659
Still, it was kind of creepy, right?

333
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:50,954
I mean, I know it would be
the biggest cliché in the world...

334
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:55,250
...the arson investigator turned out
to be the arsonist, but does he...?

335
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,754
Does he set off anything
in your brain?

336
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,048
I don't think Bosso's the Phantom.

337
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,424
He has an alibi.

338
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:05,177
- You vetted him?
- I looked into him.

339
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,055
You said
you weren't gonna take any cases.

340
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,765
- I didn't take it.
- Fuck, Dexter.

341
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,641
Why put yourself in that situation?

342
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,436
Good question. Why did I?

343
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:18,065
Hey, L.T. We got a security camera.
I'm gonna take the hard drive...

344
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,233
...see if we can get eyes
on the Phantom.

345
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,736
Good. We could use a break.

346
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,116
Hey, Hannah.

347
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:32,704
Wait, hold on. Slow down.
What happened?

348
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:35,624
I'll be right there.

349
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,141
What happened?

350
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:58,688
I came back from the flower mart
and it was like this.

351
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:05,821
Well, I had a couple of drinks
to take the edge off...

352
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,365
...but I might have overdone it
a little.

353
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:12,285
You did this to get back at me for not
giving you the money that you wanted.

354
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:15,372
Oh, talk about paranoid.

355
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,833
But then,
maybe you've got reason to be.

356
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,169
Must be a lot of folks hate you
for all the pain you've caused.

357
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,505
How can you even say that to me?

358
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:27,300
Playing Mother Nature in here
with your stupid, little flowers.

359
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,678
Won't even help out
your own fucking father!

360
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,889
- I don't wanna help you!
- You got any idea what it's like...

361
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:36,268
...to be the father
of the infamous Hannah McKay?

362
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:39,813
You're a goddamn curse,
you ungrateful little shit!

363
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,648
That's enough, Clint.

364
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:44,025
Stay out of this.
This is family business.

365
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:47,946
You know you killed your mother,
don't you?

366
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,658
She died of a broken heart
after your spree...

367
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:54,202
- ...with Wayne Randall.
- I'm sorry.

368
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:58,999
Everybody would've been better off if
I'd let you drown that day at the pond.

369
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,460
Get out of here.

370
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:08,550
Now.

371
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,679
Fine.

372
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,268
I said what I had to say.

373
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,986
Well, it looks like
Hannah's found herself another winner.

374
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,655
You two deserve each other.

375
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,378
I can cut a body up into pieces...

376
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:49,507
...but how do I help Hannah
put herself back together?

377
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,185
Could you have picked
more of a dump?

378
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,939
Come on, Maria. It's perfect
for all this cloak-and-dagger bullshit.

379
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,816
It's the kind of place you take hookers
and ugly broads.

380
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,109
So nobody sees you.

381
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,486
You should know.

382
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:12,739
I followed up on all the names
you identified on my list.

383
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:15,742
Yes, the list
of suspicious police employees...

384
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,245
- ...who own boats.
- They were all dead ends.

385
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,288
All except for Dexter Morgan...

386
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,499
...who conveniently moved his boat...

387
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,751
...when we were closing in
on his marina...

388
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,003
...during the official investigation.

389
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:30,048
You really think Dexter
is the Bay Harbor Butcher?

390
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:33,343
- It's worth looking into.
- No, it's a waste of time.

391
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,220
Now, start thinking logically.

392
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:39,057
If Doakes really wasn't
the Bay Harbor Butcher...

393
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,601
...that means
somebody probably framed him.

394
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,937
- Right.
- That same person killed him...

395
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,897
...the real Bay Harbor Butcher.

396
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:50,151
So the best thing to do is to look
into Doakes' final days.

397
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:55,198
We should start with the cabin
in the Everglades. Where Doakes died.

398
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,618
Makes sense. First let's eat.

399
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,495
- Okay.
- Waiter.

400
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,882
You went all out.

401
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:17,137
Well, you had a rough night.
I figured you could use a pick-me-up.

402
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,264
Sit.

403
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,189
You were right about my dad.

404
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,986
I'm sorry I was.

405
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,488
I just-- I feel like such a sucker.

406
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:39,159
I don't fall for anybody's bullshit,
but when it comes to him, I--

407
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:42,495
I get it. Fathers can be complicated.

408
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,540
I just don't understand
why I keep holding on to this idea...

409
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,168
...that, underneath it all,
he's a good person.

410
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:52,505
Maybe because the idea that he's not
is just too hard to take.

411
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,472
I just hope he's gone for good.

412
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,894
You sure scared the shit out of him.

413
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,688
That voice.

414
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:14,027
I hadn't seen that look on your face
since you took me to see the snow.

415
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:19,240
Is that what you were talking about?

416
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,369
Your Dark Rider?

417
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,956
Dark Passenger.

418
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,629
Fine. it sounds a little silly
when you say it out loud.

419
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:34,089
No, I get what you mean.

420
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:37,258
You do seem
like a different person...

421
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,970
...so it makes sense that you
would name that part of yourself.

422
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,309
Does it just take over?

423
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:53,608
Where do you go?

424
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:58,863
Does Dexter Morgan just disappear?

425
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,450
No, I'm still there.

426
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,578
Do you hear a voice, or--?

427
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:09,165
Not exactly. It's more like a...

428
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,793
.“need.

429
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,129
So it's just like a feeling.

430
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:29,060
Well, I should get to work.

431
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:32,397
- Unless you need me to...
- No, I'm good.

432
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:34,649
I got pancakes.

433
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:53,877
The good news is that we
have the Phantom entering the bus.

434
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:57,046
The bad news
is that he never shows his face.

435
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:11,019
My promise to Deb
is getting harder and harder to keep.

436
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:12,979
This is more than just a feeling.

437
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,982
- There's no way to ID him?
- I didn't say that.

438
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:21,237
Right there.

439
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,949
He grabs a rail bare-handed.
We might have a print.

440
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:27,118
Pull the fucking print off the rail.

441
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,871
- We might get lucky and get a match.
- Let's go, bro.

442
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,165
Hey, baby. What's up?

443
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:35,835
What? Motherfuck. I'll be right there.

444
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:39,756
- What's wrong?
- Novikov's sending Nadia to Dubai.

445
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,716
He's holding her. I gotta get her out.

446
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,092
- Alone?
- Got no choice.

447
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,970
- He's putting her on a flight tonight.
- Let's go.

448
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,976
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm here to see George.

449
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:54,521
Why don't you stay here with me?

450
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,739
Well, well, if it isn't Sir Lancelot.

451
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,784
- Where's Nadia?
- Nadia?

452
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:11,079
Let me get her for you.
She's got something to tell you.

453
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:13,248
Get over here.

454
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:20,046
All right, tell your boyfriend
who you belong to.

455
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:21,548
- Let her go.
- Tell him.

456
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:22,966
Fuck you.

457
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,386
You touch her fucking again,
you're dead.

458
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,304
Oh, what are you gonna do?

459
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:30,974
You're gonna shoot me
in my own club?

460
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,143
Fuck.

461
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,104
Don't move.

462
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,273
Nadia, get behind George's body.

463
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,692
I want you to take this gun, Nadia.

464
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:46,739
I want you to shoot me in the arm.
Okay, sweetie? It's okay.

465
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,158
Shoot me in the arm.

466
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,415
What the--? Are you okay?

467
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,375
He pulled a gun and shot me.

468
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,919
I had no fucking choice.
He just grazed me.

469
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,462
Christ.

470
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:05,133
Go to the safe. Get your passport
and the money and go.

471
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,220
What? She's a witness.
I'm not gonna let her take that money.

472
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:13,057
She's earned it. She can't be a witness.
The Koshkas will kill her.

473
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,684
And she's here illegally.

474
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:31,367
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Go, go, now.

475
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,006
So did you find a match?

476
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:46,466
We'll see.

477
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:49,636
I'm running the Phantom's prints
through AFIS now.

478
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:52,930
- Nothing.
- Fuck me.

479
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:54,307
So, what now?

480
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:57,602
You hand the whole thing over to me
and let me take care of it?

481
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,313
I can't stop thinking
about this Bobby thing.

482
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,232
You know, that somehow
that's the key.

483
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:07,362
It's a kid's name.
Nobody calls an adult Bobby.

484
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,155
He wrote "it's Bobby" on the bus.

485
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:13,117
Like Astor and Cody blaming
each other. "it's Astor." "it's Cody."

486
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,453
The fires have to do
with his childhood?

487
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:16,788
Could be.

488
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,790
Maybe his urges started back then.

489
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:23,044
I wish we could run that print against
juvie records, but that shit's sealed.

490
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,964
Back to square one.

491
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,551
Not for me.

492
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:56,994
Government workers
never miss a break.

493
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:25,523
There's your Phantom.

494
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:31,070
"Arrested for burning down
his school's gym at age 12.

495
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:34,532
Spent time in detention,
set his roommate's bunk on fire."

496
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:38,619
Got sent to a psychiatric facility
in 2006.

497
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:40,621
Just released a month ago.

498
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,666
That explains why the fires
only just started now.

499
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,253
Gonna turn that over to Deb?

500
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:49,130
Call it in on the tip line?

501
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,048
I'm not sure I can.

502
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:55,344
Deb was right. Now that I have proof,
my urges are beyond my control.

503
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:59,015
Your Dark Passenger. Where did you
come up with that, anyway?

504
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:01,768
- Thought I got it from you.
- I gave you the code.

505
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,146
The Dark Passenger was all yours.

506
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:09,358
You said it got into me too early
in that shipping container.

507
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:12,528
- You thought I was possessed.
- I meant you were traumatised.

508
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:15,031
Not possessed.

509
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,742
The first time you said it,
you must've been about 12.

510
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,079
I just let it go. I couldn't let you
blame yourself for feelings...

511
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:25,583
...that were too complicated
for a young boy to understand.

512
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,085
But you're not a boy anymore.

513
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:29,921
Oh, you sound like Hannah.

514
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,839
Maybe she's right.

515
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:34,467
Maybe the Dark Passenger
is just a feeling.

516
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,762
- It can't be.
- Why?

517
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:42,350
Because if there's no Dark Passenger,
then I'm responsible...

518
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:45,394
...for everything I've done.

519
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:48,064
It sure is simpler
to just pin all the blame...

520
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:50,691
...on something else, isn't it, Dexter?

521
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,403
It's much scarier to think...

522
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:57,490
...that the Dark Passenger
is no more real than I am.

523
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,999
- This is where the cabin used to be.
- Yeah...

524
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,794
...before it got blown to smithereens.

525
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,888
Juan Alonso?

526
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:23,724
I'm Captain Maria LaGuerta
from Miami Metro Homicide.

527
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,977
- This is Thomas Matthews.
- What do you want'?

528
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:29,021
Were you the owner of this property
back in 2007?

529
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:33,276
And did you rent it, at that time,
to a James Doakes?

530
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:34,569
Bay Harbor Butcher.

531
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:38,364
No, no, no. I told the cops back then
I had nothing to do with that.

532
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:41,158
Then how did Mr. Doakes come
to be staying here?

533
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,661
I was renting to Santos Jimenez.

534
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,290
- Jimenez?
- Some kind of Colombian drug guy.

535
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,334
Not that I knew it.
I'd never rent to a criminal.

536
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:52,628
Of course not.

537
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:56,424
Now, why does that
sound so familiar?

538
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:01,137
Now I know why the name
Santos Jimenez rang a bell.

539
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,389
He wasn't just a drug runner.

540
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:08,644
One of the men responsible for killing
Dexter Morgan's mother, Laura Moser.

541
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,479
- Moser?
- Yeah.

542
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,690
Some drug lord put a hit out on her...

543
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:15,860
...because he found out
that she was Harry Morgan's Cl.

544
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,655
She was butchered by Jimenez
with a chain saw...

545
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:22,199
...in front of Dexter
and his brother, Brian.

546
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:24,118
Brian Moser?

547
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:26,621
The Ice Truck Killer,
that was Dexter's brother?

548
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:28,915
Yeah.

549
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:31,792
So...

550
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:35,963
...that means that Dexter
watched his mother get chopped up...

551
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:39,592
...just like the Bay Harbor Butcher
chopped up his victims?

552
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,845
So, what are you saying?

553
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:45,598
- Where's Jimenez now?
- He disappeared.

554
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:48,851
Murdered by the Bay Harbor Butcher?
Who was more likely...

555
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,146
...to want Jimenez dead,
Doakes or Dexter?

556
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,231
- Oh, come on, Maria.
- No, Tom.

557
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,067
We can't ignore the facts.

558
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:59,278
The Bay Harbor Butcher
took blood slides from his victims.

559
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:02,073
Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.

560
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:05,826
And Doakes always thought
there was something off about Dexter.

561
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:09,580
What if Doakes was on to him?

562
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:15,169
Jesus. What if Dexter
is the real Bay Harbor Butcher?

563
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:17,254
What if he isn't?

564
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:20,967
- I am gonna go question him.
- No, you're not gonna do that.

565
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:25,638
- Now, I don't think you're right.
- Trust me, I hope I'm not.

566
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:29,600
If somebody's gotta talk to Dexter,
it's gonna be me.

567
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:32,478
I've known him since he was a kid.
He trusts me.

568
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,898
What's more,
I'm a lot less likely to fuck it up.

569
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:43,572
The only thing between me
and killing the Phantom...

570
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:46,575
...is a slightly deflated water wing.

571
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:50,204
You sure we can't talk you
into coming for a swim?

572
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:53,416
I'd love to, but I got something
I gotta take care of.

573
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:55,126
Put your hand through there.

574
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,422
Do this one too.

575
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:03,092
There you go.

576
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:13,561
- Well, well, who's this big fella?
- That's my son, Harrison.

577
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:16,689
Harrison. Isn't that fancy?

578
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,065
And who are you?

579
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,776
I'm Jamie, Harrison's nanny.

580
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:24,488
Boy. They didn't have nannies like you
back in my day.

581
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:27,616
We're gonna go swimming now.

582
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:30,828
You ready? Ready, little man?

583
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:32,538
Yeah.

584
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:37,251
Boy, the way they coddle kids today.

585
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,171
They're all gonna be expecting
a helping hand.

586
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,756
The world isn't like that.

587
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:45,134
It's sink or swim, sonny boy.

588
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:47,511
Have fun.

589
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:54,143
What do you want'?

590
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,398
Well, Dexter, I can tell
that you care about my daughter.

591
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,984
- I'm here to find out how much.
- Get to the point.

592
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,486
I have information...

593
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:06,113
...that could be very damaging
to Hannah.

594
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:09,992
Now, I could give this information
to the police...

595
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:12,995
...or you could pay me a nice, tidy sum
to keep it.

596
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:14,330
What are you talking about?

597
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:19,126
When Hannah got out of juvie, she
killed a counsellor at a halfway house.

598
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:21,921
She fed him rat poison.

599
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:26,133
Her roommate,
little gal named Arlene Schram...

600
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:29,345
...saw her do it
with her own two eyes.

601
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:31,931
The cops could get her
to spill her guts.

602
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,016
You're lying.

603
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:35,768
I read Sal Price's book on Hannah.

604
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:38,604
He mentioned the counsellor,
nothing about the roommate.

605
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:41,107
- I hadn't told him about it yet.
- What?

606
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:44,777
Where do you think he was getting
all those juicy, little plums?

607
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:48,906
Price was paying me
to dish dirt on my daughter.

608
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:52,368
I was saving the good stuff
for a bigger payday.

609
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:55,079
Then the son of a bitch
went belly-up.

610
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,498
And... there went my meal ticket.

611
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:00,835
You'd sell your own daughter out
for a crawfish farm?

612
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,586
Fuck crawfish, man.

613
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:05,673
I'm up to my ears in gambling debt.

614
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:09,218
But you do what you gotta do.

615
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:13,514
So you gonna give me my money...

616
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,975
...or do I send Hannah to jail?

617
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,691
Get out of here
before you see my bad side.

618
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:29,613
You might wanna ask Hannah
about Arlene...

619
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:32,658
...before you come
to a final decision.

620
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:36,162
Then we'll talk numbers.

621
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:46,005
What exactly were you doing here?

622
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,924
It was a personal matter.

623
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,760
My girlfriend works at the club.

624
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:53,262
Jesus, Quinn.

625
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,556
I came to talk to Novikov
about Nadia.

626
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,766
The conversation got heated.

627
00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:01,187
He pulled out a gun, shot me.
I returned fire. Self-defence.

628
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,356
- Plain and simple.
- Write up a report.

629
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,901
I want it on my desk in the morning.

630
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:15,159
There's a little problem
with your story.

631
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:19,538
There's a time lag
between the first shot and the second.

632
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:22,291
I want the truth.

633
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:26,879
I told you the truth.

634
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:30,007
I went down when George shot me.

635
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:33,135
He started to beat the shit
out of Nadia.

636
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,095
I reached for my gun.

637
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:38,349
He wheeled around,
ready to blow my head off...

638
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:40,976
...and I took him out.

639
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:42,978
That's what happened.

640
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:51,070
- Okay. Then we'll go with that.
- Minus Nadia.

641
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,492
Yeah.

642
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,790
- Hey, where's Dexter?
- I don't know.

643
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,918
But I'd like to point out
that I am here, doing my duty.

644
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,795
- What?
- Nothing.

645
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:12,007
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

646
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:15,552
How can that be my own father?

647
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:26,063
I'm sorry to have to tell you this...

648
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,816
...but I needed to know
that he was telling the truth.

649
00:43:30,901 --> 00:43:33,862
Arlene Schram is the only person
who can put me in jail.

650
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:39,076
She saw me put poison
in that counsellor's food.

651
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:44,790
- I'm gonna have to pay him.
- That's not gonna solve anything.

652
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,709
I don't see any other option.

653
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:53,924
When other people have threatened
you, you've found other options.

654
00:43:58,053 --> 00:43:59,888
I can't.

655
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,558
He's my father.

656
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:10,065
I'm gonna call my bank.

657
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:14,445
I know what you're thinking.

658
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:17,781
I'm not thinking anything.

659
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:20,451
Clint McKay doesn't meet the code.

660
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,790
But Joseph Jensen does.

661
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:38,362
It's not as much fun when you're not
wearing your suit, is it?

662
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,197
Who are you? I can't see you.

663
00:45:41,115 --> 00:45:43,617
Maybe I'm a phantom.

664
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,203
Then again, maybe not.

665
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:48,580
A phantom can't hurt you.

666
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,333
Oh, God. Please don't.

667
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:54,044
- Who's Bobby?
- Let me go.

668
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:57,214
Stop whining. Who's Bobby?

669
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:01,927
Bobby Hamilton,
my best friend when I was 12.

670
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:05,597
That's when you set your first fire.

671
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:08,475
I didn't set it. Bobby did.

672
00:46:08,684 --> 00:46:10,602
It was all his idea.

673
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:13,147
But then he died and I got caught.

674
00:46:13,355 --> 00:46:15,607
Sent me to the nuthouse
like I was crazy.

675
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:17,860
It's all because of Bobby.
Fucking asshole.

676
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,070
So does he still talk to you?

677
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:22,781
Is Bobby the one telling you
to set these fires?

678
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,160
No, that would make me crazy
and I'm not fucking crazy.

679
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,704
I only hurt people because of Bobby.

680
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,206
No, you're the one
who's setting those fires.

681
00:46:31,415 --> 00:46:33,250
The one who's burning people alive.

682
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:36,837
You can't blame it on something
that happened when you were a kid.

683
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:38,380
You're not a kid anymore.

684
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:42,301
It's time for you
to take responsibility.

685
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:53,145
Fuck.

686
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:03,280
The caller said
they smelled kerosene.

687
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:06,867
Looks like we have the right place.

688
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:22,466
Holy shit.

689
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,803
It's Joe Jensen.
I interviewed this guy.

690
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:29,348
Dumb fuck must've passed out
from the fumes.

691
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:31,391
He's still alive.

692
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,020
I guess we found our Phantom.
Who'd have thought it'd be so easy?

693
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:40,025
- Yeah.
- Guys, come on down.

694
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,956
Got your call. Glad you came
to your senses. You got my money?

695
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:56,375
Yeah. It's right back here.

696
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:02,130
What's with all the plastic?

697
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:09,137
You'll find out soon.

698
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,825
What the hell?

699
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,202
This isn't the way
to make a good impression...

700
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:34,830
...on your girlfriend's father.

701
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:41,712
But I can't allow you to hurt Hannah.

702
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,630
Oh, please.

703
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,883
I won't talk to the cops.
I'll leave town.

704
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:49,469
I promise,
I'll never come near Hannah again.

705
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:51,221
I wish I could believe you.

706
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:55,434
Actually, I don't
because then I couldn't kill you.

707
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:58,979
- Oh, please, you don't have to do this.
- That's what I'm realising.

708
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:00,981
I don't have to.

709
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:04,192
But I want to.

710
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:09,323
Even though you don't meet my code,
I really--

711
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:12,534
I really want to.

712
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:16,413
Because unlike you,
I care about Hannah.

713
00:49:18,332 --> 00:49:20,500
You got the devil inside you, boy.

714
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,839
No, I think it's just me.

715
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:44,191
Sink or swim, Daddy.

716
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:58,163
- Hey, Deb.
- We arrested the Phantom...

717
00:49:58,372 --> 00:50:01,750
...thanks to you. Now I know
why you weren't at The Fox Hole.

718
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,835
- Consider it a gift.
Bullshit.

719
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:05,545
You want something in return.

720
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:08,465
I'm guessing it's for me to lay off
your girlfriend.

721
00:50:08,632 --> 00:50:11,385
- Well, now that you mention it.
- Forget it.

722
00:50:12,636 --> 00:50:14,930
I always give in to you.

723
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:16,973
But not anymore.

724
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,936
I understand.

725
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:33,990
I got the money for my dad.

726
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:37,494
I left him a message.
He should be here soon.

727
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:42,332
He won't be coming.

728
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:43,834
How do you know?

729
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:50,716
I had a talk with him.

730
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:57,222
I made it clear that I wouldn't allow him
to hurt you anymore.

731
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:01,601
And I think he understood.

732
00:51:03,395 --> 00:51:04,646
So he's gone?

733
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,066
He won't be bothering you again.

734
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:17,075
Thank you.

735
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:22,581
The Dark Passenger has been with me
ever since I can remember...

736
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:26,835
...pulling the strings,
running the show.

737
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,921
But as it turns out, I'm no puppet.

738
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,132
And you should know,
you were right.

739
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:33,925
About what?

740
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:37,512
The Dark...

741
00:51:37,888 --> 00:51:39,681
...Rider.

742
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:45,061
He doesn't exist.

743
00:51:51,276 --> 00:51:55,822
Turns out maybe you understand me
a little better than I understand myself.

744
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:02,037
I love you.

745
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,589
I think I love you too.

746
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:34,736
Hey.

747
00:52:34,945 --> 00:52:36,488
I need your help.

748
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:39,032
We need to find a woman
named Arlene Schram.

749
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:40,784
Sure. Who's that?

750
00:52:41,493 --> 00:52:45,163
According to a message I got last night
from Hannah McKay's father...

751
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:47,624
...she's a witness to a murder.
