1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,513
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:13,139
Who is Dexter Morgan?

3
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:16,935
He's just a jerk who works
for Miami Metro Homicide.

4
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:20,897
- That's Dexter Morgan.
- His face...

5
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:22,691
...it looks familiar.

6
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:26,361
Only one person who worked
at Miami Metro took blood slides...

7
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:29,614
...Sergeant Doakes,
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

8
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:35,537
Same type of weapon
used on Mike Anderson.

9
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:39,624
Are we sure this Alex Dubrozny guy
shot Mike Anderson?

10
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,292
Because it smells like a setup.

11
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:44,337
Hannah McKay,
she spent six years in juvie...

12
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:47,048
...after pleading guilty to being
Randall's accomplice.

13
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:50,385
She always claimed she was just
another one of his victims.

14
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:53,179
That what you're doing,
to help us find the other bodies?

15
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:55,432
My lawyer said it was for the best.

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,560
Do you understand your rights?

17
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:01,771
He didn't say, "Yes." He walked.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,025
- There is nothing we can do.
- Fuck that. Fuck all of this.

19
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,194
But there is something I can do.

20
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:12,949
That smoke.

21
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:15,785
It's Speltzer.

22
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,204
How do you feel?

23
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,166
Glad.

24
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,461
What does that make me?

25
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,621
It never ends, does it?
The maintenance.

26
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,373
I don't mind it.

27
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,167
It's the one thing
that never changes.

28
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,086
The waves keep rolling in...

29
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:33,381
...wearing everything down
in their path a little more every day.

30
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,050
Harrison's coming home.
I wanna have the boat ready.

31
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:40,638
- So life's back to normal?
- A new normal.

32
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:44,559
Deb's not poring over
the past anymore.

33
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:48,146
We're on course, moving forward.

34
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,398
Life can be less complicated now.

35
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:51,816
You don't believe that.

36
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:55,278
- Why not? She didn't abandon me.
- She didn't accept you either.

37
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:58,990
- She doesn't know what to think.
- She's adjusting.

38
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:03,536
I did everything in my power to protect
her from you, what you really are.

39
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:06,164
- A monster?
- Your words.

40
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,540
Your thoughts.

41
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:11,878
You didn't think she could handle it
because you couldn't. Deb is stronger.

42
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:13,671
For now.

43
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,965
But the long-term exposure...

44
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:21,054
...it's going to eat away at her,
like salt water on steel.

45
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,857
Blood.

46
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:36,486
It's not from Viktor.
I never leave a mess behind.

47
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,071
Who's been on my boat?

48
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:50,875
This is too much blood.

49
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:53,002
Someone died here.

50
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,297
Someone I didn't kill.

51
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,932
Who are you?

52
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,603
If I'm getting shit-canned
and you know something about it...

53
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,147
...just give me a heads-up, all right?
We're bros.

54
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,657
First of all, we are not
and never will be bros.

55
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:27,328
Secondly, I've told you a million times,
I don't know anything.

56
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:29,831
Really? Then why did your voice
just rise?

57
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,958
Look, I took a class
in paralinguistics.

58
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,711
Change in pitch,
dead giveaway for lying.

59
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,046
Get away from my desk.

60
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:42,343
- Am I getting the axe?
- You are if you don't get out of my way.

61
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:46,389
I got off the phone and LaGuerta's
processing evidence at a private lab.

62
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:47,807
What are you talking about?

63
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:51,894
A charred blood slide containing
the blood of one Travis Marshall.

64
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,897
I asked myself, "Vince, if your
boss is processing evidence...

65
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:58,109
- ...at another lab--"
- Blood slide? Are you certain?

66
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,112
Increase in vocal volume,
indicating emotional dissonance.

67
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,822
You know something. I'm fucked.

68
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:05,366
I am sure that LaGuerta is using
an outside lab...

69
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:08,036
...because she knows
how slammed you are.

70
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:13,624
- I'll look into this, so just fucking relax.
- Okay. Thanks, LT. You rock.

71
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,798
- Got a second?
- Sure.

72
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:26,012
Masuka got wind that you're using
an outside lab to run evidence...

73
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,724
...and he thinks he's gonna get fired.
Is there anything I should know?

74
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,101
I needed a second pair of eyes
on something.

75
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,062
It's nothing.

76
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:39,942
Does this have anything to do
with the Bay Harbor Butcher?

77
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,155
Lundy carried that notebook
everywhere he went.

78
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:47,408
Get the door.

79
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:57,502
This has to remain between
you and me.

80
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,545
Of course.

81
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:03,966
I had a lab analyse a blood slide
that I found at the abandoned church.

82
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,136
A blood slide,
like a Bay Harbor Butcher trophy?

83
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,889
Travis Marshall's blood was on it.

84
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,810
Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher
and Doakes is dead.

85
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,895
Well, what if it wasn't Doakes?

86
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:18,856
What if the Bay Harbor Butcher
is still alive and at work?

87
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:21,109
What if he killed Travis Marshall?

88
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:27,240
Except Travis Marshall wasn't cut up
into pieces and put into bags.

89
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,826
But the fact
that the Bay Harbor Butcher kept...

90
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:32,829
...blood slides was never released
to the public.

91
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:37,834
It's probably not some copycat.
How do you explain this?

92
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,045
I can't.

93
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:45,049
I know it sounds impossible but...

94
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,053
...I never believed that Doakes
was a killer.

95
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,557
And from his notes,
Lundy had his doubts too.

96
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:56,686
Well, you can add me to that list.

97
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,896
Doakes was my partner.

98
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,065
He was a good man.

99
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,904
Is there anything I can do to help?

100
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,702
You have no idea how good it is
to hear you say that.

101
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,038
I've been keeping this all to myself.

102
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,753
Your eyes only.

103
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,464
My eyes only.

104
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,980
Fuck.

105
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:44,650
Fuck.

106
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,696
Motherfucking suck bag.

107
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:53,117
You cock-munching,
fucking fuck nugget.

108
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:58,039
Fuck.

109
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,884
The blood on my boat belongs to...

110
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,803
...Louis Greene?

111
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:15,056
Louis is dead?

112
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,142
Why was he killed on my boat?

113
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:20,853
Why would he have even been
on my boat?

114
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:22,605
Why...

115
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:26,692
- ...Is my sister looking at me like that?
- Dex.

116
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,532
We are in a storm of fuck.

117
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,036
LaGuerta found a slide
with Travis Marshall's blood on it...

118
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:39,497
...at the fucking church.

119
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,211
- That's not good.
- How the fuck do you lose a slide?

120
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,257
Deb, you know that night
wasn't my usual scenario.

121
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,468
Are you saying it's my fault...

122
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,221
...LaGuerta thinks
the Bay Harbor Butcher is alive?

123
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,016
No, that's not what I meant but...

124
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:03,562
...that night at the church
wasn't exactly by the playbook.

125
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,191
I talked LaGuerta into letting me help
with the investigation...

126
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,318
...so I can keep tabs
on what's happening.

127
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:12,613
You what? No.

128
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:15,491
I'll deal with this.
I don't want you involved.

129
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,703
Well, it's a little fucking late for that.

130
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:22,415
She wants to talk to the friends
and family of everyone on this list...

131
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,542
...who's gone missing
since Doakes died.

132
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,713
They all the fit the victim profile
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.

133
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,340
Anyone here that you recognise?

134
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:40,182
These three are mine.

135
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,270
This is never gonna end, is it?

136
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,063
They were bad people, Deb...

137
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,983
...who would've continued
to do bad things.

138
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:53,612
This is the only one
with family in Miami: Phillip Barnes.

139
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,532
So when LaGuerta and I
split up the list...

140
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,367
...I'll make sure I get his family.

141
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:01,787
- No, I don't like you doing this.
- I don't give a fuck...

142
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,582
...what you like, Dexter.

143
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,668
It's beyond that. This is my ass too.

144
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,715
Tell me what I need to know
about Barnes.

145
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:20,181
He was a wedding photographer.

146
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:27,897
He would find a guest from out
of town. Young, female, by herself.

147
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,941
He would charm her,
invite her back to his hotel.

148
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,279
She'd never come home.

149
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:39,158
He took pictures of what he did.

150
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,288
So, what did you do?

151
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,917
He was going out of town
for another job...

152
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:51,712
...so I nabbed him after a reception.

153
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,673
A reception?

154
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:57,134
A fucking wedding reception?

155
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:01,389
Dexter, what if Barnes
got a picture of you?

156
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:04,475
- Deb, it was a wedding.
- What if someone remembers you?

157
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:08,020
Everyone was concentrating on the
bride and groom. I slipped in and out.

158
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,980
It's fine.

159
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:14,110
- What if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

160
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:19,115
LaGuerta will not tie me to this.
There's no body, no proof.

161
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,492
Stay away from it, okay?

162
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:34,422
First thing I have to do is find out
why Louis was killed on my boat.

163
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,425
My curtains are open.

164
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:40,636
With Harrison gone,
Jamie is not around.

165
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:43,222
Someone has been
in my apartment.

166
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,599
Maybe still is.

167
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:58,737
Hey, Dex. It's Sam.

168
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:02,783
Just wanna confirm we're still on
for 1:00 at Schooner or Later...

169
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:08,122
...at 12th and Bayshore Drive.
See you there.

170
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,059
I've met him before at the bar
at The Fox Hole...

171
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,645
...owned by the Koshka Brotherhood.

172
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:34,148
The man who killed Mike Anderson,
Viktor Baskov...

173
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,983
...was one of the Koshkas.

174
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:40,279
Could they have figured out I killed
Viktor and sent a hit man after me?

175
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:00,508
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

176
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:03,135
I think I have a phone call for you.

177
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,597
A small coffee, please.

178
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,643
- Hello?
- Why were you in my apartment?

179
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:14,063
Well, aren't you Mr. Smarty-Pants?

180
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,316
Answer the question.
What were you doing in my place?

181
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:21,445
I was looking to have a discussion
about a friend who's gone missing.

182
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:23,989
Viktor. I'm sure you remember him.

183
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,033
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

184
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:29,078
- I don't care for lies.
- I told you, I don't know who that is.

185
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,913
You're wasting both our time.

186
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,667
Louis Greene,
who I found on your boat...

187
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,045
...the boat that was used
to dump Viktor in the ocean...

188
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:42,132
- ...gave me your name.
- So you killed Louis.

189
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:46,345
We had a conversation
that ended rather abruptly, yes.

190
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:48,389
What else did Louis say?

191
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:52,059
I believe he may have referred
to you as a douche bag.

192
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:55,437
- You think you're very clever.
- I do, actually, yes.

193
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,648
Your bosses
at the Koshka Brotherhood...

194
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,525
...they sent you?

195
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,486
You've done your homework.

196
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,614
There are no bosses telling me
what to do.

197
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,908
Viktor was a friend of mine.
This is personal.

198
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,535
So an eye for an eye, huh?

199
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,246
Your friend Viktor kills
an innocent woman and a cop...

200
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,999
...and killing me somehow
settles the score?

201
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,750
Oh, you misunderstand me.

202
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,044
I'm not stopping with you.

203
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:22,965
I also want any of your police officer
friends involved in this little vendetta.

204
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,759
- Wait.
- Including your lieutenant sister.

205
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,720
I've done my homework too.

206
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,139
It was just me.
She had nothing to do with this.

207
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,143
Hello, handsome.

208
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,061
I work alone.

209
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,940
I killed Viktor, only me.
I'll see you around.

210
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,859
That's the plan.

211
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,865
Why in fuckville are you telling me
to meet you in the parking garage?

212
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,742
Because of him.

213
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,578
- Do you wanna be more specific?
- His name is Isaak Sirko.

214
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,498
He's part of the Koshka Brotherhood.
He's after me.

215
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,168
But don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of it.

216
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,837
- What did you do?
- But you could be in danger too.

217
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:04,715
That's why you need to know.
That's why we're meeting--

218
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,800
- Dex.
- But I'm gonna handle this.

219
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,011
Why is he after you?

220
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,639
Viktor Baskov.

221
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,976
Viktor Baskov disappeared.

222
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:23,233
- You killed him.
- He killed Mike Anderson.

223
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,986
What about the guy
that said he killed Mike?

224
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,072
The bartender
that blew his brains out?

225
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,658
Someone put him up to it,
Isaak probably.

226
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:33,744
So that you would close the case
and move on.

227
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,913
This is un-fucking-real.

228
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,333
Viktor Baskov was on his way back
to Kiev. I had to kill him.

229
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,251
I didn't have any time.
There wasn't--

230
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,754
Time? You didn't have time
to make a phone call...

231
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,006
...so that I could arrest him
or something?

232
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,884
- His flight was leaving.
- His fl--

233
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,886
How do you know he killed Mike?

234
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,557
I found his fingerprint at the scene.

235
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,978
And you didn't tell me?

236
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,732
You kept it from
the Police Department?

237
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:10,072
Dexter, what happened
to you only taking care of people...

238
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,325
...that slip through the cracks
of the justice system?

239
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,910
You can't rip a case open...

240
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,497
- ...so that it falls into your fucking lap.
- I know.

241
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:22,876
Obviously you don't know, Dexter,
because this is normal for you.

242
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:26,839
But trust me, this is not
fucking normal for me, not at all.

243
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,799
How am I supposed to do my job?

244
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,260
Which is the be-all, end-all
of hypocrisy...

245
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:33,470
...because I am the lieutenant
of Homicide...

246
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:37,224
...and I have already helped you
cover up two murders.

247
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,059
Three. This makes three.

248
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:43,814
And the fucking bartender.
Oh, my fucking God. Oh, my God.

249
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,275
How did this become my life?

250
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,904
- Deb, where are you going?
- I'm gonna arrest Isaak.

251
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,656
- Take him to jail.
- On what charge?

252
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,491
- I'll find something!
- No.

253
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,830
We can't--
I can't afford to risk him talking.

254
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:06,837
Look, I will handle this, but until I do,
we need to take extra precautions.

255
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:11,049
Isaak is convinced
that there's some police conspiracy.

256
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:15,429
He thinks we all killed Viktor,
so you're at risk too.

257
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,724
- What?
- But I can keep you safe.

258
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,268
We're gonna go to a hotel.

259
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:23,729
A place where no one knows
who we are...

260
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:27,524
...no one asks any questions,
a place where we'll both be safe.

261
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:30,319
This is fucking fantastic.

262
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,322
He might be watching the precinct,
your home.

263
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,783
I need you to take a car
from the motor pool...

264
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,118
...make sure you never
leave the same way twice.

265
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:41,371
Make sure no one follows you.
I'll do the same.

266
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:45,542
- I need you to promise me something.
- What?

267
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:50,839
That you will never take a case
from the Police Department again...

268
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,885
- ...from me, ever.
- Okay.

269
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,054
Are you lying to me?

270
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,807
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?

271
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:03,143
- You don't fucking think so?
- I'm not lying.

272
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:07,356
I have no way of knowing, do I?

273
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,371
When you begin a stalk,
you start with what you know.

274
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,749
And with Isaak, that isn't much.

275
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,772
Isaak isn't just some hit man.
He's a boss.

276
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,703
- Yes?
- Dexter, Hannah McKay...

277
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,246
...is on her way in.

278
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,748
I'm kind of tied up with something
right now.

279
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,751
Dexter, Hannah is gonna
talk us through her road trip...

280
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,796
...with Wayne Randall and help us
find the rest of the bodies.

281
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:15,382
This is important. Get here now.

282
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:18,135
Right. I'm on my way.

283
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,853
In that first week...

284
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,356
...Wayne shot a gas station attendant
in Ashford, Alabama.

285
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,859
That's where these are from.

286
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:40,032
And Wayne shot another attendant
in Lake City, Florida.

287
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:51,084
And then he shot a guy outside
of Sarasota...

288
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,254
...who stopped to help you fix a flat.

289
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:01,929
You then get picked up in Miami
trying to sneak on board a cruise ship.

290
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,806
That week you guys were in Miami...

291
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,477
...that's the story we don't know.

292
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:13,106
The people Wayne killed,
the bodies we'd like to find.

293
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,151
It looks like it starts here.

294
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:23,617
We got to Miami and
we were the only thing on the news.

295
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:27,454
We were desperate.
No money, cops everywhere.

296
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:30,082
Wayne decided that we would
hide out in the motels...

297
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,669
...until we could make it
to that cruise ship.

298
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:39,591
He killed people
so we could take their rooms.

299
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,930
We buried the bodies close
to the motels.

300
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,850
- Where were the motels?
- One was by a Frosty Swirl.

301
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:52,270
- Wayne's favourite.
- That's where Ms. Dubois was found.

302
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,524
- What about these?
- Those two go together.

303
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:59,903
- Together?
- They were a couple.

304
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,322
Husband and wife, I guess.

305
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:05,826
- Where are they buried?
- Close to one of the ports.

306
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:10,038
- I remember big ships unloading.
- And the motel?

307
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:13,750
Small, one storey, I think...

308
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:18,380
...I would recognise it, but so much
of that time is just a blur, you know?

309
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:24,177
Everything changed in Miami.
Wayne, most of all.

310
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:29,725
I was so scared.
I thought that he was gonna kill me.

311
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:33,353
He forced me to dig those holes and
every time that I dug one of them...

312
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:37,524
...I wasn't sure if I was digging
my own grave or not.

313
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:41,069
I understand how difficult this is
for you, but if you'll excuse me...

314
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:46,491
...I'm gonna get the ball rolling
on the next dig. Tomorrow if possible.

315
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,827
Sure. I'd like to get this over with.

316
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:07,679
That toy isn't bringing back
memories of being scared.

317
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,765
She's nostalgic.

318
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,850
No touching.

319
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,232
Can I have your giraffe back,
please?

320
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,903
It's Wayne's.

321
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:24,905
Wayne's giraffe.

322
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,532
It was wrapped in your shirt.

323
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,119
What, are you a detective now too?

324
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,045
Sergeant Batista will give you
the details for tomorrow.

325
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,007
Will you be there?

326
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:48,970
I hope so.

327
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:01,942
Killing Isaak would make
a lot of Koshkas very angry.

328
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,824
But a lot of Colombians very happy.

329
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:12,994
The goddamn shower has
two settings, scalding and freezing.

330
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,872
It's a cheap motel. That's the point.

331
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,834
I'm not doing this another night.

332
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:22,254
Hopefully you won't have to.

333
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:25,173
Does that mean
you're working on a solution?

334
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,510
I have a plan, yes.

335
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:31,054
Does it involve you killing someone?

336
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:35,934
I'm not killing anybody.

337
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,189
That's my bed.

338
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,984
Closest to the door.

339
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,496
- Tell me your plan.
- No.

340
00:24:56,955 --> 00:25:01,168
Dexter, I'm hiding out in this
fucking motel room. I'm a part of this.

341
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:04,129
But not any more
than you need to be.

342
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,557
This is not how I ever imagined
spending tonight.

343
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,102
We've stayed in hotel rooms before.

344
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:26,026
Yeah, when we went to Myrtle Beach
to visit Mom's sister.

345
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:32,490
There were seashells embedded
in the plaster in the walls.

346
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,871
No air-conditioning, just ceiling fans.

347
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,957
There was sand
from the beach everywhere.

348
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,251
Even in the beds.

349
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,382
You kept your eyes on me all day.

350
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,762
I didn't want you to drown.

351
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,478
You were my hero.

352
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,698
Good boy. Good.

353
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,704
Hot as hell out here...

354
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:22,415
...even with the ocean breeze.

355
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,543
Think we'll find anything?

356
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,047
The motel Hannah and Wayne
stayed at is still here.

357
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:34,511
Nothing's changed much
since their spree.

358
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,554
Pretty good odds.

359
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,395
Can I ask you something?

360
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:50,902
This bartender who shot himself,
Alex Dubrozny.

361
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,115
Do you think it's a suicide?

362
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:59,119
Masuka matched his handwriting
to the note he left.

363
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:01,913
His fingerprints were on the gun,
GSR on the hand.

364
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,665
He definitely pulled the trigger.

365
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,212
Fucking bugs.

366
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,717
I'm gonna go get some spray
from the car.

367
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,932
This part of the job?

368
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,810
Stand around and stare?

369
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,314
I'm not needed unless
there's a body or blood.

370
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,442
I don't know how you do it.

371
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:36,364
First time Wayne killed somebody,
he shot him right in the chest and I...

372
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:42,037
I couldn't move. Never seen
that much blood in my life.

373
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,791
First crime scene I ever worked...

374
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,212
...a woman stabbed her husband
after fixing him a sandwich.

375
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:54,007
By the time I got there,
he looked like he was asleep...

376
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:59,929
...just floating on a sea of red
and the sandwich next to his head.

377
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:03,850
Seemed so sad
that no one was gonna eat it.

378
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,355
Look at us talking blood and gore
like we're on a date...

379
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:11,107
...sharing our
first sexual experience.

380
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,197
I've got work to do.

381
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:26,915
There you are.

382
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:29,334
Aren't you supposed to be talking
to the Connors?

383
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,169
They were less than cooperative.

384
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:35,173
This was on my way back
to the station, so I thought I'd sit in.

385
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:37,133
Great.

386
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,226
Hi. I'm Captain Maria LaGuerta,
Miami Metro...

387
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,186
...and this is
Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

388
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:50,480
I talked to your morn, Patricia.
Is she home?

389
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,816
No, sorry.
She got called into work.

390
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:56,528
- Oh, we'll come back.
- Is this about my dad?

391
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,446
She said you guys had called.

392
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,949
I could try to answer any questions,
if you want.

393
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:05,036
- That would be very helpful.
- Yeah.

394
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,457
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

395
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,796
When was the last time
you saw your father?

396
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,510
May 19th, 2007.
The best fucking day of my life.

397
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,720
How so?

398
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,390
Because he never came back.

399
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:29,310
So wasn't it hard growing up
without a father?

400
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,855
It was a lot better
than growing up with a father...

401
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,149
...who beat me and my mom
every chance he got.

402
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:36,734
I'm sorry.

403
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:39,279
Then one night,
he didn't come home.

404
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:41,614
I swear everything got better.

405
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,284
My morn wasn't crying all the time...

406
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:47,078
...and I wasn't constantly looking
over my shoulder.

407
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,789
Ty, you mentioned the last time
you saw your father...

408
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,624
...he was working a wedding?

409
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,003
Yeah, my mom printed out some
pictures for you from that night.

410
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,505
- She thought you might want them.
- Great.

411
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,761
What are you hoping
to find in these pictures?

412
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,680
Special Agent Lundy
had this theory...

413
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,475
...that the Bay Harbor Butcher
was in law enforcement.

414
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:10,393
If Barnes was killed by the Butcher--

415
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,479
His face might be
in one of the pictures.

416
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,899
We might even know him. Or her.

417
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,070
- Would you mind?
- Yeah, no.

418
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,953
Okay.

419
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,335
What are you looking for exactly?

420
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:38,213
We think your father
may have been abducted...

421
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,423
...and murdered
the night he disappeared...

422
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:43,551
...and the person responsible
could be in these pictures.

423
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:48,264
Mom would finally know
he's not coming home.

424
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:51,351
This is a big wedding.
A lot of pictures.

425
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,979
You know, maybe I should
take these back to the station...

426
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:57,607
...and spend the day
going over them.

427
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:03,196
You're right.

428
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,906
We shouldn't rush this.

429
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:08,076
Thank you, Ty. Thanks.

430
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,455
Right here. Put it down.

431
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,005
Go ahead, detective.

432
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:32,183
"Till death do us part"
didn't quite work out for these guys.

433
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:36,354
Get it? Because they're dead
but they're still together.

434
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:38,064
Okay, moving on.

435
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:42,485
Shower curtain helped preserve
the bodies and the clothes.

436
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,696
Our lucky day.

437
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:55,290
It's a safe assumption
that Wayne started with the male.

438
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:59,002
Would've been important
to immobilise him first...

439
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:02,797
...because he presented
the biggest threat.

440
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,425
There are defensive wounds
on the arms and the hands.

441
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:06,759
He put up a fight.

442
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,846
Judging from the cuts in the fabric...

443
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:12,974
...we're looking at perhaps
a 6-inch knife.

444
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,227
Numerous shallow wounds...

445
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:21,691
...until Wayne was able to inflict this,
the fatal wound.

446
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:23,776
Once he was done with him...

447
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:29,282
...he moved on to the female victim.

448
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:32,952
Stabbed numerous times.

449
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:39,500
The spatter pattern suggests
the victim fell on her back.

450
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:43,755
And these voids here
likely indicate that...

451
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,965
...she was straddled
by her assailant.

452
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:49,093
Who was much smaller
than Wayne.

453
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,512
If Wayne didn't kill this person...

454
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,187
Dexter.

455
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,689
What does it mean?

456
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,692
I'm not sure.
It could mean a lot of things.

457
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:08,696
I won't know until I get back to the lab
and run some tests.

458
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:13,034
I guess we're done here.

459
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:29,759
- Why did you stop?
- Stop what?

460
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,512
You started to describe
how Wayne killed that girl...

461
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,724
...and you got halfway through
and then you stopped.

462
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,601
Yeah, I did.

463
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:43,398
- And then you looked right at me.
- I did.

464
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,108
Why?

465
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:50,780
The spatter told me a story
that conflicts what you say happened.

466
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:53,700
Really?

467
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,952
How so?

468
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,915
How did you get this?

469
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:06,421
It's a little something I got
for talking back to Wayne.

470
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:11,634
- He got angry and slashed at me.
- Bullshit.

471
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:16,597
- Do you know something that I don't?
- Wayne didn't kill that woman.

472
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:20,351
He was too busy with the male.
It was someone smaller.

473
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,525
Someone with a different knife
who was inexperienced.

474
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:30,903
Got carried away
with the frenzy of the moment.

475
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:34,073
Stabbed the woman over and over
until the knife got so bloody...

476
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:38,077
...her hand slipped along the edge
of the sharp blade...

477
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:42,290
...cutting her palm very deeply,
exactly like yours...

478
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:47,462
...leaving a passive spatter stain
on the victim's dress.

479
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,716
Everything you said is a lie.

480
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,721
That's my story.

481
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,682
And I'm sticking to it.

482
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:02,393
And you don't even care.

483
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:06,981
You have immunity, don't you?

484
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:11,235
The DA gave you immunity
for cooperating with us.

485
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:16,574
From any crime committed
with Wayne, yeah. Yeah.

486
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,577
A girl's gotta protect herself.

487
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:25,416
I'll see you around, Dexter Morgan.

488
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:48,105
Isaak. I knew
you would show up eventually.

489
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:22,431
Don't worry. I'm not gonna lose you.

490
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,801
Welcome to the wrong side of town,
Isaak.

491
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:11,022
Not used to strangers here.

492
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:12,857
Koshkas.

493
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:16,694
And certainly not used
to their sworn enemies walking in.

494
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:22,533
But Isaak, being from out of town,
won't know any of this.

495
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:00,237
Definitely not as much fun as
putting Isaak on my table.

496
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,281
But it does mask his death...

497
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,910
...as the resulting war
between rival heroin dealers.

498
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:11,457
Who's saving whose ass now?

499
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:26,847
- What's up?
- I know you're busy.

500
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:30,017
I also want you to know
that I'm not trying to stir up any shit.

501
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:31,769
Of course not.

502
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:36,190
It's about this
Alex Dubrozny suicide.

503
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,156
There's something about this guy
being Anderson's killer...

504
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,950
...that's just not right.

505
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,286
Sorry. It's Dispatch.

506
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,872
Sergeant Batista.

507
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,713
Okay. Got it.

508
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:00,464
Gonna have to rain check this.

509
00:39:00,673 --> 00:39:03,676
Homicide at a Colombian hangout.

510
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,594
Got blood, Dexter.

511
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:07,596
- Where we going?
- Mateo's Bar.

512
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:10,224
- Know it?
- Nope.

513
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,519
I'll meet you there.

514
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,151
Holy shit.

515
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,740
It's like somebody turned on the hose
and sprayed blood everywhere.

516
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:26,991
Great.

517
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,786
I left Isaak here outnumbered
and expected to find only his body.

518
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:33,581
So where is he now?

519
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,499
Do we know these guys?

520
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:39,879
This is Andres Rodriguez.
He's a member of the Rojas Cartel.

521
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:42,923
We ran into each other a few times
when I worked Narcotics.

522
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,051
Is it possible Isaak did all of this?

523
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:48,095
Why do drug hits
have to be so messy?

524
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:49,930
You gotta make a big show.

525
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:53,809
Who you think is good for this?
The 87's?

526
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:58,397
- Or the Koshka Brotherhood.
- Koshkas?

527
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,194
What happened here, Dex?

528
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:08,657
Considering this one
was closest to the door...

529
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:13,245
...he's probably first to see
the attacker, first to respond.

530
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:16,415
He drew his gun
as the attacker fired.

531
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:21,712
The misting on the jukebox...

532
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:26,634
...and the wall indicates multiple
bullet hits all through and through.

533
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:32,807
- Victim number two.
- Looks like he got a shot off.

534
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:39,396
But, that didn't stop the assault.

535
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,732
The attacker returned fire.

536
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:54,370
Twice in the chest,
once in the stomach.

537
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:57,331
Judging from the lack of pooling
around the body suggests...

538
00:40:57,498 --> 00:41:00,126
...that the victim was dead
before the third shot.

539
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:03,712
Wait. How many people
were here shooting?

540
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,091
There's only evidence of one killer.

541
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:12,721
- One brutally efficient killer.
- Jesus, fuck.

542
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:21,230
Looks like our attacker
ran out of bullets right around here.

543
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,283
It's from a defensive wound.

544
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:36,662
Looks like it was a deep cut,
forearm maybe.

545
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:38,747
Obviously not fatal.

546
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:45,504
The attacker grabbed the nearest
weapon, hit his victim over the head...

547
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:50,176
...inflicted a massive skull fracture...

548
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:58,517
...and walked right out the door.

549
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:00,978
So, we're looking
for the fucking Terminator.

550
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,525
Let's get the blood
running through the system.

551
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:09,820
Maybe we can match it to a name.

552
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:13,657
Everybody outside. Let's let Dexter
and Masuka do their thing.

553
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:17,244
Sarge, you mind
if I run an errand real quick?

554
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:24,752
Was this part
of your fantastic plan?

555
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,837
I never said my plan was fantastic...

556
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:30,549
...but no, this is not
how I thought it would go.

557
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:33,969
Do we have an even bigger problem
on our hands now?

558
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:36,180
Not if we can find a match
for this blood.

559
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:37,973
You'll be able to make an arrest.

560
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:40,309
The sooner the better.

561
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:44,313
I couldn't agree more.

562
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,444
Right here, baby.

563
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:56,575
Your car is fixed.
You have to start using it.

564
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:58,661
But I like having a chauffeur.

565
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:01,664
Come on.
Let me show you how much I like it.

566
00:43:01,872 --> 00:43:04,083
I wish I could, but I have work to do.

567
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:06,669
Oh, just forget about work.

568
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:13,175
We're gonna have to
fucking pay them back.

569
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:15,386
I'll get some guys,
do it myself if you want.

570
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:17,137
- No.
- Well, they're sure as shit...

571
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:19,098
...gonna come after us.

572
00:43:19,265 --> 00:43:21,642
And we can't sit around
and do nothing.

573
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:24,019
Shit.

574
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:27,231
We don't need a cop here now.

575
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,859
- Who is he?
- Joey Quinn.

576
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:33,779
He came up from Narcotics,
and now he's Homicide.

577
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:36,323
We used to have
an understanding with him.

578
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:37,992
What kind of understanding?

579
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,412
Leave a bag of cash in his car,
and he'd do whatever we asked.

580
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,248
Mostly just look the other way.

581
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:22,578
Fuck.

582
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:54,443
Well?

583
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:17,007
Lieutenant,
are the cuffs necessary?

584
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,219
Probably not.

585
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:23,305
Would your client
like to have a little chat with us?

586
00:45:23,514 --> 00:45:25,057
My client has nothing to say.

587
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:27,768
He's exercising
his American right to silence.

588
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:31,855
Well, fucking God bless America.
Get this guy to Booking.

589
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:35,067
Your client's going to jail
for the rest of his life.

590
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:39,738
Nice to meet you,
Lieutenant Morgan.

591
00:45:45,536 --> 00:45:47,830
Maybe now that lsaak's behind bars,
we can have...

592
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:50,707
...that face-to-face
he's been so desperate for.

593
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:04,596
So you got Isaak Sirko.

594
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:07,641
We got Isaak Sirko.

595
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,561
Congratulations. It's a big deal.

596
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,025
May I?

597
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:29,580
- Our earlier conversation.
- Right.

598
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:34,251
I don't think Alex Dubrozny
shot Mike Anderson.

599
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:36,962
It doesn't make any sense.

600
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:39,298
Alex has been in this country
for two years...

601
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:42,050
...and according to every stripper
I interviewed...

602
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:45,262
...all he talked about
was his wife and his kids.

603
00:46:45,471 --> 00:46:48,849
He didn't show
any interest towards Kaja.

604
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:51,977
I think someone put Alex up to this.

605
00:46:52,186 --> 00:46:55,522
Someone connected to Isaak Sirko.

606
00:46:55,731 --> 00:47:01,028
Deb, I still think Viktor Baskov
killed Mike Anderson...

607
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:03,363
...and Viktor just disappeared
into thin air.

608
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:05,866
- But if we can find--
- Sergeant.

609
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:11,330
- Your dedication is admirable.
- Deb, you don't have to talk like that.

610
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:12,748
- It's--
- And a year ago...

611
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:16,627
...I might have been right beside you,
fighting for what I thought was right.

612
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:20,214
But the hardest lesson
that I've learned as lieutenant...

613
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:22,966
...is knowing when
to back the fuck down.

614
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:28,430
You don't believe me?

615
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:31,308
You don't have concrete evidence
to support your theory.

616
00:47:31,517 --> 00:47:33,894
And I can't afford to reopen
a murder investigation.

617
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,522
This isn't any murder investigation.
This is Mike.

618
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,398
- He--
- Mike's killer's dead.

619
00:47:41,443 --> 00:47:43,487
Mike got justice.

620
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:47,866
Let it go.

621
00:47:49,535 --> 00:47:51,411
That's an order.

622
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,505
Okay, lieutenant.

623
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:04,049
You got it.

624
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:48,677
- Hello, Isaak.
- Hello, Dexter.

625
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:51,013
I underestimated you.

626
00:48:51,221 --> 00:48:52,723
You come here to taunt me?

627
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,516
I thought maybe you could help me.

628
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:59,104
Why is it so important
that you kill me?

629
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:02,482
Well, it's quite simple, really.

630
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:06,236
You killed Viktor. I liked Viktor.

631
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:10,657
Like or not,
he killed Mike Anderson.

632
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:13,869
Is that why you killed him?
Revenge?

633
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:15,871
Yes.

634
00:49:17,414 --> 00:49:21,376
There was the briefest flicker
of hesitation there.

635
00:49:23,545 --> 00:49:25,797
But if you're telling the truth...

636
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:28,216
...then you don't require
any explanation.

637
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:31,011
You understand the need
for vengeance.

638
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:36,767
So you got arrested. There'll be a trial.
You'll go to prison for a long time.

639
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:38,769
Does that mean this is over?

640
00:49:42,773 --> 00:49:45,233
- Over?
- Yes.

641
00:49:48,779 --> 00:49:50,864
I had a great uncle...

642
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:53,909
...my grandfather's brother.

643
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:55,702
He was a hero.

644
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:59,164
Fought with the Red Army
during the Second World War.

645
00:49:59,623 --> 00:50:05,087
When he returned to Kiev afterwards,
some fat, little party official...

646
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:08,882
...resented the fact
that everyone admired him...

647
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:12,052
...so he decided
to make an example of him...

648
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,262
...by taking away his house.

649
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:18,183
When my great uncle protested...

650
00:50:18,392 --> 00:50:21,812
...he was hung
in front of the council chambers.

651
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:25,774
My grandfather was just a teenager.

652
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:28,485
When that party official saw
the hatred in his eyes...

653
00:50:28,694 --> 00:50:31,988
...he had him arrested
and sent to Siberia.

654
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:35,575
And the years rolled by.

655
00:50:36,243 --> 00:50:40,205
And my grandfather got on
with his life as best he could.

656
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:43,375
He was a patient man.

657
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:52,509
Finally, when the Soviet Union fell,
he returned to Kiev...

658
00:50:52,718 --> 00:50:57,472
...and celebrated in front of city hall
with all the others.

659
00:50:58,223 --> 00:51:02,769
And that's when he found
that fat, little party official...

660
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:08,400
...and he got to enjoy the pleasure
that belonged to him and him alone...

661
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:15,282
...by sticking a 6-inch knife into
that fat, little man's kidney.

662
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:21,705
So you ask me if this is over.

663
00:51:23,165 --> 00:51:24,958
No.

664
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,918
I'm afraid not.

665
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,632
- There's only one problem.
- And that is?

666
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:35,051
I'm not some fat, little man.

667
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:39,514
That's true.

668
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:42,350
I don't know who you are.

669
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:47,856
If you ever find out, you'll regret it.

670
00:51:57,908 --> 00:51:59,826
Hey. Come on in.

671
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:01,661
See this?

672
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:04,039
What is it?

673
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:06,708
It's me lifeguarding your ass
for a change.

674
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:10,670
I took it from LaGuerta.

675
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:18,428
- I told you to stay clear of this.
- Well, you're lucky I didn't.

676
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:22,891
- Deb--
- She would've seen you, Dexter.

677
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:30,232
So you saved me.

678
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,360
Yeah.

679
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,950
Thanks.

680
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,162
That's yours. It's not mine.

681
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:48,291
I don't wanna be involved in
that part of your life.

682
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,460
I don't want you to be.

683
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:53,296
I know you're not gonna stop.

684
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:57,300
But I don't wanna know about it.

685
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:00,387
Okay.

686
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:04,975
I had to lie to Batista.

687
00:53:06,393 --> 00:53:09,271
Batista. For you.

688
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:14,401
And that was the moment I realised
that I don't wanna be a part of this.

689
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,444
I can't do it.

690
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:23,076
It took me forever
to wrap my brain around the idea...

691
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:25,662
...that you're not
who I thought you were.

692
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:31,001
But it doesn't mean
I have to change.

693
00:53:34,546 --> 00:53:38,466
All of your stealing and your lying
and your covering up...

694
00:53:39,885 --> 00:53:41,595
...that's not me.

695
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:56,109
So you think
LaGuerta's investigation is closed?

696
00:54:01,865 --> 00:54:03,241
No.

697
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:06,369
Lundy didn't figure me out.

698
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:10,290
No reason to think LaGuerta will.

699
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:21,718
Oh, if Lundy could see me now.

700
00:54:24,888 --> 00:54:26,723
And you.

701
00:54:36,483 --> 00:54:39,903
I've been thinking about our vacation
to Myrtle Beach a lot.

702
00:54:40,779 --> 00:54:42,989
How we spent our days.

703
00:54:43,865 --> 00:54:45,784
On the beach.

704
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:49,204
Running up and down the shore.

705
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:51,873
And at low tide,
running in and out of the water.

706
00:54:52,082 --> 00:54:53,959
I was always chasing you.

707
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,086
I could never catch you.

708
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:59,714
You wouldn't take off your flippers.

709
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:07,305
Even if I did, you were always...

710
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:09,891
...just out of reach.

711
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:15,271
Maybe, we're learning
it's better that way.

712
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,825
Did you get the blood report back
on the bodies from the dig?

713
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,576
Yeah.

714
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:31,746
And?

715
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:35,458
Anything I should know?

716
00:55:38,712 --> 00:55:40,338
Nope.

717
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:11,036
As kids, Deb and I
would try to outrun the waves...

718
00:56:11,244 --> 00:56:13,830
...but I would always end up
diving under them.

719
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:18,418
I would swim deep because I could
withstand the pull of the tide.

720
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:30,722
But Deb was always safest
at shore.

721
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:36,519
From here on out,
I'll face the depths by myself.
