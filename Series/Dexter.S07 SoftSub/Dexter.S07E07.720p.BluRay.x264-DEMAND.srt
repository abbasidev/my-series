1
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:12,263
Previously on Dexter:

2
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:16,351
This blood
is from a defensive wound.

3
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,563
So you got arrested, there'll be a trial,
you'll go to prison for a long time.

4
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:23,858
- Does that mean this is over?
- No.

5
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:25,568
These men are dangerous.

6
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:28,405
You should not get involved
with the Koshka Brotherhood.

7
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:32,158
Don't be scared. I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

8
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:33,410
Where's Nadia?

9
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:37,580
Sirko wants you to lose the evidence
linking him to the Colombian murders.

10
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:41,167
- If I do this, Nadia is a free woman.
- Deal.

11
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:43,294
What was Price doing here?

12
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:45,755
He heard we dug up more
Wayne Randall victims...

13
00:00:45,964 --> 00:00:47,632
...asked if he could see the files.

14
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:50,885
- I fudged the blood report.
- The void pattern on this body...

15
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:53,596
...indicates a killer much smaller
than Wayne Randall.

16
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:58,309
- Smaller, like Hannah McKay?
- And I think she kept right on killing.

17
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:01,229
If that's true, we're totally fucked.
We gave her immunity.

18
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:03,189
So how'd he die? Your husband?

19
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:05,692
Heart attack.

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,861
She killed her husband, I can feel it.

21
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,489
"Aconite."
ingesting it causes heart attack.

22
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,537
Do what you gotta do.

23
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:27,672
Dexter...

24
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:31,754
Chemistry.
I've heard some people have it.

25
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:35,925
An attraction that can't be quantified
or explained.

26
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:38,887
Is that the reason behind this?

27
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,890
Loss of control?

28
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,851
Maybe the desire to get Hannah
on my table was just a way...

29
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,478
...to deny the effect she has on me.

30
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,648
So now what?

31
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,622
- How do you like it?
- Not much.

32
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,834
You do this to all the girls
that you go outwith?

33
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:13,838
- Wrap them up in plastic?
- I don't actually go out.

34
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:19,344
So, what, this whole date thing was just
to get me alone so you can kill me?

35
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,059
Why?

36
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,438
It's what I do.

37
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,609
You kill people.

38
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,153
Bad people.

39
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,366
So you think I'm bad.

40
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,203
You...

41
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,790
You fit the general description.

42
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,000
You have no idea.

43
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:20,279
I didn't plan to spend the whole evening
talking about Hannah McKay.

44
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:23,574
Well, what do you wanna talk about?
The economy?

45
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:27,954
I don't know.
What kind of music you like?

46
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,128
A jailhouse door slamming shut.
That's my idea of music.

47
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:41,592
I don't know what's driving me crazier,
Hannah McKay getting away...

48
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,721
...with a shitload of murder,
or you chewing on that straw.

49
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,305
Old habits die hard.

50
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:51,477
You know, it's gonna be a real downer
for your book if Hannah gets away.

51
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:57,108
People who buy true crime stuff tend
to like it when the bad guy gets caught.

52
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,318
Maybe I can help you
rewrite the ending.

53
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:04,907
- So now you're an editor.
- I'm thinking about Hannah's husband.

54
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:07,827
Forty year olds don't just drop dead
of a heart attack.

55
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:10,455
I could have the body exhumed,
test it for aconite.

56
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:11,789
It's been 10 years.

57
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:15,877
If it's there, the tox screen will find it.
The hard part is getting permission.

58
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:19,130
Hannah's the next of kin,
and I doubt she's gonna sign off on it.

59
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,633
She's not the only next of kin.
Hannah's husband had a sister.

60
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:24,927
Well, aren't you
a goddamn know-it-all?

61
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:30,767
- It's not my only virtue.
- That remains to be seen.

62
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,316
Thank you for dinner.

63
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:55,374
- We should do it again.
- Yeah, why not?

64
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,844
I'll check my notes on the sister
and get back to you.

65
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:32,328
Chemistry deals with the reactions
between elementary forms of matter.

66
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:36,207
Separate the elements,
and you negate the reaction.

67
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,459
- This can't happen again.
- Which part?

68
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,670
- The horse tranquilizer?
- The sex part.

69
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,089
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

70
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:47,260
- Why?
- We both know it wouldn't end well.

71
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,638
- Just tell me something.
- What?

72
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,850
You're not gonna try and kill me, right.
I have the right to know.

73
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,310
If I was, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

74
00:07:56,477 --> 00:08:00,022
Let's just think of it
as a misunderstanding.

75
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,274
One way to put it.

76
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,821
You know, you don't really seem
that shaken up.

77
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,866
You know, for someone
who thought she was gonna die.

78
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:14,495
Yeah, you're right, I suppose
I should be a little more freaked out.

79
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:20,001
Maybe I never really believed
that you were gonna do it.

80
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,553
Boy, did he pick the wrong car.

81
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:46,903
Oh, don't, don't.

82
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:02,293
- It was an interesting night.
- That's one way to put it.

83
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:11,052
You know, you never really asked me
why I kill people.

84
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:13,971
I don't need to.

85
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,624
Price.

86
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,629
The man thrives on stories,
and I've just given him a great twist.

87
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:50,508
If he writes about Hannah and me
my career is a memory.

88
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:54,262
Clouds parted,
and much was revealed.

89
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,513
And that would be?

90
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:59,016
Now I know why the blood work on the
Wayne Randall spree was so spotty.

91
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,559
You were protecting someone.

92
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,896
As far as Price knows, I'm an innocent
lab geek in over his head.

93
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:08,401
- How long have you been seeing her?
- What do you want to keep quiet?

94
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,945
It's not in my nature
to keep quiet about anything.

95
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,531
- You can't write about this.
- It's nothing personal.

96
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,158
- I'm just doing my job.
- You'll destroy my job.

97
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,494
Sorry. No way around that.

98
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:23,499
You could always go on the record,
help me get my facts straight.

99
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,627
I love writing about crimes
from the inside.

100
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:29,839
What if I give you something better?

101
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:33,843
What better than
"Lab tech seduced by femme fatale?"

102
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,220
I was the last one to speak
with Wayne Randall.

103
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:39,181
I could tell you
what his last words were.

104
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,142
How he really felt about Hannah.

105
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,562
How do I know you wouldn't be making
something up to save your ass?

106
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,523
I wouldn't be,
but you'd have to judge for yourself.

107
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:49,775
Either way, I'd be on the record.

108
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:52,945
I'll give it some thought.

109
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:57,241
In the meantime, I'll keep quiet
about you and Hannah McKay.

110
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,993
Show of good faith.

111
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:03,914
Between you and me,
I'd watch what I eat around her.

112
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,418
I'll be in touch.

113
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:20,806
As if I needed another reason
to stay away from Hannah.

114
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:23,809
At least
I've bought myself some time.

115
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,150
- This a good time?
- Yes.

116
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:36,739
My theory on the barrel girl killers
went nowhere.

117
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,783
I'm on a dead end
on Bay Harbor Butcher.

118
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:41,160
- Shit.
- I was thinking we could brainstorm.

119
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:43,704
I keep wondering
if we haven't missed something.

120
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:46,624
You know, some angle, or--

121
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,752
You know,
maybe we haven't missed anything.

122
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:53,005
- What do you mean?
- Maybe we've been sidetracked...

123
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,841
...by our feelings
about Sergeant Doakes.

124
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,135
I think we've been objective.

125
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:00,304
Well, I guess I'm just not sure,
you know?

126
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:03,808
I know what it's like to hold
on to an idea of someone, you know?

127
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:07,686
To refuse to believe
that they have a dark side...

128
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,147
...but everything we've done,
all the evidence...

129
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:12,775
...it still points to Sergeant Doakes.

130
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:16,153
At some point, we have to face facts.

131
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:19,949
It's possible
that we've been reaching for leads.

132
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,701
So should we rethink
what we're doing here?

133
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:26,372
I mean, I just...
I don't know if it's worth it.

134
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,292
Maybe you're right.

135
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,181
I'm fucking going to hell.

136
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:49,603
Sal Price made his living writing
about the dark things people do...

137
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,731
...but he doesn't seem
to have a dark side of his own.

138
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,568
At least nothing I can use.

139
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:03,367
- You have a minute?
- Sure.

140
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,953
What's this?

141
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:08,205
It's your report
on the Randall victims.

142
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:09,457
What about it?

143
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,417
There's something weird.

144
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:16,172
This blood spatter points
to a killer other than Wayne Randall.

145
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,632
Someone smaller.

146
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:21,844
How'd you come to that?

147
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:25,014
Sal Price had an outside lab
run an analysis.

148
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,308
They found the discrepancies.

149
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,686
- Did you miss this?
- Price strikes again.

150
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,271
Where will he show up next?

151
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,358
Deb, I didn't miss anything.
I considered the same scenario.

152
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,027
And?

153
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,489
Blood spatter is largely a matter
of interpretation...

154
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,949
...but I'm convinced Wayne
was the sole killer.

155
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,243
These blood drops
came from the killer.

156
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:49,663
You could've tested them to see if
they matched Wayne Randall's DNA...

157
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,040
...just to be sure.

158
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,835
But I was sure. I didn't think the test
was worth the time or the money.

159
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:58,172
Especially since the case
had been solved.

160
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,343
Just say what you wanna say.

161
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,012
Hannah McKay killed this woman
and you're covering.

162
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:08,057
- Why would I wanna do that?
- To save her for your table.

163
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,812
You're wrong, Deb.
If you want, I'll have the blood tested.

164
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,398
Just say the word,
we can spend the money.

165
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,317
I'll think about it.

166
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,494
You smell that?

167
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,704
- What?
- Sulphur, mixed with shit.

168
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,499
Means Isaak Sirko's attorney
is on his way.

169
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:38,546
They wanna run their own analysis
on the samples we took from Mateo's.

170
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:41,465
Confirm that it's his client's blood
we found.

171
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:44,260
- Masuka's grabbing it now.
- I'll have it ready for them.

172
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,388
That evidence should keep Isaak
locked up for a long time.

173
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,181
One less killer to worry about.

174
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,769
I just checked the freezer.
The evidence on Sirko is gone.

175
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:55,813
Or not.

176
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:59,650
How in the hell does the most
crucial piece of evidence...

177
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:04,280
...against Isaak Sirko just disappear
from our own police station?

178
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,531
I don't know.

179
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,950
I logged the blood samples
into evidence myself.

180
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,493
There's only one explanation.

181
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,704
The Koshka Brotherhood
has a mole inside.

182
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,581
A mole?
You read too many spy novels.

183
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,708
Maybe the evidence
just got misplaced.

184
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,253
Hey, we do not misplace evidence.
And who reads anymore?

185
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,880
- Simmer down, tiger mom.
- Masuka's right.

186
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,466
This is why Sirko's attorney
asked for discovery.

187
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,344
Evidence would be missing,
we'd be left holding our dicks.

188
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,179
We can find who's responsible later.

189
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,557
We have 24 hours
to find those blood samples...

190
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:35,019
...or to come up with new evidence.
And if we don't, Sirko walks.

191
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,855
I'm gonna go
check the evidence room log.

192
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,649
See who's been there
in the last couple of days.

193
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,818
The crime scene
hasn't been released yet.

194
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:45,613
Maybe we could re-collect a sample
of Sirko's blood.

195
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:48,699
Fucking haul your ass over there.
Masuka, Quinn, go with him.

196
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,165
We let a fish this big slip
through our net...

197
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,876
...I'm gonna be very unhappy.

198
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,465
You and me both.

199
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:08,093
- What's going on with the restaurant?
- I've been approved to take over...

200
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:11,138
...but I still need a few thousand
to keep the place running.

201
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:13,015
- What are you gonna do?
- Turn over cushions...

202
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,435
...stand in the corner with a tin cup,
I don't know.

203
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:23,984
Holy shit.

204
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:27,321
I don't know about the holy,
but there's no denying the shit part.

205
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,323
Fucking Koshkas.

206
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:33,243
They fucked up the sewage line
to contaminate the crime scene.

207
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,537
Which means Sirko
will be free soon.

208
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,457
And I'll have to kill him
before he comes after me.

209
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,501
Need any more proof
that there's a mole?

210
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,462
I hate to ask, but would you guys
take a look around...

211
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:46,632
...see if there's any blood anywhere
that's not mixed with crap'?

212
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,927
- I wouldn't get my hopes up.
- They do not pay us enough for this.

213
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,388
Quinn, can I talk to you outside?

214
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:55,432
Why don't you guys wait outside
while we're in here vomiting?

215
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:07,695
The list of visitors of the evidence
lock-up in the last 72 hours.

216
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,113
- Your name's on it.
- So?

217
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,282
- So, what were you doing in there?
- I don't know, my job, maybe?

218
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,034
I'm a detective,
I go to Evidence.

219
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,078
- What was the case?
- The Dixon murders.

220
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,496
I gotta testify next week.

221
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,707
Wanted to make sure
I had my ducks in a row.

222
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,917
- What you insinuating?
- You're dating a stripper...

223
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:24,002
...that works at a club owned
by the Koshka Brotherhood.

224
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,338
So you think I stole evidence
for the Koshkas?

225
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,257
- Doesn't look good.
- Fuck you.

226
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:32,219
Hold on. You're no choirboy,
but I know you wouldn't sink that low.

227
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:36,724
- Then why are we talking about this?
- Because I'm doing my job...

228
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,600
...and I needed to hear it from you.

229
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,947
No, it looks like
it was deliberate, Deb.

230
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:54,908
We're not gonna find any
new evidence, at least not here.

231
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:58,412
We're halfway through another sweep
and so far we've got fucking zip.

232
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,248
- I don't think you're gonna find anything.
- Neither do I.

233
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,126
Dexter, if this case falls apart
and Isaak walks...

234
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,670
- ...he could be on the street tonight.
- I know.

235
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:10,507
- Just have to take care of him myself.
- Stay the fuck away from him.

236
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,051
I don't think ignoring Isaak
is the right approach.

237
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,428
I'm not gonna ignore him.

238
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:18,348
I'm gonna put a tail on him 24/7
until his travel visa expires.

239
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,435
He's not gonna pick crust
out of his eye without us knowing.

240
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,979
So don't fucking do anything.

241
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,857
I won't.

242
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,278
Except use the time
to get Sal Price off my back.

243
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,619
The address for the sister
of Hannah's late husband.

244
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,039
Her name's Lori.

245
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:46,376
- Have you ever heard of e-mail?
- I like interacting face-to-face.

246
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,546
Especially when their face
looks like yours.

247
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,799
You can cancel that shit right now.

248
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:55,427
- You got a problem with compliments?
- Yes, when they're slightly cheesy...

249
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,471
...and they come out of the blue,
yeah.

250
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,141
I'll try to contact Lori
and get permission for the exhumation.

251
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,186
- Can I tag along, for the interview?
- No.

252
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:08,398
It's gonna be awkward enough without
some goofy writer hovering over us.

253
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,651
Maybe we can meet later
and you fill me in.

254
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:15,489
I did get you the info. Come on.
It'll be totally off the record.

255
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,952
Fair enough.

256
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,288
But I'm buying.

257
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,508
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

258
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,135
I thought
I wasn't going to see you again.

259
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,304
- They hurt you?
- No.

260
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,182
They sent me to their club
in Fort Myers. I was so scared.

261
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,977
I thought for sure they were gonna
send me back to Kiev.

262
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:50,524
I'd burn down every one of their
fucking clubs before I let that happen.

263
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,776
Oh, my God, Joey.

264
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,362
Did you promise them something
to keep me here?

265
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:59,116
- Don't worry about it.
- I warned you about the Koshkas.

266
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:02,578
I can take care of myself.
And I can take care of the both of us.

267
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,788
Look at me.

268
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:08,542
Very soon, you're never gonna have
to work for any of those people again.

269
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,793
I don't understand.

270
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,379
- What have you done?
- You're gonna be free.

271
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:13,672
Trust me.

272
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,811
I'm touched you wanted to be part
of my welcome back committee.

273
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,355
More like a parade.

274
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:34,401
Heat like that's gotta make
a flight home to Kiev feel pretty good.

275
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,028
Not yet, George.

276
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,406
Miami is still overcrowded, by one.

277
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,869
So you said this
was about my brother Jake?

278
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,287
Yes.

279
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:48,582
This may be a little upsetting...

280
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,168
...but we need your permission
to exhume his body.

281
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,004
Exhume his body? Why?

282
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,299
Evidence has come to light
that your brother's death...

283
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,051
...may not have been an accident.

284
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,761
But Jake died of a heart attack.

285
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,138
We believe
he may have been poisoned...

286
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,265
...and that his wife was responsible.

287
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,392
Oh, my God. Hannah?

288
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,811
That's what we're thinking.

289
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,064
Did she and your brother get along?

290
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,608
Yeah, they seemed
to have a great relationship.

291
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,402
Looked like they were totally in love.

292
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:20,030
Especially after they found out
she was expecting.

293
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:24,284
- She was pregnant?
- Yeah, she told me in confidence.

294
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,371
I was surprised.
I didn't think Hannah wanted kids.

295
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,457
- What happened to the baby?
- She lost it.

296
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:34,503
Right after Jake's death.
It was a miscarriage.

297
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:38,924
You know, after the funeral,
Hannah cut everyone off.

298
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,760
It was like my whole side of the family
never existed.

299
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,388
No matter how many times
I reached out...

300
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:47,099
...she just wouldn't reciprocate.

301
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,893
Ms. Kirkwood, I think
we can find out for sure...

302
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,812
...what happened to your brother.

303
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:53,897
We just need your help.

304
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:02,531
- That looks heavy. Need a hand?
- I need you out of my life.

305
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,242
That can be arranged.
All you have to do is talk to me.

306
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,370
Everything I have to say to you
can be summed up in two words--

307
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:11,748
- Let me guess, "fuck off."
- Glad we got that straight.

308
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,626
I want to write the authorised
biography of Hannah McKay.

309
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,712
It'll go through the roof.

310
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,297
God knows I haven't
had a decent seller in years.

311
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,174
- I need this, Hannah.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

312
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,136
I missed the last part over the sound
of my heart breaking.

313
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,930
You don't talk to me,
you'll force me to speculate.

314
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,434
- Maybe even get creative.
- It takes brains to be creative.

315
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,770
"Hannah McKay
never lost her taste for killing.

316
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:38,316
She just updated her technique
from knives to poison."

317
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,987
Just an excerpt from the preface.

318
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,865
Along with some material
on one Dexter Morgan--

319
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,867
Who's a fan of my work, by the way.

320
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:51,538
--And how he manipulated evidence
to help the woman he loved.

321
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:55,917
- I'll deny everything.
- Which will be great publicity.

322
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:01,590
Okay. Fine, we'll talk.

323
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,426
Just keep Dexter out of this.

324
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,138
Depends on what you give me.

325
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:12,642
My house, tomorrow, 4 p.m.

326
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,615
- Hello?
- It's your favourite author.

327
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,409
Decided to take you up
on your Wayne Randall offer.

328
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,828
- You won't be sorry.
- I'll come to your place.

329
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,372
How's tomorrow night sound?
Seven p.m.?

330
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,749
Seven it is.

331
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,131
Price covered
a lot of murders during his career.

332
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,552
The bloodier, the better.

333
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,263
He likes getting at his cases
from the inside.

334
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,019
You can't get more inside
than becoming a suspect.

335
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:02,484
Christy Lawson.
Her killer was never found.

336
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:07,322
Price wrote a book about her case.
One of his best sellers.

337
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,119
All I need is Price's DNA
to link him to the crime.

338
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,880
You should throw that away, Dex.

339
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,176
Hannah needs to know
what's going on.

340
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,387
You're looking for an excuse
to see her.

341
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:33,098
You could just pick up the phone.

342
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:45,694
Christ, Joey. You're here so often,
we gotta get you your own spot.

343
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:48,572
I did what you wanted.
The evidence against Sirko is gone.

344
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,906
I want Nadia's passport.

345
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,701
She's done with you,
and your whole shitty organisation.

346
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,494
Is she?

347
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:02,210
- Yeah, and so am I.
- We've been working well together.

348
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:04,796
- Why kill a good thing?
- Who do you think you're fucking with?

349
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,591
Think I'm some fucking asshole,
one of your bag men?

350
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,467
- Take it easy.
- I could fuck you up.

351
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,387
It goes two ways, detective.
You destroyed police evidence.

352
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:15,765
That'll get you thrown off the force.
Hell, you'd probably do time.

353
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,727
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- That's not gonna happen, Joey.

354
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,062
So you think real hard
about your next move...

355
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,481
...and what it means for your future.

356
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,609
And Nadia's.

357
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:48,798
You managed to stay away from me
for one whole day.

358
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,051
What happened to our plan?

359
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:52,969
Sal Price happened.

360
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:54,721
- Price?
- He saw us together...

361
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,139
...when I dropped you off.

362
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:59,434
He threatened to put me in his book.

363
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,019
I can't let that happen.

364
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:03,396
There's more.

365
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,106
He showed up at the Flower Mart.

366
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:08,443
He wants me to go on record
about my time with Wayne...

367
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:10,570
...or he'll say that I'm a murderer.

368
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,615
I'm gonna handle Price.

369
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,450
Like the way you handled me?

370
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,955
Not exactly. I only go after killers.

371
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:24,334
- Like me.
- It's the code I live by.

372
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,755
Code, huh?

373
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,262
Sometimes life just has to be taken.
There's no need to dress it up.

374
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,973
It's more than that.

375
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:41,685
I think you're just afraid to admit
that you enjoy killing.

376
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,480
And you don't?

377
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,024
No.

378
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:52,112
Killing for me is just surrendering
to nature's way.

379
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,030
Nature adds and subtracts.

380
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,867
Survival of the fittest.

381
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,829
So you're the fittest.

382
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,539
So far.

383
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:11,006
You ever wonder what it would be like
if you didn't have all these rules?

384
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,763
Price doesn't have to die.

385
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,018
I can get him to back off for good.

386
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:26,604
I'm used to dealing with things
on my own. I don't need somebody.

387
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,023
I know you don't.

388
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,234
But I have this covered.

389
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,779
Consider it a good-bye present.

390
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,408
Okay.

391
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:42,037
I suppose we're going for a record.

392
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:44,289
A record?

393
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:48,126
How many times
we can say goodbye for good.

394
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,048
Good bye.

395
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:10,106
She isn't drawn to my darkness
like Lila, or blind to it like Rita...

396
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:12,233
...and she doesn't need it
like Lumen.

397
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:15,153
She accepts both sides of me.

398
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,405
The whole Dexter.

399
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:21,743
So why am I walking away
from this?

400
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:27,540
Because when some chemicals mix
they combust and explode.

401
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:33,463
- You don't have to be here.
- He's my brother.

402
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,590
I understand.

403
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,928
- You okay?
- Yeah.

404
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,356
What the fuck?

405
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,150
There's no tissue.

406
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:57,278
- That normal?
- It is if the body wasn't embalmed.

407
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,239
Isn't that standard procedure?

408
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,908
Unless the next of kin
specifies otherwise.

409
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:07,163
- Can we do the tests?
- Not on bones, lieutenant.

410
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,582
There's nothing I can do here.

411
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,589
What is it?

412
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:19,384
Your brother's remains...

413
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:23,972
He wasn't embalmed.

414
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,225
- I don't understand.
- We can't run the tests.

415
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,561
So you're saying this was all
for nothing?

416
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,772
I'm gonna find out
what happened, Lori.

417
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,066
I'm not gonna give up.

418
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,708
I can see this was a good idea.

419
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:55,837
- You look like you need a drink.
- Yeah, or five.

420
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:58,840
Excuse me.
Bottled brew for the lady.

421
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,844
Actually, can I get a double scotch,
neat, please?

422
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:06,055
When do you get the results
for the exhumation?

423
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:07,307
We won't.

424
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:10,226
The body was more like a pile
of bones. Nothing to test.

425
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:12,437
- Shit. He wasn't embalmed.
- Yeah.

426
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,647
And surprise,
it was at the discretion of...

427
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,483
- ...Hannah.
- Hannah.

428
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,318
Thank you.

429
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:26,743
That poor woman had to watch her
dead brother be dug up.

430
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:30,580
And for what?
I put her through fucking hell.

431
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:33,374
You couldn't anticipate this.
It's not your fault.

432
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,251
Well, it doesn't make it any better.

433
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,255
Sometimes my job
really fucking sucks.

434
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,424
Actually, it always sucks.

435
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:42,884
Why do you do it?

436
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,928
I don't know
how to do fuck-all else.

437
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:46,846
- I'm sure that's not true.
- Oh, God...

438
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:50,391
...if you are building up to a compliment,
now is not the time.

439
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,185
Look.

440
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,771
I'm gonna interview Hannah later.

441
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,649
- Maybe I can pull something out.
- Gross.

442
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,611
Well, you can tell me
how it went over dinner.

443
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:05,073
I might even let you pay.

444
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:12,121
Lemonade?

445
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,709
I'll pass.

446
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,298
Should we get started?

447
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:25,176
I just wanna make sure
that we're clear.

448
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,888
You're going to forget
about Dexter Morgan.

449
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:32,141
- He got under your skin, didn't he?
- Tell me that you understand.

450
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,060
Never heard of him.

451
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:41,484
We'll start with the couple
from the motel.

452
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:02,005
I just need enough of Price's DNA
to plant at a crime scene.

453
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,011
Traces of blood.

454
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:11,472
Good for me, bad for his gums.

455
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,840
The more you linger, the greater
the chance of being caught.

456
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,259
Crime scene data, audio interviews.

457
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:51,304
It's Price's research on Hannah.

458
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,848
If I get rid of it, it'll cripple his book.

459
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,809
- Maybe kill it.
- You didn't come here to protect Hannah.

460
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,896
You need to think
about yourself right now.

461
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:19,916
Wayne gave me the knife
and told me to guard the woman.

462
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:26,547
I figured it'd be easy,
seeing as how scared she was.

463
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,510
What was Wayne doing?

464
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:33,137
He started to stab the husband.

465
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:35,890
Over and over and over.

466
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:41,187
The woman
was screaming like crazy.

467
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:45,108
The man she loved
was getting knifed in front of her eyes.

468
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,404
But he...

469
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,322
He didn't give up.

470
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:55,284
He grabbed Wayne
and he pulled him toward him.

471
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:58,413
And then the woman jumped
on Wayne.

472
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:02,125
- The woman you were guarding.
- Yeah, she was protecting her husband.

473
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:07,004
I don't blame her,
I would've done the same thing.

474
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:11,592
Keep going.

475
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,889
Wayne was yelling for me
to get her off him...

476
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,934
...so I grabbed her by the hair
and I pulled her to the bed...

477
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:25,982
...and she just kept screaming
and screaming.

478
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:31,362
So I stabbed her.

479
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:39,036
And she just kept screaming.
And there was so much blood.

480
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,209
What did you do?

481
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:52,216
I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.

482
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,068
Take a second.

483
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,001
Looks tasty.

484
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:32,799
Certainly better
than the swill I've choked on of late.

485
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:37,512
Don't worry, I haven't come down here
to cause you harm.

486
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,388
Not yet.

487
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:43,476
Not with Miami Metro's finest
shadowing my every move.

488
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:46,896
Yes, I certainly hope
they are the finest.

489
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,232
For your sake.

490
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,277
What do you want'?

491
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:55,488
So long as I'm waiting around
to kill you...

492
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,615
...I thought we might have
a little chat.

493
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:03,037
Good chips.

494
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:06,332
While I was incarcerated...

495
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:12,213
...I found myself plagued
with a nagging question.

496
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:15,591
I mean, I will move heaven and earth
to snuff out your life...

497
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,134
...because you killed Viktor.

498
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:21,180
In fact, I was so blinded
by my desire for vengeance...

499
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:24,058
...that you were able to lead me
into a trap.

500
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,144
A mistake I assure you
won't happen again.

501
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:32,191
We have a cartoon in America
about a Coyote...

502
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,235
...who chases after a Road Runner.

503
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:35,528
He keeps thinking that.

504
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:38,114
He keeps rocket-skating
right off the cliff.

505
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:42,493
You see, I know what motivates me.

506
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:46,664
But what I don't know
is what drove you to kill my friend.

507
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:48,457
He killed Mike Anderson.

508
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:52,003
A man you barely knew for what,
less than three months?

509
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,379
It's all public record.

510
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,798
No.

511
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:59,427
You didn't kill Viktor
out of vengeance.

512
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:05,308
I have a feeling
that you're a different kind of animal.

513
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:07,768
The question is...

514
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:10,479
What kind are you, Dexter Morgan?

515
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,027
The kind who hunted your friend down
and strapped him to a board...

516
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,446
...and put a plastic bag on his head...

517
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:21,449
...and crushed his skull
with a fire extinguisher.

518
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,581
The kind who's gonna do the same to
you, give or take the fire extinguisher.

519
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:37,214
You're gonna regret
sharing that with me.

520
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,017
For the chip.

521
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:03,032
- This is the last load.
- Thanks, Jamie.

522
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,579
You know, you're an interesting guy.

523
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,631
Have a seat.

524
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:21,425
I should do my next book on you.

525
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:24,971
Believe me, I know a good story
when I hear one.

526
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:32,144
You know, as a blood spatter analyst,
I'm kind of a storyteller myself.

527
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:35,272
Only difference is your medium's ink,
and mine's blood.

528
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:36,899
Interesting observation.

529
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:41,904
Before we talk about Wayne,
I have a story idea of my own.

530
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:44,490
Mostly non-fiction.
I wanted to get your take.

531
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:47,952
I'm all ears.

532
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,621
So new DNA evidence pops up...

533
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,458
...in the unsolved murder
of Christy Lawson.

534
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:58,504
You know, the jogger
who was killed near Matheson Park.

535
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:02,883
It turns out that the DNA
belongs to a true crime writer.

536
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:07,054
You said it was mostly non-fiction.
Sounds like it's all bullshit.

537
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,515
Well, the anonymous tip
is real enough.

538
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,600
The one that mentions Sal Price.

539
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:16,564
It seems he wrote a very successful
book about the same case.

540
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,607
Now it turns out he was her killer.

541
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,902
You have to appreciate the irony.

542
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,948
How do you plan
to make this happen, exactly?

543
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:30,536
Let's just say you're gonna need
a new electric toothbrush.

544
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:35,416
- You broke into my apartment?
- No, I very carefully picked your lock.

545
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,418
It's time to visit the dentist.

546
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,879
- You son of a bitch.
- Hey, it's nothing personal.

547
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:42,590
- I can't have you messing with my life.
- Fuck you!

548
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:46,719
You're not gonna get away with this.

549
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,888
I'm gonna ruin your--

550
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,853
Hannah.

551
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:57,980
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- Call 911.

552
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,448
911, what is your emergency?

553
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:09,867
I need an ambulance
at 8240 Palm Terrace.

554
00:40:10,076 --> 00:40:12,328
Apartment 10B. Please hurry.

555
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:26,300
So I came in to see if Dexter was okay,
and I saw that guy on the floor.

556
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:30,763
Dexter told me to call 911,
and he started CPR.

557
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:33,682
- Hear anything before the crash?
- There was some shouting.

558
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:35,101
Kind of like an argument.

559
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:38,229
- Dexter's voice?
- I didn't recognise the voice.

560
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:42,691
I administered CPR
until the paramedics showed up...

561
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,151
...but he was unresponsive.

562
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,903
Okay, Dex. I think it's all here.

563
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:49,865
Hey, were you and Price
arguing before he collapsed?

564
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,952
The interview
might have gotten a little heated.

565
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,411
How heated?

566
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,999
He accused me of sloppy work
on the Wayne Randall case.

567
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,253
I might have raised my voice a little,
that's all.

568
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:06,340
A contusion to the head.
The source of all the blood.

569
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:08,008
That's not enough to kill a man.

570
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:11,804
Okay, wait for the medical examiner
to get here, okay?

571
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,908
- Why all the blood, Dex?
- His head struck the table as he fell.

572
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:34,785
Jesus.

573
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:36,745
You Okay?

574
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,665
No, I'm not okay.

575
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,626
I can't even have a drink
with someone.

576
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:45,212
- You had a drink with him?
- Yeah.

577
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:47,214
He was nice, you know? I liked him.

578
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,593
Did Price tell Deb about me
and Hannah?

579
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:53,137
Doubtful. Deb would
have already brought it up.

580
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,680
- I can't believe--
- I'm sorry.

581
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:57,933
- I wish I could tell you what happened.
- I know what happened.

582
00:41:58,142 --> 00:41:59,935
Hannah McKay.

583
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:01,812
She killed Price.

584
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,564
What makes you think that?

585
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:06,317
He was convinced she stabbed
one of the victims.

586
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:09,278
And that she kept on killing.
Her husband, other people.

587
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:12,531
All with poison.
He was gonna put it in his book.

588
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,076
She poisoned Price.
It's not a coincidence.

589
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,623
- How would she pull that off?
- I don't know.

590
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:25,920
I'm gonna pick her up for questioning.
I'm gonna run a tox screen on his body.

591
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,590
She's not gonna get away with it.
Not this time.

592
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:47,233
Hannah must know that Price's body
will be tested for poison.

593
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:49,818
So why isn't she concerned?

594
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:51,820
Or is she just that good at hiding it?

595
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:05,668
Mrs. McKay, I'm Lieutenant Morgan.

596
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:08,629
Do you want anything before
we get started? A water? Coffee?

597
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:11,298
Just wanna know
what I'm doing here.

598
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:13,008
Okay.

599
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:16,971
- Sal Price is dead.
- Oh, my God.

600
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,931
She is that good.

601
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:20,349
What happened?

602
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:24,728
- I was hoping you could tell me that.
- How can I do that?

603
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:27,856
Ms. McKay, I was hoping
that we could cut through the crap.

604
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:31,652
Sal Price was writing a book on you.
You didn't like it, so you poisoned him.

605
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,113
That's crazy.

606
00:43:35,406 --> 00:43:36,699
You're a killer, Ms. McKay.

607
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,576
You're a fucking good one,
I'll give you that.

608
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:41,954
You've gotten away with it
for a long time.

609
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:44,540
But I have a blood report
on Beverly Grey...

610
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:48,752
...that proves she was killed by a plant
that grows on your property.

611
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:51,797
And I have a forensics report
on the Wayne Randall bodies...

612
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:55,926
...that prove that you stabbed
one of their victims to death.

613
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,679
I'm not even sure
why we're talking about that.

614
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:01,557
I have immunity
for the Wayne Randall killings.

615
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:05,519
Right, and the Beverly Grey evidence
is circumstantial.

616
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:09,189
Unless I can tie it to the poisons
that I'm gonna find in the tox screen...

617
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:11,900
...that I just ordered for Sal Price.

618
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:14,445
That is gonna nail your fucking ass
to the floor.

619
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:17,990
- I didn't do anything to Sal.
- No. He just dropped dead.

620
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:20,534
People die.
It doesn't mean they were poisoned.

621
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:23,329
Is that what happened to your
husband?

622
00:44:23,537 --> 00:44:25,039
Did he just die?

623
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:26,915
Along with your unborn baby?

624
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:29,084
What the fuck happened,
Ms. McKay?

625
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:31,128
Was he pressuring you
to have a family?

626
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:33,339
Was it making you feel trapped?

627
00:44:35,466 --> 00:44:37,426
She's not acting.

628
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:40,679
Charge me with something,
or let me go.

629
00:44:40,888 --> 00:44:45,309
I am trying to give you an opportunity
to come clean about Sal Price.

630
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:49,104
You'll be doing yourself a big favour
when your case comes to trial.

631
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:52,399
- Am I done here?
- Yeah. You're done. Trust me.

632
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,112
You know,
my grandma has this saying.

633
00:44:57,988 --> 00:44:59,990
"Trust those who seek the truth...

634
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,369
...but doubt those
who say that they have found it."

635
00:45:05,037 --> 00:45:07,373
My grandma wasn't ever wrong.

636
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:23,013
Hannah survived Deb's questioning...

637
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:26,433
...but she might not make it
through mine.

638
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,319
Price was going to destroy my life.
I had to do something.

639
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,321
I told you I would take care of it.

640
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,698
You weren't exactly giving me
progress reports.

641
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:43,867
I saw a chance and I took it.

642
00:45:45,953 --> 00:45:48,539
- I was doing it for you too.
- For me?

643
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:49,998
He died in my apartment!

644
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:54,044
My living room is a crime scene.

645
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:56,797
You know who I am, what that means
to someone like me.

646
00:45:57,005 --> 00:46:01,593
I figured it would kick in while Price was
on the road, a convenient auto accident.

647
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:06,390
How'd you do it?

648
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:07,683
Is it really important?

649
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,853
- Is life in prison important?
- I'm never going to prison.

650
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,151
Price liked to chew on his pens.

651
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,446
The last one had a little something
on it, completely undetectable.

652
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:22,739
- You better hope so.
- I know so.

653
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:27,703
Just wish I could've destroyed
Price's book along with him.

654
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:34,168
Actually, I took care of Price's book.

655
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:36,503
You what?

656
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:40,299
How?

657
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:44,553
I was at his apartment
collecting DNA samples...

658
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:48,348
...for my now-defunct plan
to get him to shut up...

659
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:51,518
...and I erased his research on you.

660
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,356
Thanks.

661
00:46:56,899 --> 00:46:58,859
It only took a minute.

662
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:04,990
I could feel you watching me
while I was being interrogated.

663
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:10,579
- You saw the whole thing, didn't you?
- Is it true about your husband?

664
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:13,123
Did you kill him
because he didn't want a family?

665
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:15,417
It was the opposite.

666
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:18,629
I wanted a family and he didn't.

667
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:22,174
He threatened to leave me
unless I got an abortion.

668
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:29,139
- What happened to the baby?
- It was a miscarriage.

669
00:47:32,184 --> 00:47:33,769
Sometimes life subtracts.

670
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:39,608
Sometimes it adds.

671
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:43,445
Do you realise what happened?

672
00:47:44,363 --> 00:47:46,448
We were looking out for each other.

673
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:53,580
That's big for people like us,
maybe even historic.

674
00:48:43,714 --> 00:48:44,840
What's this?

675
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:46,842
- For your restaurant.
- It's 10 grand.

676
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:49,052
You know I got that inheritance
a while back.

677
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:52,180
- I've been looking to invest.
- I can't take this. Are you crazy?

678
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:54,057
You too good for my fucking money?

679
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:57,352
- No, this is way too generous.
- Bullshit. It's family money.

680
00:48:57,561 --> 00:48:59,187
- You're family to me.
- Quinn.

681
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:04,151
Look, you're stuck with it.
I'm not taking it back.

682
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,237
I do expect a few free meals, though.

683
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:14,286
This is a loan, you asshole.
I'm gonna pay you back.

684
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:17,456
Okay, big guy. We're good.

685
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:35,057
Report's back on the tox screen
on Sal Price.

686
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:38,727
- This can't be right.
- M.E. ran it twice.

687
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,812
Negative both times.

688
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:48,111
That fucking bitch
is gonna get away with it again.

689
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,560
Wayne was yelling
for me to get her off him...

690
00:50:20,769 --> 00:50:24,022
...so I grabbed her by the hair
and I pulled her to the bed...

691
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:29,653
...and she just kept screaming
and screaming.

692
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:35,200
So I stabbed her,
and she just kept screaming...

693
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:38,412
...and there was so much blood.

694
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,163
What did you do?

695
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:45,127
I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.

696
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:57,764
Not only can't I kill her,
I can't seem to stay away from her.

697
00:50:57,973 --> 00:51:02,769
Even when I'm not with Hannah,
she's there, in my head.

698
00:51:02,978 --> 00:51:05,689
When some elements come together,
they create a reaction...

699
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:07,399
...that can't be reversed.

700
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:10,235
They transcend chemistry.

701
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:13,905
Is this what love feels like?

702
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,409
Is this how it begins?

703
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:19,536
Am I even capable of this?

704
00:51:28,754 --> 00:51:29,796
Hello?

705
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:35,177
Hannah McKay killed Sal Price,
and she's gonna walk.

706
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:38,513
She's gonna get away with it...

707
00:51:38,722 --> 00:51:41,183
...and we both know
she's gonna kill again.

708
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:46,688
Deb, can we talk
about this in the morning?

709
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:49,399
He didn't deserve to die.

710
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:52,861
I can't let this happen.

711
00:51:54,488 --> 00:51:57,616
There has to be some fucking justice.

712
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,245
It's you, Dex.

713
00:52:03,497 --> 00:52:05,165
Me?

714
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:07,876
You know what I'm saying?

715
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:11,838
She deserves it.

716
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,300
I want you to make it right.

717
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:20,013
Do what you do.
