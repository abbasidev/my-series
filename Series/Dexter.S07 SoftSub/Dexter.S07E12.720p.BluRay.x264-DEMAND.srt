1
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,513
Previously on Dexter:

2
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,767
Dexter, what the fuck?

3
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:20,355
Maybe we should just get rid of the
body. We make it look like a suicide.

4
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:21,856
How do we do that?

5
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:24,067
Gasoline. There's a station nearby.

6
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,403
I'll go get a couple of gallons.

7
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:34,160
If Doakes really wasn't
the Bay Harbor Butcher...

8
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:36,538
...best thing
is look into his final days.

9
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:40,458
We should start with the cabin
in the Everglades where Doakes died.

10
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:45,255
Maria's convinced
that Doakes was innocent...

11
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:48,758
- ...that the real killer might be you.
- Me?

12
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,638
Do what you gotta do.

13
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:01,020
That was Department of Corrections.
Hector Estrada is up for parole.

14
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,273
- Estrada?
- I told you about my mother...

15
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,233
...and how she died?

16
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:08,903
Was he one of the men
that killed her?

17
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,531
He was the leader.
He gave the order.

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,325
It's the universe giving you
a Christmas present.

19
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:17,078
No one but you
would see it that way.

20
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:18,580
Estrada!

21
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,874
You're working with her, aren't you?

22
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:24,544
That fucking cop bitch,
the one that got me out.

23
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:26,755
- LaGuerta.
- She fucking set me up.

24
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:29,466
You're not the one who was set up.

25
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,100
Debra's at St. Joseph's.
She's been in a car accident.

26
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:42,437
Well, I sure as shit
didn't swallow a handful of pills.

27
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:45,815
She poisoned you
while she was at your house last night?

28
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:47,150
Find the proof.

29
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,736
Hannah dissolved the pills
into Deb's water...

30
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,197
...so that she'd pass out
behind the wheel.

31
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,657
Sal Price's pen.

32
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:58,453
If you test it,
you'll find traces of aconite on the end.

33
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:02,916
- Can't believe you're gonna turn her in.
- As long as she's free, you're not safe.

34
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:05,376
You should have killed me.

35
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,993
You look like you got some sun.

36
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,621
The boat.

37
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,623
They treating you well?

38
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,708
I get 10 minutes outside.

39
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,003
My cellmate seems nice.

40
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:56,756
She robbed a liquor store
so she could buy meth.

41
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:59,300
- You have every--
- You said you loved me.

42
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:00,885
- I do.
- Then why am I here?

43
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:03,721
You poisoned Debra.

44
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,314
Because she was trying
to keep us apart.

45
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,695
And what was I supposed to do?

46
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:23,157
I don't know. I don't know,
you could have just broken up with me.

47
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:26,995
And completely free you up to kill Deb?
No.

48
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:30,707
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
behind bars.

49
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:33,501
- You left me no choice.
- You had a choice.

50
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,628
You were supposed to choose me.

51
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:36,879
She's my sister.

52
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:38,881
Jesus.

53
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:43,886
I never stood a chance.

54
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,810
Don't.

55
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:59,861
Why are you even here?

56
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,238
I had to see you.

57
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:07,702
If you're worried I'm gonna tell people
what you are, then don't worry.

58
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,955
Your secret is safe with me.

59
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,666
Is it?

60
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,586
I would never do that to you.

61
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:25,845
I came here because I wanted--
I needed you to know.

62
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:33,061
If there was another--
Any way to keep Deb safe...

63
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:35,897
...I would have found it.

64
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:48,701
I miss you so much.

65
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,536
I miss you too.

66
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:01,756
You're the only person in the world
I don't have to hide anything from.

67
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:08,179
I don't know what I'm gonna do
without you.

68
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:12,642
Dexter, it's not too late.

69
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:18,314
The only thing they have on me
is that fucking pen.

70
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:21,400
If the pen disappears, so can we.

71
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:24,362
We can go some place
that your sister can't find us.

72
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,949
We can go to Argentina
and be together always.

73
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,576
I can never trust you.

74
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:34,997
- But you just--
- And you know you can never trust me.

75
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:46,342
We both knew it would come to this,
one of us dead or behind bars.

76
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,844
Yeah.

77
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:51,722
Except I always thought
it would be you.

78
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,059
Sorry.

79
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,312
Yeah, me too.

80
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,550
Goodbye, Dexter.

81
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,319
I tried to kill Hannah but couldn't.

82
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:49,447
I wanna hate her
for what she did to Deb...

83
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,490
...but can't.

84
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:53,701
- Hello.
- An inmate...

85
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,745
...from the Sheriff's Department...

86
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,289
...is trying to contact you
via collect call.

87
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,583
Do you accept the charges?

88
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,001
- Yeah.
- Connecting.

89
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:03,794
Arlene, thank God.

90
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:06,047
- Hannah, what's wrong?
- I can't do this.

91
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,091
I can't spend my life in here.
I need you to help me.

92
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,677
I need this to be over.

93
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:13,930
No, you're stronger than that.

94
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,807
You haven't even had your trial.
I can visit you.

95
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:20,811
Arlene, you owe me. I took care of
that counsellor for the both of us...

96
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,024
...and now I need your help, okay?
I can't live like this.

97
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:30,905
Tell me what to do.

98
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,619
I don't know who's worse,
you or him.

99
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,705
It is Toy-mageddon
every time I walk in here.

100
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,875
He can't make up his mind
which one he likes the best.

101
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:45,920
He's a boy. He wants them all.

102
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,505
I can clean this stuff up.

103
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,466
Go, get ready for work. I got it.

104
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,551
- All right, Harrison.
- Hey.

105
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,846
We're gonna need to let Jamie
pick some things up.

106
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:58,474
That doesn't mean
you can't play with Thomas.

107
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,309
I want Hannah.

108
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:06,315
Sweetie, Hannah had to go away,
but that doesn't mean...

109
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:10,486
...that she doesn't miss you
very, very much. Okay?

110
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,655
Okay.

111
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:16,867
- Let's see if we can get Thomas to talk.
- One...

112
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,038
- Captain?
- Dexter.

113
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,207
What are you doing here?

114
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:30,006
It might be best
if you take Harrison to another room.

115
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:31,882
Because?

116
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,722
Because I'm placing you under arrest
for the murder of Hector Estrada.

117
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:40,391
Dexter?

118
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,645
- This has to be some sort of mistake.
- I wish it was.

119
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,064
- Who is Hector Estrada?
- Stay back.

120
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:49,108
- Get your hands off.
- Stay back.

121
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:52,069
Jamie, just take Harrison to his room.
It's okay.

122
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,529
I'm calling Deb.

123
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,120
Dexter Morgan...

124
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,250
..."you have the right
to remain silent.

125
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:07,877
Anything you say or do...

126
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,421
...can be used against you
in a court of law.

127
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,465
You have the right to an attorney.

128
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:16,510
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you."

129
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:30,358
- What the hell's going on?
- Jesus. LaGuerta arrested Morgan.

130
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,568
I'll call you later.

131
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:33,819
What are you doing?

132
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:36,697
- Out of my way, Angel.
- Why is Dexter in handcuffs?

133
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:39,450
I have proof
he's the Bay Harbor Butcher.

134
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,703
Doakes is the Bay Harbor Butcher.
Have you lost your mind?

135
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,622
- What is this?
- I don't know.

136
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,582
What the fuck?

137
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:51,087
She thinks your brother's the Bay
Harbor Butcher. How is that possible?

138
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,589
It's not.
Take those things off his wrists.

139
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:56,509
- Leave those.
- Maria, what are you doing?

140
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:00,346
Stand down, lieutenant.
Dexter's my prisoner, you're family.

141
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,598
You need to recuse yourself.

142
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:04,809
Let's go.

143
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,645
- Angel.
- I'm on it.

144
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,822
Just so we're clear then...

145
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:22,618
...your official statement
is that you went fishing last night...

146
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:24,870
...then went home
to be with your son.

147
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,123
I didn't kill Hector Estrada.

148
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:29,250
No?

149
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,044
You didn't cut his body into pieces...

150
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,839
...and put it into bags,
take it on your boat...

151
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,883
- ...then throw it into the ocean?
- Why would I do that?

152
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:41,554
Because Hector Estrada
butchered your mother in front of you.

153
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,598
So how about you start telling me
the truth?

154
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,935
I'm not the Bay Harbor Butcher.

155
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,522
He's answered your questions.
You've got nothing.

156
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,190
Not all my questions.

157
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,989
These are from my phone
last night...

158
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:03,492
...and that's you carrying
plastic garbage bags onto your boat.

159
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:06,287
It was ice to keep any fish
I caught cold.

160
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,830
My cooler broke.

161
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:11,375
But earlier today,
you said you didn't catch anything.

162
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,294
What was in the bag?

163
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:19,300
It was a shirt
with Hector Estrada's blood on it...

164
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,260
...and his wallet.

165
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,553
You killed him.

166
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,223
You killed him
like you killed all your other victims.

167
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:27,808
Admit it.

168
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,311
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

169
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,522
- Dexter, don't say another word.
- That's enough, sergeant.

170
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,399
I was throwing away my dinner.

171
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:38,861
It was a bag from Franco's.
You can check.

172
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,448
- Angel, you gotta believe me.
- You framed Doakes.

173
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,327
After I defended you against him.

174
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:50,748
You betrayed me, this department,
everybody around you.

175
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,583
Is that what this is about?

176
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,961
Your desperate need to believe
the James Doakes you knew...

177
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,173
...or thought you knew,
wasn't a cold-blooded killer?

178
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,218
You don't have the right
to speak his name.

179
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,846
You're so hurt...

180
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,307
...angry, scared.

181
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,227
He's dead because of you.

182
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,230
You were his partner,
his lieutenant...

183
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,316
...his lover.

184
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,529
If you couldn't see
what was in front of your eyes...

185
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,614
...what does that say about you?

186
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,908
I swear to God, Dexter...

187
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:29,537
...I'm gonna nail you to the wall
for what you've done.

188
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,205
- Maria.
- To the wall!

189
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,249
Maria, that's enough.

190
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,793
Goddamn it, lieutenant.
You can't be in here.

191
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,296
- Tell them what you told me.
- I reran the blood on the shirt...

192
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,882
...Captain LaGuerta discovered
in the trash.

193
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:45,719
It's definitely Hector Estrada's,
but after going over it...

194
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,513
...I found an evidence number.

195
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,139
What? What evidence number?

196
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,643
Shirt with Estrada's blood on it
is the shirt he was wearing...

197
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,521
...the day he was brought in,
back in '73.

198
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:59,775
Things got a little rough and the
arresting officers broke his nose.

199
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,027
That's impossible.

200
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,904
I checked inventory.

201
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,031
The shirt's missing.

202
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,408
What about his wallet?

203
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,661
Don't kill the messenger.
There was a partial print...

204
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,705
...and it's yours.

205
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,749
- Were you trying to frame my brother?
- Deb.

206
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,334
You son of a bitch.

207
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,044
- You set me up.
- Maria.

208
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,921
- Can I go now?
- Yes, you can.

209
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:23,549
He did this.

210
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:27,177
He's the Bay Harbor Butcher.
He has to be.

211
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:30,848
This witch hunt of yours is over.
If you have a problem with it...

212
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,392
...we can take it upstairs.

213
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,113
Captain.

214
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:50,284
Everyone else may have bought
your little victim routine in there...

215
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,620
...but we both know the truth.

216
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:56,373
And the truth
is it's been a very long day.

217
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,835
You set me up,
just like you did James.

218
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:03,756
Now, I'm sure you've already managed
to kill Estrada.

219
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,216
Leaves me no chance to prove
any of this.

220
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,219
Congratulations. You've won again.

221
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,513
I just wanna go home
and see my son.

222
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,810
James always knew
there was something wrong with you.

223
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,315
Surprise, motherfucker.

224
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:23,651
You got my reports?

225
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,069
Hot off the presses.

226
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,363
Headlines.

227
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,032
Twenty-six stab wounds,
the first pierced her heart.

228
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,576
- Whoever did this--
- Was making a point.

229
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,578
This is our third vic.

230
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,789
Any Suspects?

231
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,457
Walter Munro.

232
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,335
Crazy. Thinks he's some philosopher
or some shit.

233
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,129
Scribbling his fucked-up thoughts
in his journals.

234
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:47,508
Victims are all prostitutes.
Wounds suggest the same weapon.

235
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,385
Consistent with a single killer.

236
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,929
The thing is he's crazy,
but he's smart too.

237
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,723
I can never get anything on him.

238
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,020
Hold up.

239
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,235
What's up?

240
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,570
What we talked about.

241
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,826
Come on, Maria.

242
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,412
Don't you at least
wanna think about it?

243
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,247
I'm sorry, James.

244
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,463
Oh, shit, Morgan.
I didn't even know you were there.

245
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,258
You're, like, invisible.

246
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:36,265
If only I had stayed invisible.

247
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,686
- Maria, wait up.
- Angel.

248
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,438
- Hey.
- I don't wanna hear it.

249
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,232
I just checked
with Estrada's parole officer.

250
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:48,277
You were behind his release
from prison?

251
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:52,030
Somehow Dexter figured out
I was watching him.

252
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,704
Everyone thinks
that you're trying to frame Dexter.

253
00:17:58,871 --> 00:17:59,913
- I am--
- Dexter.

254
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,040
I don't care
what everybody else thinks.

255
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,335
Well, you better start caring.
Do you wanna keep your job?

256
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,630
- I wanna keep my job.
- Then better back off...

257
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,260
- ...and drop this whole crazy idea.
- Angel, I need you to be on my side.

258
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:16,972
I am on your side
and that's why I'm telling you this.

259
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,475
But you have to stop.

260
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:31,111
- It looks pretty bad, doesn't it?
- More than pretty bad.

261
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,198
And you're gonna have to work
really hard to fix this.

262
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:36,325
But come on, Maria.

263
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:40,579
If anyone can work their way
out of a jam like this...

264
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:41,830
...it's you.

265
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,126
Okay.

266
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,754
Thanks for your advice, Angel.

267
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:54,968
We need to talk.

268
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:58,597
Harrison just went to sleep.

269
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,392
I'm glad one of us will sleep tonight.

270
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,649
Heads up next time
you're gonna get arrested...

271
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,151
...or make our captain look
like a lunatic.

272
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,694
It worked, didn't it?

273
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,780
Everyone thinks
LaGuerta framed me.

274
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,241
She won't be able to come after me
anymore.

275
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,493
All it cost her was her career.

276
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,287
How many careers
has LaGuerta destroyed?

277
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,790
That still doesn't make it right.

278
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,710
Not that I even know
what that is anymore.

279
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:37,052
I wish it hadn't come to this,
but it was either her or me.

280
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:41,265
She almost caught me
trying to kill Estrada on the docks.

281
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,267
Whose fault was that?

282
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,227
LaGuerta's the one who set me up.

283
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,979
So you repay the favour?

284
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:50,732
Would you prefer my normal method
of conflict resolution?

285
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,109
Not fucking funny.

286
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,487
There was a problem, and I solved it
the best way I knew how.

287
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,072
And it's over.

288
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,866
That's what you keep saying.

289
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,826
What about Hannah?

290
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,078
What about her?

291
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,164
Well, I assume she knows
what you are.

292
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,667
- Yeah, but--
- Her arraignment's tomorrow.

293
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:11,920
How do you know she won't use that
to get a better deal?

294
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,590
- She won't.
- How do you know that?

295
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:18,051
Because she's in love with me.

296
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,223
I pray to fuck you're right.

297
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,937
Take tomorrow off, all right?

298
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,900
At least until the dust settles
with this LaGuerta thing.

299
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,160
You know this isn't over.

300
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,288
Despite what LaGuerta thinks,
Estrada's still out there.

301
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:50,375
I know. It's been six days since
I let him go and I haven't found him yet.

302
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,878
If he resurfaces,
LaGuerta gets wind of it--

303
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,923
She'll offer him a deal.
Put him up in some safe house.

304
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:59,927
You're left to explain to the DA why
you came after him with a chainsaw.

305
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,929
I'll find him.

306
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,557
I'll do What I have to do.

307
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,227
You sound like Hannah.

308
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,907
According to Estrada's
parole officer...

309
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,493
...this is the last known address
of his wife.

310
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,495
Hector has nowhere else to turn.

311
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:30,123
He's wanted by the police, me.

312
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,965
Mrs. Estrada?

313
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,801
I'm Arthur Curry,
Hector's parole officer.

314
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,804
Why are you here?
I haven't seen Hector in years.

315
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,222
Hey, honey, who's that?

316
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,848
The neighbour.

317
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,100
Please.

318
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,185
Don't come here again.

319
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:51,645
My Tony doesn't like it.

320
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,941
Well, if you haven't seen Hector,
why are you still married to him?

321
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,111
I'm Catholic.

322
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,445
Is it that guy again?

323
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,700
- You sure he hasn't been around?
- You should go.

324
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:18,255
It's been 40 years,
but Florencia hasn't let go of Hector.

325
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:22,342
Sometimes it only takes a moment
to reveal who we really are.

326
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,970
Looks like you spun a goddamn web.

327
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,097
Yeah, it's more like a puzzle.

328
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:30,100
Connect the dots.
Can you pin this on Munro or not?

329
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,602
Entry wounds on the victim
are consistent...

330
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,646
...with wounds on previous victims.

331
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,523
She was standing when attacked.

332
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:40,444
- Get another one.
- She stumbled, her body turning.

333
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:45,741
The killer's behind her now,
stabbing her in the back repeatedly.

334
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:49,286
Then she's down on all fours,
crawling away...

335
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,039
...until the killer grabs her
and flips her over.

336
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,832
He's on top of her now.

337
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,461
He slices her carotid artery.

338
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,213
She's terrified, heart's racing.

339
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,759
It's releasing more blood
in thick arterial spurts...

340
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,136
...here and here and...

341
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,096
Here.

342
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,309
I've never seen someone so excited
about a crime scene before.

343
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:14,352
You like this blood shit too much.

344
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:15,854
I'm just doing my job.

345
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,231
Wipe that smile off your face...

346
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,151
...and help me find the creep
who did this.

347
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,488
I let my guard down.

348
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,657
For an instant,
my real life bled into my fake life...

349
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:31,495
...and Doakes caught his first glimpse
of the real me.

350
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,943
Thanks for coming, Tom.

351
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:06,947
Chrissakes, it's all over the station
you tried to frame Dexter.

352
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,408
- You know that's not true.
- Do I?

353
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:16,456
Commissioner's going to open an
investigation into your recent conduct.

354
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,251
If called to testify,
I'll be dragged into this...

355
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,586
...and have no choice
but tell the truth.

356
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:25,632
That we found definitive proof that
Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher.

357
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:28,718
And that despite me advising you
to cease and desist...

358
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:31,555
...you continued
on this reckless course.

359
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:34,975
- So, what's your advice?
- Start kissing anything...

360
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,185
...that even remotely resembles
an ass.

361
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,688
I'm serious, Tom.

362
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,232
I was hoping for your support.

363
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,818
And make myself look
as crazy as you?

364
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:48,488
People still respect you here.

365
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,577
I need someone to have my back,
Tom...

366
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,371
...and you could say
I had reasonable suspicion.

367
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,623
- You carried it too far.
- Then say that.

368
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:02,085
Say that due to my overzealous nature
as a police officer...

369
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:04,254
...I got too caught up in the case.

370
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:08,717
- You got too caught up being an idiot.
- I'm already down, Tom.

371
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,511
Stop kicking.

372
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:19,144
My job is at stake.

373
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:21,897
Tom?

374
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,485
All right.

375
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,362
I'll see what I can do.

376
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,573
Thank you.

377
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,534
You just keep your head low.

378
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,874
And for God's sake, start doing your
job if you have any hope of keeping it.

379
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,597
Lieutenant.

380
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,057
What brings you here?

381
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:59,142
I'm the arresting officer.

382
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,229
How's the wrist?

383
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,105
Stronger every day.

384
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:07,025
How's facing life
without the possibility of parole?

385
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:11,029
Last time I checked
it's innocent until proven guilty.

386
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,572
This is your last chance.

387
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:16,660
You can save yourself a lot of time
and trouble, confess what you've done.

388
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:18,662
I will if you Will.

389
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,497
My conscience is clear.

390
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:24,000
All that Xanax.

391
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:27,003
My, how you must have trouble
sleeping at night.

392
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:30,173
You don't know shit about me.

393
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:33,301
- A minute?
- Except you're lieutenant of Homicide...

394
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,096
...and you wear a big shiny badge...

395
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:39,057
...and yet you know exactly
what your brother is.

396
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,103
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

397
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:45,981
They wouldn't believe me
even if I did.

398
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:49,401
But knowing that you have
to live with it...

399
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,569
...is punishment enough.

400
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,905
Still, I'm curious.

401
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:58,994
How do you justify arresting me
and not him?

402
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:03,373
Or is the law just something
that you make up as you go along?

403
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:06,209
Turning a blind eye
whenever you feel like it...

404
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,336
...or whenever Dexter is involved?

405
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:10,672
Fuck you.

406
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,509
You are a liar and a killer.

407
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,511
But not a hypocrite.

408
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,014
Miss McKay. Come on, let's go.

409
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:25,687
You're charged with murder,
first degree...

410
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,732
...with the death of Salvador Price.
How do you plead?

411
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,525
My client pleads not guilty.

412
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,653
Miss McKay, you are remanded
to the state of Florida...

413
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,155
...and bail is denied.

414
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,406
No.

415
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:39,367
Hannah.

416
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:43,330
- I'm so sorry.
- Listen to me. It's gonna be fine, okay?

417
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:46,124
- Ma'am, you need to step back, please.
- Thank you.

418
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,959
Good bye.

419
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:56,259
Maria.

420
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,386
Just checking in.

421
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:00,805
It's nice of you.

422
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:04,184
Seems everyone else is avoiding me.

423
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,729
You know how it is. Everyone
is waiting to see where this lands.

424
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:11,566
I'm doing everything I can to make sure
it doesn't land on my head.

425
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:14,152
You need to show up to my party.

426
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:17,614
I really don't think
anyone wants to see me there.

427
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,699
Of course they do.

428
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:23,745
It's also an opportunity for you
to apologise to Dexter.

429
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:27,499
- A public act of contrition.
- If you straighten it outwith him...

430
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:31,669
...he can tell the people upstairs
that it was just a misunderstanding.

431
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:34,005
Either way, show up tonight.

432
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:38,093
It's not just New Year's Eve.
It's also my retirement party.

433
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,638
It wouldn't feel right without you.

434
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:43,098
I'll be there.

435
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,032
1500 cds, supercharged.

436
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,827
It's the best Jet Ski out there.

437
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,705
Yeah, I just can't see spending
14 grand--

438
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:10,083
Shit! What the fuck?

439
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,004
Seward Memorial Hospital, now!

440
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:17,632
She's having some sort of seizure.

441
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,392
She seems stable. We're wheeling her
into Seward Memorial Emergency now.

442
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:33,398
We'd better contact her next of kin.

443
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,693
Hang on, sweetheart.

444
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:40,780
Go ahead and get her an MRI.
Make sure it's with contrast.

445
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:43,283
ETA is...

446
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,694
Let's hope my hunch is right...

447
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,071
...that the pull of a past romance...

448
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,492
...is enough to compel Florencia
to help Estrada.

449
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:29,412
You wanted to talk?

450
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,789
Deb, come in and have a seat.

451
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,542
What's up?

452
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,296
You were right.

453
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,048
About?

454
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,633
Me.

455
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:47,972
I let my feelings for Sergeant Doakes
affect my decision-making.

456
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:54,270
What I put your brother through
was negligent and unforgivable.

457
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,649
And I'm sorry.

458
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:04,405
If it's any consolation,
my career is gonna take a hit.

459
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:07,867
Suspension, probably worse.

460
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:09,702
I hope not.

461
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,706
You don't have to say that.

462
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:17,001
Either way, in the event I'm not around
much longer...

463
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,506
...I wanna leave things
in some kind of order.

464
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:26,052
I was trying so hard to prove
the Butcher was still active...

465
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:29,764
...I overlooked some loose ends
on Travis Marshall's death.

466
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:32,600
I was hoping you could help me
with the time line.

467
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:34,894
Sure.

468
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:38,815
Okay.
According to Dexter's statement...

469
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:42,193
...previous to the day
we found Travis Marshall's body...

470
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:45,405
...he was doing his final
forensics sweep on the church.

471
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:46,698
Yeah, that's right.

472
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,866
- Under your supervision.
- No.

473
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:51,953
I mean, yes, I sent him,
but he was on his own.

474
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,163
He doesn't need someone
to watch him.

475
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:56,165
You didn't go to the church?

476
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:59,127
- That day or evening?
- No.

477
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:01,170
You sure?

478
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,006
Yes.

479
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:15,685
Going through the mail, I got a package
from Mike Anderson's widow.

480
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:21,274
And it seems that before Mike died,
he ordered security footage...

481
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:24,819
...from all gas stations
around the church.

482
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,656
This got lumped
into his personal belongings.

483
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:32,452
It recently got sent to me, so...

484
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,080
Can you see that?

485
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:41,794
That's two blocks from the church
and there's a time stamp.

486
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:44,422
It was 22 minutes...

487
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:48,885
...before the fire department
got the call on the burning church.

488
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,223
What were you doing there,
lieutenant?

489
00:32:57,477 --> 00:33:00,021
What it looks like. I was getting gas.

490
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,898
Then why lie about it?

491
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:05,360
I didn't lie. I forgot.

492
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,028
It was a crazy night.

493
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:10,073
You were certain about it
a moment ago.

494
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,241
No--

495
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,286
I'm-- I am sorry, I...

496
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,538
Took some food to Dexter
at the church.

497
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,540
I was only there for 30 seconds...

498
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:22,835
...so I didn't think
that it was worth remembering.

499
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,379
Then you got some gas.

500
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:27,924
- Yes.
- That you put in a gas can?

501
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:31,761
Yeah.

502
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,514
Why in the world--?

503
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,432
Captain, where is this going?

504
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:41,020
That's up to you, lieutenant.

505
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,272
Debra...

506
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:47,360
...we've known each other
a long time.

507
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:52,281
Is there something
you wanna get off your chest?

508
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:03,084
Yes.

509
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:18,224
I think you have been
under a lot of stress.

510
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:26,190
You know what I think?

511
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:33,781
I think I'm not the only one
who made a mistake...

512
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,868
...trying to protect someone
they care about.

513
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,293
Is there anything else, captain?

514
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,336
Not for now.

515
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:52,091
But this is just the start
of a much larger conversation.

516
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,262
Count on it.

517
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,210
Estrada.

518
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,590
I guess some bonds
are unbreakable.

519
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:36,135
We never leave behind
the ones we love.

520
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,815
He could be there all day.

521
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,822
And you can keep that, all right?

522
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:03,788
Hey!

523
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:21,305
Hi, Deb.

524
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,517
Well, now?

525
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:26,811
Okay.

526
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,063
Give me 15 minutes.

527
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:31,732
Still unconscious,
but seizures have stopped.

528
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:34,777
We've got her stabilised.
We're waiting for a doctor.

529
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:36,779
We could use your help over here.

530
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,667
Just-- Okay.

531
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:52,169
LaGuerta knew I was lying, Dex.

532
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,589
Wait, wait, let me think.

533
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,843
What?

534
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:00,636
This is bad, Deb.

535
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:05,433
I don't wanna fucking hear you say that.
You always say that you can fix it.

536
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:06,976
I Will.

537
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,979
Just don't know how yet.

538
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,150
Dangerous enough
when she was focused just on me...

539
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:17,612
...but now that she's pulled you
into this, well, it's worse.

540
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,822
Tell me about it.

541
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:25,328
- I've said this a hundred times.
- But you're sorry I got involved in this.

542
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,038
I am.

543
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,834
Are we really that fucked?

544
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,714
Look, all she knows
is that you bought some gas.

545
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,507
That's not a crime.

546
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:41,218
Yeah, but buying gas
to burn down a church...

547
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:45,097
...to cover up the fact you killed
Travis Marshall is. She knows that.

548
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:47,350
But she can't prove it.

549
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:49,101
Yet.

550
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:53,022
I need to know what else she has,
what her next move is.

551
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,275
If all she's got is that DVD,
I can handle this.

552
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,195
Is this ever gonna end?

553
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:02,406
Yeah, it will.

554
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:09,622
Just go back to work
and try and act normal.

555
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:12,416
Normal? What the fuck is normal?

556
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,085
Just do the best you can.

557
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,670
I'll deal with LaGuerta.

558
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:20,633
- What the hell is that?
- Estrada.

559
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,108
Oh, shit. Let's go!

560
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:41,570
Officer Armes calling for backup.
We need units at Seward Memorial.

561
00:38:57,837 --> 00:38:59,005
LaGuerta's house.

562
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:01,882
What is it you're hoping to find,
Dexter?

563
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,093
I don't know.

564
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:14,729
Not this.

565
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:16,814
Warrants.

566
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,525
With a judge's signature...

567
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:23,904
...allowing LaGuerta to track the GPS
on my phone and Debra's...

568
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,365
...the night the church burnt down.

569
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,284
Once this goes through...

570
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,620
...LaGuerta will have the time line
for the night I killed Marshall.

571
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:36,333
She'll know Debra went to the church,
then the gas station.

572
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:39,795
And then back to the church...

573
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:43,966
...proving that we both were
at the church when it burned down...

574
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:47,053
...and proving
that Deb was my accomplice.

575
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:50,347
I think it's time to run, Dexter.

576
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,725
But Deb. I can't leave her behind.

577
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,477
Take her with you.

578
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:58,606
Debra and Harrison, just go. You knew
one day it would come to this.

579
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:00,775
Deb could never live like that.

580
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:03,778
That's always been the plan, Dexter.

581
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,697
That was before.

582
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:08,783
It's not just Deb.

583
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:10,326
I don't wanna run either.

584
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,745
Before? Before what?

585
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,371
Before everything.

586
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,083
Before I married Rita,
before I had a son...

587
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,835
...before Deb knew who I was,
before I fell in love.

588
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,504
What difference does that make?

589
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,839
Somewhere along the line,
the fake life...

590
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:27,051
...that we created as a cover for me
to kill became real.

591
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:30,554
It's not fake to me anymore.

592
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:33,099
I don't wanna lose it.

593
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,435
I'm gonna stand my ground.

594
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:39,730
I don't see any other options here,
Dexter.

595
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,569
But I do.

596
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:51,700
No. Dexter, you have never
done a kill like this.

597
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:54,578
I'm about to.

598
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:57,123
No.

599
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:01,460
LaGuerta's an innocent. She doesn't
even begin to meet the code.

600
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:03,462
It's the only option.

601
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,632
I can't let Deb go down
for what I've done.

602
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:09,635
My God, Dexter.

603
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,473
How did we end up here?

604
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:22,648
Morning, Dex.

605
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:26,569
Gonna pick up
some steaks and beer tonight, yeah?

606
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:27,820
Sounds good.

607
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,906
The kind of doughnut you choose
says a lot about a man.

608
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:33,117
Hey.

609
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:35,161
Avoid Doakes. Bad mood.

610
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:39,331
First, Lt dumps him, now his prostitute
killer seems to have gone missing.

611
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:41,417
- I love these.
- Hey.

612
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,210
Thanks.

613
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:47,923
Get one while they last.

614
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:50,676
I don't want no fucking doughnut,
Morgan.

615
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:52,303
Sorry.

616
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,346
Hell, it's not you.

617
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:59,560
It's LaGuerta. I should have never
gotten involved with her to begin with.

618
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,484
Never jump the fence if you're not
willing to face what's on the other side.

619
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:10,487
Where the fuck did you hear that?

620
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:14,909
A friend said it to me
in a moment of stress.

621
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:18,078
Bullshit. You don't have any friends.

622
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:25,836
This is the journal
of that motherfucking hooker killer...

623
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:27,504
...Walter Munro.

624
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:31,425
I took it from his place a couple
of weeks ago while serving a warrant.

625
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:33,135
Locked up in my drawer since.

626
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:34,678
"Never jump the fence...

627
00:42:34,887 --> 00:42:37,973
...if you're not willing to face
what's on the other side."

628
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,728
That's a weird coincidence.

629
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:45,356
Fuck coincidences.
I don't believe in them.

630
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:49,401
- I should--
- There's something off about you.

631
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,320
I should have seen it before.

632
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:54,907
The fake smile, the doughnuts.

633
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:57,952
You don't even walk
like a normal person. You glide.

634
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,830
Like a fucking lizard on ice.

635
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:04,250
It's all a fucking act...

636
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,293
...and I ain't buying it.

637
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:10,381
I think you're overreacting.

638
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:13,968
You're hiding something...

639
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:17,179
...and one day
I'm gonna figure out what it is.

640
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,100
You are one creep motherfucker.

641
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,319
It was a mistake to try to act human
in front of Doakes.

642
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:35,322
All I did was reveal how fake I was.

643
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:42,663
- Captain LaGuerta.
- Oye, this is Hector Estrada.

644
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:43,914
You're alive?

645
00:43:44,123 --> 00:43:45,207
I need your help.

646
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:47,001
I'm back here at the shipyard.

647
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:49,503
Same container.

648
00:44:01,724 --> 00:44:02,808
That's good.

649
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:04,935
Very convincing.

650
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:08,564
- You're gonna let me go now, right?
- No.

651
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:12,776
- You said--
- You think I'm a killer and not a liar?

652
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:22,578
Now, this is a kill I've been
looking forward to for a long time.

653
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:27,291
You're the one who started this all,
so many years ago.

654
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,960
Should auld acquaintance be forgot?

655
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:32,838
- No, but look. I can--
- It's a rhetorical question.

656
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:34,131
Look!

657
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,468
I'm sorry I killed your mother,
all right?

658
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:40,846
Was it hard?

659
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,141
Making the decision to kill her?

660
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,352
Yes.

661
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,853
Yeah, man.

662
00:44:48,062 --> 00:44:50,064
It was the hardest decision
of my life.

663
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:52,316
Look, I didn't wanna do it.

664
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:53,567
You're lying.

665
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:56,070
She was a snitch.

666
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:59,031
It was a matter of survival.
It was her or me.

667
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:01,575
Come on! This was 40 years ago!

668
00:45:01,784 --> 00:45:03,702
Why are we still talking about this?

669
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:06,830
When we finish talking, I kill you.

670
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:10,209
Okay, okay.

671
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,587
What else you wanna know?

672
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:17,716
Did it make you feel bad?

673
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:20,552
Look, I said I--

674
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:23,347
It was her or me.

675
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:25,974
Survival of the fittest?

676
00:45:26,183 --> 00:45:28,102
Yeah, exactly.

677
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:30,938
Killing you will be easy...

678
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:36,068
...but I have another kill I have to do
that's not so easy.

679
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:39,321
So why are you doing it, man?

680
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,740
To protect myself.

681
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:43,951
And my sister.

682
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:45,786
Exactly.

683
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:48,330
Survival, right?

684
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:50,499
The normal reasons.

685
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:53,001
The normal reasons?

686
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:57,798
I've never killed for normal reasons.

687
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:02,678
I used to think I was special,
a special kind of killer...

688
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:05,139
...but tonight...

689
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:06,515
...I'm not.

690
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:08,809
I hear you, bro.

691
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:11,520
I hear you.

692
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,857
So then what are you, right?

693
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:16,900
What am I?

694
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:21,363
I'm just a creep motherfucker.

695
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:46,472
- Jamie.
- Hey, Deb.

696
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,725
- Have you seen Dex?
- He was supposed to pick up Harrison.

697
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:52,227
So tired,
I put him down in the back office.

698
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:54,813
You see him,
let him know I'm looking for him?

699
00:46:55,022 --> 00:46:56,440
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

700
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,400
Happy New Year.

701
00:46:58,609 --> 00:46:59,651
What?

702
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:01,904
Fuck, sorry. Happy New Year.

703
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:05,491
- You wanna dance?
- Okay, let's go dance. Come on.

704
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:08,452
Oh, slow down, cowboy.

705
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,412
I'll share.

706
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:16,835
I heard that you broke up
with your girlfriend.

707
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:18,670
She dumped me.

708
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:22,674
So are you gonna get all sloppy drunk
and make an ass of yourself...

709
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:26,553
- ...like when you broke up with Deb?
- I was thinking about it.

710
00:47:26,762 --> 00:47:29,014
You gonna hit on me again too?

711
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:31,767
I'm just saying, fair warning.

712
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:34,520
I do not need my brother
to protect me.

713
00:47:34,728 --> 00:47:36,897
And if you don't show me respect...

714
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:39,483
...I will fuck you up...

715
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:42,819
...and serve your balls
in a shot glass.

716
00:47:43,153 --> 00:47:46,657
How do you make that sound
so fucking sexy?

717
00:47:49,618 --> 00:47:51,370
- Everything good here?
- Just fine.

718
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:53,121
Yeah? Good.

719
00:47:59,545 --> 00:48:01,421
- Hey, hermano.
- Hey.

720
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:05,551
So how's it feel knowing
you're putting away your badge?

721
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:09,054
Honestly, a little scary.

722
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:10,639
All I've been is a cop.

723
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:12,849
I'm putting it all behind me,
you know?

724
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:14,101
Unknown territory.

725
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:15,978
That takes balls, man.

726
00:48:16,562 --> 00:48:18,564
Oh, hey. It's almost time.

727
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:21,108
Where can I go to change?

728
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:24,903
No, you're not gonna put on a diaper
and come out as Baby New Year.

729
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:27,990
- Try and stop me.
- No.

730
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:29,825
You're gonna scare people is--

731
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,327
- Great party.
- Thanks. ls your brother here?

732
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:34,371
He said he was gonna be here.

733
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:38,417
Maria too. Maybe after what happened,
they wanna avoid each other.

734
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:41,587
- I'm gonna call, make sure he's okay.
- Okay.

735
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:46,842
- Dispatch.
- This is Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

736
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,595
I was hoping to get a 20
on LaGuerta's vehicle.

737
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:50,971
I'll Wait.

738
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:54,516
Heading north towards the Miami Port,
by the shipping yards.

739
00:48:54,725 --> 00:48:57,394
- The shipping yards? Are you sure?
- That's correct.

740
00:48:57,603 --> 00:48:59,104
Thank you.

741
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:09,197
Dex. Whatever you're thinking of doing,
please don't do it.

742
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,570
So, what's the plan?

743
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:34,866
I gave LaGuerta half a dose of M99...

744
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:37,744
...so it won't be found in her system.

745
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:42,416
I'll use her gun to shoot Estrada
in his puncture wound.

746
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:45,335
Destroying any evidence
that he was stabbed.

747
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:47,713
And then?

748
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:50,382
Tell me.

749
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,718
I'll use Estrada's gun
to shoot LaGuerta.

750
00:50:52,926 --> 00:50:55,429
So it'll look
like they killed each other.

751
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:57,389
Yes.

752
00:50:57,764 --> 00:50:59,516
Dexter.

753
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:02,477
Where will this end?

754
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:24,875
Shit, Dex, what have you done?

755
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,638
Deb?

756
00:51:38,847 --> 00:51:40,515
Oh, God.

757
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:42,601
Dex.

758
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:45,479
You shouldn't be here.

759
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:50,984
Why shouldn't I be here?

760
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:55,697
What are you doing?

761
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:57,991
What needs to be done.

762
00:51:58,492 --> 00:52:01,203
- Are you gonna kill her?
- You need to leave.

763
00:52:01,411 --> 00:52:03,747
- I need to finish this.
- Dexter, you can't.

764
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,666
I can and I will.

765
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:08,960
Enough. Dexter, you can't do this.

766
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:11,838
The only solution,
the only way to end this.

767
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:14,382
No, no.
I can't let you go through with this!

768
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:16,009
Shoot him, Debra.

769
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,641
You have to end this.

770
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,643
Shoot him.

771
00:52:27,229 --> 00:52:29,731
- Stop!
- Do it, Debra. Shoot him.

772
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,985
Do it! Shoot him!

773
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:37,656
This is not who you are.

774
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:39,241
You're a good cop.

775
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:41,910
You're a good person.
You're not like him.

776
00:52:43,912 --> 00:52:45,539
Put him down!

777
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,626
It's true.

778
00:52:49,835 --> 00:52:52,087
Everything she said.

779
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:54,381
You're a good person.

780
00:52:57,801 --> 00:52:59,302
It's okay.

781
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:09,896
Do what you gotta do.

782
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:19,489
Dex.

783
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:30,292
Oh, my God!

784
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,378
Oh, my God!

785
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:12,125
We all make rules for ourselves.

786
00:54:14,002 --> 00:54:17,589
It's these rules
that help define who we are.

787
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:24,554
So when we break those rules,
we risk losing ourselves...

788
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:27,057
...and becoming something unknown.

789
00:54:27,766 --> 00:54:29,809
Who is Deb now?

790
00:54:30,018 --> 00:54:31,853
Who am I?

791
00:54:32,604 --> 00:54:34,981
Is this a new beginning...

792
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:38,276
...or the beginning of the end?
