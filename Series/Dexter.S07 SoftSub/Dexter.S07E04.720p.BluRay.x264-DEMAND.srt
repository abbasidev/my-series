1
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:11,805
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,431
Who is Dexter Morgan?

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,226
He's just a jerk who works
for Miami Metro Homicide.

4
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:20,146
Now can I please go?

5
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:21,773
Yes.

6
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:26,361
So you're not interested in alcohol
or looking at naked women.

7
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:28,238
You may be in the wrong place.

8
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:32,158
I'm taking out the trash that would
otherwise be left to putrefy.

9
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,285
There is a legal system for that.

10
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:38,081
If it worked as well as you think
it does, I wouldn't be so busy.

11
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,083
Just gonna get a swab
from your cheek.

12
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:46,589
You do this for a living?

13
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:52,804
Well, I hate it, but I get it,
what you do.

14
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:56,307
But what I don't understand
are the blood slides.

15
00:00:57,142 --> 00:00:59,853
They're trophies.
They're like Speltzer's earrings.

16
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,980
I'm nothing like Speltzer.

17
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:10,572
My bosses at the club,
they ordered me to get close to you.

18
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,326
These men are dangerous.
I can't go back to them with nothing.

19
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:18,663
I'm not gonna let anything happen
to you.

20
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:31,009
- He's gone.
- Motherfucker. He has a girl in here.

21
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:32,594
We have to find her.

22
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:35,680
She's dead.

23
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,591
Just when it seems like Deb and I
are making progress...

24
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,051
...we take a left turn.

25
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,054
I showed her a monster,
Ray Speltzer...

26
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:43,766
...a killer who chased his victim
through a maze.

27
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:48,146
I could have prevented that murder,
and Deb accepts that.

28
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,941
But she hasn't accepted me...

29
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,860
...what I am.

30
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:58,740
And I'm not sure she ever will.

31
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,015
I'm getting nothing.

32
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,851
- You?
- No.

33
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,938
That maze man, he's good.

34
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,523
He knows what he's doing.

35
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,610
My hat's off to any killer good enough
not to leave any DNA...

36
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:36,861
...at a murder scene.

37
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,988
Plenty of his DNA
in this place though.

38
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:44,243
Well, if this cemetery was his office,
it's like this place was his break room.

39
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,831
Something was here.

40
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,918
Something special.
Like a trophy maybe?

41
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:54,545
From one of his victims.

42
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:57,256
Killers hate
to leave their trophies behind.

43
00:04:57,465 --> 00:05:00,468
That means Speltzer stopped
by here after he killed that girl.

44
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:03,262
But there's none of her DNA here.

45
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,891
No blood, no fibres, no hair.

46
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,143
No reception.

47
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:20,238
Speltzer is loose in the world...

48
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,408
...and Deb will do everything
in her power to find him.

49
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:27,620
But will she and I be able
to find our way back to each other?

50
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,305
Deb.

51
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:48,474
Will you?

52
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,356
Will you be mine?

53
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,758
- Morning.
- Coffee. Now.

54
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:17,563
- Rita.
- Another left turn.

55
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:20,942
- Trinity killed her.
- Yes.

56
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,071
- Yes.
- Why?

57
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,907
She didn't fit the pattern at all.

58
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,118
Because I was coming after him.

59
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:35,039
So while we were hunting Trinity,
you were too.

60
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,792
I figured out who he was
before you did.

61
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,460
And you didn't help us get him?

62
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:43,089
He knew who I was, where I lived,
that I had a family.

63
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,219
- I was trying to protect them.
- You wanted to fucking kill him.

64
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,179
And I did.

65
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:52,682
When?

66
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,477
- He's dead. That's what matters.
- When?

67
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:58,896
I took care of him.

68
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,316
- Did you love her?
- Why would you ask that?

69
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:05,570
Because I have no idea what's
the truth and what's a lie with you.

70
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:10,783
- I loved her.
- If you were concerned about family...

71
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,785
...then why were you going
after Trinity?

72
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:15,037
Is that what a loving husband does?

73
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,332
- Are you even capable of love?
- I love you.

74
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,628
How?

75
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,590
How can you love me
and also love to--?

76
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,550
It's how I've lived my whole life.

77
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:31,095
Before you walked into that church...

78
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:34,182
...did you ever question the way
I felt about you?

79
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,518
- Why is it any different now?
- Why?

80
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,105
Jesus, Dexter.

81
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:44,192
Morgan.

82
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,613
Okay.

83
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,324
That was Batista.
They found Speltzer.

84
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,954
A security guard spotted him
at the scrap yard.

85
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:59,165
And he had the good sense
not to be a hero.

86
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:02,418
- It took four officers to take Speltzer.
- He put up a fight.

87
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:05,546
Came close to shooting. If Speltzer
had a weapon, they would've.

88
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,049
- Speltzer is a weapon.
- He was mine.

89
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,760
He hasn't asked for a lawyer.
This is your one shot.

90
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,511
A confession is our only shot.

91
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,640
He was wearing a mask so I couldn't
make an ID that would stick.

92
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,558
Can't believe DNA
wasn't at the scene.

93
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,268
Masuka and I went over it twice.

94
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:22,396
Yeah, Dexter and I, we checked
Speltzer's mausoleum man cave...

95
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:25,274
...for evidence of his victim there,
but no luck.

96
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,194
Dexter and I can't make
the evidence appear.

97
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,905
If you don't get a confession,
you won't get Speltzer.

98
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,657
Are you two ready?

99
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,866
Fuck, yes.

100
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:42,333
- That's Dexter Morgan.
- His face. It looks familiar.

101
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,211
I put everything Jurg dug up
on Morgan in there.

102
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,880
He's not a cop. He's a lab rat.

103
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,216
- Blood splatter.
- It's spatter.

104
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:51,968
Blood spatter.

105
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,470
Whatever. He's from Miami.
Normal guy.

106
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:58,808
Except his wife was murdered
by a serial killer a few years back.

107
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,685
The man we killed on the boat?

108
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:02,979
Louis Greene.

109
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,941
He was an intern for Miami Metro.

110
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,903
The boat's owner, this Dexter Morgan.

111
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,449
He works for Miami Metro too.

112
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:19,912
Viktor's death.

113
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:22,123
Is it payback
for killing that detective?

114
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,833
Viktor fucked us real good here.

115
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,253
Of all the people he could've shot,
it had to be a fucking cop.

116
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:32,341
- So it's Viktor's fault he's dead?
- Yeah. He was a loose cannon.

117
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,468
Never listened. At least not to me.

118
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,471
Everything was going great
until he showed up in Miami.

119
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,640
Viktor was a good man.

120
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:44,437
He was loyal. He was committed.

121
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,940
And he was here
to do what you couldn't.

122
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:51,569
Keep the Colombians
from taking over our traffic!

123
00:10:57,325 --> 00:11:00,453
- Fuck.
- Gentlemen. Let's go. Get up.

124
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,079
And here we go again.

125
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,293
- Why?
- Come over here, please.

126
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:12,381
Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm Detective Quinn.

127
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,508
I'll be your pain in the ass
for the day.

128
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,385
Can we get that music turned off?

129
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:19,138
Ladies to the left,
customers to the right.

130
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:21,390
Keep it behind the bar.

131
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,310
Ma'am, I need you to go ahead
and stand over there.

132
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,604
- Officer.
- It's detective.

133
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,273
Detective Quinn.

134
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:34,403
Do not tell me you are fucking her.

135
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,530
No. What makes you think that?

136
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,575
You're not the only one
who's a detective.

137
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,370
You really think a stripper's
a good idea?

138
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,872
No, it's a horrible idea.

139
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:51,170
Seriously,
how long is this gonna go on?

140
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:56,217
I'm thinking every day until
we lock up Mike Anderson's shooter.

141
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,554
Or you could say a number.
It'll be just like old times.

142
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,556
You leave your car unlocked...

143
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,976
...you'll find some cash,
maybe some blow.

144
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,396
All this goes away.

145
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,649
I don't know what you're talking about.

146
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,984
Get the fuck out of my face.

147
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:27,331
None of this makes any sense.
Viktor's dead. They got him.

148
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,209
Not everyone at Miami Metro
knows this.

149
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,461
Otherwise, they wouldn't be here.

150
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:37,133
Maybe this Morgan and Greene
were working alone.

151
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,429
Why the fuck would these two
assholes cover up Viktor's murder?

152
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,389
I believe Dexter Morgan knows why.

153
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,766
Well, say the word. I'll take him out.

154
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:48,436
- No. I wanna talk to him.
- Talk?

155
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,771
Hey, what are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

156
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,315
We got two boats waiting
to drop off our supply...

157
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:57,069
...even though we can't move
what we already have.

158
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,280
We are bleeding money.

159
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,167
The bartender, Alex.
One of ours, isn't he?

160
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,171
Yeah.

161
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,590
So let's give them what they want.

162
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:26,098
For my money, four on one
is not really a fair fight.

163
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,685
I did a little boxing myself
back in the day.

164
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:34,064
I didn't take on four cops,
but, you know, I held my own.

165
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,902
You don't wanna chitchat. I get that.

166
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:40,863
Here's the thing though.

167
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,116
My lieutenant is gonna come
in here...

168
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:47,411
...and say that she saw you
at the maze where that waitress died.

169
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:53,292
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Right, guy like you was at the gym.

170
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,294
But she's a woman.

171
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,796
They get shit wrong all the time.

172
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:02,384
And this one, man, she's my boss.

173
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:04,428
If you can believe that.

174
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:08,849
I have to fucking answer
to her skinny ass every day.

175
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,810
And she's always squawking at me,
you know?

176
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,105
Her beak is,
"Squawk, squawk, squawk."

177
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,566
To tell you the truth, I envy you.

178
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,778
I've been wanting
to pop my lieutenant...

179
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,613
...in that beak of hers for years.

180
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:29,078
She's dying to get a shot at you.

181
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:33,082
Should we let her? Could be fun.

182
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,042
Right?

183
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,764
- Nice job in there.
- He's all ready for you.

184
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,474
Deb.

185
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,268
Good luck.

186
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:58,065
He was mine,
but Deb needs this more than me.

187
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,150
And she needs to get him her way.

188
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,154
Remember me?
I saw you just the other night.

189
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,198
That is some maze that you built.

190
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,368
What is it for, Ray?

191
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,497
Are you sure
you don't remember me?

192
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,586
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.

193
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,381
Your morn sure was pretty.

194
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,634
She died a few years ago, right?

195
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,303
Cast a long shadow, I bet.

196
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,724
Hard for any girl to measure up
to those looks...

197
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,393
...but you keep trying, don't you?

198
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,688
What do you think about the girls
that go home with you?

199
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,899
That they're stupid? Easy?

200
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:43,360
That they're whores?

201
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:47,823
They'd have to be, right?

202
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:50,409
To go home with you,
take their clothes off for you.

203
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,455
Girls like that are vulgar.

204
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,959
But girls like that
sure do look like your mom.

205
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,172
So I have to wonder.
Your morn was so pretty.

206
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,382
She probably had a lot of admirers,
right?

207
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:10,763
Men that would go home with her
and watch her take her clothes off?

208
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,391
And then take her
any way that they wanted her?

209
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,352
Shut up.

210
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:20,648
There are many ways
to break a body down.

211
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,192
You could hear it, couldn't you?

212
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:27,029
You could hear her
through those thin walls...

213
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,698
...that the two of you shared.

214
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:34,620
You could hear how much she loved
getting fucked by all those men.

215
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,872
You could hear her kissing them.

216
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,375
All the things that she might do
with her mouth...

217
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,586
...that same mouth
that she would kiss you with.

218
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,672
But be honest, Ray.

219
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,217
You kind of liked it, didn't you?

220
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:54,014
Weren't you kind of wishing
that it was you inside her?

221
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,685
I should've killed you like
I killed that other bitch!

222
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,478
Go to hell.

223
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,397
We got him.

224
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,616
- Way to go, lieutenant.
- Good job.

225
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,160
Congratulations.

226
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:17,496
Hey, Deb.

227
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,541
Jamie said she was good to watch
Harrison till late tonight...

228
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,168
...if you wanna grab a drink
or something.

229
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,548
I thought you'd be in the mood
to celebrate.

230
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,887
I'm really glad we got Speltzer,
but celebrate? No.

231
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,348
Melanie Garrett is still dead.

232
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:40,769
But you got Speltzer.
He'll never hurt anyone again.

233
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,397
- Well, outside of prison.
- Dexter.

234
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:49,111
I've been thinking a lot about Rita.
About how she died.

235
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,030
She died because of you.

236
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,325
Because you were selfish.

237
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:59,705
You have a son.
Harrison is three years old.

238
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,458
- Someone needs to protect him.
- I do.

239
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,752
Someone needs to protect him
from you.

240
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,882
He could go live with Astor and Cody.

241
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,676
- With their grandparents in Orlando.
- I am a good father.

242
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:13,927
I am the right person.

243
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,681
The only person
who can and should raise my son.

244
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:20,851
Who, like me, lost his mother.

245
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,564
It is not fair of you
to expose a child to your life...

246
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,650
...choices.

247
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:33,614
- You have to decide. Your desires or--
- No, I don't.

248
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:38,243
You said it yourself, Dexter, that you
can't stop, that you don't wanna stop.

249
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:42,790
And if you keep doing this,
you're like a fucking magnet.

250
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,919
Bad shit is gonna find you.

251
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,505
And if that happens, I'll handle it.

252
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:58,430
What if you had been three minutes
later to Speltzer's fucking maze?

253
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,099
- But I wasn't.
- You were too late for Rita.

254
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,064
I should've killed Trinity
the first time I saw him.

255
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,483
- That's the mistake I made.
- That's the mistake?

256
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,654
Yes! And I will never, from this
moment on-- Do you hear me?

257
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,823
I will never ever make
that mistake again.

258
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,033
It is not in your control.

259
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,369
Everything is in my control.

260
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,966
I am not giving up my son.

261
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,738
Mr. Sirko, George.

262
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,365
I wasn't expecting visitors.

263
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,951
That's all right.
We don't stand on ceremony here.

264
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,369
Have a seat, Alex.

265
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,788
You have a beautiful family.

266
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,292
Thank you.
That is why I came here.

267
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,877
They are still in Kursk.

268
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:14,172
Your son and daughter,
what are their names?

269
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,968
My son's Zakhary
and my girl, her name's Yulia.

270
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:22,306
- They're twins, yes? How old?
- Five.

271
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,601
- Their birthday's in April.
- Wow, five.

272
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,228
That's the best age.

273
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:32,065
Learning to read, walking,
seeing the world...

274
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,735
...and yet, they still want to be held.

275
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:38,906
You're probably wondering
why I stopped by. Well, you see...

276
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:43,410
Tell me, how much money do you
send back to Kursk each month?

277
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,831
- From your job at The Fox Hole?
- Seven-hundred-fifty dollar.

278
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,586
I take out only my rent,
my food, some money for my car.

279
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:58,091
A sacrifice for you, I'm sure.
But still, it's not very much.

280
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:04,640
What if your family
could have a lot of money?

281
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:09,269
Security.
College for Zakhary and Yulia?

282
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,940
- You'd want that for them.
- I would give anything for them.

283
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,567
That pleases me.

284
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:20,322
Because that is why
I came by here today.

285
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,784
- To ask you a favour, Alex.
- Yes, of course. Anything.

286
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,202
I have a problem.

287
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,748
One of my men killed a police officer...

288
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:33,418
...and I have to give the police
a suspect so they'll stop harassing us.

289
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:37,839
- And that suspect is you.
- But I didn't kill anyone.

290
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:43,595
- Sure, you did.
- I want you to write a note.

291
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,889
Pen, paper?

292
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,894
This is what I want you to write.

293
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,730
Kaja...

294
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,318
...I cannot live with what I have done.

295
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,571
I'm very sorry.

296
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,702
I will take care of your family now.

297
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,790
Zakhary and Yulia
will want for nothing.

298
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:17,879
That's for you. It's the gun
that killed the police officer.

299
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:19,631
What do I do with it?

300
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,302
Bang.

301
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:33,228
Look at your children's faces.
They're looking at you.

302
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,940
Wanting you to give them the best life
this world has to offer.

303
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:42,112
- You will do this for them.
- And if I don't?

304
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,615
We'll kill you anyway.

305
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:49,369
And throw your wife
and fucking kids in the river.

306
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,039
No need for threats.

307
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:53,665
We're all friends here.

308
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,253
But I think you understand
the situation.

309
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,607
You won't feel a thing.

310
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:23,195
It'll be quick.

311
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,281
Like turning off a light.

312
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,846
For my family?

313
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:06,613
Hannah McKay.

314
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,323
She spent six years in juvie...

315
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:11,368
...after pleading guilty to being
Wayne Randall's accomplice.

316
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:15,247
She always claimed she was just
another one of his victims.

317
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,834
Wayne called her the Robin
to his Batman...

318
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,044
...but with better legs.

319
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,879
Dexter Morgan.

320
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:25,507
You look a little lost.

321
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:29,970
Well, I haven't been inside a police
station in 15 years.

322
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,390
Still smells the same,
like fast food and sweat.

323
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:36,351
Hospitality isn't exactly
our main concern.

324
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:41,898
I heard the sheriff's department found
the body of one of Wayne's victims.

325
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:46,361
Yeah, they went back one last time
after Wayne died.

326
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,446
And expanded the perimeter.

327
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,908
Is that what you're doing here?

328
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,619
To help us find the other bodies
Wayne buried?

329
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,663
My lawyer said it was for the best.

330
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,794
There's a rumour going around
that you were the last person...

331
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:06,006
...to talk to Wayne before he...

332
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:09,551
...died.

333
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,138
His last words were about you.

334
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,853
He said something about every day
being like an unwrapped present.

335
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:21,855
Yeah.

336
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,899
Yeah.

337
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:27,444
I remember when he got that fortune
from a cookie.

338
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,655
You two didn't stay in contact?

339
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,451
Too painful.

340
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:39,623
Where were you
and Wayne going anyway?

341
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,249
Or was there a plan?

342
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,501
Not much of one at first.

343
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,129
We were just trying to get out
of Clopton, Alabama...

344
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:50,008
...which isn't even a town.
It's an intersection and a cemetery.

345
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:54,554
But somewhere around Sarasota,
a plan did begin to form.

346
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,556
Argentina.

347
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:00,936
We were gonna go find a farm
in Argentina and settle down.

348
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:05,440
- What?
- We were living on farms in Alabama...

349
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:09,194
...like somehow it would all be
so different in South America.

350
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:15,033
Do you miss him?

351
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,080
I miss the way I felt with him
on the road.

352
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:24,668
That life was just beginning,
and that anything...

353
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,796
Anything was possible.

354
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,008
You know the feeling?

355
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,517
No.

356
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:45,981
It's my lawyer.

357
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:48,942
I'm sure he's wondering
where I got lost to.

358
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,918
We have a big problem.

359
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,964
Get down.

360
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,968
Stay down there.

361
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,178
- What's the problem?
- Watch the Miranda.

362
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,472
Put him on the fucking car.

363
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:22,392
You know how this goes.
If you want an attorney...

364
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,520
...we'll get one for you,
even if you can't afford one.

365
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:28,023
Do you understand your rights?

366
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,066
Do you understand?

367
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:35,989
Did you guys see that?
Looks like a yes to me.

368
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,450
Fucking cocksucker.

369
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,579
Never got confirmation
that Speltzer understood his rights.

370
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:44,748
- No.
- But Speltzer fucking nodded.

371
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,624
He didn't say yes.

372
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:50,587
And at Speltzer's arraignment,
his PD was able to make the case...

373
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,505
- Don't.
- ...that because Speltzer...

374
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,883
...was knocked unconscious,
it is possible...

375
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,010
...that he did not understand
his rights.

376
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,929
That it wasn't a nod.
That it was a temporary blackout.

377
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,723
And the judge fucking bought that?

378
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:05,310
The judge threw his confession
out of court.

379
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:06,895
- He walked.
- When?

380
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,522
- Two hours ago.
- Motherfucker.

381
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:13,068
And apparently, Speltzer's planning
to file a lawsuit against us.

382
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:14,986
Use of excessive force?

383
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:20,408
- I don't believe this.
- So all that's left to do is...

384
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:21,743
- Is what?
- Yeah, we--

385
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,455
- We'll wait till he kills someone else?
- There's nothing else we can do.

386
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:29,584
- But there is something I can do.
- Fuck that. Fuck all of this.

387
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:44,015
The bartender from The Fox Hole
blew his brains out last night.

388
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:50,688
Why don't they wear uniforms?
There's no respect.

389
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,859
You would never know
they were police.

390
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,288
Unless you knew
who you were looking for.

391
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,593
We got a single gunshot wound
to the right temple...

392
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,346
...what appears to be GSR
on the right hand.

393
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:27,058
It was through and through. Based on
the height of the bullet in the wall...

394
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:30,395
...Alex was sitting at the table.
He put his gun to his head.

395
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,690
- We got a White Russian on ice.
- Very funny.

396
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:37,026
I'll have you know
I have a major following on Twitter.

397
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:41,322
This gun is a 9-mil. Same type
of weapon used on Mike Anderson.

398
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,826
I'll go to Ballistics
and run this through.

399
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,287
And confirm this turd is our shooter.

400
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,666
But I know that Viktor
killed Mike Anderson.

401
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,794
Why would Alex take the fall for him?

402
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,339
Unless there's someone at the club
who wants the investigation to end...

403
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,341
...as much as Miami Metro does.

404
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,177
Quinn, read that note again.

405
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:05,805
"Kaja, I cannot live with
what I have done. I am very sorry."

406
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:08,683
- Sorry to Kaja?
- Yeah.

407
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:12,479
It makes sense. It's obvious this
Alex Dubrozny had feelings for her.

408
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,022
And she was in love with Tony.

409
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,274
Which probably
didn't sit very well with him.

410
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,234
So he kills her, kills Tony...

411
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:21,112
...and Mike was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

412
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,157
I mean, this guy still has pictures
up of his kids, his wife.

413
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:28,244
Yeah, he probably feels horrible
having to look at her face all day.

414
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:32,499
That's just it. He doesn't have to. Take
the pictures down. Put them away.

415
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,251
Leaving the pictures up
tells me he cares for them.

416
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:38,213
He's a guy. Once something's up,
why bother taking it down?

417
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,048
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

418
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:43,551
- I don't know if it all adds up.
- Look. We'll talk to the neighbours.

419
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:46,721
See if they saw anyone coming in
or out of Alex's apartment...

420
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,307
- ...if it'll make you happy.
- It's not about happy.

421
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:53,019
Angel.
Angel, this is our fucking guy.

422
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,818
Everyone yearns for clarity,
for closure.

423
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:04,948
But is that ever really possible?

424
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:13,122
- Jamie?
- Harrison's outgrown half these toys.

425
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:16,376
I know we had to go through them.
Didn't know it was gonna be now.

426
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,962
I'm almost done.
I wanted to do it while he's asleep.

427
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:23,174
Anything we're unsure about,
we can put in the keep-for-now pile.

428
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:29,931
- What's the other pile?
- Trash.

429
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,604
- You put Lamby in the trash?
- Lamby smells like pee.

430
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:43,194
And Harrison hasn't slept
with Lamby in more than a year.

431
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,530
Used to be he couldn't go to sleep
without it.

432
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,157
I remember. Keep?

433
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:50,910
No.

434
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:54,706
Yeah, a lot of kids sleep with security
blankets when they're little...

435
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,624
...but once they start socializing...

436
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,419
...you know,
learning how to be part of a group...

437
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,045
...they don't need it.

438
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:04,966
And Harrison, because he's a genius,
hit this milestone early.

439
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:09,345
He was so small.

440
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,683
Lamby was a gift from Rita's mother
when he was born.

441
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,811
Maybe we should keep it for Harrison.

442
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,564
For Harrison, of course.

443
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:34,162
Some toys are more difficult
than others to part with.

444
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:57,310
Speltzer is already back at work,
digging graves.

445
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,856
He should start by digging his own.

446
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:09,238
Miami Metro impounded
Speltzer's little pied-é-RV...

447
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:10,615
...when he was arrested...

448
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,201
...but they had to give it back
once he was set free.

449
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:19,791
Ray's been juicing.
At least he doesn't mind needles.

450
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:24,379
I can hide up here,
wait for Speltzer to come home.

451
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,172
I'll use the RV as my kill room...

452
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:30,051
...and transportation
to get rid of Ray's body.

453
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,394
And his trophies.

454
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:25,022
I'm still alive, but I don't think
I'm going to like the reason why.

455
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:33,990
Speltzer couldn't have done
all of this in a day.

456
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:38,035
Is this place his masterpiece?

457
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:50,089
I don't run. I make people run.

458
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:14,781
However, I do run if there's a bull
coming after me with an axe.

459
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:46,289
You should really try taking
a shower once in a while.

460
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:57,550
Where are you?

461
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:07,351
Speltzer keeps forcing me
down to the next floor.

462
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:13,649
So if he wants me to go down,
what happens if I go up?

463
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,612
He knows my face now.

464
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:04,241
If I want a rematch,
I'm gonna have to be smarter.

465
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:10,831
To take Speltzer down, I have
to make sure I have nothing to lose.

466
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:21,175
Harrison's only going to Orlando
for a few weeks, Dexter.

467
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:24,595
- Yep, I know.
- He's gonna be fine.

468
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:26,764
All he'll wanna do is follow
Cody around.

469
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:28,224
Thanks for driving him up.

470
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:32,144
I actually might spend a few days
there, see what trouble I can get into.

471
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,397
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks.

472
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:36,774
I'll take these down to the car.

473
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:46,742
Astor and Cody
are excited to see you.

474
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:49,662
I want you to be good for your
grandma and grandpa, okay?

475
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,833
I'm not sending Harrison to Orlando
because Deb asked me to...

476
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,711
...but because Speltzer
is a problem I need to solve.

477
00:38:56,919 --> 00:39:00,589
Once I do, Harrison will come home
where he belongs.

478
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:05,011
- You mean more to me than--
- Pizza!

479
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:09,849
That's right. Pizza. Let's go.

480
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:44,443
I will avenge your death.

481
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:50,574
Everything I do...

482
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:54,245
...is for you.

483
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,725
- Deb, you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

484
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:19,854
I wanna get back to the station...

485
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,481
...finish up the paperwork
on Mike's shooter.

486
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:23,691
Be there in a minute.

487
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,746
Motherfucker.

488
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,422
You impotent fuck.

489
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:49,008
- You got some mouth.
- What are you doing?

490
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:52,011
- Haven't you done enough?
- Oh, I'm just getting started.

491
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:54,555
You fucking motherfucking
cocksucker!

492
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,599
- All right--
- You fucking piece of shit!

493
00:41:56,807 --> 00:42:00,936
- Deb, get your shit together.
- You're so easy, just like the others.

494
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:03,480
Get the fuck out of here.
Come on.

495
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:05,065
Fuck you up.

496
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:08,652
I'll you see around.

497
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:22,333
Batista called.

498
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:26,795
- I'm sure he did.
- What happened?

499
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:32,051
I fucking lost my mind.

500
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:36,597
I saw Speltzer at Melanie's funeral.

501
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:42,353
- Fucking smiling at the hearse, and--
- What'd you do?

502
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:46,899
I fucking attacked him!
I wanted to fucking kill him.

503
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,236
Fuck you.

504
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:52,071
Is that why you came here?

505
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:55,866
To prove some fucking point
that everybody wants someone dead?

506
00:42:56,075 --> 00:43:00,579
I came here to see how you are.

507
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:02,373
That's all.

508
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:07,503
I'm just fucking great.

509
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:24,979
Is this ever gonna get easier?

510
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:28,357
Nothing's really all that different, Deb.

511
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:38,367
The only thing that's changed
is now you know more about me.

512
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:41,328
What I know about you...

513
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:49,128
...makes you a completely
different person.

514
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:53,173
But I'm not.
I'm the same person I've always been.

515
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:59,680
Your brother, the same person
who will always be there for you.

516
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:09,606
Maybe the question
is whether you'll be there for me.

517
00:44:20,284 --> 00:44:23,662
I don't know if I can feel
the same way about us.

518
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:27,124
I do.

519
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:32,338
I do.

520
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:36,550
And I don't too.

521
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:11,001
Are we sure this Alex Dubrozny guy
shot Mike Anderson?

522
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,338
- Why are you trying to rattle this?
- It smells like a set-up.

523
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:16,090
And what does a set-up smell like?

524
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:18,801
This bartender had no record
back in Kursk.

525
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:21,095
Suddenly he decides
to murder three people?

526
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:25,808
Alex had a short fuse, a broken heart
and a loaded gun.

527
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:29,228
A gun that Masuka confirmed
was the same one used on Mike.

528
00:45:29,395 --> 00:45:31,522
And we got a sweet little suicide
note...

529
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,025
...that helped us solve not just
Mike's murder, but two others.

530
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:37,736
That's what a set-up smells like.

531
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:41,490
It's all too neat, too easy.
Alex wasn't even on our radar.

532
00:45:41,657 --> 00:45:46,078
- Why would he off himself now?
- His conscience got to him.

533
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:50,541
Let's just swing by the club
one last time, ask around.

534
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:53,669
This is Mike we're talking about here.

535
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:56,588
Fine. Not tonight.

536
00:45:58,173 --> 00:45:59,925
- What's her name?
- Nadia.

537
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:02,803
- The stripper?
- She's a dancer.

538
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,681
- Doesn't keep a lot of clothes on.
- You serious about her?

539
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:08,684
I don't know what I am about her...

540
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:13,856
...but she was real close to Kaja and
Tony and all this is real hard on her.

541
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:16,024
I'm so glad
you're there to comfort her.

542
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:18,068
- Come on.
- I'm just jealous.

543
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:19,987
At least you got someone
in your life.

544
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:21,905
She's got a lot of pretty friends.

545
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:25,617
I'm a twice-divorced detective staring
down the barrel of retirement.

546
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:27,161
I'm already a cliché.

547
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,329
Don't need to add a stripper
to that list.

548
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:33,250
Fine. We'll go by tomorrow. Make sure
Alex isn't some patsy for the mob.

549
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:35,419
Have a good night.

550
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:54,396
Fight or flight.

551
00:46:57,024 --> 00:47:00,277
That's a part
of everyone's lizard brain.

552
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,422
Speltzer may have a lizard brain
like me...

553
00:47:21,924 --> 00:47:25,427
...but his shortcoming is he doesn't
have much of a human brain.

554
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:47,491
What the fuck is this?

555
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:50,327
The end of your run.

556
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:54,289
Get me out of here!

557
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:57,376
Yell all you want.
No one's gonna hear you.

558
00:47:57,543 --> 00:47:59,920
Fuck. Fuck!

559
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:04,049
Fuck! Fuck!

560
00:48:04,258 --> 00:48:09,179
Feels good. Fuck!

561
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:13,684
Now is when I'd slice your cheek
with my scalpel...

562
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:16,687
...and get a drop of blood
to remember you by...

563
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,898
...but I can't risk anyone finding
a blood slide ever again.

564
00:48:20,107 --> 00:48:22,025
You're a fucking freak.

565
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:25,237
Everything's different now.

566
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:28,490
The memory of killing you
will have to be enough.

567
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:30,701
I'm gonna kill you.

568
00:48:31,535 --> 00:48:35,163
That would be a twist.

569
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:38,792
But not one that's gonna
happen tonight.

570
00:48:46,717 --> 00:48:50,887
You were supposed to be a way out
of the tangle I was in with my sister...

571
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:54,308
...a thread she could follow
to understand me better...

572
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:55,892
...to accept me even.

573
00:48:57,728 --> 00:49:01,064
But she and I lost each other.

574
00:49:01,273 --> 00:49:04,526
She almost lost herself
going after you.

575
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:09,740
She wanted to catch you
just as much as I did.

576
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:15,329
Who knows, maybe our relationship
can rise from your ashes.

577
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:20,375
No. No.

578
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:56,370
It's time for everyone to move on.

579
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:12,969
Goodbye, friends.

580
00:51:00,517 --> 00:51:02,394
You came.

581
00:51:03,437 --> 00:51:05,021
I wasn't sure you would.

582
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:07,566
Me neither.

583
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:12,487
What am I doing here?

584
00:51:16,533 --> 00:51:17,743
That smoke.

585
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:29,629
It's Speltzer.

586
00:51:41,308 --> 00:51:43,477
Did you do this for me?

587
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,943
No.

588
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:02,329
How do you feel?

589
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:11,421
Glad.

590
00:52:22,808 --> 00:52:25,185
What does that make me?

591
00:52:32,609 --> 00:52:34,236
Human.
