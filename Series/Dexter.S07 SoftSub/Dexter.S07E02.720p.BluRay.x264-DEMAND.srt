1
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:11,638
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:14,099
- Where's your lug wrench at?
- No!

3
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,063
We are investigating the homicide
of a Miami Metro Police officer.

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,981
Viktor left on an evening flight.

5
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:25,568
He arrives in Kiev at 5:25 p.m.,
your time.

6
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:27,654
What about the dead police officer?

7
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:29,823
- I'll make it go away.
- Good.

8
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,492
- Hello, Viktor.
- Is there anything I can do...

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,452
- ...to keep you from killing me?
- No.

10
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:38,581
In my game,
you can be the serial killer.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,417
I think this is offensive.

12
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:44,045
Who would choose
to be a serial killer?

13
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:47,465
It's a bad idea. Do something else.

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,970
Only one person who ever worked
at Miami Metro ever took blood slides.

15
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,889
Sergeant Doakes,
the Bay Harbour Butcher.

16
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:00,520
What happened was too strong.
It got into you too early.

17
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:03,273
You mustn't ever tell Debra
the truth about yourself.

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,941
If you think she's upset now...

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,362
...that's nothing compared to how
she'd feel if she learned what you are.

20
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,616
Dexter, what the fuck?

21
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:16,077
You said Travis came at you
with a sword.

22
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:18,872
Where did you get the knives?
There was a roll of them.

23
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:20,874
I'm just trying to put this together.

24
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:33,720
Are you a serial killer?

25
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:36,514
Yes.

26
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,997
I've dreaded this moment
my whole life.

27
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,918
But I never pictured it like this.

28
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,546
Don't you fucking touch me.

29
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,175
I just want to know you're okay.

30
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:19,886
I am not okay.

31
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:25,850
- I am never gonna fucking be okay.
- Just try to take it easy.

32
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:28,645
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

33
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,483
How long have you been doing this?

34
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,903
How long have you been
fucking doing this?

35
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:42,367
Since I was 20.

36
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:48,122
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.

37
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:53,795
Those blood slides
that I found in your apartment...

38
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:56,422
...they look like the ones
we found in Doakes' car.

39
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,882
Deb.

40
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,135
Are you the Bay Harbour Butcher?

41
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,930
This is not the place
to talk about this.

42
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:07,141
Deb.

43
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:12,355
- I only kill certain kinds of people...
- Oh, God.

44
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:13,731
...like Travis.

45
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:19,529
Deb, Dad taught me.

46
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,158
He gave me a code.

47
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,286
Dad knew?

48
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,707
It was his idea. He knew everything.

49
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,128
- Oh, fuck.
- Deb.

50
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,636
Please, just...

51
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,223
Just come back inside with me.

52
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,142
Please.

53
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:05,033
Harry found me sitting in a pool
of my mother's blood.

54
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:08,870
He understood why I had these...

55
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,998
...urges.

56
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:16,127
A lot of horrible things happen
to a lot of people.

57
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:19,172
And they don't turn out like you.

58
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,549
I don't know about other people.

59
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:26,387
But I have this need...

60
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:30,058
...deep inside me.

61
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,273
I call it my dark passenger.

62
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,485
You gave it a name?

63
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:46,240
Harry said it got in me too early
and too deep.

64
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,785
He said I couldn't change it.

65
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,163
And so...

66
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,791
...he thought up the code.

67
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:59,170
He said if I had to kill, I might
as well kill people who deserved it.

68
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:04,342
You make it sound like it's okay,
like you're the victim here.

69
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:09,931
The people in that box, Dexter...

70
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,684
...they're the victims.

71
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:15,937
Victims?

72
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:27,615
A choir director
who raped and murdered little boys?

73
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:34,622
A married couple smuggling refugees
who killed the ones who couldn't pay?

74
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:35,957
A psychiatrist...

75
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,127
...who manipulated women
into taking their own lives?

76
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,381
There's this place
called the police department.

77
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:48,761
Sometimes the system doesn't work.
Killers fall through the cracks.

78
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:53,182
Don't I fucking know it?

79
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:57,478
I'm talking to one right now.

80
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,951
I am the worst fucking detective
in the world.

81
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:14,871
You're my own brother.

82
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,165
How could I not see
what you were doing?

83
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,211
- You're not responsible for this.
- Well, I am now.

84
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,673
I helped you cover up
Travis' murder.

85
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,094
- I'm an accomplice.
- You walked in on me.

86
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:33,764
- I had to think on my feet.
- Well, fuck me for ruining your night.

87
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,018
What am I supposed to do here?

88
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:40,438
My name has the word "lieutenant"
in front of it.

89
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,441
I can't turn my back on this.

90
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:51,115
All of this is very, very fucking wrong.

91
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:56,996
So...

92
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,670
...what are you gonna do?

93
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:21,354
I never wanted her to go through this,
Dex.

94
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,606
Neither did I.

95
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,817
Then you should have been
more careful.

96
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:30,321
At least she didn't arrest me.

97
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,365
Not yet.

98
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,929
What is this doing here?

99
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,018
Is it some kind of message?

100
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,732
Maybe someone else is on to me.

101
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:25,418
According to FBI Special Agent
Frank Lundy:

102
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:29,005
"it's almost certain that the butcher
is still at work.

103
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:32,049
Serial killers have an addiction...

104
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:35,469
...and will continue to kill
until they're caught."

105
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,192
If the ITK hand in my apartment
is genuine...

106
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,695
...then it can't still be in Evidence.

107
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,958
Not here.

108
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,669
Then I was sent the real thing.

109
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:13,841
No record of it being checked out.

110
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,260
Could it have been stolen?

111
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,347
Sorry.

112
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,684
Sorry. Saw you come in here.
I just got curious.

113
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,397
- Now I wish I hadn't.
- Why?

114
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,567
You're looking for the hand,
aren't you? Look, I can explain.

115
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:34,445
Look, remember
my former intern Ryan?

116
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:38,324
Blond, stacked and the cause
of many sleepless nights?

117
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,659
- Yeah.
- Well, she needed some extra dough...

118
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:44,163
...so she stole the hand
and auctioned it online.

119
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,499
That's why I fired her.

120
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,668
- Who won the auction?
- Don't know.

121
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:53,381
- I put Louis on the case to find out.
- Louis?

122
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,884
Not even with all his digital skills,
he couldn't dig up a name.

123
00:11:57,093 --> 00:12:00,012
At least he was able
to erase the electronic trail.

124
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,057
Did Louis find the hand
and keep it?

125
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,309
No one needs to know, right?

126
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:08,979
But why send the work
of a serial killer to me?

127
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,898
Does Louis know what I am?

128
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,149
Dex?

129
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,151
What?

130
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,028
We're cool, right?

131
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,696
Yeah. No one needs to know.

132
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,699
Oh, thank God.

133
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,079
- I was ready to blow you.
- Not necessary.

134
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:29,875
- Briefing. You coming?
- Yeah.

135
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,048
I have to find out
what Louis knows about me.

136
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:38,467
Some time alone with him
and he'd open up...

137
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,302
...one way or another.

138
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,931
But I need to put out fires,
not start new ones.

139
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,648
Remember him?

140
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,484
It's been three days
since Mike was gunned down.

141
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:59,071
The son of a bitch that pulled
the trigger is still walking the streets.

142
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,322
Where are we?

143
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,534
We're continuing to hit the club
where Miss Soroka was employed.

144
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:07,413
Someone there must've seen
something related to her death.

145
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,083
We think it's our best shot at a lead,
Gonna shut them down every night.

146
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,503
You know, those places do
big business during lunch too.

147
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,007
- Just saying.
- Start shutting them down twice a day.

148
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:21,302
- With pleasure.
- Moving on.

149
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,264
This pretty face belongs
to Wayne Randall.

150
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:28,017
Fifteen years ago,
Randall and his teenage girlfriend...

151
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:31,520
...went on a three-state killing spree
that ended here in Miami.

152
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,857
He's currently serving
two consecutive life terms at Dade.

153
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,027
Randall now claims to have evidence
on three other murders...

154
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:41,280
...that he committed in the Miami area,
and he wants to come clean.

155
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:44,366
He wants to lead investigators
to where he buried the bodies.

156
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,618
That's nice of him.

157
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,828
He says he wants
to clear his conscience.

158
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,331
His lawyers are just trying
to swing a deal.

159
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,582
What's he telling us?

160
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:54,418
He told us about one victim,
a brunette in her mid-20s...

161
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:58,589
...that matches a missing persons
report from that time, a Janice Dubois.

162
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,258
There's a chance
he's not completely full of shit.

163
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,135
County has requested
one detective...

164
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,763
...and one lab tech to help them
process the scene.

165
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,389
- Miller?
- Yeah.

166
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,350
- You're volunteer number one.
- I'll go.

167
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,060
No.

168
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,104
- I want Masuka on this.
- I don't to work a dumpsite.

169
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,190
Come on, I'm up to my ears
on Mike's case.

170
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:17,942
I'm sorry. You're with Miller.

171
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,778
Contact info will be in your boxes.
You'll start tomorrow.

172
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:22,780
That's it. Thank you.

173
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,751
Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

174
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,468
I was this close to arresting you
this morning.

175
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,975
I even thought about
what I would say to the press.

176
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:54,144
I wouldn't want to have to write
that speech.

177
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,896
I don't know what to do.

178
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:58,482
Every alternative I can think of...

179
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:01,944
...is fucking crazy.

180
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,988
Such as?

181
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,490
It's fucked up.

182
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,701
Try me.

183
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:13,664
They say people like you
are addicts.

184
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,584
Like drugs.

185
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,502
It's not untrue.

186
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:22,381
Well, when addicts want to get better,
they go to rehab.

187
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:27,011
I don't think there are clinics
for what I've got.

188
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,138
We can make one.

189
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:31,682
I could be your clinic.

190
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,060
- How?
- You move in with me.

191
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,982
I watch you 24/7 and make sure
that there's no way in hell you can...

192
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,778
...do what you do...

193
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,907
...and if it is an addiction,
then maybe...

194
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,869
Maybe you can get over it.

195
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:56,624
You're right. It's crazy.

196
00:15:56,832 --> 00:16:00,252
Dexter,
if you can channel your urges...

197
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:03,005
...why can't you control them?

198
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,510
What if Dad had taught you
how to quit...

199
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,430
...instead of teaching you
how to live with it?

200
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,434
- He fucked up.
- There's a big problem with this idea.

201
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:18,395
What?

202
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,314
I've tried stopping before.

203
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:22,358
It didn't work.

204
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,361
Well, now you have me.

205
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:30,282
Someone who loves you more
than you will ever fucking know.

206
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:37,748
And in spite of all of this,
I still believe that there is good in you.

207
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,254
Maybe more that's in most people.

208
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,841
What if it doesn't work?

209
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,595
I don't...

210
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,641
I don't want to think about that.

211
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,397
And how much choice
do I have here?

212
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,819
None.

213
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,990
Okay.

214
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,121
Thanks for getting back to me
so quickly.

215
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,748
I'm curious.
Your facilities are state-of-the-art.

216
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,418
Why go through a private lab?

217
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:27,131
Just trying to lighten the load.
It's been a hectic few months.

218
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,508
Look, just to confirm...

219
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:32,010
...the blood you sampled
from the glass fragment...

220
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,305
...is a positive match
with Travis Marshall's?

221
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,266
No question about it.

222
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,814
Thank you. Thanks.
Remember, keep this confidential.

223
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:48,402
And when you send back the findings,
address them to me personally, okay?

224
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:51,572
- No problem.
- Great. Thanks.

225
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,842
- Yes, captain?
- Regional FBI office, please.

226
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,990
We are back!

227
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,327
Hey! I won't allow this to go on.
This is harassment.

228
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:41,663
No, this is an inconvenience. We're
working our way up to harassment.

229
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,042
I told you the last time you were here,
I don't know who killed Kaja.

230
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,877
I don't know who shot
your policeman.

231
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,213
Kaja was clubbed to death in the
parking lot...

232
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,965
- ...15 yards from where we are.
- No one saw anything.

233
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,426
- Sell that somewhere else.
- What are you gonna do?

234
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,637
Gonna keep coming every day
and shut me down?

235
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,305
No, I'm coming back tonight too.

236
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:01,350
- What the fuck do you want from me?
- I want the shooter.

237
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,519
You rack your brain
and give me something...

238
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,939
...or I'm gonna turn this place
into a fucking monastery.

239
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,317
You got that list?

240
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,528
Follow me.

241
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,615
You know, the money we make here
is all we have to live on.

242
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,450
What you're doing is really unfair.

243
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,119
What's your name?

244
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,665
- Nadia.
- Come here.

245
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:33,841
Have a drink.

246
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,510
We're not supposed to drink
while we're working.

247
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,929
Come on.
You hear any music playing?

248
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,394
Now, what you said isn't true.

249
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,563
I do care who killed Kaja...

250
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,815
...but no one around here
seems interested...

251
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,609
...in helping me find out who it is.
Okay?

252
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:56,071
Do you know anybody who might be
interested in hurting your friend?

253
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:00,868
You've been told
not to cooperate with us?

254
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,955
Kaja was dating someone.

255
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:09,001
Tony Rush.
He's one of the bouncers here.

256
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,461
They were on and off,
but Tony is a good guy.

257
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,714
Can you point Tony out to me?

258
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,008
He's not here today.

259
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,553
I really hope you catch the person
who did this...

260
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,597
...and put a bullet through his head.

261
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:25,350
That's not generally how we work,
but I get where you're coming from.

262
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,437
Here, if you can think of anything
to help, give me a call.

263
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,982
I will, Detective Quinn.

264
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,193
- Joey.
- Excuse me. Joey.

265
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,906
- Tell me you got the shooter.
- Possibly.

266
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,825
One of the bouncers hasn't come
to work since the murders.

267
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,827
Tony Rush.

268
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:46,163
- How'd you know?
- He and Kaja were an item.

269
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,958
Suspicious timing, don't you think?
The sudden absence?

270
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,668
Come on.

271
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,725
Hey.

272
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,944
You're gonna sleep in the bedroom.

273
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,072
I'm not gonna put you out.

274
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,448
Yes, you are.

275
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:23,617
I'm sleeping out here.

276
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,118
Deb, that's ridiculous.

277
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,329
This isn't a fucking pyjama party,
Dex, okay?

278
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,956
You're gonna take my bedroom...

279
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,416
...and I'm gonna sleep out here
on the couch.

280
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,796
- Between me and the front door?
- I will be by the door.

281
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,096
You've really thought this through.

282
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,181
Yeah, well, I found this website:

283
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,558
"How to cure a serial killer
in ten easy steps."

284
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,311
And this is the first step.

285
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,442
You'll have to print me out a copy.

286
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,862
I'm figuring this out as I go along,
Dexter.

287
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,740
But if we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it all the way.

288
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,827
We're gonna eat together,
we're gonna watch TV together...

289
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:10,247
...we're gonna drive
to fucking work together.

290
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,500
Hope you got a big shower.

291
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,088
Why don't you go unpack.
I'll heat us up something to eat.

292
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,928
You have to be completely honest
with me.

293
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,431
That is the first rule.

294
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,852
My new code.

295
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:59,296
Don't you think Deb has gone through
enough without you lying to her?

296
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:01,631
I'm not lying.

297
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,884
You're a killer, Dex.

298
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,261
Deb didn't raise you.

299
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,138
I did.

300
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:11,183
She never saw
what you were really like.

301
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,143
I did.

302
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,897
I was right to channel your urges
instead of trying to suppress them.

303
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,192
You think I can just walk out of here
and call the whole thing off?

304
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:23,028
If it were this simple,
watching you for 24 hours a day...

305
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:25,322
...don't you think
I would have tried it?

306
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:28,533
Maybe you should've.

307
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,921
How does it feel?

308
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:45,175
This need to kill?

309
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,094
What do you call it?

310
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,680
My dark passenger.

311
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:56,311
You make it sound like
you're possessed or something.

312
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:01,399
That's how it feels sometimes.

313
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:06,029
Do you know how many assholes
in prison...

314
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:09,533
...blame their actions
on someone or something else?

315
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:14,454
I'm not copping a plea, Deb.
I'm giving you honesty.

316
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,960
It's rule number one, right?

317
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,755
How's the spaghetti?

318
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,804
Overcooked.

319
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:33,765
First rule.

320
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,144
So how does it feel?

321
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,735
It starts with blood.

322
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,405
Blood?

323
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,617
Yeah, the image of it...

324
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:59,416
...trickling down the back
of my eyelids.

325
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:07,841
The trickle becomes a stream
and then a flood.

326
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,387
It fills me up...

327
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,600
...all my empty spaces.

328
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:22,355
But then the blood
isn't red anymore.

329
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,651
- What is it?
- It's black.

330
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,450
And pressing.

331
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:39,831
It feels like my head
is gonna explode.

332
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:43,919
And...

333
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,047
...the only way
to relieve the pressure...

334
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,674
...is to open the floodgates...

335
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:53,386
...let it spill out.

336
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:00,727
I can't believe you're like this.

337
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,814
You're a sick fuck, Dexter.
Jesus Christ.

338
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,942
Well, maybe we shouldn't talk
about it.

339
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:10,278
Yeah, maybe not while I'm serving
fucking tomato sauce.

340
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,076
Are you seeing blood now?

341
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,578
Nope, just spaghetti.

342
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,540
Well, if you start seeing red,
will you fucking call me?

343
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:26,044
And say what?
"Deb, I'm seeing blood"?

344
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,924
Say, "I really feel...

345
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,887
...like wrapping someone up in plastic
and stabbing them."

346
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:39,182
And I can say, "No, Dexter, don't."

347
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,854
Second rule.

348
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,986
There have to be families out there
that are more fucked up than us.

349
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,824
But I sure as hell wouldn't
wanna meet them.

350
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:02,038
What the fuck am I doing here?

351
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:09,421
- What you think's right.
- Right would be turning you in.

352
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,966
I'm doing this
because I can't stand the idea...

353
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,094
...of you living the rest of your life
in prison.

354
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,056
Or worse.

355
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:31,609
I told Deb I'd be honest with her,
but it's not like I'm stalking a kill.

356
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,737
I just need to get
into Louis' penthouse...

357
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,239
...and find out what he knows
about me.

358
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,333
You Okay?

359
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,919
- It's late.
- Yeah. I'm just doing some work.

360
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,383
I'll sit with you.

361
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,428
Deb, I'm fine.

362
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:00,805
No, you shouldn't be alone
right now.

363
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:04,017
I mean, awake and alone.

364
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:13,693
Yeah, maybe I should try
to get some sleep.

365
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:22,410
Just know that I'm here for you.

366
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,957
How could I forget?

367
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,377
Now that Deb is my Siamese twin...

368
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:34,923
...getting into Louis' penthouse
is going to be next to impossible.

369
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,510
But how long can I wait?

370
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,597
You know, for the tenth time...

371
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,809
...I barely saw Kaja that night.
I was working.

372
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:49,813
She got off at 2 a.m. and I don't know
what she did after that.

373
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:53,942
Whatever you decide to get into
after this, forget writing...

374
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:58,238
...because you could not make up
a story to save your fucking life.

375
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:06,538
Security tapes back him up.

376
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,332
- Shit. Are you sure?
- No doubt.

377
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,043
He was at the club all night working.

378
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:18,466
Well, it looks like some
of what you said wasn't bullshit.

379
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,927
You were working
when Kaja was killed.

380
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:25,181
We still don't like the fact that
you vanished the day after she died.

381
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:28,059
Smells like guilt to me.

382
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:31,187
- You could have had someone do it.
- No way.

383
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:33,523
What happened?
She start sleeping around on you?

384
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,818
- Kaja was loyal.
- Loyal, huh?

385
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,237
So she was doing you.

386
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:41,197
At least we're getting somewhere.

387
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:45,994
The problem is now we know
you've been lying to us...

388
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,829
...about you and Kaja.

389
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,706
And that's bad form, Tony.

390
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:52,000
We tend to get cranky
when people bullshit us.

391
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:55,086
Now, if you think what we're doing
to the club is bad...

392
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,130
...wait till we start on you.

393
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:02,385
She was with Viktor.

394
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,429
Say again?

395
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,223
The night that Kaja died...

396
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,601
...she left the club with Viktor.

397
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:13,271
- Fucking sleazebag.
- Who the fuck is Viktor?

398
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,358
Hey, how's it going out there?

399
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:18,568
Don't ask.

400
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,320
Bad as you thought?

401
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,197
Worse.

402
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:26,159
We sit in the sun waiting
for the diggers to find a body.

403
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,745
I mean, so far they've uncovered
a telephone cable...

404
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,246
...and a bag of used diapers.

405
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:33,082
I mean, all this waiting around...

406
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,919
...it's like dating a born-again
Christian.

407
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,755
If I don't have Deb
watching my every move...

408
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:41,674
...it'll be a lot easier to slip away
to Louis' apartment.

409
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,384
I'm getting a little stir crazy.

410
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,678
- I wouldn't mind a day out of the lab.
- Dude.

411
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,598
Oh, my God,
I would be eternally grateful.

412
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,892
But you'd have to clear it
with your sister.

413
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,520
For some reason,
she really wants me out there.

414
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:58,399
- You think she secretly hates me?
- I'll see what I can do.

415
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:05,782
Masuka's miserable on this whole
Wayne Randall thing.

416
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,993
He's begging me to take over
for him today.

417
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:10,453
Okay. Great.

418
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,914
Great.

419
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,499
I'll drive.

420
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,170
- You'll drive?
- I could use some fresh air. Let's go.

421
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,881
- Just got a break on Mike's shooting.
- What?

422
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:24,551
The last person to see Kaja alive
was Viktor Baskov.

423
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,762
He's a Russian expat. We couldn't find
anything on him in here...

424
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,973
...but we got a hit
on the Interpol database.

425
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:31,975
He's a member
of the Koshka brotherhood.

426
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,393
Known for narcotics...

427
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,603
- ...and human trafficking.
- Hold on.

428
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:40,316
I have to take care of this.
Are we good?

429
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:44,487
Deb, I'll be surrounded by federal
marshals. I think I'll be okay.

430
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,620
It was 15 years ago.
Give me a fucking break.

431
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:55,832
Where are the bodies, Wayne?

432
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,542
Closer to the road.

433
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,004
- Why'd you tell us to dig here?
- Because this place looks different.

434
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:02,922
Look at these mini-malls.

435
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:07,677
You think I like being out here with you
in the fucking heat?

436
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:10,179
- All right. Listen. We're moving.
- Damn.

437
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,223
Strike this.

438
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:18,104
One more wit,
he'd be a fucking half-wit.

439
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,357
God.

440
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:24,027
Oh, it's hot as a pig's asshole.

441
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,195
All this asphalt.

442
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,325
You know, this used to be
a real pretty place.

443
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,702
Field.

444
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,746
Trees.

445
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,332
Now look at it.

446
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,710
Yeah, nothing stays the same.

447
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,962
That's the truth.

448
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,215
Well, at least the Frosty Swirl
is still here.

449
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,681
You surprised a lot of people.

450
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,645
- How's that?
- Leading us to these bodies.

451
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,688
Why the change of heart?

452
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:03,316
Why do you care?

453
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:05,610
I'm just curious.

454
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:08,321
People say you grew a conscience.

455
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:12,742
It was always there.

456
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:16,704
It was just buried
under a lot of Wayne Randall.

457
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,040
I just surrendered.

458
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:22,210
- Surrendered?
- All right. Let's break for lunch.

459
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:23,753
We'll pick this up in an hour.

460
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,588
Oh, here we go.

461
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:29,926
Getting to Louis' penthouse
and back in an hour will be tight...

462
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:33,638
...but I'm not exactly flush
with options.

463
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:49,070
I can appreciate the mind-set
of a collector...

464
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,697
...but toys?

465
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,908
Seems like a waste
of a good obsession.

466
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,681
My charge card numbers?

467
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:20,184
So Louis killed my credit cards.

468
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:23,062
Why is he messing with my life?

469
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:34,198
It features 29 points of articulation...

470
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:36,617
...five more than the last figure
they put out...

471
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:39,120
...so at least they're listening
to the collectors.

472
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:42,165
Still, they could have--

473
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:47,712
Idea: a video diary app.

474
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,842
One touch, device starts recording.
Tap again and it uploads directly to...

475
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,219
Still waiting.

476
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:56,929
Yeah, I'm almost done.

477
00:34:57,138 --> 00:35:00,767
Your hour's almost up.
I'm only thinking of you.

478
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,854
Oh, God.

479
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:08,107
There'll never be an app for this.

480
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:10,151
Jesus.

481
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:13,905
This is going to be worse
than Bob Henley.

482
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,782
He got off easy.

483
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,285
I want to see Dexter lying
in his own piss and vomit...

484
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:22,622
...and I won't stop until that
represents the high point of his day.

485
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:25,374
No one fucks with me.

486
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,084
No one.

487
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:31,380
Now, on to more important things.

488
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,050
Four-ninety--

489
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,429
Bob Henley.

490
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:53,152
"Henley arrested after the FBI found
child pornography on his workstation.

491
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:56,697
Skanda tech has announced
his dismissal...

492
00:35:56,906 --> 00:36:01,369
...pending charges
which could fetch up to 15 years."

493
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:04,205
Is this how Louis took control
of his software company?

494
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:08,793
By setting this guy up?
What's he planning for me?

495
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:30,356
With Deb on my case, I don't know
when I'll have this chance again.

496
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:49,500
- Why are you fucking with me, Louis?
- God, please, don't hurt me.

497
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,544
Give me a good reason
not to hurt you...

498
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:53,880
...because right now
I want to break your neck.

499
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:57,550
- Why'd you send me the hand?
- It was a stupid joke.

500
00:36:57,758 --> 00:37:00,386
I just, you know, the lifelines,
you know, time is short.

501
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,722
It was a clue.
I was screwing with you.

502
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:04,724
Why?

503
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:09,353
Because I came to you for help
with my game and you said no.

504
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,940
Your game?

505
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:16,569
Yes, I swear that's the reason.

506
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,370
This is about your game?

507
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:32,084
I spent five years on that game
and you shit all over it.

508
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,337
And now I'm too depressed
to even look at it.

509
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,505
It was my whole world!

510
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:43,679
I never wanna see you again.

511
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:47,683
Work. Jamie.

512
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,227
Do you understand?

513
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:55,191
I'm done. I'm totally done.

514
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,618
Where the fuck have you been?

515
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,036
Running an errand.

516
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,454
What errand?

517
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:10,164
Deb, I didn't kill anybody.

518
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:13,584
How the fuck do I know that?
I've been calling you and calling you.

519
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:16,712
- I didn't get the messages.
- Well, check your fucking phone.

520
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,798
I need to know where you are
at all times.

521
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:22,843
- That is what we agreed on, right?
- It won't happen again.

522
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:26,263
Finish what you need to do here
and we'll go visit Harrison together.

523
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,682
Okay.

524
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,308
Here you are.

525
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:34,397
Seems you rode that wagon
till the wheels came off.

526
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,775
- Trouble in paradise?
- No, she's my sister.

527
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:39,568
Also my boss.

528
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:44,573
Congratulations.
You just redefined hell.

529
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,702
What crawled up her ass?

530
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,871
It's a long story.

531
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:55,501
Randall, what'd you mean earlier
when you said "surrendered"?

532
00:38:56,794 --> 00:39:00,464
I just accepted my situation,
you know...

533
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,550
...of being where I am.

534
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:06,470
Prison. People watching
your every move.

535
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:08,973
It is what it is.

536
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,434
Once I stopped fighting it...

537
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,438
...the anger just fell off...

538
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:18,232
...like a bad scab.

539
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:22,611
Left me open
to try and make things right.

540
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,993
They still use real ice cream.

541
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:32,413
At least everything hasn't gone
to hell.

542
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:41,630
We're still not getting anywhere,
George.

543
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,632
I mean, you must like us
coming here.

544
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:47,219
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- Stop protecting Viktor Baskov.

545
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,305
- I told you--
- Yeah, he doesn't work here.

546
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:51,599
Just comes in for a drink
now and then.

547
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,851
- That's all I know.
- Right.

548
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:55,978
We'll see you soon.

549
00:39:56,645 --> 00:40:00,399
I might even bring a portable
polygraph next time.

550
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:04,361
You know how long it would take
to poly everyone in here?

551
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:14,872
Okay, everybody get your asses
back to work.

552
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,930
- Rough day?
- Isaak.

553
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:34,016
Mr. Sirko.

554
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,727
What are you doing here?

555
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:38,771
I heard the police.

556
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:43,359
It would appear that I'm here
for the same reason, to find Viktor.

557
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:46,654
Yeah, I swear I...

558
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:48,989
I have no idea
how they got his name.

559
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,407
I'm sure of it.

560
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:53,869
But we'll get to that.

561
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:59,333
Anyway, I thought he was in Kiev
with you.

562
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:02,002
If Viktor was in Kiev...

563
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,213
...why would I be here?

564
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:07,550
Viktor never made his flight.

565
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:09,009
I checked.

566
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:11,303
Well, I don't understand.

567
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,930
Where is he, then?

568
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:20,896
Viktor's caused us some problems.

569
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:23,065
I won't deny it.

570
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:26,527
Shooting a policeman
is never good for business.

571
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,032
I can't help but wonder...

572
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:37,371
...if someone in the brotherhood
decided to make an example of him.

573
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,292
Without your approval? No.

574
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,628
Oh, no. Viktor was impulsive, yes.

575
00:41:44,837 --> 00:41:47,590
He did a stupid thing, yes.

576
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:52,344
But he was one of us
and we would always protect him.

577
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,438
You're in luck.

578
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:05,232
Why?

579
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,402
I believe you.

580
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:15,117
I've had a long flight.

581
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:24,835
We have a lot to discuss.

582
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:28,589
- Hello?
- Hello, Joey?

583
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,633
It's Nadia from the Fox Hole.

584
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:34,178
Yeah, how many Nadias
do you think I know?

585
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:37,806
- What's up?
- My car won't start.

586
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:41,602
I was wondering if maybe you could
give me a ride home tonight.

587
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:45,105
Yeah, sure.
What time do you get off?

588
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:44,790
- Hey.
- Hey.

589
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:47,626
We were just having a little dinner.
Look who's here.

590
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:50,379
Hey, bud, I missed you today.
How was school?

591
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:54,258
- We had toy share.
- Toy share?

592
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:58,345
- Did you bring your train set?
- Fire truck.

593
00:43:58,721 --> 00:44:01,682
- Fire truck beat out the train set?
- Yes.

594
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,393
Oh, hey, Dex.

595
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:09,231
Just grabbing one for the road. I know
you don't like me being on this side...

596
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:11,984
...but it's all right when Jamie's here,
right?

597
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,739
- Why not?
- Sweet.

598
00:44:16,947 --> 00:44:20,075
This is such a great place
to hang out. Right by the bay.

599
00:44:20,284 --> 00:44:22,161
- Yeah.
- I love coming over here.

600
00:44:23,537 --> 00:44:26,999
Well, I better get going.
I'll see you tomorrow.

601
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:35,299
And...

602
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:39,094
...I'll catch you at work, right? Yeah.

603
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:51,982
He's not scared of me at all.

604
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,818
And he's not going to quit...

605
00:44:55,903 --> 00:44:58,238
...unless I stop him.

606
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:04,787
You're a lifesaver.
Not all cops are so nice to strippers.

607
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:09,208
To tell you the truth, I was hoping
you had something more for me.

608
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:12,669
- More for you?
- About the murders.

609
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:18,467
What? You think this is just some ploy
so I could get you alone...

610
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:19,885
...and spill my guts?

611
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:25,057
Look, I told you everything
that I knew.

612
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:28,143
My car really did break down.
I'm sorry.

613
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:31,480
- I could pay you for the gas.
- Stop it. It's fine.

614
00:45:32,189 --> 00:45:35,943
It's the least I could do
after all I'm costing you in tips.

615
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:40,155
You'll have to do a lot more than
give me a lift to make up for that.

616
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:44,618
This is it. On the left.

617
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:51,583
What'd you have in mind
as far as compensation?

618
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:54,878
I don't know. Use your imagination.

619
00:45:55,421 --> 00:46:00,342
Well, you're gonna have to give me
a hint. I'm very unimaginative.

620
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:03,137
Okay.

621
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:07,850
George says the problem with my car
could be the transmission.

622
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:15,941
It means it's going to be in the shop
for at least a few days.

623
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,526
Yeah.

624
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:22,364
Well, maybe you could
pick up the bill.

625
00:46:23,115 --> 00:46:25,242
I'd really appreciate it.

626
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:38,505
You're awfully quiet tonight.

627
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:41,091
Anything you wanna talk about?

628
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,260
Anything I can do?

629
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,555
Yeah.

630
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:48,265
What?

631
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:50,767
Do you have any A-1?

632
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:54,146
I think so.

633
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,526
Just enough for a good night's sleep.

634
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:01,737
That's all I need.

635
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:06,658
- Success!
- Thank you.

636
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:34,686
Just finishing what you started.

637
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:57,793
I promised Deb.

638
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:16,895
Hello?

639
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,651
Where are you?

640
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:31,660
Sorry. I got here as fast as I could.

641
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:35,163
Almost drove off the road.
I'm so fucking tired.

642
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:38,625
What are you doing here?

643
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:45,549
I snuck out of the house
while you were asleep.

644
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:48,635
- Dexter, what the fuck did you do?
- Nothing.

645
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:54,683
I couldn't go through with it,
but I wanted to.

646
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,685
I needed to.

647
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:59,896
I didn't care about anything else.

648
00:49:00,564 --> 00:49:03,859
I lost control.
All I could see was blood.

649
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:09,865
All I could feel was the pressure
in my head. Fuck!

650
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:18,665
It is too deep inside me.
Harry was right. I am a monster.

651
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:25,714
You should arrest me.
You should take me in.

652
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:28,050
Get me off the street.

653
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:29,801
Dex.

654
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,846
Dad was wrong.

655
00:49:35,265 --> 00:49:40,145
The fact that we're here tonight
proves that you are in control.

656
00:49:40,354 --> 00:49:42,773
- But I wasn't.
- But you stopped.

657
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:45,567
That's what's important.

658
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:48,570
It must've been so hard
for you to call me...

659
00:49:48,779 --> 00:49:51,365
...but you did,
and that's a huge step.

660
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:57,704
It makes me think
maybe you can control this.

661
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,540
You really believe that?

662
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:02,668
I didn't.

663
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:05,379
But maybe now I do.

664
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:13,345
What happened tonight
is a good thing.

665
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:16,264
It was really, really good.

666
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,227
I'm not gonna give up.

667
00:50:21,645 --> 00:50:24,064
And I'm not gonna let you give up.

668
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:33,031
- Are you okay to drive?
- No, I'm gonna stay with you.

669
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,160
I just need to be alone
for a couple of minutes.

670
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:39,913
Nothing's gonna happen.

671
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:41,581
Okay.

672
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:11,737
You'll wake up with a headache.

673
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,947
Probably have a decent idea
how you got here.

674
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:16,867
Maybe that's a good thing.

675
00:51:29,171 --> 00:51:31,673
I still have to get you out of my life.

676
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,342
But not by taking yours.

677
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:58,450
What the fuck?

678
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:01,536
Who the fuck are you?

679
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:05,248
I'm your employer or rather,
former employer.

680
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:07,417
I believe you recently gave notice.

681
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:10,921
Bullshit. I work for George.
Well, worked.

682
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:12,255
And he works for me.

683
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:14,090
My name is Isaak.

684
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:17,469
I'm the owner of the Fox Hole chain
of gentlemen's clubs...

685
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:19,221
...amongst other enterprises.

686
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:21,264
What do you want'?

687
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:24,810
It would appear that George neglected
to do your exit interview.

688
00:52:25,018 --> 00:52:28,230
It's company policy and I'm a stickler
when it comes to rules.

689
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:30,982
You got to be kidding, right?

690
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:34,402
Keeping good employees is essential
to running a successful business.

691
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:36,613
Your feedback is important.

692
00:52:36,822 --> 00:52:38,615
Would you mind telling me
why you quit?

693
00:52:38,824 --> 00:52:42,160
Well, I trust it wasn't the hostile
working environment.

694
00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:43,411
No, I...

695
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:48,667
I just felt it was time to move on.

696
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:52,254
So it was nothing to do with
the tragic death of one of our dancers?

697
00:52:52,462 --> 00:52:54,381
Kaja, I believe her name was.

698
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:58,635
Because if it did,
I would completely understand.

699
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:01,096
It must have been quite
a traumatic loss for you.

700
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:02,514
What do you mean?

701
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:05,684
Yeah. Maybe that's why you talked
to the police.

702
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:08,687
- No way.
- I had you followed.

703
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,649
You know what?
I didn't say a word. I swear.

704
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:16,278
I lied. I didn't have you followed.

705
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:20,907
You were just
the most likely candidate.

706
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,954
You loved her, didn't you?

707
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:27,163
What?

708
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,333
Kaja. You were in love with her.

709
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:34,421
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

710
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:39,259
It's the one thing
that gives meaning in this life.

711
00:53:40,886 --> 00:53:44,097
I would have done the same thing
if I was in your position.

712
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:50,937
It's terrible to lose someone
you love.

713
00:54:23,845 --> 00:54:26,598
You still thinking about last night?

714
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:29,976
Actually, I'm thinking about how much
I could go for a Frosty Swirl.

715
00:54:30,185 --> 00:54:31,853
That's good.

716
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:35,357
A sudden craving for sugar is good?

717
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:38,360
If you're thinking
about normal things...

718
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:41,279
...then maybe you're becoming
more normal.

719
00:54:41,488 --> 00:54:44,532
I'm never gonna be normal, Deb.

720
00:54:45,617 --> 00:54:46,660
Yeah.

721
00:54:47,744 --> 00:54:49,079
None of us really are.

722
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,041
Where you going?

723
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,586
I want a Frosty Swirl.
I'll bring you one.

724
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,924
She'll always be watching me,
but maybe that's okay.

725
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:03,927
If Wayne Randall can make peace
with his sentence...

726
00:55:04,094 --> 00:55:05,220
...who am I to complain?

727
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:08,223
Especially considering
the alternative.

728
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:10,183
Well, well.

729
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,478
Looks like you two are ready
to eat each other's shit.

730
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:16,564
Oh, yeah.
We kind of patched things up.

731
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:20,902
I'm happy for you.

732
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:24,280
I never got to do that with Hannah.

733
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:29,452
It's Robin to my Batman.

734
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:34,916
I was never as alive
as I was when I was with her.

735
00:55:36,209 --> 00:55:40,672
Every day was like Christmas Day...

736
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:42,966
...unwrapped present.

737
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:48,179
I wish I had a chance to tell her
how I felt.

738
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:51,516
You can still tell her.

739
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:53,685
Yeah.

740
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:57,272
I'm afraid the clock has run out.

741
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:04,154
Damn.

742
00:56:05,822 --> 00:56:10,827
I sure as fuck gonna miss that.

743
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:17,083
Hannah used to think
I was something special.

744
00:56:18,835 --> 00:56:21,713
Now she sees me as just a killer.

745
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:25,884
And you know what?

746
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,803
She's not wrong.

747
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:34,184
There's just one last person
I need to kill.

748
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:17,018
He never cared
if anyone found the bodies.

749
00:57:17,227 --> 00:57:21,523
He just wanted a couple of days
of sunshine and Frosty Swirl.

750
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:28,196
Randall didn't change,
and he couldn't take life in prison.

751
00:57:31,533 --> 00:57:33,159
Can I?
