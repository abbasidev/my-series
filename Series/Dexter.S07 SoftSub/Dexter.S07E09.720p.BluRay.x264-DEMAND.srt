1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,514
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,600
Miami is still overcrowded by one.

3
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,727
I'm not suggesting a coup here.

4
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:19,479
More like a realignment.

5
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:24,150
- Do you recognise him?
- It's one of George's men.

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,237
Sent here to kill me.
So much for brotherhood.

7
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,697
This guy had a slip.

8
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:30,031
Dexter Morgan.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,117
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,622
Chief Lane has somehow come
to learn about my indiscretions.

11
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:38,998
He's asking me to retire.

12
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:41,876
He thought that I ratted him out.
We both know it was you.

13
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,879
This is how the game is played,
Morgan.

14
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,716
- I don't owe you shit.
- Not the way Isaak sees it.

15
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:51,803
He did you a favour by taking out
those Colombian scumbags.

16
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,264
So, what do you know
about this Isaak Sirko?

17
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:58,727
I know that he wants to kill me
and that I need to kill him first.

18
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:01,771
I have never been able to talk
to anyone about my kills.

19
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:03,356
Not like this.

20
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,985
You should cut your losses, Isaak.

21
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:08,987
Go back to Kiev.

22
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:13,074
The one thing that made my life worth
living in Kiev, you tossed in the ocean.

23
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:15,201
- You and Viktor were--
- Lovers.

24
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,539
You took from me the one thing
that money and power can't bring back.

25
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,916
Till next time.

26
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:26,087
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

27
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:29,340
I think you'd be surprised
at the things you don't know about me.

28
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:30,842
Being with Hannah is worse...

29
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,343
- ...than being a killer?
- Yes!

30
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,554
Feel like if you love me,
you'll accept this.

31
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,766
If I love you? I'm in love with you.

32
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:40,977
You're in love with me?

33
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,606
Will you please just go? I really--
I can't look at you.

34
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:52,025
There are no two stronger
human emotions than fear and love.

35
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:56,279
In many ways, they're not so different.
Both can make you do crazy things.

36
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:59,365
Tell your own brother
you're in love with him.

37
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,035
Put your life at risk
to hunt down the man...

38
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,703
...who took away your beloved.

39
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,086
Could you maybe not do
that turny thing?

40
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:15,381
- How you doing back there?
- Oh, you know, I'm fine.

41
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,093
Or do something
that scares you to death...

42
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,013
...because you may be in love.

43
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:35,652
I didn't think it was gonna be this
choppy. Turn into the waves.

44
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,487
Otherwise it's worse.

45
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:40,281
Well, I wouldn't want that.

46
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:50,249
You know, could we maybe stop
for a minute?

47
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,011
We don't have to do this.
We can go back.

48
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,805
No, no, no. I just need a minute.

49
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,017
I thought I'd outgrown this.

50
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:12,480
When you said your nanny
was taking the kids back to Orlando...

51
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:15,316
...a morning on the ocean alone
sounded“.

52
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,902
...better in my head.

53
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:23,449
LS your--?

54
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,993
You're shaking.

55
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,288
You always been this afraid
of the water?

56
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,625
Since my father thought that the best
way to teach me how to swim...

57
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,503
...was to march me down to the local
pond and throw me in.

58
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:38,047
- That's horrible.
- Yeah.

59
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:41,843
- Where was your mother?
- She was right beside him.

60
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,430
She noticed pretty quickly
that something was wrong...

61
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:48,975
...but he wouldn't let her come to me.

62
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:50,852
He wouldn't save you?

63
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,689
Six years old and I already knew
what it felt like to be dying.

64
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,232
I came to on the dock.

65
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:59,277
A fisherman heard my mother
screaming.

66
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,823
A complete stranger saved my life
instead of my father.

67
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:08,327
Have you ever been that scared?

68
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,123
Not--

69
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,542
Not really.

70
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,670
You've never felt that at all?

71
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,175
It's okay if you have.
You can talk to me...

72
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,510
...about this kind of stuff.

73
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,722
I know.

74
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,485
It's work.

75
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,738
There's a body. I have to get back.

76
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,783
Okay.

77
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:20,066
You're positive?

78
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,527
After George's attempt on your life...

79
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,363
...the brotherhood has taken matters
into their own hands.

80
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,616
They've sent two men to kill you.
They're most likely already here.

81
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:30,576
Who?

82
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,455
Mickie and Caffrey.

83
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:42,505
You know there's still time for you.
You don't have to stay.

84
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,550
I'm not going anywhere.
You're safe here for now.

85
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,427
They won't be able to trace this room
to you.

86
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,596
Your phone.

87
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:55,184
I've made both these men very rich
when I required their services.

88
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,979
Let's see if they're as loyal as you.

89
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,439
- Oleg, it's--
- Isaak.

90
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:03,818
Good to hear your voice.

91
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,196
- How's your mother?
- Good days and bad.

92
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:12,493
So I hear you're in town.
Don't suppose we can talk about this.

93
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,913
I've already accepted the contract.
What's done is done.

94
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,999
Right, then.

95
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,668
We'll see you soon.

96
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:27,341
We're gonna need some help.

97
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,930
Hannah keeps wanting me
to open up...

98
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:35,600
...get to know the real me.

99
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:39,520
The only problem is I'm not so sure
there is such a thing.

100
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:43,649
Relax. You're safe.

101
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,319
As for me, I wish
I could say the same thing.

102
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:50,031
- What are you doing here?
- Circumstances have changed greatly.

103
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:54,535
Koshkas have sent two of their own
to kill me. Need your help to stay alive.

104
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,122
I'm feeling rather exposed out here.

105
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:01,876
We wouldn't want these two men
to know where you live now, would we?

106
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,348
You don't seem like someone
who needs help.

107
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:19,852
Even a man dangling from a cliff will
stretch out a hand to his worst enemy.

108
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,271
Where's your assistant?

109
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,191
As resourceful as Jurg is,
he's of no use to me now.

110
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,236
These men know who he is.

111
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,782
What I need
is the element of surprise.

112
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,326
And that, Dexter...

113
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,662
...is you.

114
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:41,415
You're scared.

115
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,879
If you knew
who these two men were...

116
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,297
...you would be too.

117
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,550
What's in this for me?

118
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,053
Your life.

119
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,057
I'll take my chances.

120
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,561
Very well.

121
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,069
If the enemy of my enemy
is my friend...

122
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:12,863
...I should be rooting for the men
who want Isaak dead.

123
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,616
But crazy as it sounds, I'm not.

124
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,244
Maybe because I still want Isaak
for myself.

125
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,205
Or that he and I are more alike
than I want to admit.

126
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:23,874
Know what would be great
at the restaurant? S'mores.

127
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,336
- The ones you make at your own table.
- Don't mention the restaurant.

128
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,171
Health inspector stopped by.

129
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,132
How can you think of food with this?

130
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,760
Four violations and seven days to fix
or they're gonna shut me down.

131
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,846
Mind if I take a look?

132
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,516
I'd rather you not.
At least till I'm done here.

133
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,812
- Little heads up next time?
- What would be the fun in that?

134
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,565
Arson investigator.

135
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:55,406
There's an empty canister of accelerant
under the passenger seat.

136
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,160
I'm detecting an oily residue.

137
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,995
There's also...

138
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,914
...an ID badge.

139
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,669
- What do we have here?
- Watch.

140
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:11,339
Holy filet-o-fuck.

141
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,424
- Who are you?
- See, it never gets old.

142
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,176
Phil Bosso.

143
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,595
We met a while back.
That church burning?

144
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:23,100
- Have an ID?
- Danny Yamiro. Paralegal.

145
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,102
Badge says he works downtown.

146
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,063
Think you got a suicide here.

147
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,440
Hara-kiri.

148
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,776
Self-immolation.

149
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,779
What is it with my people?
First in math, first to check out.

150
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,947
It's actually self-incineration.

151
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:41,118
Immolation is a form of sacrifice
by any means. Isn't restricted to fire.

152
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:43,162
Well, excuse the fuck out of me.

153
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:46,040
Hey, what about the backseat?

154
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:49,627
The burn rate behind the driver's side
is different than the rest.

155
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,671
- Are you sure it's a suicide?
- You're the blood guy?

156
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,049
- Right.
- Exactly.

157
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,593
- Crime scene's all yours.
- Thanks.

158
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,597
Let me know what you find.
Gonna have unis canvass the area.

159
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,724
- I can do that.
- No, no, I got it.

160
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,060
Deb's been afraid
of her feelings consuming her.

161
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:09,855
If I can't find a way to extinguish them,
I'm afraid she might be right.

162
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,150
- Deb, wait up.
- I have to get back to the station.

163
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:15,569
- What you said--
- I don't wanna talk about this.

164
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,405
I'm glad you said it.

165
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:21,200
How? When every second of every day,
all I wanna do is take it back.

166
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:24,286
Because on some level,
I've always felt the same way.

167
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:28,082
- You don't have to do this.
- I do. I am your brother, and I love you.

168
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,459
Just not in the same way
you think you love me.

169
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:33,254
- Dex--
- And it's okay.

170
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,881
I understand. It makes sense.

171
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,217
It's logical.

172
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,429
Like...

173
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:45,057
The way I love M&Ms,
even though I know I shouldn't.

174
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,559
M&-fucking-Ms?

175
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,602
I'm trying here. Just hear me out.

176
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,813
Why, Dexter?
It's sure as shit not logical.

177
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,815
Consider everything
we've been through.

178
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:56,068
You are the one person on the planet
who's been down the same road.

179
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,780
Same road, very different cars.

180
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:04,618
Deb, we've always been the one
constant thing in each other's lives.

181
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,329
It's like you and I...

182
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:08,873
...we endure.

183
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,501
Maybe that's what love is.

184
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,712
Endurance.

185
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:20,176
- You think you're in love with me.
- Please stop saying that.

186
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,053
- But it's gonna be fine.
- No.

187
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:24,805
It's--

188
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,683
Logical. Because it is.

189
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,811
You're not crazy.

190
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,731
Fuck. That, coming from you...

191
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,983
Should make you feel better.

192
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:39,487
It does.

193
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:45,117
God, Dexter. You, me, Dad.

194
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,580
It's like Mom got cancer
to take the easy way out.

195
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,083
I don't know.
Maybe it's better that it's out there...

196
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,378
...and it's not controlling me
anymore.

197
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:04,428
Do you feel that way
about your secret?

198
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,515
Not really.

199
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,984
Deb?

200
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,155
Hannah?

201
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,951
I saw your van outside. Are you--?

202
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,580
- Here?
- Dexter. You're just in time for tea.

203
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,750
Hope you don't mind, I let myself in.
That's far enough.

204
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,337
I just want to talk.

205
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,130
Where's Hannah?

206
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,758
Jurg's been keeping tabs on you.

207
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,552
For me.

208
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,179
Your comings and goings.

209
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,764
Where you spend your nights.

210
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,559
Seems this Hannah's quite important
to you.

211
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:54,270
- Where is she?
- I assure you she's perfectly safe...

212
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,813
...and quite comfortable.

213
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,398
Jurg is seeing to that.

214
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,528
Let her go.
This is between you and me.

215
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,488
Not quite.

216
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,449
There's the small matter
of the two men who want me dead...

217
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,077
...and your stubborn refusal to help.

218
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,872
You asked me
what was in this for you.

219
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,917
Well, if your life doesn't matter...

220
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,586
...I'm betting hers does.

221
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:29,388
Well, I guess I have no choice
but to take you up on that tea.

222
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,223
Splendid idea.

223
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,645
I have a better idea. I kill you, and
leave you out for the Koshkas to find.

224
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,856
Yes, you can do that...

225
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,275
...but that leaves Hannah with Jurg.

226
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:45,654
I'm afraid he's not as honourable
nor as forgiving as I am.

227
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,616
What makes you think
Hannah means anything to me?

228
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,743
Well, if she didn't,
I'd be dead by now.

229
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,635
You have the wrong guy.
This isn't what I do.

230
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,890
You killed Viktor as well as the man
waiting for me in my apartment.

231
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,934
He had a gun, you had a knife.
I think I have the right man.

232
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,228
And if I help you, then what?

233
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,606
You get Hannah back...

234
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,816
...and I walk away from Miami
and from you.

235
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,362
No matter what you may think of me
or my methods...

236
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,406
...I'm a man of my word.

237
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,243
I need to know she's alive.

238
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:51,720
Hannah, I trust you and Jurg
are settled in.

239
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,808
- Why are you doing this?
- The reason, my dear, is right here.

240
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,601
Dexter.

241
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,478
- Don't worry.
- That's enough.

242
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,814
- Now, you behave.
- No, wait! Dexter--

243
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,361
Your life is in his hands now.

244
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,321
Listen to me carefully.

245
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,908
Scream, make noise, I hurt you.

246
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:14,493
Try to escape...

247
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,121
...I hurt you badly.

248
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:18,914
Clear?

249
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,668
Here.

250
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,254
Find something for us to watch.

251
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,133
And none of the American
reality shit.

252
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,143
Here.

253
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,187
Oleg Mickie. Ex-military.
Efficient, methodical.

254
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,065
Which is why I've employed him
more times than I can count.

255
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,737
- And that one?
- Benjamin Caffrey.

256
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,655
He's a Yank, like you.

257
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:56,285
Out of New York.
Less reliable but, as you can see...

258
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,703
...just as deadly.

259
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,872
Any weaknesses?

260
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,957
I need to know everything.

261
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,294
Caffrey likes it up close and personal.
Knives, piano wire.

262
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,254
And as you saw...

263
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:08,881
...he's a vicious little cunt.

264
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,550
Whereas Mickie doesn't like
to get his hands dirty.

265
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,553
- Guns?
- High-powered riﬂes specifically.

266
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,305
He's a slave to ritual.

267
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,223
He'll buy a rifle locally...

268
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,267
...and be compelled
to test it out first.

269
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:23,103
Point of a rifle is to hit a target
from a long distance.

270
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,564
The range would need
to be outdoors.

271
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,027
That's his favourite.

272
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,367
A Savage Arms 110 sniper rifle.

273
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:41,997
Most ranges don't sell the kind
of magazine rounds this one uses.

274
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,792
That's where I'll start tomorrow.

275
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:49,338
Well, just where are you running off to,
all helter-skelter?

276
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,589
I'm hungry-

277
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:52,841
You've been tasked
with helping kill two men.

278
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,762
A loved one's life hangs in the balance,
and you're hungry?

279
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,972
- It's late.
- Let me ask you a question.

280
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,725
Just how many men have you killed?

281
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,687
A lot.

282
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,690
I asked Mickie
the same question once.

283
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:12,444
He answered 16. And the bastard
was almost pounding his chest.

284
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,488
But you...

285
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,574
...you don't seem to revel
in what you do.

286
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:18,867
Why?

287
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,453
You trying to have a moment?

288
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,413
I don't bond.

289
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,750
Most men kill for money.

290
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,545
Some for the sheer brutality.

291
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:33,090
Others like me, revenge.

292
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,425
But you, Dexter...

293
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,387
...with everything
I've put you through...

294
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:43,517
...I get the sense you could walk away
without the need to kill me.

295
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,603
My needs are different.

296
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:47,855
Why do you do it?

297
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,481
Why are you a killer?

298
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,943
If anything happens to Hannah,
you'll find out.

299
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,285
I need a favour.

300
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:04,788
Okay. If you do me one
and watch where you're dripping.

301
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,875
Isaak Sirko.

302
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,418
What about him?

303
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,420
Call off the 24-hour surveillance.

304
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,797
Like hell I Will.

305
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,593
What the fuck is going on?

306
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,763
Someone's after Isaak.

307
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,474
Two someones.

308
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:28,061
You know, like the guy
in his apartment but worse.

309
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,314
Actually, much worse.

310
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,234
So you want me to pull the surveillance
so the two someones can...

311
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,278
...do what they're hired to do?

312
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:37,988
Not exactly.

313
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,240
Well, then I'm not pulling
the surveillance.

314
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,576
- He'll come after you.
- No, he won't.

315
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,786
Because he and I...

316
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,998
...are working together.

317
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:52,210
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Isaak took Hannah.

318
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,923
He got wind about these two guys
coming after him...

319
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,133
...and he took Hannah
as leverage against me.

320
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,887
- He's gonna kill her if I don't help him.
- And I should give a shit why?

321
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,681
Because I do?

322
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,643
Dexter, you don't have to save her.

323
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,646
You shouldn't even be with her.

324
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,106
It's not even like you
will have a fucking future.

325
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,067
You're both what you are.

326
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:19,279
I don't know what's in our future.
I don't want Isaak to kill her, that's all.

327
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,198
Right now.

328
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,533
Who do you think has her?

329
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:25,994
His assistant. Jurg.

330
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,916
If I can find out where, Isaak won't
have any more leverage on me...

331
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,668
...and I can kill him.

332
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:36,713
Well, how do you expect to find Jurg
if you're hanging outwith Isaak?

333
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,633
I'll figure it out.

334
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,761
You know what happened
this morning?

335
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:48,892
I was lying in bed,
staring at the ceiling...

336
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:53,647
...feeling the sun,
and listening to the waves, and...

337
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,902
For a second,
everything was just like it used to be.

338
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:02,114
Steaks and beer...

339
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,867
...and bad movies on the couch.

340
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,746
And then I blinked.

341
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,625
And now it's burritos...

342
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:17,212
...and hired killers and favours...

343
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,382
...and Xanax
to get me to tomorrow morning...

344
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,677
...so I can have that half second
of peace.

345
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,516
I'll pull the surveillance...

346
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:35,022
...but don't you ever expect me to be
okay with who you're doing this for.

347
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,565
Deal?

348
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,568
Deal.

349
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,761
Tom.

350
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:09,431
And a great creature arose
from the depths.

351
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,099
Tokyo's that way, Maria.

352
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:14,019
Nice to see you too, Tom.

353
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,522
I thought I'd stop by
and see how you were doing.

354
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:20,859
- I mean, it's been a while.
- Bullshit.

355
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:25,655
Now, you have exactly the time
it takes for me to finish my drink...

356
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,532
...to explain why you're really here.

357
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,369
Little early for Scotch.

358
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:32,788
The joy of retirement.

359
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,957
I have no place to be,
no one cares what I do.

360
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:40,253
If I'd known you were dropping by,
trust me, I'd have made it a double.

361
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,214
So?

362
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:46,426
I think the Bay Harbor Butcher
is alive and well...

363
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,637
...and still in Miami.

364
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,891
Clearly I'm not the only one
who's been hitting the sauce.

365
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:56,603
Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher,
end of story.

366
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:59,064
I found a blood slide
at a crime scene...

367
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:02,109
...exactly like the ones we found
in Doakes' car.

368
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:06,279
Bad people are still going missing,
and Doakes never had a boat.

369
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:11,368
Here is a list of Miami personnel
who still do.

370
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:16,832
Oh, and I'm on it too.
Are you fucking kidding me, Maria?

371
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,252
Torn, you know I have to follow
every lead.

372
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,338
You sound like a real cop.

373
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:27,843
Except a real cop would've
remembered my hernia operation.

374
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,177
And after the surgery...

375
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:32,430
...I could barely lift my ass
out of a chair let alone a dead body.

376
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:35,517
- You check the dates against the kills.
- I will.

377
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:41,106
Since I'm here,
do any of those names look familiar?

378
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,694
Go home, Maria.

379
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:49,197
The only help you'll get from me
is a lift back to Cuba.

380
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:07,507
Only two firing ranges outside of Miami
sell high-calibre rounds...

381
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,552
...and this is the only one
near the airport.

382
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,472
But the target I'm interested in
isn't out there.

383
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:15,724
It's beside me.

384
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,159
Mickie is dead.

385
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:17,369
Fast work.

386
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,079
I see I chose wisely.

387
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:21,289
You're not out of the woods yet.

388
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:25,335
When he finds out his partner's dead,
Caffrey is gonna be harder to kill.

389
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,463
- What does he know about you?
- Everything, I suppose.

390
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,924
I'm sure the Koshkas
would have saw to that.

391
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,510
What if he knows you're after me
and can't track you?

392
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:36,763
- He'll come after you hoping to find me.
- So let's let him.

393
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,515
You're willing to be bait?

394
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,726
You're the one who wanted
the element of surprise.

395
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,377
I got your text. What's going on?

396
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:11,423
Unis found Jurg's car at a park,
but it was abandoned.

397
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:12,966
That's all I could find.

398
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:16,344
You're not supposed to be finding
anything. I told you I've got this.

399
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:19,681
You've got this? It sounds so casual.

400
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:22,475
Facts without emotion.

401
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:27,647
That's pretty much
how you've always seen the world.

402
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,150
Pretty much.

403
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,945
Except when it comes to Hannah.

404
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,408
Will we be getting a call
about a body?

405
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,952
No, it's outside
of Miami Metro jurisdiction.

406
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,871
That's good.

407
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,956
I guess.

408
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,253
How do you know that Isaak
is not gonna kill Hannah anyway?

409
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,047
I don't.

410
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:55,800
And if you find Hannah
and you take care of Isaak, then what?

411
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,137
Well, according to you, Hannah and I
don't have a future together.

412
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:03,808
I had no right to say that.

413
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,852
And it wasn't out of spite.

414
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:09,647
Fuck, I don't know, maybe it was out
of spite. I don't even know anymore.

415
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,859
It's just...

416
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:17,614
I'm saying this to you as your
fucking sister and nothing else, okay?

417
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,117
Dex, she is a killer.

418
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,495
You will never be safe with her.

419
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,374
You're safe with me.

420
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:30,168
Promise me you'll think
about what I said.

421
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,087
I Will.

422
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,179
Breathe.

423
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,775
What the fuck? Aren't you supposed
to be hunting down Isaak?

424
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:55,735
Hey, I can't reach Mickie.

425
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:58,279
I think Sirko got to him.

426
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:00,407
Great.

427
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:03,660
That's just fucking great.
You realise he'll be coming after me...

428
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,245
...if this goes sideways?

429
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,080
Then I need a way to find him.

430
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,793
Morgan.

431
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,053
I wanna talk to Hannah.

432
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,388
She hasn't been harmed.

433
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:27,642
I've done everything you've asked,
but I need to know she's still alive.

434
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,936
And figure out where she is.

435
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:33,523
Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious trust issues?

436
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:47,370
Is it over?

437
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,038
Not quite.

438
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:51,791
Put Hannah on.
Someone wishes to speak to her.

439
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,132
Hey.

440
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:01,509
Hey, my God.

441
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,053
It's so good to see you.

442
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:07,015
- Has he hurt you?
- I'm fine.

443
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:12,645
So those Ukrainians
you were telling me about?

444
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,148
This would be them.

445
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,151
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- I know.

446
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,446
I'm sorry they're using me like this
to get to you.

447
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,573
Don't be.

448
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,536
It's not your fault.

449
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:33,625
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
Just do what you have to do, okay?

450
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,086
I want you to take me out
on that stupid boat of yours again.

451
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,382
Promise?

452
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,556
I--

453
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:50,767
I miss you.

454
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,232
Likewise.

455
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:04,322
Touching.

456
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:06,866
I have to get back to work.

457
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:12,080
If I had the chance to speak to Viktor
again and he told me he missed me...

458
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,457
...I think I'd like to think
I could come up...

459
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:17,043
...with something better
than "likewise."

460
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,711
I'm not you.

461
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:22,006
Yeah, but there she was,
trying to comfort you...

462
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:25,426
...and you just couldn't manage
to do the same.

463
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:28,054
- Why do you even care?
- Well, look around.

464
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:32,350
There's no one else here for me
to talk to because of you.

465
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,686
Viktor got exactly
what was coming to him.

466
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,146
- Fuck you.
- That what these questions are about?

467
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,650
Wondering what kind of killer I am,
trying to decide if I should die...

468
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,903
- ...because of what I did to him?
- He was my life!

469
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,991
But still...

470
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,411
...you sent him to Miami.

471
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,332
You put him in over his head.

472
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:59,127
You put all this in motion.

473
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:02,463
And now you're terrified, Isaak.

474
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,258
You're terrified
that I'm not really responsible...

475
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,218
...for his death.

476
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:08,636
That you are.

477
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:10,888
No.

478
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:14,225
You're the reason he's gone.

479
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,729
If you really believed that,
I'd be dead by now.

480
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,032
Go.

481
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:42,253
Hey, Quinn, it's me.
I'm having a real shitty day here.

482
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,214
So how about you return
one of my fucking calls?

483
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,096
- Go get changed.
- My shift just started.

484
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:55,600
Yeah, well, we're gonna take a break.
Your boyfriend's got me in a mood.

485
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,935
Viceroy's just down the road.

486
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,772
We had some good times there,
right?

487
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,566
I'll get my things.

488
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:16,996
Isaak is consumed by guilt,
drowning in grief.

489
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:18,581
He'll never recover.

490
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:23,169
You took the risk. How did you know
he blames himself for Viktor's death?

491
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:25,213
I did the same thing with Rita.

492
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:29,967
Even though it was Trinity
who killed her, I still felt responsible.

493
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,553
Now it's happening all over again
with Hannah.

494
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:36,474
If something were to happen to her,
and it's my fault...

495
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:39,519
- ...will I end up like Isaak?
- You recovered after Rita.

496
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:41,729
Barely.

497
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:45,316
Harrison reminds me of her
every day.

498
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,820
But with Hannah...

499
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,738
It feels different.

500
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:55,743
I've spent my entire life
trying to mask who I am...

501
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,829
...Wha'[ I do.

502
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:01,082
But she sees through it all,
and accepts that part of me.

503
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,750
So where's the problem?

504
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:05,336
If we get through this...

505
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,008
...maybe it's the human side of me
that'll push her away.

506
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,065
Juan Pablo.

507
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,412
It's a Colombian soccer player.

508
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,999
The men Isaak killed in that bar
were Colombian.

509
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,668
And dead men don't return home.

510
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:48,796
It's the last place these killers
would think to look for Isaak.

511
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:51,090
And the perfect place
to hold Hannah.

512
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:54,719
Dex, grab your kit. We got another
burn victim near the university.

513
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,819
It's the man Isaak showed me.
Caffrey.

514
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:13,738
He's taken the bait.

515
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:15,948
I need to keep him close...

516
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,409
...but not too close.

517
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,496
Fucking mould.

518
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:24,957
With all that it's gonna cost me,
the universe is giving me the finger.

519
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:28,002
And with proper lubrication,
nothing wrong with that, hombre.

520
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:31,005
Yo, Dex. You wanna join the party?

521
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:34,175
Victim's name is Leo Santolongo.
He's a grad student.

522
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:37,178
One punch away from getting
free coffee at the student union.

523
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,639
What the hell?
Two burning men in two days.

524
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:42,099
Looks to be the same accelerant-
Petroleum-based.

525
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:44,435
--As your car victim.
Same oily residue.

526
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:47,396
- Another suicide?
- Typically with a suicide by fire...

527
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:50,817
...the gas or fuel
is poured over the head, like so.

528
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,360
This fire's point of origin...

529
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:55,238
...was front centre mass.

530
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:57,240
It burned upward and downward.

531
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,746
Can we close the doors?

532
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:15,967
This void. It's the same thing
that happened with the first car victim.

533
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,720
We have a phantom.

534
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:21,931
- Bobby.
- Maybe the victim...

535
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,934
...was letting us know who did this.

536
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:28,563
Or was it the last person
he was thinking of'?

537
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,444
You Okay?

538
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:39,282
Never seen anything like this.

539
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:43,369
If this was a person...

540
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:47,498
...then they'd have to be wearing
some kind of protective suit.

541
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:51,752
He blocked the victim from escaping
and watched him burn alive.

542
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,755
Oh, it's not as horrific
as one might think.

543
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:57,091
Destruction of vital tissue,
nerve endings...

544
00:36:57,258 --> 00:37:03,180
...quickly induce shock or asphyxiation
making the event relatively painless.

545
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,057
Relatively.

546
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,235
I need my camera.

547
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:20,656
- What does he need his camera for?
- Evidence we have a killer...

548
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:25,119
...using fire as a weapon
and a first name. Bobby.

549
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:26,704
Wonderful.

550
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:29,081
Quinn, is there a security camera
on this level?

551
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,542
Yeah, one.
I'll get the tape from the company.

552
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:33,920
Well, if there's no blood,
I'm gonna head back.

553
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,797
- Vince.
- Yeah, I've got it, Exter-Day.

554
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,842
How can there be only one
security camera in this entire lot?

555
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:41,218
Deb, you got a minute?

556
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:43,137
Be right back.

557
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,724
Who's Juan Pablo?

558
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:50,186
He plays for the Colombians.
You remember Mateo's Bar?

559
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:52,438
Yeah,
the three Colombians Isaak killed?

560
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,440
Yeah, I grabbed this off of his phone.

561
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:59,028
I think Hannah's being held
at one of the dead men's homes.

562
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,780
I'll look into it.

563
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:03,115
But that's all, and thank you.

564
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,293
- Dexter.
- Your man, Caffrey?

565
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:17,254
- He sees you?
- Yeah.

566
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,048
I'm leaving a crime scene now.

567
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:21,717
Lead him to the port.
Pier 18, northwest corridor.

568
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:24,595
There's a cargo ship, the Fearless.
It's one of ours.

569
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:26,597
I'll be waiting there.

570
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:41,028
This is George. How can I help you?

571
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,530
It's Caffrey.

572
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,115
Did you find Isaak?

573
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,867
- Please tell me that fucker's dead.
- Not yet.

574
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:50,371
I'm tailing Morgan. Any reason
he'd be headed down to the port?

575
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:51,914
We got a boat down there.

576
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,625
You think Isaak is luring Morgan
to him?

577
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,586
That's what I'm hoping to find out.

578
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,686
- Hi.
- Hey.

579
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,441
Joey, what are you doing here?

580
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:22,695
I was on my way from a crime scene.
Thought I'd see if you can get off early.

581
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:25,531
No. George wouldn't be happy.

582
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,576
Fuck him. Can't one of the other girls
cover for you?

583
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:33,122
Hey. ls everything okay?

584
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,373
Yes.

585
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:36,208
Please, just go.

586
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,461
Well, did something happen?

587
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:41,589
Would you please talk to me?

588
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,299
This job is hard with you...

589
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:46,260
...and the things
that are expected of me.

590
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:48,763
I don't have a problem
with you working here.

591
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:51,057
Promise me you won't be upset.

592
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,392
Depends on what it is.
Nadia, what happened?

593
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,568
You fucked my girl?

594
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:05,738
Technically, if the dancers
are on the clock, they're my girls.

595
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:08,741
Maybe you'd know that
if you ever returned my fucking calls.

596
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:12,495
You left me high and dry tonight.
That's gonna stop.

597
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:14,580
You could learn a thing or two
from her.

598
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:17,500
She takes her job very seriously.

599
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:23,672
You're gonna be sorry!

600
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:27,635
Piece of shit!

601
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,601
Consider that her fucking notice.

602
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:39,814
Come on.

603
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:47,279
Really? Cornflakes? Again?

604
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:49,657
That's all there is in the cupboard.

605
00:40:58,457 --> 00:40:59,500
Eat.

606
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:03,504
How about you let me introduce you
to some good old Southern cuisine?

607
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:07,800
My grandma has this great recipe
for fried green tomatoes. It's amazing.

608
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,636
I saw some tomatoes
growing in the garden out back.

609
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:12,513
I can't let you outside.

610
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,598
Okay, fine.

611
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,892
You pick them, then.

612
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:22,064
It's not like I'm going anywhere.

613
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:28,279
Well, just remember, not too ripe.

614
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:38,455
I think I'm on to something.
One of those Colombians was single.

615
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:41,167
The other two lived with their family
or an apartment.

616
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,794
But he has a house on Coral Road.
I'm heading there.

617
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:46,881
- Deb, no.
- I don't wanna hear it, Dexter, okay?

618
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,800
And just so we're clear,
I am not doing this for Hannah.

619
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:54,638
I am doing this so you don't end up
dead. If you catch Isaak first, so be it.

620
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:58,893
You kind of need to hurry. I'm leading
one of these guys to Isaak now.

621
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,063
- Please be careful.
- I was gonna say the same to you.

622
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,026
That's the plan.

623
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,188
Sweetheart.

624
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:59,745
See? A man of my word.

625
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:05,376
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

626
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,545
Your assistant told me
I'd find you here.

627
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:09,797
We need to talk.

628
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:13,217
About what?
The horrible things you said to me?

629
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,386
You cost me my job, Maria.

630
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,889
Was nine months shy of a 40-year
pension before you stuck the knife in.

631
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:21,684
Before you could return the favour.
It's not my fault...

632
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,560
...I beat you at your own game.

633
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:26,146
So why don't you take
your own advice? Go home.

634
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:30,025
Now, why would I wanna do that
if I'm here to help?

635
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:35,322
Don't fuck with me, Torn.

636
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:44,290
That little list of yours?

637
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:48,127
You'd be surprised what I know
about some of the names on there.

638
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:51,297
- Which names?
- Oh, not so fast, no.

639
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:53,841
I help you,
you support my reinstatement.

640
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:57,094
Just long enough for me
to get my pension bump.

641
00:43:57,303 --> 00:43:59,388
Boats are fucking expensive.

642
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:04,727
So the question, Maria...

643
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:06,979
...is how bad do you want this?

644
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:17,031
Looks like a table just opened up.

645
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:28,292
Careful, they're hot.

646
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:31,086
Isaak hasn't checked in yet.

647
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,839
If anything has happened to him...

648
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:36,592
...it would be a shame
to kill you after a lovely meal.

649
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:39,553
Well, let's hope
that doesn't have to happen.

650
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:42,473
In case you want some more.

651
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:53,567
- Water.
- I'm sorry.

652
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:55,444
Grams always went heavy
on the pepper.

653
00:46:08,142 --> 00:46:10,644
Never cared much for that man.

654
00:46:11,103 --> 00:46:13,605
We should go before we're spotted.

655
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:17,818
So this is over?

656
00:46:18,152 --> 00:46:20,654
And still you don't trust me?

657
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:22,406
Well?

658
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,533
You can talk.

659
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:26,285
The knife?

660
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:30,456
How'd that get there?

661
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:33,667
In the water. I'll do the same.

662
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:38,505
Fine. Together, then.

663
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,470
You go ahead.
I'm gonna hose this down to be safe.

664
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:46,138
I'll wait for you below.

665
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:50,184
Isaak was right.
I could have walked away if he'd let me.

666
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,186
But I was wrong about him.

667
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:54,563
I never thought he would.

668
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:12,122
What the hell happened to you?

669
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:17,002
Well...

670
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:19,880
What are you waiting for,
you little shit?

671
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:27,429
God.

672
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:46,615
Don't move.
I can get you to a hospital.

673
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,867
The bullet's still inside.

674
00:47:49,076 --> 00:47:51,245
We both know I'm a dead man.

675
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:54,665
There's a kit in my car.

676
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:57,417
- I can help with the pain.
- No.

677
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:00,295
I need you to do me one better.

678
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:40,419
Fuck.

679
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:57,519
- Dispatch.
- This is Lt. Morgan requesting backup.

680
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:00,981
And a fucking ambulance
at 2085 Coral Road.

681
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:03,358
We're sending someone right now.

682
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:18,915
Sorry for the bumpy ride.

683
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:21,460
You're forgiven.

684
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:24,171
We're here.

685
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:30,260
Indulge a dying man.

686
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,140
What do you intend to say to Hannah
when you see her again?

687
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:39,102
I guess that I'm sorry.

688
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:40,354
You guess?

689
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:44,608
Fuck's sakes, Dexter. She needs
to know how you feel about her.

690
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,985
It's not that easy.

691
00:49:47,903 --> 00:49:51,740
How is it you can be absolutely
fearless in the face of death...

692
00:49:51,907 --> 00:49:55,118
...and yet so afraid to live?

693
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:57,996
I'm not...

694
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,874
...afraid.

695
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,044
Then what is it?

696
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:13,637
Death has always calmed me.

697
00:50:15,472 --> 00:50:17,474
It's soothing.

698
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:20,602
Predictable.

699
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:22,771
Inevitable.

700
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,568
With a knife in my hand,
I feel it's mine to control.

701
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:30,237
It gives you intimacy.

702
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:32,155
Yes.

703
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:34,408
But it never lasts.

704
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:36,076
It's over...

705
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:38,787
...then you move on.

706
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:44,960
But now, with Hannah...

707
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:50,048
...I feel
like I don't have any control...

708
00:50:50,257 --> 00:50:53,260
...and I'm not sure I wanna move on.

709
00:50:53,844 --> 00:50:55,721
I was like you.

710
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:58,306
So detached.

711
00:50:59,683 --> 00:51:01,727
Until Viktor.

712
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:05,647
Was it worth it? Your feelings for him
cost you everything.

713
00:51:05,856 --> 00:51:07,899
Oh, God, yes.

714
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:10,235
Being with him...

715
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:14,322
...I never had to hide.

716
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:17,325
I was finally...

717
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:20,746
Alive.

718
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,458
There's hope for you yet.

719
00:51:51,777 --> 00:51:54,613
Watch any Western, and you'll know
a man out for vengeance...

720
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,989
...should dig two graves.

721
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:59,409
One for his enemy
and one for himself.

722
00:51:59,618 --> 00:52:00,869
I won't be needing mine.

723
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:04,706
But I'll see to it
that Isaak isn't alone in his.

724
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:09,294
And you have no idea
why you were taken by the deceased?

725
00:52:09,503 --> 00:52:10,629
No.

726
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:13,173
He barely spoke.

727
00:52:13,924 --> 00:52:17,135
So he chained you up, you got free...

728
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:20,931
...he stabbed you,
and then you beat him to death.

729
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:23,475
As I stated, it was self-defence.

730
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:27,521
Oh, I know.
Still, there was a lot of blood.

731
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:31,024
I mean, I know it's not the first time
you've gotten your hands bloody.

732
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,276
Are we finished?

733
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:37,280
I wanna make sure what you're telling
me reflects what really happened.

734
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:40,325
But, yeah, sure, we can be done.

735
00:52:40,534 --> 00:52:43,036
How is it that you were the one
that found me?

736
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,789
I'm a cop.

737
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:48,542
It's my job to follow through
on anonymous tips.

738
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,460
Where was your backup?

739
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:52,128
Lieutenant's prerogative.

740
00:52:52,796 --> 00:52:55,882
Doctor said I was in pretty bad shape
when you found me.

741
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:57,342
Yep.

742
00:52:57,551 --> 00:53:03,098
So given your feelings about me,
why not just let me die?

743
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,310
I was doing my job.

744
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:09,896
Was it because of Dexter?

745
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:15,777
No.

746
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:20,991
I think it's about fucking time
I start doing things for myself.

747
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:26,162
Maybe you can be fine with being
responsible for someone's death...

748
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:28,582
...but I can't. That's...

749
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:29,958
That's not who I am.

750
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:38,466
I got here as fast as I could.

751
00:53:39,134 --> 00:53:40,886
Everything taken care of?

752
00:53:41,428 --> 00:53:44,431
All taken care of.

753
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,643
Then I guess I'll go.

754
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:54,691
You gonna be okay?

755
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:58,445
Yeah. I'm gonna be fine.

756
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:13,543
It's only 12 stitches.
I'm gonna be out of here tomorrow.

757
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:21,134
God, you're shaking.

758
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:27,349
When you asked me on my boat
if I'd ever been scared like that, I have.

759
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,560
Twice.

760
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:37,150
When I was 3,
seeing my mother murdered.

761
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:42,447
And when I realised
these past few days...

762
00:54:42,656 --> 00:54:45,158
...that I might never see you again.

763
00:54:50,914 --> 00:54:53,208
Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?

764
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,460
I don't know.

765
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:02,759
I'm not sure what this is...

766
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:05,428
...exactly.

767
00:55:05,637 --> 00:55:07,514
Or what's...

768
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:10,725
...coming.

769
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:20,235
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be.
Out of my control.

770
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,176
All I know is that when I'm with you,
I feel...

771
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,560
...safe.
