be buried in those.

10
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,821
We didn't agree on anything.

11
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:31,782
It breaks my heart to be
as ashamed as I am now.

12
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,159
My checkbook is closed.

13
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,952

150
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,234
It's pie.

151
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,485
Mom did this by herself.

152
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,154
There are three of us.

Right.

159
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,004

162
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:33,347
that would deliver our kids'
contraband, for Penny's sake.

163
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:37,017

164
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,310

a few friends at my house.

166
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,855
You know, keep the teens
out of Dad's hair.

167
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:46,610
Oh, yeah, Cady asked Lydia
to order red and blue Jell-O.

168
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,781
I had a flashback to 1998's
technicolor vomit catastrophe.

Oh, God.

170
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,951
It's amazing how our kids

pulling one over
on their parents.

172
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,454
Yeah, she said,
preparing to bamboozle Dad

173
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,624

miraculously become our mother.

174
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,380

00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,593
- Check.
- I've got these.

179
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,053
Perfect. Okay.

180
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,429
I told the field club jerks
to come here

181
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,640
after they do the polite hello
thing at Clairmont.

182
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,143
And I invited
a few local baddies.

183
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,145
Beautiful. I'll do the slide.

184
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,605
Perfect. Cady, we need limes.

185
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,983
Gat, you make a playlist.

186
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,150
Party on three.

187
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,318
One, two...

188
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,864
One, two, party!
You legends, I love you.

189
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,032
Mwah.

190
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,158
What a day.

191
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,743
He's cheerful.

192
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,328
He's compensating.

193
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,789
It's been a little sad
around here.

194
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,873
Yeah.

195
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,044
Well, I have to go to Clairmont
for limes, so I'll see you.

196
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,254
No, I'll come with you.

197
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,757
Hey, you and I are fine.

198
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,634
I swear. Friends again.

199
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,220
You don't have to, like,
stick to me.

200
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,724
Noted.

201
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,435
But I need Wi-Fi
for the music, so...

202
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,729
<i>♪ Oops, was that my fault? ♪</i>

203
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,772
 <i>♪ Well, I'm not sorry</i>
 <i>'bout it ♪</i>

204
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,733
 <i>♪ I'm not sorry 'bout it ♪</i>

205
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,359
 <i>♪ I'm not sorry 'bout it ♪</i>

206
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,697
Whoa. Hey.

207
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,157
Aren't there
adult things happening

208
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,491
on the adult side
of the island?

209
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,327
You are not invited
to our secret party.

210
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,911
Oh, no.

211
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:23,206
But I love skunked beer
and twerking to Ice Spice.

212
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,750
If you're locking up
the valuables,

213
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,045
you're gonna need
a bigger safe.

214
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,881
That's not exactly...

215
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,260
Oh, is that...

216
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,846
- wait, are you gonna...
- Depends.

217
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,307
Does the sight of it make
you wanna punch someone

218
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,768
or plan a bachelor party?

219
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,978
I won't do it without
your approval.

220
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,856
Oh. Okay.

221
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,193
Well, I guess that's a yes.

222
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,781
Hey, are you okay?

223
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,493
Yeah.

224
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,288
Yeah, sorry, things have just
been a little rough lately.

225
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,333
Don't tell anyone.

226
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,167
Yeah.

227
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:12,631
Grief is...grief is hard
in this family.

228
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,301
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

229
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,723
Something else
on your mind, or...

230
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,270
No, no. I mean, you know me.

231
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,857
I'm...I'm always dancing on
the edge of a fall from grace.

232
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,404
Are you gonna ask her today?

233
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,406
Every Fourth, your mom and I
sneak away

234
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,449
from the party
and watch the fireworks

235
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,618
together from the beach,
so I'm gonna do it then.

236
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,912
You romantic fuck.

237
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,748
Okay, but I still
have to ask Will.

238
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,291
Although he's easily bribed.

239
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,631
Mom's been wanting this
for a long time.

240
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,674
We all have.

241
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,885
Congrats in advance, Ed.

242
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,179
Thanks.

243
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,139
Whoo.

244
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,693
Hey.

245
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,112
I got all turned around
on the path.

246
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,242
Never saw the signs.

247
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,326
Who names houses?

248
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,248
People with several
to keep track of.

249
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,209
What are you doing here,
spying again?

250
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,171
You're literally
paying me to be here.

251
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,715
We don't...we don't usually
do deliveries,

252
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,135
but the captain said
you called, requested us.

253
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,512
Didn't specifically
request the eavesdropper.

254
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,015
I just said to not
send Slutty Dan.

255
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,475
Oh, right.

256
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,810
I guess I can't blame you.
That whole thing sucks.

257
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,148
Oh, my God, you know?

258
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,443
What, were you watching him
while he banged my mother?

259
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,028
Again, I don't spy. All right?

260
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,322
He probably told a friend,
and it got back to me.

261
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,656
It's like I said.

262
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,450
People talk on the water taxi
like I'm invisible.

263
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,076
Then you go around
repeating their business.

264
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,328
How righteous of you.

265
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,413
Yeah, that's me, town gossip.

266
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,207
All right, you want me
to tap this for you?

267
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,917
I got it, thanks.

268
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,712
I'll get your tip.

269
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,923
No, no, no. You're good.

270
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,759
I don't take money
from people I feel sorry for.

271
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,385
Excuse me.

Oh!

284
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,943
Oh, Carrie!

285
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,946
God, no, there's a lid
to the food processor.

286
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:26,324
Do I have to do everything?

287
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,159
Is it too late to order backup?

288
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,869
Yeah, if you want your kid
to go to public school.

289
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,288
Oh, damn it.

290
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,664
My crust keeps cracking.

291
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,874
Oh, you just didn't
add enough water.

292
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,459
And Mom used to mix it by hand.

293
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,005
Oh, did either of you
get any of her DNA?

294
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,016
She always wanted to teach us.

295
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,145
We just never made the time.

296
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,152
Okay, stop. Stop.

297
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,195
People are arriving.
There is no time for sulking.

298
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,031
- Just chin up.
- Oh, God, Penny.

299
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,450
Could I just have
just a moment?

300
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,245
Oh, God.

301
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,040
Now I am flashing back
to the '90s.

302
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,583
Fuck.

303
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,252
What's that supposed to mean?

304
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,046
Nothing.

305
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,172
Never mind.

306
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,801
Because I didn't cry
oceans enough for you

307
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,762
when Rosie died either?

308
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,096
Is that it?

309
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,973
It was never enough for you.

310
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,642
Mom was pragmatic.

311
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,435
She knew how
to maintain composure

312
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,811
and get what she needed
from Dad

313
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,146
while making him think
it was his idea.

314
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,190
And that is the DNA that I got.

315
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,154
Where's my fucking recipe card?
I'm starting over.

316
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,073
- Here, I can do it.
- Yeah.

317
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,158
So you can take credit? Thanks.

318
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,955
Right, right, right.
So you wanna be on my team?

319
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,500
Hey, we're just
grabbing some...

320
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,085
Healthy snacks.

321
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,544
Yeah.

322
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,630
Carrot sticks.

323
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,840
Gat, when I was
in town earlier,

324
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,300
I ran into your friend.

325
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,177
Can't remember her name.

326
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,012
The woman that we...
we took to the Knicks game.

327
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:11,846
Raquel?

328
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,892
Raquel's in town? This town?

329
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,978
Said she's staying for the week
with her aunt in Chilmark.

330
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,189
Is she gonna come to
your unsanctioned party?

331
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,400
Oh, you know, she knows
I don't have much

332
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,901
cell service
when I'm here, so...

333
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,153
Right, but you have
Wi-Fi now, so...

334
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,613
invite her.

335
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,156
You should definitely
invite her.

336
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,785
That would be...be so much fun.

337
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,663
The more the merrier.

338
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,123
Yep.

339
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:38,957
Sorry.

340
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,714
You invited Gat's girlfriend?

341
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,508
Aunt Carrie dropped the
Raquel bomb out of nowhere,

342
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,093
and Gat was just looking at me
like he pitied me.

343
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,721
And I didn't wanna seem like
some pining, pathetic girl,

344
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,931
so I tried to be cool.

345
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,850
Wow. God.

346
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,017
Wow, good job.

347
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,019
Okay, I choked.

348
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,354
And now he's off island,

349
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,314
probably picking her up
and giving her a beach rose

350
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,859
and sweeping her off her feet.

351
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,277
Well, it's a party.

352
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,862
Get over Gat
by getting under someone else.

353
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,113
Oh, God.

354
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,365
Sex is not the solution
to all of your problems.

355
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,701
You know, sex actually
turns perfectly sane people

356
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,578
into lunatics.

357
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,538
Fair, but flirting
never hurt anyone.

358
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,042
What's your type, Cady?
We'll round 'em up.

359
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,670
I'm in the mood for frat boys,

360
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,257
guys who play guitar,
guys with dumb tattoos,

361
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,467
guys with podcasts.

362
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,676
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God.

363
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,136
Douchebags Gat will hate.

364
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,221
You guys are both disgusting.

365
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,891
But I will make
a douchebag group chat, okay?

366
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,476
Mm-hmm!

367
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:43,980
Just PS, I personally endorse
a life of celibacy.

368
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,608
For...for real, though.
Yeah.

372
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,700
PS, I personally
endorse a life of celibacy.

373
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,118
Okay. That's enough? Okay.

374
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,453
Nope. Nope. Nope.

375
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,414
- Ugh. Whoo!
- Ugh!

376
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,751
You need to follow
my three rules.

377
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,461
I know...the sugar in the mixer

378
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,712
makes you sicker
than the booze.

379
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,172
Never leave a drink unattended

380
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,174
when drunk country club bros
are near.

381
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:15,261
And it's only fun until
someone gets sued.

382
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,598
Hey. Be careful.

383
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,601
I always am, pathologically so.

384
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,936
Okay.

385
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:26,523
Well, I need to get
back to Clairmont,

386
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,149
deal with some work drama.

387
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,067
On the Fourth?

388
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,610
Literally always.

389
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,112
Your mom likes very
fancy shoes, Little Bug.

390
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,826
- Dad?
- Yeah?

391
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,538
I need to tell you something.

392
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,832
- It's about Mom.
- Oh.

393
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,543
Sounds like
mother-daughter business,

394
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,837
and I don't really wanna...

395
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,297
hey, have fun today.

396
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,382
Yeah?

397
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,050

I'll see you for the fireworks?

398
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,884

That's beautiful.

421
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,363
Ours have two minutes, Carrie.

422
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,948
Told you we'd pull it off.

423
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,741
Oh, where is the good china?

424
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,992
Packed.

425
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,328
I'm shipping it
back to Cambridge.

426
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,496
We never use it here.

427
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,915
That is antique rose medallion.

428
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,625
We do need to talk
about these things.

429
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,336
Fine china is used when
you cook a nice meal.

430
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:56,547
Pen's culinary expertise is
limited to literal dog food.

431
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,508
Yeah, except this isn't
about your tablescape,

432
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,593
because I know how much
the punch bowl auction's for.

433
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,095
Do you think
we're fucking idiots?

434
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,596
You barely even eat.

435
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,139
Well, Bess, we can't
all have the metabolism

436
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,809
and the grating personality
of a hummingbird on crack.

437
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,519
Okay, that's enough.

438
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,521
Let's not go for the Achilles
just five minutes before

439
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,648
we're supposed to play hostess,
okay?

440
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,149
Oh!

441
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,442
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

442
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,991
- Oh, God!
- No, no, no, no.

443
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,618
- Oh, God.
- Jesus.

444
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,578
- Oh, God.
- Oh!

445
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,205
They were fine
five minutes ago.

446
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,456
They were totally fine.

447
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,916
What did you do?

448
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,877
Did you turn the heat up?
Did you turn the broiler on?

449
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,379
I don't know what
the broiler is, Bess.

450
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,797
I don't cook.

451
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,674
Well, your fucking pie
is perfect and you...

452
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,175
Okay, relax, relax.

453
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,635
You have nothing
to worry about today.

454
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,262
Thanks to the
well-bred income source

455
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:45,680
that Dad instructed you
to marry,

456
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,306
your trust fund is intact.

457
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,393
Oh, yeah, 'cause you married
middle class for true love.

458
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,812
What? No.
She never even loved Sam.

459
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,273
And you are pushing 40
in a crop top,

460
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,483
hoping your husband
will throw a glance your way

461
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,943
on his way to the golf course.

462
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,780
Please, Bess, tell me
what you know about love.

463
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,615
I know that I don't
remember the last time

464
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,075
I saw you feel it.

465
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,202
I know you use us
like sparring bags.

466
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,413
You polish up your daughter
like some trophy.

467
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,373
Oh, perfect Penny,
so good in a crisis

468
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,125
she can plan a whole funeral

469
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,544
but won't shed
one single tear at it.

470
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,212
God, you don't love anyone.

471
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,214
You just tolerate them
until they leave you.

472
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,386
Ah, Bess!

473
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,605
You need to breathe.
You need to breathe.

474
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,732
It's a panic attack, okay?
It's a panic attack.

475
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:38,649
Just breathe.

476
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,494
It's just a pie.

477
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:54,916
You have no idea
what it feels like...

478
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,043
to be a failure in Dad's eyes.

479
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,795
He still thinks that
you walk on water.

480
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,213
Penny's broke.

481
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,048
She's not hurting.

482
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,591
She's just pretending
to break down

483
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,468
so that you'll
feel bad for her,

484
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,179
and you'll swoop in
and defend her.

485
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,264
And it's working,
like it always does.

486
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:11,224
Bess.

487
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,479
You've been the baby
for a long time now.

488
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:19,982
But have you honestly forgotten
what it feels like

489
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:23,069

526
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,493
Whoo!

527
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,120
Cady!

528
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,166
Cady, where's Gat?

529
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,293
We're gonna do a Liars shot
to kick this thing off.

530
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,212
Oh, he's somewhere
around here with, uh, Raquel.

531
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,463
You saw them?

532
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:06,297
Uh-huh.

533
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,301
Uh, Liars plus-one shot?

534
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,802
Ow. Okay, or not.

535
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,351
Who the fuck invited them?

536
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,810
The tennis boys?

537
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,562
Probably me.
Cady needed options.

538
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:25,524
Next time you decide to
invite people from my school

539
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,486
to my party, how about
you run them by me first?

540
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,406
Fuck's sake, Mirren.

541
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,246
God, that was dramatic.

542
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:40,581
I'm so sick of all
his ups and downs, man.

543
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:44,335
Hey, look,
don't let it ruin your vibe.

544
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,170
Look at me.

545
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,799
I am not letting Raquel
ruin mine.

546
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,008
Sure you're not.

547
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,009
Hold my beer.

548
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:07,024
Yeah. Whoo!

549
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,569
Stop, stop.

550
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,321
- I swear to God.
- No. Stop it.

551
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,699
I told you I don't feel good.

552
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,534
Ow! Stop it!

553
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:17,994
Stop!

554
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:21,914
Do you remember Johnny's
tennis friends from last year?

555
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,040
Vaguely.

556
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,420
Yeah, well, I thought that
they were all pals and stuff,

557
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,132
but now I remember that
when they got to the party,

558
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:33,718
Johnny was so pissed
that they were there.

559
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:37,847
He had that scary look
in his eye,

560
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,558
like he did with Blake Beaumont
at the funeral.

561
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,729
See, the key to my
friendship with Johnny

562
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,814
is that I pretty much
never pretend

563
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,858
to care about the intricacies
of rich kid drama.

564
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:52,153
But last year, I was
so caught up with you,

565
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:53,863
and you were
so caught up with Raquel,

566
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,197
that we didn't realize that

567
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,575
there was something off
with Johnny.

568
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:58,743
Have you ever thought that

569
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,953
you're not remembering
for a reason,

570
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,705
that your mind is trying
to protect you?

571
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,958
- My mind wants answers.
- Fine. All right.

572
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,836
Maybe you could believe that
I'm trying to protect you?

573
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:17,136
You were MIA all year, Gat.

574
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,014
It's too late to do the whole
Prince Charming thing now.

575
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:26,354
I'll just figure
this out myself.

576
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,608
Come on, Johnny.

577
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,369
Nice.

578
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,934
Happy Fourth.

579
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,645
- Happy Fourth.
- I'm sorry.

580

581
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,939
Hi.

582
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,609

- No, she's literally...

589
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,296

- Okay.

Wait, you're here again?

591
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,053
Your cousin invited me.

592
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,971
It's like she doesn't
know that you're a lurker.

593
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,264
I'm not lurking.

594
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,016
I'm eating a carrot stick,
and I'm talking to you.

595
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,435
That's impossible,
'cause I'm not talking to you.

596
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,020
Ebon, dance with me.

597
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,313
Oh, I'm not much of a dancer.

598

Oh, come on.

599
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,233
- Dance with me.
- I'll dance.

600
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,528
Hey, you're cute.

601
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,530
Okay, you're off
the hook for now.

00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,739

You're Johnny's
doubles partner.

607
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,465
No, I used to be.

611
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,308
I haven't seen him
this whole party.

612
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:55,521
If you came to declare
your intentions, I wouldn't.

613
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,481
This island is cursed.

614
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,817

616
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,113
Then why did you come?

617
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,365
The guy said Beechwood parties
are legendary.

618
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,658
True.

619
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,828
And 'cause he's not
answering any of my texts.

620
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:13,914
Oh, well, we don't really
have Wi-Fi here.

621
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:17,084
When you see him,
tell him I just wanna talk.

622
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,210

623
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:20,421

They're just pies.

629

They were important.

630
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,581
It's literally impossible
to make you proud.

631
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,958
Well, nothing about
any of your behavior lately

632
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,668
has been worthy of my pride.

633
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,632
Okay. Okay.

634
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,967
We got a little worked up
about Mom's stuff.

635
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,636
But you know what?
We are grieving.

636
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:11,430
We're just clearly
not very good at it.

637
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,932
Grieving over her loss

638
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,853
or the fact that she's not
around anymore to bail you out?

639
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,688
Look, I don't know
what's happening

640
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,399
with Penny's finances,

641
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,902
but you should have
seen her earlier.

642
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,612
She's not made of stone.

643
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,365
Well, Penny is spending
twice her budget,

644
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:33,744
and Bess is skating
along the edge of zero.

645
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,579
What?

646
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,997
Running on empty.

647
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,296
And then there's you.

648
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,422
What about me?

649
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,466
I thought that you
and your young man,

650
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,760
you were staying afloat, even
after you spent your trust

651
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,346
on drugs and fancy rehabs.

652
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:55,599
But you've been working
overtime to impress me,

653
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,394
now trying to make pie.

654
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,145
You need something from me.

655
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,364
Ed and I were fine.

656
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:15,327
We had savings,
enough for a wedding, IVF.

657
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:22,126
And then there was an incident
at Johnny's school.

658
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:25,671
He got into some trouble,

659
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,716
some very bad, very expensive,

660
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:33,429
very fucked up trouble,

661
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,347
the kind that
you would not like associated

662
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,016
with the Sinclair name.

663
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,687
So I did what I thought
you would do,

664
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,397
and I took care of it.

665
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,985
And now there is nothing.

666
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,445
Nothing.

667
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:52,448
And Ed does not know,
because if Ed knew,

668
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:57,244
he would make me do what
he thinks is the right thing.

669
00:33:57,244 --> 00:34:01,081
And I can't do that.

670
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:09,798
So, yes, I do need you.

671
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,694
- Hands off.
- Hey, hey, hey!

672
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,864
Dance amongst yourselves.

673
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:35,824
You need some water or
you're gonna be passed out

674
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,117
before the fireworks start.

675
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,827
Gat disappeared.

676
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,955
He's definitely trying to make
out with Raquel somewhere.

677
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,917
Not in your kitchen,
where the water is.

678
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,752
Go.

679
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,755
You jealous she's
getting all the attention?

680
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,424
Cadence is the eldest heir
in the Sinclair legacy.

681
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,511
If I had an issue with getting
attention, I'd be screwed.

682
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:58,180
No, I was just helping
a vulnerable girl out, so.

683
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,265
Oh, so like I was trying to do

684
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,683
when you were crying
over Blake Beaumont

685
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,976
at a dock at a funeral, right?

686
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,604
I don't need rescuing.
She does.

687
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,481
Look, you see that guy, Jake?

688
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,858
He sells pills
to sixth-graders.

689
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,362
And Deacon is so alt-right,
he's a fascist.

690
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:16,657
And Kurt sexually assaulted
his best friend's sister

691
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:19,368
when she was too drunk
to fight him off.

692
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,537
So yeah, I'm sorry, but they
don't get to give my cousin

693
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:23,080
any kind of attention.

694
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,000
How do you know that?

695
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,419
It's just like you said.

696
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:32,756
People talk around people that
they perceive to be invisible.

697
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:37,386
And invisibility isn't just
for water taxi drivers.

698
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:40,347
It also applies to girls that
they don't think are hot.

699
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,433
They think you're hot.

700
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,686
No, they think I'm weird.

701
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:48,146
And weird cancels out hot, so.

702
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,700
You know, I...I sort of, uh...

703
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,412
pride myself on being the
keeper of Vineyard secrets,

704
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:07,124
you know, dark shit,
secret families, embezzlers,

705
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:08,834
transphobe Republican senators

706
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,669
that keep gay escorts
on speed dial.

707
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,672
Seriously, it sucks
sometimes knowing all that.

708
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,094
Secrets poison you.

709
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,221
Yeah, they do.

710
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,557
But I keep them...

711
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,726
because...I don't know.
I don't know.

712
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,561
It makes me feel powerful
or something.

713
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,688
But I told you about
Blake Beaumont,

714
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,523
and I told you about the thing
with your mother.

715
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,818
Yeah, because you pitied me.
You made that very clear.

716
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:38,989
No, it's because
I think you're weird.

717
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,449
And I think you're hot.

718
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,328
You hate me.

719
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:47,998

You know you can tell me stuff.

00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,067
Look, I want you
to know that, Johnny.

736
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,153
I love you.

737
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,031
Ed?

What is this?

739
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,249
You're early.
Um.

740
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:14,418
Johnny, will you just
leave us alone?

741
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:15,752
I need to talk to Ed.

742
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,465
What's going on?

743
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,551
Nothing, just family stuff.

744
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,803
Family stuff?
Family stuff?

745
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,264
- I was about to ask you...
- Don't.

746
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,685
Thanks.

747
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:37,024
Hey, can you keep it down?

748
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:38,442
Oh.

749
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,612
That was rude.

750
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:46,450
You're rude for bringing
your girlfriend to our island

751
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,785
and not introducing me.

752
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,871
- It's your island.
- Right.

753
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:53,165
That's why you think
I'm shallow and selfish,

754
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,751
because I have an island.

755
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:59,755
But you're still here,
torturing me.

756
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,673
I'm...I'm torturing you?

757
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,134
Clearly,
you're torturing me, Gat.

758
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,845
Clearly, I'm tortured.
Like...

759
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,015
Yeah, Cadence, you look it.

760
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,100
Thanks...uh.

761
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,356
It's just not fair
'cause...ah.

762
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,234
Ow.

763
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:36,792
I always loved my Nan's ring.

764
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:44,716
Funny, my mom wouldn't part
with it for my first wedding.

765
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,636
I think she always
knew he'd bail.

766
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,179
She knew I wouldn't.

767
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:57,145
So I...I need you to hear me.

768
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,690
Whatever it is,
you can tell me.

769
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,400
Johnny's problems
are my problems.

770
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,155
I am here for you, the boys,
our future kids,

771
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,532
all of it, Carrie.

772
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,494
I can't marry you, Ed.

773
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,079
I'm sorry.

774
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,831
Because of Johnny?
I don't get it.

775
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:20,710
I know.
I can't...I can't explain it.

776
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,923
Even if I tried,
you would not understand.

777
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,760
I got Harris's approval.

778
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,389
His approval is fleeting.

779
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,391
Fine, then we don't need him.
I...

780
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,225
I do.

781
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:38,937
I do.

782
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,904
I lost my mom,
and I need my dad.

783
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:53,827
I'm sorry.

784
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,664

792
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,735
Ed just asked me to marry him
with Nan's ring.

I said no.

Well, you don't
do sentiment, Penny.

00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,006
You thought that I didn't need
to succeed today

803
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,966
because I don't need
Dad's money.

804
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:52,761
Did you consider that
maybe I just wanted

805
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:55,639
to give him a tiny bright spot
given that he just

806
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,515
lost the love of his life?

807
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,226

00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:00,727

his brand new money,

857
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,736

No, no need to worry

862
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:29,042
You worry about the men
so that when you screwed up

863
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:32,170
and you owe them money,
you just steal it from me

00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:08,600
I was just trying
to make you jealous.

881
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,019
Okay?

882
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:17,901
Because I've been jealous for
weeks, and it feels like shit.

883
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:21,404
If you wanted me
to feel like shit, it worked.

884
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:23,490
You must have known
that it killed me

885
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,158
when you brought Raquel today.

886
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,954
Raquel wasn't here today.

887
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,877
You told me to invite her,
but I didn't.

888
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:41,883
But you...you went to go
pick her up at the Vineyard.

889
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,429
I went to break up with her.

890
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:54,229
In person,
'cause she deserves that...

891
00:46:57,524 --> 00:47:00,068
...just like, uh...

892
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:02,779
she deserves better
than some guy who...

893
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:06,824
...completely forgets
she exists

894
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,826
when he's in a hammock
with his best friend.

895
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:14,415
- Oh.
- Yeah, I...

896
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,000
I fucked things up, I know.

897
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,254
I just...I was
trying to fix it.

898
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,218
What happened?

899
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:26,052
Oh.

900
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,764
Drunk happened.

901
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:33,351
Okay.

902
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,897
Let me see.

903
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,232
It's gonna sting, all right?

904
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,066
Mm.

905
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,278
There you go.

906
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,389
Give me your hand.

907
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,682
My hand?

908
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:15,518
Yeah, give me your hand.

909
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:16,853
What are you doing?

910
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:19,147
You'll see.

911
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:40,043
Fuck! Oh, damn it!

912
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:42,170
Shit.

913
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,380
- Fuck!
- Johnny?

914
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,549
What's wrong?

915
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:47,884
Dude, what are you doing?

916
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,385
Stay away from me.

917
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:51,888
You're going to fall.

918
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:53,431
Just tell us what's going on.

919
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,766
No. Just leave me alone.

920
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:55,850

921
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,226

Cady, okay?

922
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,520

Got so worried.

958
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,390
I saw something,
a video on Johnny's phone.

959
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,142
He hurt someone, Gat.

960
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:02,560
- You hacked his phone?
- Yes, she did.

961
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,604
She unlocked my phone,
and she gave it to my mother,

962
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:07,148
who is now seeing my entire
private life, Cadence.

963
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:09,317
My texts with my dealer,
my Grindr profile.

964
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:10,985
She's crying so hard,
she won't even yell at me.

965
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,403
- Who does that?
- You lied to me.

966
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,197
Yes, yes, I kept some secrets.

967
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:16,240
Why would that give you the
right to go through my phone?

968
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,451
- Don't yell at her, man.
- What, because she's sick?

969
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,787
She's also fucking crazy.

970
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:22,830
I wouldn't have
to do all of this

971
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,791
if someone would just
tell me the fucking truth.

972
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:26,042
You wanna know
the truth, Cadence?

973
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:27,376
Yeah.

974
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,128
I'm a terrible person.
Maybe I'm a psycho.

975
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,755
Maybe everything that
happened to you was my fault.

976
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,006
You wanna believe that?

977
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,257
Do you wanna
believe that, Cadence?

978
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,675
No, no, I'm fucking sick of it!

979
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,469
