1
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,259
<i>Have you ever thought</i>

2
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,010
that you're not remembering
for a reason?

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,595
That your mind is
trying to protect you?

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,722
My mind wants answers.

5
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:17,685
<i>We are grieving.</i>
<i>We're just not good at it.</i>

6
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,603
<i>Grieving over a loss</i>
 <i>or the fact</i>

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,188
 <i>that she's not around anymore</i>
 <i>to bail you out?</i>

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,565
Aah!

9
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:24,817
Penny is spending
twice her budget,

10
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:27,486
 <i>and Bess is skating</i>
 <i>along the edge of zero.</i>

11
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,238
<i>That money was</i>
 <i>for our daughters.</i>

12
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,865
How long have you
been robbing them?

13
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,742
Get the fuck off this island.

14
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:35,161
<i>Ed just asked me</i>
 <i>to marry him with Nan's ring.</i>

15
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,662
I'm so, so sorry.

16
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,038
<i>Do you hate me?</i>

17
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,498
<i>No, I think you're hot.</i>

18
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,083
 <i>They're not</i>
 <i>mutually exclusive.</i>

19
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,585
Raquel wasn't here today.

20
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:45,045
You went to go pick her up
at the Vineyard.

21
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,298
<i>I went to break up with her.</i>

22
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,008
<i>Do you remember</i>
 <i>Johnny's tennis friends</i>

23
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,885
 <i>- from last year?</i>
- Who the fuck invited them?

24
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,012
<i>Have you ever done</i>
 <i>anything bad in your life?</i>

25
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,680
I mean, like really bad?

26
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,474
<i>There was an incident</i>
 <i>at Johnny's school...</i>

27
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:58,434
 <i>They fucking deserved it!</i>

28
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,519
...the kind that you
would not like associated

29
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,981
with the Sinclair name,
and now I do need you.

30
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,316
<i>She unlocked my phone,</i>

31
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:07,109
 <i>and she gave it</i>
 <i>to my mother, who does that?</i>

32
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,444
Just tell me
the fucking truth!

33
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:09,904
You want to know
the truth, Cadence?

34
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,739
 <i>Maybe everything that happened</i>
 <i>to you is my fault.</i>

35
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,324
Cady! Somebody please
get some fucking help!

36
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:15,117
- Help us! Cady!
- Hey!

37
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,077
- Someone get help, please!
- Cady!

38
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:39,266
<i>Are you crazy?</i>
<i>Yes, I kept some secrets.</i>

39
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,811
 <i>I'm sick</i>
 <i>of the fucking victim card!</i>

40
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:44,563
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
 <i>there was a mythical land</i>

41
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,358
 <i>where it was always summer.</i>

42
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,985
 <i>There was a princess...</i>

43
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,780
 <i>a cursed princess, I think.</i>

44
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,615
 <i>Or maybe it...</i>

45
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,158
 <i>Oh, here it is.</i>

46
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,537
 <i>There was once</i>
 <i>a three-headed serpent.</i>

47
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,581
 <i>No.</i>

48
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,959
 <i>There was once a wicked witch.</i>

49
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,002
<i>Yes, a witch.</i>

50
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,173
 <i>No, there was once</i>
 <i>a cruel prince,</i>

51
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,634
 <i>used to having</i>
 <i>his every whim indulged.</i>

52
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,942
 <i>I'm so sick</i>
 <i>of fucking fairy tales.</i>

53
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,601
You look pretty.

54
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,103
My mom made me go
to Clairmont this morning,

55
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,106
dressed all respectably,
to tell Harris

56
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,859
how much I love
Gran's jade-jewelry collection.

57
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,277
Did you tell him?

58
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,029
He gave me this hairpin,

59
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:00,658
making it clear it's a gift
for me and not my mother.

60
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,453
Mom says she needs to get
back on his good side.

61
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,706
She, like, enlisted me.

62
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,292
So what are you, uh...
what are you doing up here?

63
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,836
The weather's
gonna turn soon.

64
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,507
Just thinking, I guess.

65
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,676
Ed finally left
last night.

66
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,594
He's at a hotel
at the Vineyard.

67
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,515
It's weird being here
without him.

68
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,394
I feel like
a stranger at Red Gate.

69
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,603
Everything just...

70
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,189
everything feels messed up.

71
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,737
Almost everything.

72
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,168
The universe
is really huge right now.

73
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,963
I need something
to hold on to.

74
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,803
Hey, kids.

75
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,931
Have you seen Mirren?

76
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,351
She's not at Cuddledown.
I thought that...

77
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,145
Is that my mom's hairpin?

78
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,191
I told my dad yesterday
that it was my favorite.

79
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,152

could have that?

00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:55,898
Yeah.

I just dropped your grandpa's

Oh, sure, sure.

104
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,708
No, I went to take off,
but they, uh...

105
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,252
they ordered a shelter
in place, so I turned around.

106
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,046
I tied up
to your service dock.

107
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,051
So...

108
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,844
you want to?

Uh, I can take you

115
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,827

00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,411
- I know...
- Lay off it, Will.

117
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,247

00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,270

128
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,021
- Because you seem pretty...
- Johnny, just stop.

129
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,023
No. No, you don't get

00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,316

00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,469
What if I spoke to him?

136
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,054
Okay, I'll tell him
it was my fault.

137
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,931
And I'm gonna tell him
what happened at school.

138
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,976
No, you cannot tell anyone.

139
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,353
Do you understand me?

140
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,190
If you want to help,
you can prove to Harris

141
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,319
that you can be an asset
to the family.

142
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,946
He's the one keeping the roof
over our heads right now.

143
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,533
And if it ever got out
what you did...

144
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,744
he'd never forgive
either of us.

145
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,717
The land value
is skyrocketing.

146
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,969
We're sitting
on a gold mine.

147
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,889
Thatcher, you say that
every year, and every year,

148
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,058
my parents tell you they
would never sell Beechwood.

149
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,143
- Your mother said that.
- Of course she did.

150
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,855
It's your legacy
for your grandchildren.

151
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,732
Mmm.

152
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,193
Let me know if I can get you
anything else.

153
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,861
- Thanks, Lydia.
- Thank you, Lydia.

154
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,988
Where are the little ones?

155
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,406
Playing a board game.

156
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,408
Trying to keep them entertained
in this kind of weather

157
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,952
is a nightmare.

158
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:58,997
Oh, I can imagine,
with all the valuables around.

159
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,001
Huh.
Is that ivory?

160
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,461
They were my favorites.

161
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,589
Mom actually said that they
would be perfect for Red Gate.

162
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,632
Hold on.

163
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,050
There's no way
that she said that.

164
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,802
- That's not how...
- They belong where they are.

165
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,428
I am not dead...yet.

166
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,432
You will want to include them

167
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,643
in an asset inventory,
though.

168
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,353
- What asset inventory?
- Thatcher and I

169
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,230
have been going over
the estate plan.

170
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,941
Um, you're changing
your will?

171
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,443
To account
for new circumstances.

172
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,821
Isn't ivory illegal,
Granddad?

173
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,702
I don't mean
that illegal is a bad thing.

174
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,955
No, you just need
to know how to get it.

175
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,291
Never take no for an answer.

176
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,376
Yeah, this little slip
of a China girl

177
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,712
sold those to us in Shanghai.

178
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:50,799
Um, they're illegal
for a reason, right?

179
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,636
Um, maybe you could auction
the statues off

180
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,930
and use the money
and donate it

181
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,850
to a wildlife conservatory
or something.

182
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,145
Cadence, you're not to tell me
what to do with my earnings.

183
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,272
Your gran loved ivory.

184
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,859
And, luckily, Orientals--
they care far more about money

185
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,485
than they do legalities.

186
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,070
I mean, you...

187
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,197
you can't say "Oriental."

188
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,282
Oriental?

189
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,867
Or "China girl."

190
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,577
Hmm.

191
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,038
Oriental...
it's an academic term.

192
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,040
Just ask Edward Said.

193
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,543
Your generation is
so damn eager to be offended.

194
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,087
It's true.
Outrage addiction.

195
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,548
It's an epidemic.

196
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,258
I blame TikTok.

197
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,637
<i>You could have had my back.</i>

198
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,514
You know what he said
was wrong.

199
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,684
I didn't say it.
I didn't fucking say it, okay?

200
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,311
Also, it's not like
he's racist, okay?

201
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,437
He's just old.

202
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,105
You just need to stay
on his good side.

203
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,816
If he says the kids these days
are a bunch of woke freaks,

204
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,027
then there's no harm
in nodding and smiling.

205
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,528
Maybe this isn't
about Granddad.

206
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,364
You've been acting
like a jerk all summer...

207
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,324
picking fights, acting shady.

208
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,909
- Me acting shady?
- Yeah.

209
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,370
You two are acting shady.

210
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,871
Dude, don't yell at her.

211
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,623
What are you guys,
like, together now?

212
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,375
Cute.

213
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,793
Boys, the storm
is getting close.

214
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,544
Make sure
the boats are secured.

215
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,129
Yes, sir.

216
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,857
Can I help you
find something, Dad?

217
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,317
No flashlight batteries.

218
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,194
Oh.

219
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,196
Got them
from the service building

220
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,906
as soon as I saw
the forecast.

221
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,408
Mom always used to, so...

222
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:47,416
I was hoping to talk to you
about something important.

223
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,960
Brody and I...

224
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,004
Hey, Mom,
have you seen Will?

225
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,715
Um...No, no, no, no, no!
Do not get mud on Gran's rugs.

226
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,967
We need him.

227
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,969
Stormy weather is perfect
for summoning the ghosts

228
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,637
of the whaling captain's widow.

229
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,889
Well, I think
he's at Red Gate.

230
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,851
So go, go, go.
Go.

231
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,310
I presume
you claimed the rugs

232
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,187
in your sisters' battle
for heirlooms?

233
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,605
Well, I...

234
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,483
I do love them, but...

235
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,236
Anyway...

236
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,029
Listen, Daddy,

237
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,990
Brody needs to pay back
his clients

238
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,867
if he's going to stay
out of trouble.

239
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,703
What he's trying to stay out of
is federal prison.

240
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,624
What do you think
about all of us moving

241
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,918
into the Boston house
in the fall?

242
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,795
No, no, no, no.
I don't like noise.

243
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,672
It's so big,
and without Mom...

244
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,424
Dad.
Dad, look at me!

245
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,387
I didn't know
what was going on.

246
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,015
I had nothing
to do with it.

247
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,391
I don't know
which is worse,

248
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:51,229
the idea that I raised
a criminal or an absolute fool.

249
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,941
You loved him, too, Dad.

250
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,152
Because I trusted
your judgment!

251
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:01,281
Carrie, Penny, no,
but you I had faith in.

252
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,658
I...I was mistaken.

253
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,369
Penny.

254
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,704
Oh, uh, don't mind me.

255
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,247
I'm just going to give the dogs
their thunder pills

256
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,707
and put them
in the laundry room

257
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,459
so they don't pee
on that beautiful rug.

258
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,461
Cadence was entirely
out of line today...

259
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,129
in front of company.

260
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,423
I don't know what she's
reading, but I will...

261
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,800
Oh, she was just
trying to impress Gat.

262
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,677
Maybe you've been
too distracted

263
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,388
to notice them getting
all cozy this summer, Pen.

264
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,979
This is an interesting
spot for a studio.

265
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,066
I used to paint
in my grandmother's study,

266
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:39,277
but now it just feels
kind of weird.

267
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,698
I want to submit one

268
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,451
to the Sound's Edge Gallery.

269
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,869
That's where my grandmother

270
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,455
used to take me all the time
when I was little.

271
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,625
It's my favorite
one on the Vineyard.

272
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,211
Hmm. That's cool.

273
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,296
Hey, don't touch.

274
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,675
My medium
takes weeks to dry.

275
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,386
So should we just, um, take
our clothes off?

276
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,845
Oh, look at this.

277
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,723
This is the, uh...this is
the view from the ferry, right?

278
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:12,644
You know I'm not, like, trying
to go on a date or anything.

279
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,604
Yeah, it's pretty.

280
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,730
So, if you're gonna be here,

281
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,440
you might as well make
yourself useful.

282
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,942
All right,
I'm not a sex object.

283
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,527
- I need to be wooed.
- Oh.

284
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,570
Now shush.

285
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,321
I'm looking at art.

286
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,534
Well, what
do you think, then,

287
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,788
other than "pretty,"
"cool," grunt.

288
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,333
I mean, look, you're...

289
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,130
...very technically skilled.

290
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,134
- Technically skilled.
- Yeah.

291
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,261
So you think have
no imagination.

292
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:50,557
You think I'm a bored rich girl
who has a generic hobby.

293
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,018
I don't think that.

294
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,728
You think that?

295
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,731
Probably every night
just before I fall asleep.

296
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:01,943
I think art should be,
like, messy,

297
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,988
messy as people are.

298
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,406
I don't know.
I don't...

299
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,326
Maybe you don't have a mess.

300
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,244
Are you kidding?

301
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,872
You know my mom
is sleeping around on my dad,

302
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,832
who is a thief,
apparently.

303
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,001
But I blame my mother
because she's the one

304
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,961
that's so obsessed
with everything being perfect

305
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,839
all the time,
and perfect is expensive.

306
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,177
My whole family
didn't notice

307
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:30,180
I didn't show up
to lunch today...

308
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,598
which makes sense

309
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,310
'cause I'm practically
just the spare to their heirs.

310
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,813
Cady is, "Gat this, Gat that,"
all the time,

311
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,440
and I don't remember
the last time

312
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,610
she asked me anything
about my personal life.

313
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,279
I lost my virginity
to some random.

314
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,406
And my technically good
portfolio

315
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,991
is never gonna
get me anywhere!

316
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,994
Fuck!

317
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,999
You should wait out the storm
in the boathouse.

318
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,419
I would like to have my
temper tantrum alone, please.

319
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,463
Mirren.

320
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,006
What?

321
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,853
Oh, it's, um...

322
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,855
I don't....
Oh.

323
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,663
<i>The person I was angry</i>
 <i>with was myself.</i>

324
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,165
 <i>Luckily, my sponsor picked up</i>
 <i>on the first ring.</i>

325
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,459
<i>Thank you for sharing, Vanya.</i>

326
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,253
 <i>Does anyone else</i>
 <i>have anything?</i>

327
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,255
Uh, I do.

328
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,464
Hi.

329
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:48,925
Fuck.

330
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,885
I'm sorry.
I'm on mute, I think.

331
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,263
- Um...
 <i>- You are not.</i>

332
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,473
- Oh, good.
- <i>- Go ahead.</i>

333
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,058
Uh...

334
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,396
I'm Carrie.
I'm a drug addict.

335
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,064
<i>Hi, Carrie.</i>

336
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:07,569
I have, uh, ten years sober.

337
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,696
I have not been
to a meeting in ages.

338
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,740
Um...

339
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,909
But I really needed this.

340
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,496
Um...

341
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,709
This summer...

342
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,297
so far, I have lost
my mother...

343
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,717
and did things
with my partner...

344
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,719
not because I wanted to.

345
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,680
And it's all been really hard
on my sons.

346
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,116
<i>Why are you so worried</i>

347
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,743
about Harris's approval
all of a sudden?

348
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,870
I mean, you're like
the Sinclair golden child.

349
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,038
That's Cadence, okay?

350
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,332
I just get "first male heir"
bonus points.

351
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,083
I'm just trying to get
my shit together, okay?

352
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,627
How?
How do you plan to do that?

353
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,420
By turning
into your grandfather?

354
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,755
What?
Like that's a bad thing?

355
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,465
It's really not a good thing.

356
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,175
I get it, okay?

357
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,135
You don't like me
or my family anymore.

358
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,429
You think I haven't heard your
shitty comments all summer?

359
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,140
You went to India,
you got enlightened,

360
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,809
and now you're
too good for us.

361
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,102
Way to level up.
Fucking congrats!

362
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,146
That's not true.
You and the Liars...

363
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,023
No, you and I got thrown
together on an island

364
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,775
when we were
eight years old, Gat.

365
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,984
And little kids,

366
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,903
they make friends
based on proximity, right?

367
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,781
But let's face it, dude, we
don't have shit else in common.

368
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,577
If we met in school now,
we wouldn't even be friends.

369
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,583
I think eventually
we were gonna grow apart,

370
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,585
and I guess eventually
is now.

371
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,632
It's no big deal, dude.

372
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,092
You get the canoes
put away?

373
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,554
Uh...

374
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,055
yeah, the green one's
out there.

375
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,349
The red one
wasn't on the beach.

376
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,767
Listen, I'm sorry.
I...

377
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,893
Wait, what?

378
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,187
You sure it wasn't
under the dock?

379
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,815
No, just the green one.
Why?

380
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,487
- Oh, fuck!
- Dude, what? What?

381
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,698
Will, he...he wanted to go
off island this morning,

382
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,783
- and I blew him off.
- Fuck. Okay, go, go.

383
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,618
Shit!

384
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,036
Fuck!

385
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,329
Wait!

386
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,457
Hey, Mom.
Have you seen Gat?

387
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,458
No one was at the...

388
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,294
Do you have
mercury poisoning?

389
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,461
Huh?

390
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,881
Has the chef
over-shell-fished you?

391
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:33,965
I'm sorry, what?

392
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,633
Maybe you're a changeling.

393
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,177
Maybe while I slept,
an evil witch

394
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,930
swapped out my chronically
well-behaved kid

395
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,932
for a demon pain in the ass,

396
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:46,436
because my kid would never
intentionally provoke

397
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,021
her grandfather when
I specifically asked her...

398
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,522
The word he used was...

399
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,817
If one absolutely
must correct Harris Sinclair,

400
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,361
one does it
in absolute privacy.

401
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,991
And pro tip, Cady, you never
absolutely must correct him.

402
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,620
You are 16, and he is one
of <i>Forbes</i> most powerful.

403
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,330
I am trying to be
a better person.

404
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,457
- Ah.
- I'm trying to call out

405
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,334
injustice when I see it
and use my...

406
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,669
...privilege for good.

407
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,338
Oh, sweet, merciful Jesus.

408
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,048
Look, I get it, you know?

409
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,467
I was also an idiot
around cute boys

410
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,968
when I was your age.

411
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,596
I know you've been spending
a lot of time with Gat.

412
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:24,766
Yeah, every summer
for the last eight years.

413
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,936
You know, when I was your age,
my dad made a rule...

414
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:31,689
no boys overnight
on Beechwood.

415
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,900
Gat didn't count.

416
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,111
But, clearly, things
have changed between you.

417
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,613
Hmm?

418
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,324
Maybe with Ed gone, it isn't
appropriate for him to be here.

419
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,742
You can't send him away.

420
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,410
Sinclair ladies
have discretion.

421
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,371
And Bess saw you two
on the beach.

422
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:47,872
- Bess?
- Mm-hmm.

423
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:52,335
Wow. Okay, well, she's one
to talk about discretion.

424
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,128
Stop.

425
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,296
Sit.

426
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,928
Spill.

427
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,513
Oh, my God, I'm shaking.

428
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,598
You can do it.

429
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,893
Okay.

430
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,729
Yeah, there you go.

431
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,730
Yeah.

432
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,775
Oh, my God.
I love it.

433
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,694
Have I lost it?

434
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,446
I have absolutely snapped.

435
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,451
Ah, this one,
it's taken me so long,

436
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,454
with the underpainting
and the glow of the lights.

437
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,207
I feel like
I'll never be finished.

438
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,460
It's my masterpiece.

I bet Windemere
doesn't leak.

460
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,034
Just you and Cadence
in that big house

461
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,702
while I'm stuck
tripping over the twins

462
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,746
in this haunted shack.

463
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,123
It was my turn to renovate,
and you know it.

464
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,042
Well, if Dad
sells Beechwood,

465
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,377
Cuddledown would be
a tear-down anyway.

466
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,215
In the meantime, you could get
your roof fixed with a barter.

467
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:06,552
You know, trade your body
for a good caulking.

468
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,929
Excuse me?

469
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,056
Your side piece
is an actual handyman.

470
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,099
Put him to work.

471
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:16,479
Your daughter saw you
with Salty Dan.

472
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,439
Boobs out in the boathouse.

473
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:23,277
I mean, no mind
for discretion at all.

474
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,449
But if you ever...

475
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,284
throw my kid under the bus

476
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,328
to get into Dad's
good graces again,

477
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,455
ever...

478
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,792
I won't have
any discretion either.

479
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,776
Fuck, I don't see anything!

480
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,821
Wait. Ed's staying
at the Harbor Inn, isn't he?

481
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,573
Will couldn't make it
that far.

482
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:09,907
Don't...don't say that shit.

483
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,659
But he knows the sound.
He'd...

484
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,994
- Find shelter.
- Yeah.

485
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,412
The cove!
The cove!

486
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,413
Go, go, go!

487
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:20,084
Look, I know earlier
I might have been a bit rude.

488
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:23,671
I understand you didn't intend
on being bigoted,

489
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,715
so I'm very, very sorry.

490
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,133
Annabelle!

491
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,928
I'm out
of St. Adaline Reserve.

492
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,513
I just restocked it,
Mr. Sinclair.

493
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,307
Well, it's not here.

494
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:37,059
One of your maids must take it
for their St. Adaline Reserve.

495
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,144
Watch the rug.

496
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,271
Mom loves it more
than she loves us.

497
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,148
Have you seen Will,
Granddad?

498
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,693
Uh...no, no,
not for some time.

499
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,361
- He's nowhere.
- He's somewhere.

500
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,654
It's an island.

501
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,281
We've literally
looked everywhere.

502
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,118
Annabelle...

503
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,162
have the staff fan out
along the perimeter path.

504
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,330
But...but do you think he's...

505
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,956
- Where are you going?
- The water.

506
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,512
William!

507
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,805
William, Johnny!

508
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,766
- William!
- Dad!

509
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,976
Dad, what on Earth
are you doing?

510
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:22,188
The boat's gone.
I think the boys are, too.

511
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,190
Call the Coast Guard
and the marina.

512
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,400
And find Tipper.
They've gone...

513
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,070
No, no, God damn it!
Carrie!

514
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,571
Find Carrie.
Go.

515
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,822
William!

516
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,660
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

517
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,370
I'll sneak you up to my room,
and you can shower there, okay?

518
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,414
You know, I'm still not
a...a sex object.

519
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,291
No, you're my muse.

520
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,877
No, I'm serious.
I'm trying to be serious.

521
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,213
I like you.

522
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,215
I liked you
for some time...

523
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,425
for real.

524
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,594
- Ebon, you barely know me.
- I know you.

525
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,471
I've driven you
for three summers.

526
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,891
You're funny,
and you're interesting,

527
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,227
and you're so frickin' weird.

528
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:04,063
And I like it.
I like you.

529
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,441
So you were spying
on me, then?

530
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,572
Mirren Sinclair Sheffield!

531
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,907
Oh, sorry.

532
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,951
Hey, we were looking
at her paintings up there.

533
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,203
- You need to leave.
- Mom, this is Ebon.

534
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,164
Ebon, leave, please.

535
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,916
Thank you.

536
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,459
Now.

537
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,256
Yeah, I'll...I'll...
I'll see you around.

538
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,599
Aunt Carrie?

539
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:52,278
Carrie?

540
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,865
Carrie?
Carrie.

541
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:58,951
- Carrie.
- Yeah? Yeah. Yeah.

542
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,995
Will's missing.

543
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,788
The beaches,
we have to get to the shore.

544
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,540
No, we already checked.
They're not there.

545
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,292
Cady, call Ed.

546
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,460
Okay.

547
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,183
Johnny! Faster!

548
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:23,976
I see it. I see...

549
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,269
Okay.

550
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,438
Please be okay. Please be okay.
Please be okay.

551
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,524
Whoa! Hey!

552
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,777
- What happened?
- I don't know! It won't move!

553
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,612
The propeller's
caught on something!

554
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:37,448
I...I can't get
the boat close enough.

555
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,116
Fuck!

556
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,535
- I'll jump in.
- No! Stay with the boat!

557
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,371
What are you doing? Wait!

558
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,413
Hey!

559
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,753
I'm on the fucking swim team.

560
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,259
Oh, come on!

561
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,771
Will! Will!

562
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,734
Will. Will.

563
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,194
Johnny!

564
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,821
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

565
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,781
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

566
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,575
Here, put this on.

567
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,452
No, it's okay. It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

568
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,413
You're okay, buddy?
You did good.

569
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,206
You did really good.

570
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,749
- Okay, okay.
- I'm really tired.

571
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,377
It's okay.
I've got you. It's okay.

572
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,307
Are you trying
to ruin my life?

573
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,476
I'm guessing that's
a rhetorical question.

574
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,979
My entire life is
about making things perfect

575
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,105
for other people.

576
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:52,523
I drive you to art class.

577
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,233
I pack your sister's lunch

578
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,194
and recitals
and field hockey games

579
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,779
and...and charity galas.

580
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,657
Oh, the galas, the galas.
They must be awful.

581
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,660
But the one time that
I do something that I want,

582
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,412
the one fucking time...

583
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:13,502
My private life
is not your gossip fodder.

584
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,342
Is this about Salty Dan?

585
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,013
Oh, my God.

586
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:27,725
If you need some me time,
get a hobby.

587
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:28,809
What?

588
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,811
Finish your degree maybe

589
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,230
or divorce dad
and then run away to Paris...

590
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,523
Oh.

591
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,233
...because at least
there's honor in that.

592
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,028
Cheating on him in open air
isn't self-care.

593
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,280
It's fucking disgusting!

594
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,032
God damn it!

595
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:46,243
If Penny doesn't spill
this to Harris

596
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:49,246
in some self-righteous fit,

597
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,123
she's gonna hold this
over my head

598
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,292
until we are in our grave!

599
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,044
Cady fucking told.

600
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:58,422
Your grandfather was
our only way out of this mess

601
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,673
that your father made.

602
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,342
What do you think
happens next, Mirren?

603
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,595
You think you're gonna go
to art school

604
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,473
when we are tens of millions
of dollars in debt?

605
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:10,559
That money was
your only ticket.

606
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,144
You are nothing
without it.

607
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,480
- None of us are! Oh!
- No!

608
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,689
God damn it!

609
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,359
You are not an artist!

610
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,027
You are a dilettante!

611
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,320
And you're a child!

612
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,615
I'm your child!

613
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:27,701
I didn't ask for you
to waste your life on me!

614
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,663
And neither did the twins!

615
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:34,500
You chose to be a mother.

616
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,711
You chose.

617
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,713
It's not our fault

618
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:43,592
that you decided
to hate it.

619
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,318
No!

620
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,283
Oh!
Jesus Christ!

621
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,641
Will, listen to me.

622
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,727
Keep the vest on.
Swim to...

623
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,563
Swim to Gat, okay?

624
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,983
- Gat!
- Go.

625
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,526
Don't leave me!

626
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,364
Johnny!

627
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:15,392
- Johnny!
- Can't reach!

628
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,977
Johnny.

629
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,315
Hang on to the ring,
all right?

630
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,400
Don't let go!

631
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,693
I'll pull us in.

632
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,195
It's okay.

633
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,209
I'm sorry, I can't.
It's not safe.

634
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,960
Then give me your keys and tell
your boss I stole the boat.

635
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,961
I can't. It's not safe.

636
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,171
- I'm sorry.
- Leave him alone.

637
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,048
Hey, Mirren,
Gat and Johnny are...

638
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,217
Oh, Gat. Shut up about Gat.
I don't care about his drama.

639
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:50,636
- No, you're not listening.
- I've heard it all summer!

640
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,471
- You're not listening.
- I've been there!

641
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,014
And I kept your secrets.

642
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,225
And the one time I tell you
something in confidence,

643
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,810
you go and tell
your mother?

644
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,355
- Mirren, they are...
- You're such a selfish bitch.

645
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:03,440
- They are gone, Mirren.
- Who? Who?

646
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,858
Gat and Johnny, the boys.

647
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,902
They took the boat,
and Will is missing.

648
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,071
Hey, they're fine.

649
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,198
They're good. The three
of them, they're all fine.

650
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,825
Coast Guard's got them.
They're fine.

651
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,122
This selfish bitch
better go tell everyone

652
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:19,707
our family didn't drown.

653
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:21,709
Fuck.

654
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,691
You're scared of me.

655
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,068
I don't remember
what I'm scared of.

656
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,075
Your mom has your pills.

657
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,079
She's worried about you.
We all are.

658
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,707
Look, I'm sorry
for yelling at you.

659
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,250
I'm sorry for everything.

660
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,586
But I don't know how you
ended up in the water,

661
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:07,254
and I don't know
how you got hurt,

662
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:09,923
but I know I didn't hurt you,
that is the truth.

663
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,675
Then why lie?

664
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,314
Come on.

665
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,952
Look, I did some things that
I don't want to talk about,

666
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:43,415
but it has nothing
to do with you, I swear.

667
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,134
Wait.

668
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,556
What did I miss
while I was out of it?

669
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,810
Well, um...

670
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,561
the sexy air-ambulance guy

671
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,772
who strapped you
to a gurney, for one,

672
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:09,858
the Vineyard Regatta,
Tisbury Street Fair.

673
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,152
We jumped Sunset Bluffs.

674
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,487
That was a rush.

675
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:17,658
Also, Mirren's art has been
considered for a gallery.

676
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:20,994
She's so nervous, she puked.

677
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,914
Maybe you can hype her up
a little.

678
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,252
What about Gat?

679
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:32,631
He's moping around,
reading sad poetry.

680
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:38,387
Okay.

681
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,431
Okay?

682
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,644
Okay.

683
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,525
I don't think
you're a psychopath.

684
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:55,863
I don't think you're any
of the things I said you were.

685
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,749
Whoo!

686
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,627
Mirren, are you okay?

687
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,129
You look a little pale.

688
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:14,298
This is such a bad idea.

689
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,844
And it's making me
nauseous, so...

690
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,929
It'll be fun.

691
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,723
All right, who's
jumping first?

692
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:24,766
Nope. No, no.

693
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,435
Nobody's jumping, right?
Too dangerous.

694
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,936
- What?
- No, no, no, wait.

695
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,397
Johnny said you all jumped
while I was sick,

696
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,233
one of the many things
I missed out on.

697
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,651
Or was that a lie?

698
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,111
No, once is enough.

699
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,280
And there are rocks, Cady,
and you're not feeling well.

700
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,407
I feel better, actually.

701
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,326
I don't want to be
the only one missing out.

702
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:45,329
Cady, don't.
Please, don't...don't do it.

703
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:46,580
Don't do it, for me.

704
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,875
Don't be
such a buzzkill, okay?

705
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,251
Like, we're here.

706
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,503
Even the moms jumped
when they were teenagers.

707
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,963
They didn't have
brain trauma.

708
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,381
Doesn't matter, okay?

709
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,883
If you're precise and you go
exactly when that wave comes

710
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,468
and you jump where it's deep,
then it's fine.

711
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,677
Okay, Cady?
You're fine.

712
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,262
Johnny, can I talk to
you for a second, please?

713
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,681
You know what?
It wasn't even that fun.

714
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,391
Honest.

715
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,561
Whatever happened to Ebon?

716
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,814
He's not driving
the water taxi anymore.

717
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,900
I-I thought I told you.

718
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,693
I'm seeing someone new.

719
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:22,115
Ebon was...whatever.

720
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,826
It's making me so queasy.

721
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:28,789
Your stomach hurts
when you have a secret.

722
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:33,085
You've been sick.
That's what you just said.

723
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:36,546
You said you were done asking
about last year.

724
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,049

No. Come on, don't run.

744
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,996
No, look,
the Coast Guard said

745
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,165
they'll bring them back
when it's safe.

746
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,917

Don't ever, ever,
ever do that again, okay?

768

I won't.

00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,305
It's all yours.

00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,394
Gat, um...

772
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:41,690
...I would have been fucked
today without you.

773
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:55,579
Hey, what the hell
happened out there?

774
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:58,331
You just gave up
once Will was safe.

775
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,962
Just tell me what's going on.

776
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,970
Beaumont and his teammates
pissed in our lockers

777
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:12,971
during a tournament.

778
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,514
Okay, gross.

779
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,515
And?

780
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,185
And I decided to get revenge.

781
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,520
There was a cold snap,

782
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,773
and so I rented a water truck

783
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,692
with my emergency AmEx.

784
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,777
Fuck, how much
did that even cost?

785
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:31,323
We flooded
their indoor courts.

786
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,366
We left all the doors open

787
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:37,662
so the breeze would come
through and it would ice over.

788
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,956
And then this kid...

789
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,834
Seb Delgado,

790
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,337
busted us,
and I, uh...

791
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,964
and I kicked his ass.

792
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:51,176
And I left him there...

793
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,970
in the fucking cold.

794
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,099
And I wasn't thinking
about the cold.

795
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,185
When I found out
he was in the hospital,

796
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,604
I called my mom,
and...

797
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:05,232
she fixed it.

798
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:07,234
All our matches were canceled
for the ice,

799
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:09,236
but Seb didn't narc on me.

800
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:10,820
She paid him off?

801
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,822
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

802
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,200
His family, h-his teammates,

803
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,077
the paramedics.

804
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:20,580
But Beaumont has a video,
and it'll go viral...

805
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,874
if I don't pay.

806
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,879
Harris Sinclair's heir
destroying the family name.

807
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:31,883
Look, it was an accident.

808
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,844
An accident?
Are you even listening to me?

809
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:38,056
The team wanted to run.
I wanted to stay.

810
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:41,226
I wanted to fight.

811
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,812
I don't know why.
Delgado's a good kid.

812
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:46,022
He's a scholarship kid,

813
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,608
kind of kid that you'd want
to be friends with, Gat.

814
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,946
But I, um...

815
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,448
I don't know.
I saw red.

816
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:05,917
I remember
when I was little, my, uh...

817
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,337
when my dad would flip out
on my mom and I,

818
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,047
that's what she used to say.

819
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,842
She used to say, um...

820
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:15,468
just go
to your room, Johnny.

821
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,596
It's okay. He's just...
he's just seeing red.

822
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,433
Johnny,
you're not your dad.

823
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,685
Yeah, I'm not
Harris Sinclair either.

824
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:26,646
I'm the shitty thing
in between.

825
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,648
I'm not a good person.

826
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:31,484
I'm fucked up,
and I'm pissed off,

827
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:34,738
and I'm...I'm privileged
in all the worst ways.

828
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:37,157
And, yeah, you've been right
about me all summer.

829
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,244
Johnny...

830
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,879
So, Dad, I read Cadence
the Riot Act, obviously.

831
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:52,589
She does know better.

832
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:55,633
Oh, Cadence was
very helpful today.

833
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,634
Oh.

834
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,553
She's a responsible
young woman.

835
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,097
Here you go, Dad.

836
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,725
- You want anything else?
- No, thank you.

837
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,560
Okay.

838
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,895
Hi.

839
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:09,689
Um, Annabelle said
to tell you

840
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:13,526
that she found your gin
in Gran's closet.

841
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,531
It's not opened.
I swear.

842
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,993
Johnny, you
really scared us today.

843
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,453
You really should
have found an adult.

844
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,955
Oh, time was crucial.

845
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:28,917
Johnny did just
as I would have.

846
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,627
It was admirable.

847
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,381
Thank you, sir.

848
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,510
Carrie...

849
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,053
Hmm?

850
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,180
...why are you wearing
the pearls?

851
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,100
Have you had those
this whole time?

852
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,520
I was, um, putting
Nan's ring back in Mom's...

853
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,480
- with her things, and I...
- Carrie.

854
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,023
I forgot.
I didn't mean to keep it on.

855
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,317
Oh, Christ, while your kids
went missing.

856
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:57,278
It wasn't her fault, actually.
It was me.

857
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,864
I'm the reason Will ran off.

858
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,408
And I didn't save him.

859
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:03,827
I wasn't admirable.
I wasn't strong enough.

860
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:06,079
And I forgot the water safety
you taught us, Granddad,

861
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,580
but Gat remembered.

862
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,833
And Ed ran to the pier, and he
caught the Coast Guard leaving.

863
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,751
He showed them where
he thought Will would be

864
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,212
from all the times
he took us out canoeing.

865
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,386
Ed and Gat saved us both.

866
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,599
I just screwed up.
Um...

867
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,518
that's the truth.

868
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:18,818
I thought I saw
you come in here.

869
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,237
Emergency fruit delivery.

870
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,365
Fuck.

871
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,242
What happened in here?

872
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,841
And the spousal support?

873
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,263
Yes, I understand.

874
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,598
Um...

875
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:52,060
...Sam's investigator
is digging up old skeletons.

876
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,690
Yes, enough.

877
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,818
Thatcher, I am not paying you
to list my various sins.

878
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,862
I was present
when they were committed.

879
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:06,241
I am paying you
to make them go away.

880
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,038
Mm-hmm.

881
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:15,500
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.

882
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,684
I'm gonna do better, Mom.
I promise.

883
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,647
I know.

884
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,533
Hi.

885
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:49,867
Gat.

886
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,913
Are you okay?

887
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:02,839
Yeah, it...
it's just a rope burn.

888
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:04,507
Ow.

889
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,357
I don't want to talk
to you right now.

890
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,401
I don't know what
you were trying to do all day,

891
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,279
but, fuck, I am so fucking done
with being scared for you.

892
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:27,614
When you have amnesia,

893
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:30,283
memories can get triggered
by your own body chemistry

894
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:32,160
if you're in the same
physical state as you were

895
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,578
when the trauma happened.

896
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,997
The same heart rate,
the same adrenaline rush

897
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,665
can bring you right back
to that moment.

898
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,125
So, to remember
the accident,

899
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,585
you wanted
to nearly drown again?

900
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:42,003
I wanted to see if it would
work, but it didn't.

901
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,504
The more you remember,
the worse you get.

902
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,256
I sat by your bed
while you had fever dreams

903
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,216
- and you took pills.
- I didn't ask you to be there.

904
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,843
Where the fuck else
am I going to be, then?

905
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,637
I don't know.
Where were you all year

906
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:52,805
- when I needed you most?
- It keeps coming back to this.

907
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,766
It'll always come
back to that, Gat.

908
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,184
I didn't just come
back here

909
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:58,478
because I wanted to know
how I got hurt.

910
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:02,815
I came back here
because I needed to know

911
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,817
why you didn't care
about me anymore.

912
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,611
How...how can you say that?
You know...

913
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:07,987
I don't know anything.

914
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,990
- You know how I feel.
- I don't.

915
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,369
I don't remember.

916
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:24,962
Fine. Maybe you don't remember,
but you must feel it.

917
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,131
I feel it
when we're together.

918
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,424
I...

919
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,597
Cady, I feel all of it.

920
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,854
I was...

921
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:45,233
I was so scared
I was gonna lose you.

922
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:47,402
You...you won't lose me.

923
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,237
I feel like I am...

924
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,866
...because you don't love
this place anymore.

925
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,037
You want more.

926
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:59,664
And you should.

927
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:04,293
You want
different summers.

928
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:08,464
- I don't blame you.
- Cadence.

929
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,384
I want you.

930
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:17,390
You said you hated
yourself for it.

931
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,308
I didn't mean it.

932
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,061
I hate myself
for a lot of things...

933
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,063
stealing from a bodega,

934
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,525
being a burden
to my mom...

935
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:31,070
being with Raquel, even though
I never stopped missing you.

936
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:40,288
I don't hate myself
for loving you.

937
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,516
