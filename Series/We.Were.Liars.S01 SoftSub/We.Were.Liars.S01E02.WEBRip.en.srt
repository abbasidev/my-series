<i>Something terrible</i>
 <i>happened last summer,</i>

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,721
 <i>and I have no memory of what,</i>
 <i>or who, hurt me.</i>

3
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,851
 <i>We live,</i>
 <i>at least in the summer,</i>

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,478
 <i>on Beechwood Island.</i>

5
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,981
 <i>Our island was a fairy tale,</i>

6
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,483
 <i>filled with kings and queens</i>
 <i>and castles.</i>

7
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:25,776
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,779
<i>On it, we could be anything.</i>

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:29,780
Tag!

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,823
You're it.

11
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,325
You seem different.

12
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,910
In a good way?

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,328
In a new way.

14
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,164
I mean, at a certain point,
are you even really married?

15
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:39,832
My marriage is just fine.

16
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:43,878
<i>So was mine,</i>

17
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,715
I imagine the divorce
must be draining, though.

18
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,633

19
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,969

I need to tell you something.

106
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,282
What's better,
a guy giving you

107
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,577
a dried beach flower

108

00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,372
This is Gat.

110
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,041
Gat sends you weird
little notes all the time.

111
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,170
Well, maybe Gat
is a guy-guy now.

112
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,215
Ugh, we had a moment.

113
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,884
I knew there was a vibe.

114
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,053
I mean,

115
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,388
I guess
I'll be happy for you

116
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:12,057
instead of despairing the fact
that the Liars dynamic

117
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,433
will be changed forever.

118
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,978
See, that's the thing,
right?

119
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,105
The other day,
I saw him writing me a letter,

120
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,358
and he put a dried beach flower
inside the envelope.

121
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,027
But then he changed his mind,
and he put a taffy in it

122
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,321
instead, which he's done
a million times before

123
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,990
in, like, a friend way.

124
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,284
So maybe that's his way
of saying that I...

125
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,703
Maybe he's just contemplating
the potential fallout.

126
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,788
As should you, Cady.

127
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,375
I will.

128
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,544

129
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,341

00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,802

131
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,971
Oh, it's not

132
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,347
while you're all heart-eyes.

133
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,432
I um...

134
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,225
You focus on Gat.

135
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,560
Get yourself alone
together and see

136
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,811

137
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,291

Right.

150
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,197
Yeah, you're a grown-up who
has somehow sexted yourself

151
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,907
into eternal virginity.

152
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,408

153
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,576
a drink at the party boat?

154
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,119
Golf bro,
looked like his name was

155
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,080
something like Shep Calloway.

156
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,040
Winchester Prescott.

157
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,625

158
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,920

160
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,382
- Hey, baby.
- Oh, my gosh, you're here.

161
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,424
- Bonbon, Liberty...
- I missed you so much.

162
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,052
Oh, I missed you tornadoes.

163
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,804
- Oh, bug.
- Oh!

164
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,555
I thought you
missed your flight.

165
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,307
Oh, I...I did,

166
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,476
so I woke up
at the crack of dawn

167
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,936
and I made the drive in.

168
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,729
Figured I'd sneak in from the
service dock and surprise you,

169
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,273
but Harris blew my cover.

170
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,528
Wow!

171
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,196
That's fantastic, little bug.

172
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,823
You drew that
water with pencils?

173
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,992
Look at how the light
dances through it.

174
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,827
I'm glad you could tear
yourself away from the office.

175
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,328
Oh, the office
will always be there.

176
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,788
Getting crushed by you
on the golf course,

177
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,248
however, is a rare treat.

178
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,667
Ah, Harris's favorite
Father's Day tradition...

179
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,294
disappearing to the club
all morning.

180
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:48,422
To give you space to prepare
your favorite tradition,

181
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,548
the feast.

182
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,091
Oh, I see.

183
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,218
Tee time, 7:00 a.m.

184
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,928
Tomorrow.

185
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,847
Hope you haven't
gotten too rusty.

186
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,849
Bring your A-game, boomer.

187
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,019
Hey, Ed, what do you say
we take the boat into town,

188
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,145
get some ice cream?

189
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,646
- Littles, Liars, you in?
- Sure, Dad!

190
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,691
- I'm in!
- Ed?

191
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,609
You in, bro?

192
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,821
Sure thing, bro.

193
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,489
I think that Gat and Cady

194
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,949
were actually planning
on staying here.

195
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:16,950
No, no, no.

196
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,328
I'm down for ice cream.

197
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,246
Yeah, same.

198
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,957
Awesome.

199

00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,934
and you swear to not tell
a single soul?

205
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,728
Yeah.

206
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,147
OK.

207
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,900
I saw my mom last night
having sex with Salty Dan.

208
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,234
Oh, fuck.

209
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,944
Wait, like,
the harbor service guy?

210
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,571
Yeah, the delivery pirate.

211
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,698
He had her all pressed up
on the boathouse.

212
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,991
Their legs were just going...

213
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,785
you know, there's one there...

214
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,912
Ugh! Ugh, gross.
Sorry.

215
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,456
Enough detail about Aunt Bess
getting railed, please.

216
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,666
Yeah, well,
I can't eat and I can't sleep.

217
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,712
I'm gonna develop a weird
sex complex, obviously, so...

218
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,300
I'm gonna have to
tell my dad.

219
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,969
I mean, I don't know,
maybe talk to your mom first.

220
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,180
There could be a reasonable
explanation, right?

221
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,767
Like what, fish boy is on my
parents' celeb hall pass list?

222
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,269
Look, there's no excuse
for cheating.

223
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,897
Ever.

224
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,690
We're supposed to
have values...

225
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,859
honor, dignity.

226
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,778
Wait, did your dad...

227
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,988
I don't want
to talk about it.

228
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,281
You guys ready to head home?

229
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,282
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,617
Let's do it.

231
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,703
Do you guys want to go
to the bookstore?

232
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,747
We could leave the, uh,
boat taxi for you guys

233
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,666
to take later.

234
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,251
Uh, if Gat wants to.

235
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,421
No, I just--I'm gonna wait
for the Fourth of July sale.

236
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,923
Yeah, we can go back
to Beechwood.

237

243
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,231
I thought we were gonna go
sit on the beach

244
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,066
and have real adult
conversations.

245
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,401
I mean, we're almost
done here, Bess.

246
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,694
Please?

247
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,070
I have mimosas.

248
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,572
Ooh, I'd love one.
Thank you.

249
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,573
No OJ.

250
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,033
Well, waft it over here.

251
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,327
I will enjoy it vicariously.

252
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,204
Yes, because enjoying things
through your nose

253
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,373
always ended very well for you.

254
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,501
Why are you so on edge, Care?

255
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,836
Children.

256
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:33,879
Boyfriend.

257
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,963
Parents.

258
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,048
Fair.

259
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,049
Must be really hard
for you both,

260
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,050
not being
the favorite daughter.

261
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,260
Oh, we'll see about that.

262
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,472
My Father's Day gift
is excellent this year.

263
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,849
That's just Penny
for expensive.

264
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,976
Don't you have
a divorce to pay for?

265
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,186
Meh.

266
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,687
Well, I went sentimental
with mine.

267
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,564
- Mm.
- Ever the suck-up.

268
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,566
This year, I just want him
to see that Ed and I

269
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,151
have our shit together.

270
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,944
It's a little late
for boyfriend approval,

271
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:58,987
don't you think?

272
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,406
Oh, my God.

273
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,116
Unless you're about
to ask him to pay

274
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,118
for some big Indian wedding.

275
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,661
Oh, Carrie.

276
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,580
Focus.

277
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,832
Tomorrow night,

278
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,918
we gauge his reactions
to the gifts,

279
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,213
and then we meet
and convene post-feast

280
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,756
and crown the winning daughter.

281
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,090
And what am I going to win?

282
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,010
The winner can wear
my black pearl necklace

283
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,471
to the end-of-summer gala.

284
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,097
Wow.

285
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,016
Mom, um, competing
for parental love

286
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,601
has lasting consequences
on children.

287
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,977
Did you know that?

288
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,979
Well, when your dad
is happy,

289
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,523
we are all happy.

290
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,608
May the best woman win.

291
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,492
Dude, I'm telling you,
you gotta sit back

292
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,660
and let your money make money.

293
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,161
How much are we talking?

294
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,955
I mean,
I didn't win the Powerball.

295
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,874
But, you know, I want to
give Carrie some security

296
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,377
without Sinclair strings
attached.

297
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,587
Maybe put a dent
in Gat's college tuition.

298
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,966
Yeah. Yeah.

299
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,301
You know, on second thought,
I think it's best

300
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,427
if I refer you to someone

301
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,929
a little more small-time.

302
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,722
My firm prefers a little more
zeros and commas

303
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,641
than you're working with.

304
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,609
Hey. I got you.

305
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,037
Thanks.

306
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,561
13 points?

307
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,771
Unfortunately, it
doesn't...that does not count.

308
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,064
What about that
doesn't count?

309
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,816
What do you mean?
Mirren, tell him.

310
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,026
That's not...

311
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,194
OK, Gat is a
cheater.

312
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,571
Oh, real mature, Johnny.

313
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,655
You guys are so...oh, my God!

314
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,906
Ow!

315
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,325
OK, OK, OK!
Off the...oh my God.

316
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,659
OK, OK, OK.

317
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,952
- Idiots!
- OK.

318
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,203
What's the point of this?

319
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,913
You're gonna ruin the game.

320
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,206
- What?
- What are you doing?

321
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,208
Stop, bitch! Oh!

322
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,877
- Oh, no, Gat.
- Come on.

323
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,880
Serious?
You guys, come on.

324
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,840
Cadence.

325
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,258
Hi.

326
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,426
Shit.

327
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,470
Oh, my God.

328
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,555
- Oh, Cady.
- Hey.

329
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,265
Thank God you're here.

330
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,892
All that testosterone
in there was seriously

331
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,685
- starting to poison my soul.
- OK.

332
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,062
Cady,
you got to settle this,

333
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,022
because we're playing dirty
word Scrabble and Gat says

334
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,607
that "douche" doesn't count.

335
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,317
It means water.

336
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,653
- So go to New Clairmont and
tell Harris that you're parched

337
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,154
and you need a cold glass
of douche.

338
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,238
You're not gonna do it.

339
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,622
I know I look terrible.

340
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,207
Gat still thinks you're hot.

341
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,918
Careful, bro, those old-ass
shorts do not hide a boner.

342
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,503
OK, Johnny, shut the fuck up.

343
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,338
Cady, you don't...

344
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,798
you don't look terrible.

345
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,383
Yeah, I like your haircut.

346
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,427
It's very
Saint Laurent circa Y2K.

347
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,720
Yours is cool too.

348
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,055
Oh, thank you.

349
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,848
It's symbolic.

350
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,350
Lobster roll?

351
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,103
Since when do the moms
let us skip family meals?

352
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,689
- Oh, I'm not hanging around
that cold new house.

353
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,108
Those people will be
fine without me.

354
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,860
You're so skinny.

355
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,655
Have the moms asked you
for any diet tips yet?

356
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,115
Right.

357
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,408
Traumatic brain injury,

358
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,035
the next big fitness fad.

359
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,537
Don't joke.

360
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,373
We really were scared.

361
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,541
You were?

362
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,126
Cady, of course we were.

363
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,713
All year long, you didn't
come to the hospital or call.

364
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,048
I thought you were mad at me,

365
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,426
but I can't remember
what I did wrong.

366
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,220
My mom just thought
you needed space, so...

367
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,180
and I got this new boyfriend.

368
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,224
I got really distracted
by all the intercourse.

369
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,517
My call went to voicemail.

370
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,893
Sorry, I don't do voicemail.

371
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,353
I'm not a psychopath.

372
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,528
Yeah, my parents,
um, they took my phone.

373
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,447
The screens make
my migraines worse.

374
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,658
Well, you're safe here
in the land of no Wi-Fi.

375
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,536
Shall we start a new game?

376
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,954
How bad is it?

377
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,749
I mean, the amnesia and just...

378
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,250
I mean, just everything.

379
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,419
Some of my memories
are coming back, but...

380
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,422
like, I went down to
Taft Beach last night

381
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,257
to try to remember
the night of the accident,

382
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,593
but I just couldn't.

383
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,178
Maybe your brain
did you a favor

384
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,680
deleting that particular file.

385
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,807
Guys, just stop, OK?

386
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,018
I can handle it.

387
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,436
Was I swimming?

388
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,937
What, did I...did I fall?

389
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,648
We weren't there.

390
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,485
None of us were.

391
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,111
Why?

392
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,280
Why was I all alone?

393
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,740
We don't know.

394
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,534
None of us know why
you wound up in the water.

395
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,119
Cadence!

396
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,748
I'm fine, Mom.

397
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,874
Relax.

398
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,375
Hey, nice hat, Aunt Pen.

399
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,711
Harris is up at
the New Clairmont patio.

400
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,712
Go and say hello, Cady.

401
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,797
I will later.

402
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,048
No, you slept in.

403
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,966
Your cousins have already
visited with him today.

404
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,343
Oh, my God.

405
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,971
All right, I'm coming.

406
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,227
Hey, Cadence.

407
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,734
We just thought
you needed some time.

408
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,616
We're really sorry.

409
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,666
"Douche" counts.

410
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,544
If you wouldn't say it to
Tipper, it's a dirty word.

411
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,087
Thank you!

412
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,964
But you spelled it wrong,
Johnny.

413
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,549
- What?
- No points.

414
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,133
You did!

415
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,429
You spelled it with an O.
It's D-O-U.

416
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,390
Pathetic. I quit.

417
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,558
This game sucks.

418
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,101
Oh, you're such
a sore loser, dude.

419
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,602
Because you...

420
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,440
So Gat had two
perfect opportunities

421
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,067
for you guys
to be alone together,

422
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,402
and he blew them off.

423
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,946
I wish I could just
ask him what he thinks.

424
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:18,324
But sometimes moments are
just fleeting, you know?

425
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,451
At least you know now.

426
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,911
You can be cool.

427
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:25,540
You can just go back
to being normal.

428
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,001
Pretend nothing ever happened.

429
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,961
Right,
but he's not acting normal.

430
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,754
That's the problem.

431
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,298
What up?

432
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,009
Hey, you guys want
to play Scrabble?

433
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,136
- Yes.
- Can we do it stoned?

434
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,304
How was the water?

435
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,640
Oh, see, Johnny can
kick my ass in tennis,

436
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,683
but not in a swim race.

437
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,684
Whatever, dude.

438
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,644
My shorts got more drag.

439
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,730
- Ew.
- Ew. Stop, Johnny.

440
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,523
- That is gross.
- So gross.

441
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,067
Here, I got the good shit.

442
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,277
Hey.

443
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,487
Oh, hey, is that next
on your reading list?

444
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,947
This one?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

445
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,699
I finished that
Andrew Jackson biography.

446
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,367
It was actually
really interesting.

447
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,619
Oh, here we go.

448
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,287
If you skip
the Trail of Tears lecture,

449
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,496
I'll give you five
Andrew Jacksons.

450
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,706
Dude, you gotta admit,
it's fucked up

451
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,999
he's still on our money.

452
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,709
Besides, don't you guys
ever think about, like,

453
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,294
who was on this island
before Harris?

454
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,921
Harris's dad?

455
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,505
All I'm saying is
that there should be limits

456
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,715
to what one person can own.
That's it.

457
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,842
Can you just shut up?
Can we just play?

458
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,093
Shut up forever.

459
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,720
Shut up and Scrabble,
seriously.

460
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,018
You know what, guys?
My...my letters suck.

461
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,187
I forfeit.
I'm gonna go find a new book.

462
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,438
Wait, Gat.

463
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,982
Seriously, let him go, OK?

464
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,400
Ever since he got back
from India,

465
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,820
he's been obsessed with
the evils of colonization.

466
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,197
I'm over it.

467
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,580
So the appraisal
authentication,

468
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,332
and the original
bill of sale

469
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,085
from when my family
acquired it in 1949.

470
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,420
Mm.

471
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,255
Thatcher,

472
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,256
hello.

473
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,967
Are you staying for dinner?

474
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,134
Uh, no.

475
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,262
No, my, uh...my boat's waiting.

476
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,514
I'll arrange for transport
for next week.

477
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:05,640
Mm-hmm.

478
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,892
My Sotheby's guy
will be ecstatic.

479
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,227
Thank you.

480
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,859
You're selling the Thornton?

481
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,820
Well, your dad hates it.

482
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,030
Only because
your dad loved it.

483
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,908
I'm replacing it
with a Britteridge

484
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,326
Harris has been on about,

485
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,744
a Father's Day gift.

486
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,080
Well, you should
have had Ed sell it.

487
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,707
He's kind of killing it.

488
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,333
Did Carrie tell you he's
curating Spike Lee's vineyard

489
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,376
collection this summer?

490
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,711
Hmm.

491
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,755
Thatcher will be, um,

492
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,215
more discreet.

493
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:43,803
I don't intend to discuss

494
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,930
the sale with your father.

495
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,849
It's none of his concern.

496
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,642
The Thornton is a...

497
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,477
it's a Taft heirloom,

498
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,563
not a Sinclair asset.

499
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,149
So you're putting
the funds from the sale

500
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,527
into a separate account and
buying the new piece for Dad

501
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,654
with Dad's money?

502
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,868
I am not some 1950s
housewife, Penny,

503
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,746
who's collecting an allowance
from her husband

504
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,706
to get her hair done.

505
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:15,710
I am selling
my favorite piece

506
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,795
to alleviate
your cash flow issues.

507
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,798
So don't give me that face.

508
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,723
Sorry. I'm sorry.

509
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,017
I didn't mean that tone.

510
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,520
I was up very late with Lydia
planning the feast,

511
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,813
and I'm just...

512
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,148
I'm so tired.

513
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,609
When I asked for your help,

514
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,027
I thought you would
write a check,

515
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,946
not pull off an art heist.

516
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,239
Look, I...

517
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:49,202
I didn't pry into why
your divorce is so messy

518
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:53,247
because, well,
I have always believed

519
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,958
that women are entitled
to our secrets.

520
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,422
But your father is also
entitled to his peace of mind,

521
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,801
and if he sees such
a big transaction,

522
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,303
he won't settle
for your vague answers.

523
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,601
Go fetch.

524
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,894
Go get it.

525
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,438
Go get it, go get it,
go get it.

526
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,232
Beautiful day.

527
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,485
No garish party boat to
interrupt your tranquility.

528
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:23,986
Oh.

529
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,863
I suppose I didn't notice.

530
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,324
Right. Um...

531
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:32,703
uh, Harris, I, uh,
wanted to talk to you.

532
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,997
You know, Carrie and I have
been together for a decade,

533
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,918
and out of utmost respect,
I'm here to ask...

534
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,254
Carrie thinks it's outdated
to ask a man

535
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,089
for his daughter's hand
in marriage.

536
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,967
Antiquated, she says.

537
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:49,220
Yeah, but you
value tradition, so...

538
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,471
Mm-hmm.

539
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,306
Well, per Roman tradition,

540
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,100
the suitor would offer
the father

541
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,102
a symbolic gold coin
for his blessing.

542
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,271
That's what Brody did.

543
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,064
I thought it was a nice touch.

544
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,316
Hmm.

545
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,693
- I'm kidding.
- Oh.

546
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,069
Right.

547
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,529
Yeah.

548
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,532
You know, I suppose you're an
improvement over her eloping

549
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,659
with a junkie who would
ultimately abandon her

550
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,162
with two kids
and terrible credit.

551
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,497
Oh, you suppose?

552
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,916
No, I'm just wondering...

553
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,880
Why now?

554
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,756
You seem content

555
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,383
without making it official.

556
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,219
Yeah, I mean...

557
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,471
yeah, my parents
are traditional too,

558
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,141
and they have opinions about
kids out of wedlock.

559
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,602
We want to add to our family.

560
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:40,855
Hurry up.

561
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,150
Sit.

562
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,318
Salute.

563
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,612
Good boy, Franklin.

564
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:51,532
Yeah, most people, they slack
off with their training.

565
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:55,786
It's important to never
let a dog forget his place,

566
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,496
think he's a person.

567
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,998
Diligence is key.

568
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:03,002
A little positive
reinforcement works, too.

569
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,467
What did I miss?

570
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,677
Well,

571
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:15,431
darling,

572
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:19,227
I was just welcoming
this young man to the family.

573
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:23,356
Oh, Ed, congratulations!

574
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,150
I have something for you...
my mother's wedding ring.

575
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,820
Well, I ought to clean up
my old golf clubs for Brody.

576
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,198
Oh, don't mind him.

577
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,453
Hey.

578
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,040
I don't tell you to shut up.

579
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,625
I would never say that to you.

580
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,252
I know.

581
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:46,629
I just...

582
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,589
I don't know

583
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:52,343
how to be you and me,
ever since...

584
00:25:55,513 --> 00:26:00,101
I was just trying
to act normal, and I...

585
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,603
I said something
that I didn't mean.

586
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,313
Can I?

587
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:09,819
But I do not

588
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:12,571
want you to shut up.

589
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,156
Maybe I should.

590
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,118
Look, I know I...

591
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,828
I know I've been annoying.

592
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,413
You...you said
I was acting different.

593
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,455
You're right.

594
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,292
I feel different.

595
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,794
I like that you're different.

596
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:31,048
I like that you care
so much

597
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:34,051
about the things
we don't understand.

598
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,639
We don't really
want you to shut up.

599
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,933
When we say that,

600
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,477
we just mean we love you.

601
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:54,238
We should go downstairs,
I think.

602
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,489
Cady.

603
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,787
Shut up.

604
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:07,460
<i>♪ I feel I've known</i>
 <i>you all my life ♪</i>

605
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:15,593
 <i>♪ I just hope we don't</i>
 <i>run out of time ♪</i>

606
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:23,225
<i>♪ The one constant you ♪</i>

607
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:38,699
I'm interrupting.

608
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,659
No, no, no, no, no, sir.

609
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,954
Yes, I most certainly am.

610
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,539
Uh, we're just looking at...

611
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,375
Books.

612
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:52,088
Have you read
"First Base and Beyond"?

613
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,132
Uh...

614
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,134
Ah.

615
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,011
Ooh.

616
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,930
Well, you...
you might like this.

617
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,395
Thank you.

618
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:11,774
Watch yourself, young man.

619
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,067
Pardon me?

620
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,443
Your head.

621
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,986
Watch yourself

622
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,363
or you could get hurt.

623
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,371
Mm.

624
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,521
There you are.

625
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,232
Do you remember summer '11?

626
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:57,027
We played Tipper's favorite
record so much we warped it.

627
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,487
Sounded all messed up.

628
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,947
Yeah, "Tapestry."

629
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,782
Mm-hmm.

630
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,743
I'm scared memories
are like that.

631
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:10,124
Like, if you play one favorite
memory too many times,

632
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:12,501
you might warp it.

633
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,545
Change it.

634
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,881
What's your favorite memory?

635
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,966
All year,

636
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,802
the last thing I remembered
from summer '16

637
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:26,182
was you kissing me
on the beach.

638
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:30,478
I kept going back to it every
time I was scared or sick.

639
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,482
But maybe I warped it.

640
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,275
You know, maybe I'm wrong

641
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,778
about how perfect it felt.

642
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,239
Maybe it was just a kiss.

643
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,365
It wasn't.

644
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:48,287
It...it was perfect.

645
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,206
Then why didn't you call?

646
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,003
All year,
I thought you hated me.

647
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,255
And you were so hot
and cold last summer,

648
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,924
I thought I must have
done something

649
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,801
so unforgivable
the night of the accident

650
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,011
that you wouldn't have...

651
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:07,181
We're not allowed
to talk about summer '16.

652
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,307
What?

653
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,600
All right, listen.

654
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,685
Penny gathered
everybody up for this...

655
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:12,811
this big meeting today...

656
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,271
Whoa, whoa.

657
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:18,192
Since when do any of you
obey the moms' rules?

658
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,610
Listen, she said
it could trigger

659
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,072
your...your migraines so bad
that you spend days in bed.

660
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:26,325
Look, we...
we all decided that...

661
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,869
You all decided?

662
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,037
Jesus, Gat.

663
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,497
Listen to me, please.

664
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,915
You have to let it go.

665
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,543
Can we please just be here,
me and you?

666
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,169
Please?

667
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,467
I'm so tired.

668
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,552
I'm gonna go.

669
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,428
Cady, please.

670
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,683
You know what, maybe you're
the unforgivable one.

671
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:54,812
Maybe I don't forgive you
for bailing on me all year,

672
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:57,898
and then looking at me like
you are, and touching me...

673
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,900
That night fucked me up
as well, all right?

674
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,779
That's...that's why I can't
fucking talk about it.

675
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:09,118
Look.

676
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,331
That kiss,
that kiss on the beach,

677
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,708
that was my favorite
memory, too.

678
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,126
It really was.

679
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:20,879
I'm telling you, Cady,
I am telling you,

680
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,090
nothing else matters.

681
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,351
Don't you trust me?

682
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:38,897
I don't remember.

683
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,374
- That was bad.
- That was fine.

684
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,834
- You think it's fine?
- You think it's bad?

685
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,044
He gave you a book.

686
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:02,296
He gave me
"Wuthering Heights."

687
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:03,881
There you are.

688
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:06,508
Triple-decker s'mores, anyone?

689
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,968
Hey.

690
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,387
What's up?

691
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,722
Nothing.

692
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,016
We were just, uh,
talking about tomorrow.

693
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,727
You know,
my dad and I used to go

694
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,896
to the museum before
the Father's Day feast,

695
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,898
but, well...

696
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:23,651
Hey, let's do something
awesome, then, all right?

697
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:24,985
Mm-hmm.

698
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:28,489
Like, replace all Harris's
gifts with glitter bombs.

699
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:29,823
That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

700
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,284
Or, or, or...you know
those foam parties in Ibiza?

701
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,619
Mm.

702
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,537
If we could get
into the sprinkler system

703
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,331
and load it with
industrial-strength soap,

704
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,458
- then we...
- Get the gardener fired.

705
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,043
I mean...

706
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,212
Oh, my God, Gat.

707
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:45,005
Dude, you used to be fun.

708
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,423
Johnny, just lay off him.

709
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,841
Look, not everyone has...
has a private island to ruin,

710
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,051
all right?

711
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,511
You'll contaminate
the irrigation,

712
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:51,720
- wreck the ecosystem, and...
- OK, Gat.

713
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,305
- What, what?
- We get it, bro, we get it.

714
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,432
Like, we're roasting
marshmallows on stolen land.

715
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,433
Johnny.

716
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,976
What...what should I do?

717
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,395
Do you want me to tell
Harris to return

718
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,063
Beechwood to the Wampanoag?

719
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,815
Do you want me to hurl my
emergency Amex into the sea?

720
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,650
Fine, Gat, fine.

721
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,487
You know, of course
I won't be able to take

722
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,988
you to all those Knicks games.

723
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,909
You love those games, right?

724
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,494
But you never ask
about the ticket prices.

725
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,913
You're being an asshole,
all right?

726
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:18,956
Yeah.

727
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,290
Yeah, I am an asshole.

728
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,583
I was born this way, bro.

729
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,043
It's a fucking
congenital privilege.

730
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,128
I've embraced it.

731
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,671
And guess what, dude?

732
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,381
It's better than being the
type of asshole who pretends

733
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,133
to be all holier
than everybody

734
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:31,635
when they're actually
the fucking asshole.

735
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,095
Be fucking real, dude.

736
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:35,305
Do you think you haven't
caused destruction this summer?

737
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,766
Do you think that you aren't
wrecking a perfectly good

738
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,435
- ecosystem, right fucking now?
- What are you saying?

739
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,145
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

740
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:42,229
Really?

741
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,689
Stop!

742
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:44,773
- You want to fucking go, dude?
- Don't fucking touch me!

743
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:45,607
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

744
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,817
Hey, walk it off. Go.

745
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,652
You're such
a fucking hypocrite.

746
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,987
What the heck?

747
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,657
You all right?

748
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,757
You're up early.

749
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,341
Yeah, couldn't sleep.

750
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,384
Yeah, same.

751
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,136
Came to find coffee.

752
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,179
Do you...

753
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,597
Uh, what happened last night?

754
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,557
You and Johnny,
you're just, like,

755
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,225
not getting along all
of a sudden.

756
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,604
I don't...things are
different this summer.

757
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,022
Yeah, I get that.

758
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,982
But why was he calling
you a hypocrite?

759
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,902
I think...

760
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:34,114
he feels like
I'm making some bad choices.

761
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,574
Like what?

762
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,326
Like me?

763
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,578
OK, well, then he can
mind his own business.

764
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,621
He's just being
protective of you.

765
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,039
That's it.

766
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,500
Well, the one person I don't
need protecting from is you.

767
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,254
Right?

768
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,881
Yeah.

769
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,759
I should go get dressed.

770
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,512
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

771
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:59,139
Just tell me, why didn't...

772
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:02,059
why didn't you give me
the beach flower?

773
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,352
The what?

774
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:07,272
You wrote me a letter,
like you always do.

775
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:11,610
And I saw you

776
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:16,114
put a flower inside of it,
but then...

777
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,491
Oh.

778
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,326
What, did you think
it was too much?

779
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,332
Yeah.

780
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,084
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

781
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,210
Yeah, too much.

782
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,755
I mean, we just
made out, right?

783
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,382
Yeah.

784
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,718
Totally.

785
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:47,604
I have to go get ready
for the feast.

786
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,900
I hate Father's Day.

787
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,111
Happy Father's Day.

788
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,824
Oh.

789
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,242
Oh!

790
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,996
Would you look at that?

791
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,040
- The Britteridge.
- Mm-hmm.

792
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,250
How did you know?

793
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,545
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

794
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:14,172
It makes the room feel much
more grand, don't you think?

795
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,215
Mm.

796
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,425
Yeah, you were right.

797
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:17,885
It's...it's much better.

798
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,469
Yeah.

799
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,804
Don't tell me you want
to display that Thornton

800
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,222
in the Boston house.

801
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,473
No.

802
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,850
No, no.

803
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,854
That is...is just
going away to storage.

804
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:32,149
It's gonna be a problem
for the next generation.

805
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,775
Thank you.

806
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,152
Of course.

807
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:38,989
I do love
when you wear these.

808
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,658
I know you do.

809
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:42,784
Well.

810
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,453
Shall we, my liege?

811
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:45,454
Oh.

812
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,249
If you insist, my lady.

813
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,792
Oh.

814
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,254
- Yeah.
- Mm.

815
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,089
Oh.

816
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,758
My queen.

817
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:58,884
Ready?

818
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:01,720
Man of the hour!

819
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,521
All hail the king!

820
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,775
No, this fanfare is absurd.

821
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,902
It's just...it's ridiculous.

822
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,904
You girls, you're all grown.

823
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,114
- Dad.
- It's tradition!

824
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,908
Oh, tradition,
all right, all right.

825
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,370
- Oh, yes.
- Your cape, Granddad.

826
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,537
The cape, the cape.

827
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,289
Yeah.

828
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,499
- You little traitor.
- Sorry, Granddad.

829
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:33,669
- Here you go.
- Aw.

830
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,130
- Yeah!
- Speech!

831
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,508
- Speech!
- Speech!

832
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:42,260
All right. All right.

833
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,931
My loyal subjects...

834
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,352
I thank you for another
wonderful gathering

835
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:53,647
to celebrate a bountiful summer
in the land of milk and honey.

836
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:54,940
Hear, hear!

837
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,525
Cady, about earlier...

838
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,276
As I look upon
the generations,

839
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:02,197
I'm reminded of a father's
most noble duty...

840
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,907
to produce a son.

841
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,826
- Oops.
- Oh.

842
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:08,495
And if that fails,
to see to his daughters'

843
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,497
every outlandish whim,

844
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:13,250
even if it means wearing
a gingham tablecloth

845
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,585
decade after decade.

846
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,838
But, as always, I command you,

847
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,756
bow to Queen Tipper...

848
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,425
Oh, stop.

849
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,093
Without whom
I would most certainly be

850
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,554
a malevolent ruler
with blighted crops

851
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:26,805
and a castle of ice.

852
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,015
- No.
- He wouldn't.

853
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:30,767
And now we feast.

867
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,363
I wanted to tell you.

868
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,657
Actually, I wanted him
to tell you.

869
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,242
Who's Raquel?

870
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,786
She sucks.
She's a total trash goblin.

871
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,454
Don't lie.

872
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,623
Fine.

873
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,333
Uh, I don't know.

874
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,668
She's just a girl.

875
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:21,920
And we went to a Knicks game.

876
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,296
She was cool, I guess.

877
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,840
She had, like, three hot dogs.

878
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,551
Who are we talking about?

879
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:31,388
Uh, Gat's girlfriend.

880
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:41,022
I'm really sorry, Cady.

881
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,192
Not a big deal.

882
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,279
His behavior makes
complete sense now.

883
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,199
It's fine.

884
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,752
I'm sorry.

885
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,880
Earlier, I was a jerk
this morning.

886
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,214
- You're good.
- No, I'm not.

887
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,091
Look, I don't like this.
We haven't talked all feast.

888
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,176
Really?

889
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:16,474
Is there something important
you forgot to tell me?

890
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,196
Presents!
Time for presents!

891
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:30,697
The time has come!

892
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:31,907
Get this party started.

893
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,327
- It's time!
- Girls, come on in.

894
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,494
Come on, everyone.

895
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,371
- To the king!
- Come on.

896
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:39,456
Where are you sitting?

897
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,291
Hey, guys.

898
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,835
Come on, come on, let's go.

899
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,128
In your seats, everyone.

900
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,507
Hear ye, hear ye.

901
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:54,471
May I present your youngest
heir, Princess Bess.

902
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:57,057
Oh, Princess Bess.

903
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,850
Let's see what you have.

904
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,437
My king, I offer you...

905
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,647
Mm-hmm.

906
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,524
...a gift of memory.

907
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,735
Ooh, OK.

908
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,488
All right.

909
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,031
- What is it, Dad?
- Oh, my...

910
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,741
It's all of our home videos,

911
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,285
digitized and optimized.

912
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,912
Greatest hits of the '90s,

913
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,581
rescued from the VHS graveyard.

914
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,792
Oh, fantastic.

915
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,418
Look at that.

916
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,420
And now, Princess Penny,

917
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,130
what do you have to offer?

918
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,590
It is the gift
of practicality.

919
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,967
All the bells and whistles.

920
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:35,345
- It'll catch the fish for you.
- Oh, my God.

921
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:38,890
And finally, Princess Carrie.

922
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,350
The gift of majesty.

923
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,519
Ooh.
Would you look at that?

924
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:45,522
The Sinclair family crest!

925
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:46,815
Oh, thank you, honey.

926
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:48,024
Beautiful, honey.

927
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,360
Oh, that...
look at that.

928
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,528
Oh, it's wonderful.

929
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:52,529
It's a wonderful thing.

930
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,030
- Oh.
- Yeah.

931
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,657
Happy Father's Day, Dad.

932
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,534
- Thank you.
- Happy Father's Day.

933
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:59,536
- Happy Father's Day.
- It is a happy Father's Day.

934
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,037
You've all done
a wonderful job, thank you.

935
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,580
All my children.

936
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,752
I'm sure today must have
been difficult for you,

937
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,587
what with Sam not here and all,

938
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,172
but I find the best way
to feel better

939
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,675
is to appear perfectly fine.

940
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:16,428
So you go take a moment,

941
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:19,848
and then chin up
and shoulders back.

942
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:22,434
<i>♪ I think about you ♪</i>

943
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,060

948
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,385
Sorry.

949
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,679
I...I wanted to
tell you about her.

950
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,389
So tell me now.

951
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,060
Who is she?

952
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,479
Look, I met her in India, OK?

953
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,522
But it turns out that
she lives a train stop

954
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,815
away from me in Brooklyn.

955
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,651
And our moms
were friends, and...

956
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:15,987
I like her a lot.

957
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,449
She gets me.

958
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,326
Well, I don't.

959
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,328
I thought I knew you.

960
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:27,499
But the Gat that
I knew, my Gat,

961
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:30,710
he would never kiss me
while he had a girlfriend.

962
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,338
He wouldn't keep us
both secret.

963
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,090
Maybe you don't
know me, then, Cady.

964
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,466
You've never met my mom.

965
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,176
You've never seen my room
over the air shaft.

966
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,178
You only know me here,
Cady, OK?

967
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:43,223
OK, you're...you're like
this royal family.

968
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:45,475
I mean, everyone is rich
and white except for me,

969
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,851
Ed, and the staff.

970
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,853
None of that matters to us.

971
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,605
It matters to me.

972
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,360
It matters to me because
you don't see any of it.

973
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,278
You don't.

974
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,613
How when you eat
Harris's dessert,

975
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,615
Lydia gets chewed off for not
serving what he asked.

976
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:01,908
How...how messing
with the sprinklers

977
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,410
- gets Paolo in trouble.
- Paolo?

978
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,702
The groundskeeper.

979
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,121
That's Henry.

980
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:08,289
Oh, my God.

981
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:14,212
Henry got fired last year.

982
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,674
He got blamed when our dance
party wrecked the tennis court.

983
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:19,300
You didn't know, right?

984
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,761
I didn't. I'm sorry.

985
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,972
You guys never say
thank you when they serve you.

986
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,849
You don't pick up
after yourselves.

987
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:27,934
Why would you care to ask the
guy mowing the lawn his name?

988
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:34,482
I have waited so long
for you to see me.

989
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,651
The truth is,
people like me just

990
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,278
exist in the
background of the story

991
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,029
you tell about yourselves.

992
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,156
That's it.

993
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:43,867
That is bullshit, Gat.

994
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:45,410
You're my best friend.

995
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,288
I have been in love with you
since we were 12.

996
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,833
You never saw.

997
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:57,797
And then out of nowhere,
you're...you're finally here,

998
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,466
looking back at me.

999
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:01,718
So forgive me for not wanting
to blow up my fucking life

1000
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:03,261
just because you were
in the mood to hook up.

1001
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,304
I'm sorry, all right?

1002
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:05,555
That is not true.

1003
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:07,474
Stop saying that.

1004
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:09,976
You're the one
who kissed me, Gat.

1005
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,019
Twice!

1006
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:12,562
I wish I never did.

1007
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:18,651
I hate myself for it, OK?

1008
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:27,285
Cady, I didn't mean...

1009
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,120
I'm sorry.

1031
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:50,952

I was thinking maybe

1032
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:53,037
I should hold on
to your medication

1033
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:57,041
just so that I can,
you know, monitor better.

1034
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:02,463
Did I try to kill myself
that night in the water?

1035
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,756
What?

1036
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,633
Is that why
you're telling everyone

1037
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,093
not to talk about it
with me?

1038
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,803
Because you're scared
I'll do it again?

1039
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,388
You didn't try
to hurt yourself.

1040
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,348
Then why?

1041
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,391
Why?

1042
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,642
- Oh.
- Why?

1043
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,728
Why did you forbid everyone
from talking to me

1044
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:18,229
about my own fucking life?

1045
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,023
Cadence,
Sinclairs don't yell.

1046
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,275
We don't yell,
we don't curse,

1047
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:25,111
we don't air our problems
in mixed company.

1048
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:29,365
I've lived my entire life
by your dumb Sinclairian rules,

1049
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,909
and they're not
working anymore, Mom.

1050
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,453
They work if you follow them.

1051
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:35,204
What?

1052
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,706
Why are you doing this to me?

1053
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,876
I am doing my fucking best.

1054
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:44,005
I spent 17 nights
in that hospital chair.

1055
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,299
I took you to every
neurologist in New England.

1056
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:48,092
When you couldn't
handle school,

1057
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,803
I relearned fucking calculus
so you wouldn't fall behind.

1058
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,306
I cleaned up your vomit,
I lay awake listening

1059
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:56,184
to your nightmares, and I
brought you back to this place.

1060
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:09,030
The doctors said it was best
not to overwhelm you.

1061
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:13,451
They said it was best
if you remember on your own,

1062
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:16,204
that it is best
to manage your pain.

1063
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:18,247
So that is what I am doing.

1064
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,958
I am doing my best.

1065
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:28,716
Post-traumatic amnesia
is caused

1066
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,635
by brain injury

1067
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:33,763
or a disturbing event...

1068
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:36,349
an attack, an assault.

1069
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,559
Mom, did somebody hurt me?

1070
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,687
Just take a deep breath
and calm down.

1071
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:47,276
Right.

1072
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,570
Chin up,

1073
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,489
shoulders back.

1074
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,514
Don't let it
ruin your summer.

1075
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,686
He's just a guy.

1076
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,396
Cady.

1077
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,608
I don't know
if I'm a good person.

1078
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,946
Me neither.

1079
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,824
I'm winging it.

1080
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,993
Hey, you want to steal a bottle
of something from the moms,

1081
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:38,494
get drunk at the
lighthouse, and talk shit

1082
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,330
about Gat and his
useless motorcycle license?

1083
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:43,708
Yeah?

1084
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,253
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1085
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,507
Molting?

1086
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,926
Is that the word
you're looking for?

1087
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,846
- Oh, God.
- But, like, in a cute way.

1088
00:50:56,846 --> 00:51:00,141
How come we never have
Mother's Day on Beechwood?

1089
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:05,855
Because all I want on my
special day is some peace...

1090
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,191
And quiet.

1091
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:10,485
Precisely.

1092
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:14,781
Oh,
and here I am having it,

1093
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:17,742
with my three favorite women
in the world.

1094
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,119
Well, he loved it.
You outdid yourself.

1095
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,663
Oh, but don't think
that we don't know

1096
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,916
that you paid the Littles
a silver dollar each

1097
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:25,833
to go along with that bit.

1098
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,919
Shh, shh, shh.

1099
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:31,714
The queen's secrets are key
to all family rituals.

1100
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,716
It's very delicate.

1101
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:35,885
You'll see someday.

1102
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:37,178
All right.

1103
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:38,721
What was the verdict?

1104
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:41,516
Which of us was tonight's
favorite daughter?

1105
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:47,146
Let's be real,
we don't stand a chance.

Yeah, Bess, what are we doing?

1127
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:57,758
Mom, it's time to wake up.

1128
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,302
Mom.

1129
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,721
