1
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:09,927
<i>Something terrible</i>
 <i>happened last summer.</i>

2
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,971
You didn't come to
the hospital or call.

3
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,223
Why did you forbid
everyone from talking to me

4
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,142
about my own fucking life?

5
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:18,728
You are doing this
to yourself, Cady.

6
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:21,313
 <i>It is your own broken brain</i>

7
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,607
 <i>that is the enemy</i>
 <i>you are raging against.</i>

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,280
You're leaving?

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,323
Don't open it until your
birthday next week, OK?

10
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,451
You know, I thought
you might just reinstate

11
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,453
 <i>the no-boyfriends-on-Beechwood</i>
 <i>rule.</i>

12
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:36,746
Cadence will be just fine.

13
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:37,872
<i>You never liked them, did you?</i>

14
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:38,956
 <i>Gat and Ed.</i>

15
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,624
Are you saying I'm racist?

16
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,335
Watch yourself,
or you could get hurt.

17
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,589
I believe in who we are,
who we have been for centuries.

18
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,215
<i>He's too far gone.</i>

19
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,717
Look, he's been
revising his will.

20
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,385
 <i>I think he plans</i>
 <i>to leave all of it</i>

21
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,221
 <i>to one favored daughter</i>
 <i>or grandchild.</i>

22
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,474
What if we made
a mess so big,

23
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:58,476
only a Sinclair
could clean it up?

24
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,312
What if all the petty,
material things

25
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,689
that tore our family apart
were just gone?

26
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,065
We could tear it down,

27
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,651
teach Harris and the moms
the ultimate lesson.

28
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,944
I remember it now.

29
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,363
We burnt this place
to the ground.

30
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:19,955
<i>If you want to live</i>

31
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,500
 <i>where people</i>
 <i>aren't afraid of mice,</i>

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,252
 <i>you must give up</i>
 <i>living in palaces.</i>

33
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:31,091
 <i>Or maybe, just maybe,</i>

34
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,803
 <i>you burn the fucking palace</i>
 <i>to the ground.</i>

35
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,888
Could you imagine?

36
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,601
I could imagine
the moms' faces.

37
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,936
Guys, I mean it.

38
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,521
Clairmont is just
a pile of trophies.

39
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:46,273
Trophies won with a bullshit,
unfair advantage.

40
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,652
Yeah, it's basically
the seat of the patriarchy.

41
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:51,862
Yeah, with Harris
at the head of the table.

42
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,990
Right, so if it was all gone,
we'd have to start over.

43
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,910
Maybe they'd stop.

44
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,412
Maybe we'd be a family again.

45
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,123
It'd be like a purification.

46
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,709
I mean, things can't
get any worse, right?

47
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,003
Gat,

48
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:11,507
this is usually where you chime
in as the voice of reason.

49
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,968
It's the Sinclair house.
I don't get a say.

50
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,511
- Oh.
- Well, you guys know

51
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,221
I'm not even going to be
welcome here anymore.

52
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,014
Well, that's exactly why
we have to do something.

53
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,309
They're tearing each other
apart and us along with them.

54
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,270
Look, they need to learn.

55
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,980
Mm-mm,
they'll punish us and send us

56
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,023
to some boarding school
in the Swiss Alps.

57
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:28,983
No.

58
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,318
We are so sorry

59
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,362
that we overflowed
the dishwasher,

60
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,489
and we swiped the good whiskey.

61
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,616
Then we made s'mores,

62
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,828
and watched movies
at Cuddledown.

63
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,914
We watched "Ferris Bueller"
and "Sixth Sense" for Johnny,

64
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,083
and then we fell asleep.

65
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,544
And we smelled
the smoke too late.

66
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:50,671
And they wouldn't believe us,
but it wouldn't matter...

67
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,839
Because...

68
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,507
- People might talk, right?
- Yes!

69
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,842
They would ask questions like,

70
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:59,930
how did the Sinclair girls
screw up their kids so bad

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,724
that they burned
their house down?

72
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:04,310
OK, it's a genius plan, but
we don't know how to do arson.

73
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,811
OK, well,
we'll divide and conquer.

74
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,647
I mean, there's plenty
of fuel in the boathouse.

 <i>I'll do the downstairs.</i>

00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,116

 <i>OK, I'll cover the attic.</i>

85
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,917
We work from the top down.

86
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:32,129
Gas it up, light the match,
and get the fuck out.

87
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,131
And me?

88
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,052
The boat is docked
at Windemere, right?

89
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,054
Bring the boat around and you
can be our getaway driver.

90
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,138
It'll be perfect.

91
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,306
I don't drive the boat.
You know that.

92
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,933
Yeah, but Gat...

93
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,267
- What?
- Look.

94
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,103
You'll be able to say
you didn't see the fire start

95
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,857
and you got us all to safety,
and it won't even be a lie.

96
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:55,778
And once the things inside are
gone, their power will be gone,

97
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,112
and Harris will have
to give you

98
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,198
a big hero's welcome back
next summer.

99
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,574
Ed, too, even.

100
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,076
We can fix this.

101
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,535
I...

102
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,828
fuck it, I want to help.

105
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,960
 <i>We need it to spread fast</i>

106
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,628

107
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,172
After I help with the arsenal,
I'll get the boat over.

108
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,215
No gas near the
main staircase, OK?

109
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,341
We need a safe way out.

110
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:20,302
And when the grandfather
clock strikes 12:00,

111
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:24,181
we light the match
and we run like hell.

112
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,182

113
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,519

I can't believe we did it.

125
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:21,321
The moms haven't been fighting,
and Gat was invited back.

126
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,489
It worked.

127
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,907
I mean, it...

128
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,117

the fire, is all.

129
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,452
Yeah.

130
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:29,663
Come on. Absolutely.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

I'm missing something.

133
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:41,050
This still doesn't explain
how I ended up in the water.

134
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,973
Come on,
we should go get Gat.

135
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,016
Right.

136
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,642
It'll be better.

137
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,359
Come on, Cady.

138
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,865
She's going
to remember the rest soon.

139
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,784
She's starting to piece
everything together.

140
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,204
I think I get it.

141
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:13,040
Did we swim off the boat
after the fire to celebrate?

142
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,459
I hit my head, and you
couldn't find me, right?

143
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,252
You were scared.
We were drunk.

144
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,338
We'd just committed a felony,
so you left.

145
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,632
- No, no, no.
- I understand.

146
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,217
I do.

147
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,552
I needed you to be
invited back, Gat.

148
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,471
And here you are,
so it's worth it to me.

149
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,723
Cady, stop, we don't know
how you got in the water.

150
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,849
OK, well...

151
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,101
And we told you
the truth about that.

152
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,310
Well, you know something
that I don't.

153
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,895
Just a little bit.

154
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,022
And it's not like we can
just straight-up tell you.

155
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,858
Every time people do,
you just...

156
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,777
Yeah, and then
you forget anyways.

157
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,862
Cady, we really
want to help you.

158
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,239
We do.
It's just that that's not...

159
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,616
It's like every time that
I get close to the truth,

160
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,328
this pain dragon
crawls into my brain

161
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,205
and-and it shuts me down.

162
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,915
But when we're just
Liars being Liars,

163
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,750
the dragon gets distracted.

164
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,464
I have an idea.

165
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,469
- All right, ready?
- Mm-hmm.

166
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,887
Just a familiar,
non-triggering,

167
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,223
peaceful activity.

00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:16,854
I prefer dirty word Scrabble
to trigger trauma Scrabble.

Molotov cocktails
from a summer

180
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,686
of the Sinclair sisters'
empties.

181
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,480
Poetic, kind of.

182
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,275
I'll see you in
a better world.

183
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,068

00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:09,072
You and I in the kitchen,
right?

185
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,785
See you in a better world.

186
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,207
OK, we got this.

187
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,292
- Hey.
- Hey.

188
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,211
All right.

189
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,796
No, no, no, no.
Uh...

190
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,340
Here's the gas.

191
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,799
I thought it'd be easier
to carry upstairs

192
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,092
than the big red one.

193
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,928
Genius.

194
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,054
Midnight, yeah?

195
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,680
It's a date, bro.

196
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,101
It's ironic, isn't it, huh?

197
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,312
"The Boston Sentinel,"

198
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,982
the paper that started the
Sinclair publishing empire.

199
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,609
The thing that
paid for this house

200
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,402
is what will burn it down.

201
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,952
And I know I spelled it
right this time,

202
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:58,455
so redemption or whatever.

203
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:06,380
The plan was for you to
start in the attic, right?

204
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,131
<i>Yeah.</i>

205
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,218
 <i>A lot of memories up there.</i>

206
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,313
<i>I was so excited</i>

207
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,816
 <i>to torch my mother's</i>
 <i>childhood bedroom.</i>

208
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,235
 <i>She was the worst of them all,</i>
 <i>chasing the money,</i>

209
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,988
 <i>coming for her sisters</i>
 <i>with claws out.</i>

210
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,531
Honestly,
that's the only reason why

211
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,283
I agreed to the plan at all.

212
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,118
I bet it felt good.

213
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,577
It was just a guest bedroom.

214
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,330
It's not like Gran kept
a shrine to her teen magazines

215
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,416
or expired nail polishes.

216
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,626
Well, maybe she never even
had that kind of mess.

217
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,629
Maybe she was just
always toxic positivity.

218
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,631
Perfection.

219
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,966
Anyways, Cady, I don't...

220
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,801
is this really even helping
you at all right now?

221
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,303
- Yes, yes.
- OK.

222
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,929
I think so.

223
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,559
I remember some of it.

224
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,105
The smell,
I felt high off of it.

225
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,277
The gasoline.

226
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,487

Right, right.
Go get it.

00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,471
- Granddad.
- Oh!

Oh, Cadence, the first.

285
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,601
Come, sit.

286
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,316
We didn't do the annual
sandcastle contest this year,

287
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,901
did we?

288
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,736
Someone ought to
have reminded me.

289
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,533
I just wanted to say...

290
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,243
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,665
You've collected yourself,
then?

292
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,125
Your memories?

293
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,299
Well, I do miss them,

294
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,010
at strange moments...

295
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,722
inconvenient ones,
always, it seems.

296
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,768
And don't be sorry.

297
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,813
You were heroic.

298
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,648
A fine example.

299
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:27,028
It's just that faulty wiring
to blame, and that...

300
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,781
that gas main.

301
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,158
Hey.

302
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,285
What do you think

303
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,455
about me and the Liars
coming to New Clairmont

304
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,291
to have dinner
with you tonight?

305
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,169
All of us, I mean.

306
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,796
Gat, too.

307
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,799
I think it's important
he knows he's welcome now.

308
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,346
Well...

309
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,272
Your 18th birthday's coming.

310
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,318
Yep.

311
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,319
Three days.

312
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,821
Mm.

313
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,906
Yeah, time.

314
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:16,369
Hard to keep track of
in the summer, isn't it?

315
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,037
Yeah.

316
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,667
I've, um...
I've been hanging on to these.

317
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,419
I'd rather not.

318
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,546
Oh, no,
it's your birthday gift.

319
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:31,426
You just open it
when you're ready.

320
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,720
Thanks.

321
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,297
Here!
Over here!

322
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,884
Stay with me.

323
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,482
Hey, Cady.
What are you doing out here?

324
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,817
Hey, we saw you
talking to Harris.

325
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,362
We thought
we should check on you.

326
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,073
I think he knows something.

327
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,035
Or everything.

328
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,204
And he gave me these.

329
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,164
The family noose of love.

330
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,084
How did those even
survive the fire?

331
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,419
Cady?

332
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,842
We tried to warn you, OK?
These aren't happy memories.

333
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,134
No.

334
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,761
Bet you're missing your amnesia
right about now.

335
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,096
No.
No!

336
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,806
I need to know.

337
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,267
Where were you when they
found me on the beach?

338
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,686
And why didn't you call?

339
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:08,565
Why didn't any of you call?

340
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,652
Hey, Cady.

341
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,196
- You're OK.
- Cady!

342
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,906
- Hey, you need to calm down.
- Panic attack.

343
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,536
No!

344
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:35,300
I'm strong enough
to know my own story.

345
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,557
Please.

346
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,151
OK.

347
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,569
Yes.

 <i>and then I found something.</i>

353
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,443
 <i>My mom tried.</i>

354
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,153
 <i>I don't know why she</i>
 <i>couldn't just say sorry,</i>

355
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,030
 <i>but at least she was trying.</i>

356
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:45,662
I suddenly felt so guilty,
but we had a plan.

357
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,831
 <i>Light a match and get out.</i>

358
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,022
<i>I admit I got</i>
 <i>a little distracted.</i>

359
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,592
 <i>I almost didn't hear</i>
 <i>the clock, but I did.</i>

360
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,387
 <i>I heard it in time.</i>

361
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,264
 <i>Didn't even light up</i>
 <i>the mess that I made.</i>

362
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:49,475
 <i>I just...</i>
 <i>I got the hell out of there.</i>

363
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,233
 <i>But the smoke rose up</i>
 <i>the turret so fast.</i>

364
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:06,492
<i>The clock struck 12:00.</i>
<i>The fire had started.</i>

365
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,663
 <i>You were supposed to come out,</i>
 <i>light the match, and get out.</i>

366
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,712
Fuck.

367
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,756
<i>There was so much fire.</i>

368
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,050
 <i>Maybe I got turned around,</i>
 <i>I don't know.</i>

369
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,052
Johnny!

370
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,138
<i>I couldn't wait.</i>

371
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,056
Cady!

372
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,974
 <i>I had to chase you, Cadence.</i>

373
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,942
 <i>I searched everywhere.</i>

374
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:24,320
 <i>I guess I searched too long.</i>

375
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,073
Cadence!

376
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,243
<i>It was the newspapers, maybe.</i>

377
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,120
 <i>Too much kindling.</i>

378
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,539
Johnny!

379
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,624
Johnny! Cady!

380
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,376
<i>Too much accelerant.</i>

381
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,003
Cadence! Mirren!

382
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,630
Where are you?

383
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,383

384
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,385

 <i>and there were consequences.</i>

389

No.

390
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,791

 <i>Mirren Sinclair Sheffield,</i>

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:21,520
 <i>perished in the recent house</i>
 <i>fire near Martha's Vineyard.</i>

403
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,397
 <i>The home of Harris Sinclair</i>

404
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,192
 <i>and the late Mrs. Tipper Taft</i>
 <i>Sinclair burned to the ground</i>

405

 <i>before the</i>

406
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,655
Cadence!

407
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,698
I'm fine, Mom. Relax.

408
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,158
Why didn't you call?

409
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,701
That night fucked me up
as well, all right?

410
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,663
That's why I can't
fucking talk about it.

411
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,414
Ow!

412
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,416
Don't complain while
I'm trying to make you pretty.

413
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,085
She's already pretty.

414
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,381
Is this Johnny's phone?

415
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,174
Uh...

416
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,345
Mom, why do you
have my phone?

417
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,222
Mom, just leave it alone.
Mom, please just give it back.

418
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,976
<i>Yeah,</i>
 <i>my parents took my phone.</i>

419
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:02,353
 <i>The screens make</i>
 <i>my migraines worse.</i>

420
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,982
Nothing that I find out
will change

421
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,984
the way I feel about you, Gat.

422
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,490
<i>Gat.</i>

423
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,578
Cady, tell me a ghost story.

424
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,707
I'm fresh out.
Ask Mirren.

425
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,417
Hilarious.

426
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,989
Cadence?

427
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,878
Mommy. Mommy!

428
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:53,422
<i>Don't open it until</i>
 <i>your birthday next week, OK?</i>

429
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:10,147
 <i>Cady, I wore these beads</i>
 <i>close to my heart all summer.</i>

430
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,150
 <i>I love you.</i>
 <i>From Gat.</i>

431
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,210
How are you holding up?

432
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,963
I feel like my heart

433
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:39,218
is bleeding through
my shirt all the time.

434
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,345
Well, that is normal.

435
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:45,641
Sadness is always, uh, seeping.

436
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:50,354
And your migraines?

437
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:57,111
Um, I...

438
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:00,197
I think I was taking
too many pills.

439
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:04,076
It's been hard
not to take them.

440
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,121
I think I might need some help

441
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:10,332
not taking them anymore.

442
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,168
Thank you for telling me.

443
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:15,796
Um, I'm going to
call the doctor

444
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,923
and your dad,
and we are going to get you

445
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,885
all the help you need
in Vermont.

446
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,220
Whatever happened to

447
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,851
"All ailments can be cured by
salt air and outdoor exercise"?

448
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,437
Turns out that law
doesn't apply

449
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,981
to losing the great
loves of your life.

450
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:38,027
Trust me, I...
I checked the rule book,

451
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,154
over and over.

452
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,784
You're not talking about Dad,
are you?

453
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,122
No.

454
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:55,503
There was someone else, uh,

455
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,422
for a long time.

456
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:04,553
And I still blamed
your father for leaving,

457
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:08,516
because I wouldn't have.

458
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,851
It is not what Sinclairs do.

459
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,982
I...

460
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,528
I hope that you don't hate me

461
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:24,031
for letting you blame him, too.

462
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,451
I think I was afraid that

463
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,663
if you had the option, that
you wouldn't choose this...

464
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,624
um...

465
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:37,211
choose, uh, me.

466
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,967
You should know that
you do have a choice.

467
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:46,971
I know being a Sinclair
is not easy,

468
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,389
but I would imagine

469
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:51,183
not being a Sinclair
is much, much harder.

470
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,564
But the choice
is yours to make.

483
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,579
Hi.

484
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,872
Yo.

485
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:57,249
Where have you been?

486
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,336
Well, a tennis championship.

487
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:01,920
Actually, I won.

488
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,423
Yeah, and then I celebrated
on the party boat.

489
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,175
And then, um,

490
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,719
that led to an orgy,
which I also won.

491
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:13,682
And yeah,
that's where I've been.

492
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,018
Hey, I mean it.

493
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:20,481
Where were you before
you showed up here just now?

494
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:23,442
Um, sleeping,

495
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,736
kind of.

496
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:29,615
It's like a...
a soft nothing, in a way.

497
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:34,703
And then a pull,
and then I'm here.

498
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,955
I thought I'd never
see you again.

499
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,374
You thought we
might be figments

500
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,918
of your fucked up,
traumatized, weird imagination?

501
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,839
Why would you imagine
a dickhead version of me

502
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,216
who wouldn't say goodbye?

503
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:50,719
Right, because you've
never been a dickhead.

504
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,847
No.

505
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:00,437
Look, um,

506
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,899
I'm sorry about this summer.

507
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,360
You just wanted
your memories back,

508
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,154
just to feel better,
and I fought so hard.

509
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,490
I didn't want you to remember
because I thought that

510
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,951
when you did,
I might go somewhere

511
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:17,955
that isn't such a soft nothing.

512
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,498
You can't believe in hell.

513
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,084
I mean, that's just, like,
a made-up threat.

514
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,461
There's got to be
some sort of punishment

515
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,463
for having everything
that I had

516
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,674
and doing nothing good with it.

517
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,637
I'm sorry I lied.
I just...

518
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,390
I don't want to burn again.

519
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,103
Johnny,

520
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:44,064
if hell is real,

521
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,941
I'm fucked, too.

522
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,321
You are going to do
a million good things

523
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,365
with your life, Cady.

524
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,951
You feel so bad
about that night

525
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,536
that you're going to spend
the rest of your life

526
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,580
doing amazing things,

527
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,124
that they'll have to build
a new tier in heaven for you.

528
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:09,089
Any heaven waiting for me
would have you in it.

538
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,249
He's slipping.

539
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,169
The legendary Harris Sinclair

540
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:51,381
wore two mismatching shoes
to dinner tonight.

541
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:55,844
I hate it when things are
funny and sad at the same time.

542
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,888
I know, but like,
you don't have to rub it in.

543
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,640
Like, that's offensive.

544
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,724
It's rude.

545
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,309
- 128.
- How?

546
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,936
- 128?
- I win.

547
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,522
OK, you didn't have
to underline "last"

548
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:07,606
that many times.

549
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,107
But you lost.

550
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,068
You want to play?

551
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,402
Maybe later.

552
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,658
Hey, you guys OK?

553
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,956
It's too quiet here now.

554
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,376
Yeah.

555
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,670
I'm over Scrabble.

556
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,255
- I want to swim.
- Same.

557
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,716
- Race you!
- No fair!

558
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,093
- I'm winning.
- Bye, Cady.

559
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,052
You've got a head start!

560
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,178
I'm winning!

561
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:52,442
Wish I'd been
a little kinder to them.

562
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,738
The Littles.

563
00:35:56,738 --> 00:36:00,868
They always wanted me to teach
them how to braid their hair.

564
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:04,288
Make friendship bracelets.

565
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,255
God, I never even talked
to them unless I had to.

566
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,173
Mirren.

567
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,678
Let me be the one to regret.

568
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,808
You should be light as air.

569
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:29,479
You should be
a fucking sunbeam.

570
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:34,026
Turns out I suck
at being a ghost.

571
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:39,323
I wanted to be excellent at it.

572
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,325
I wanted to be excellent
at everything...

573
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:45,871
at my art, sex, grades,

574
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:50,083
and at being
Bess Sinclair's daughter.

575
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,712
Maybe that's where it all went
wrong between us, you know?

576
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,423
Maybe if we'd just let each
other be messy sometimes,

577
00:36:56,423 --> 00:37:00,093
we could have actually
seen each other, you know?

578
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,894
Oh, Cady.

579
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:15,692
I don't think anyone
ever really saw me.

580
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:25,535
And now no one ever will,
and...

581
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:28,038
No. Look at me.

582
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:34,336
The Liars saw you, Mirren.

583
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:39,383
And I'll see you
for the rest of my life.

584
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:44,596
I'm so tired, Cady.

585
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,186
I'm so tired.

586
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,906
Cady.

587
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,409
Mm-hmm?

588
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,077
He'll come.

589
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,311
Thank you for the gift,
but I don't want these.

590
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,605
You should give them to someone
who actually wants them.

591
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,274
Nonsense.

592
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,943
Who else?

593
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:43,780
You're the first
Sinclair granddaughter.

594
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,283
I don't want to be that.

595
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,993
The heir.

596
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,162
Oh, all right, then.

597
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,249
Who will you be?

598
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,505
Well, perhaps you could be, um,

599
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:05,177
an entitled child with a crush

600
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:08,847
who got mad at her family
and committed arson,

601
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:13,560
animal cruelty,
and involuntary manslaughter.

602
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,563
Now, you do love a story.

603
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,649
You get that from Tip,
of course,

604
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,736
who had a fondness
for fairy tale endings.

605
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:26,740
But I, too,
know of heroes and villains,

606
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,617
plot twists and tropes.

607
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:33,580
But most importantly,
I know how to sell a story...

608
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:38,168
certainly to your aunts,
and your mother,

609
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:42,214
or the poor Littles
who've lost Johnny and Mirren.

610
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:45,050
Yes, it was an errant spark.

611
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:50,472
It was an ignorant worker
who improperly stored the fuel.

612
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:54,184
It was a cruel turn
of the wind.

613
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:58,063
And you nearly died
risking yourself

614
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,065
in an attempt
to save the others,

615
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:03,110
like any good Sinclair would.

616
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:07,114
Now, me,
I would tell that story.

617
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,826
When the reporter
comes on Saturday,

618
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,202
you keep that in mind.

619
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,371
A reporter?

620
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:15,789
On Beechwood?

621
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, another
 <i>Time</i> magazine cover.

622
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,254
I'd like to put an end to the
nattering about a family curse

623
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:26,007
in my last significant profile.

624
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:30,262
I've decided to retire
from public life in my prime.

625
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:36,017
So it is time...

626
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,063
...that I pass the baton

627
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:44,025
to a worthy new face
of the family.

628
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:52,492
You will wear those.

629
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,504
It's early.

630
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:07,632
It's one year ago today.

631
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,259
I know.

632
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:13,013
A year.

633
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:17,100
The Sound's Edge Gallery agreed
to display Mirren's art.

634
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,855
<i>Oh, God,</i>
 <i>she'd have loved that.</i>

635
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,858
<i>They were very eager.</i>

636
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:27,694
 <i>I just...</i>

637
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:32,199
 <i>I hope when people look at it,</i>
 <i>they see her.</i>

638
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,287
 <i>I want to make sure that</i>

639
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:41,541
 <i>she's seen as more</i>
 <i>than just a tragedy.</i>

640
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,695
That's a really nice thing
that you did for her.

641
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,281
Well,

642
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,534
it's too late to do things
for her, so...

643
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,830
Mm.

644
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,833
I thought I needed
exactly what Mom had.

645
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,962
I wanted the husband
from the good family,

646
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,965
the beautiful home,
three daughters.

647
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:33,176
And I would daydream about
what I would name them

648
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,763
and how I would dress them
and how I would raise them

649
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:40,141
to be just so perfect.

650
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:41,643
And then I...

651
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:46,064
I think I was so busy
adjusting them that...

652
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:52,362
...I forgot to just love them.

653
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:55,907
Mirren knew that
you loved her.

654
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:04,582
She did.

655
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:12,382
Sometimes I think losing them
was our punishment.

656
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:15,719
Like that one tiny ember
was sent from God,

657
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:19,431
or the universe,
or Beechwood Island.

658
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:23,101
Punishment for what?

659
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:28,440
For what we did in Summer 16.

660
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:34,279
The summer...
the summer I was 16.

661
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:39,284
Because then I think if
it was our punishment,

662
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:43,246
Penny wouldn't have
been spared, right?

663
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,460
Yeah.

664
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,109
What're we doing next?
Oh, come on.

665
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,944
Thank you.

666
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:20,241
Come on!

667
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,792
Are you real?

668
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,835
I think so.

669
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,629
I'm Cadence.

670
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:34,339

I don't know.

00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:44,742
I really don't know.

691
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:54,294
Lovely.
American royalty, truly.

692
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:56,838
It's nice of Brody
to join us today, Bess.

693
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,259
Loss really showed us how
strong our marriage truly is.

694
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,302
Uh-huh.

695
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:04,137
Do you mind standing
in birth order?

696
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:08,141
It's a condition of Dad
bailing him out financially.

697
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:12,979
A united, stable front
in the wake of it all.

698
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,689
So you're trapped.

699
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,940
Mm-hmm.

700
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,568
Oh, my God,
some things never change.

701
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,195
Oh, some things do, though.

702
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,992
Ed!

703
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:29,579
- Hey.
- Oh, there he is.

704
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:30,830
Uh-huh.

705
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,376
Ah, you made it.

706
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,586
Ed, come on.

707
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:37,921
We should...we should get
you in the photo, too.

708
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:38,838
Uh, no.

709
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,465
I'm all right, Harris.

710
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:41,841
Prefer to avoid the scrutiny.

711
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,218
Mm.

712
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:45,512
Uh, are we expecting Cadence?

713
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:46,971
She'll, uh...
she'll be around.

714
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,765
Thank you.

715
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:50,725
Should we go get her?

716
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,268
No.

717
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,145
It's her choice.

718
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:00,193
I wanted to believe
we were helping you,

719
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:02,320
keeping the secret.

720
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,614
I know now it was selfish.

721
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:10,203
I just wanted one more summer.

722
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:13,248
I didn't want to
make you sicker,

723
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:16,751
but I couldn't
stop wanting you.

724
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,631
Even when everything else about
me felt like it was fading,

725
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:25,885
I still loved you
as much as ever.

726
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:29,722
Well, there's something
you don't know

727
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,141
that might make you
love me less.

728
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,064
 <i>Right before midnight,</i>

729
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:41,859
 <i>I looked out</i>
 <i>and saw you at the boat.</i>

730
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:44,862
I should have waited, but...

731
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,073
I took too long.

732
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:50,493
I was downstairs.

733
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:54,872
I could have gotten out while
the clock was still chiming...

734
00:47:56,124 --> 00:48:00,128
 <i>...but I was looking</i>
 <i>at the family photo.</i>

735
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:02,547
 <i>The black pearls,</i>

736
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:05,925
 <i>the ones the moms were so</i>
 <i>obsessed with our whole lives.</i>

737
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,802
 <i>They obsessed over them...</i>

738
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:11,180
 <i>who got to wear them</i>
 <i>at Christmas, at Easter.</i>

739
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,057
 <i>Who was the best?</i>

740
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,602
 <i>Who was the most loved?</i>

741
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:18,229
And I wanted them.

742
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:22,358
 <i>I can't even explain why.</i>

743
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:25,236
 <i>That's why</i>
 <i>you went inside, Gat.</i>

744
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,614
 <i>That's why you died.</i>

745
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:37,206
No!

746
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,754
It was all my fault.

747
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,714
It's our fault.

748
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:45,715
No.

749
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:46,799
No, I'm the one
who got impatient

750
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,635
and didn't follow the plan.

751
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:51,554
I was as involved as you, Cady.

752
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:55,141
Truth is, I'd burnt
that place down to the ground

753
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:58,686
a million times
in my mind already.

754
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:02,023
I don't blame you.

755
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:06,444
Harris wants me to keep up
the big Sinclair lie,

756
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:10,573
like I'm a hero.

757
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,743
I don't want to be
that kind of liar,

758
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:18,039
but what about the moms

759
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:21,417
and the Littles?

760
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:24,671
Your mom.

761
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:27,465
Ed.

762
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:31,594
I mean, they all think
it was an accident.

763
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:34,263
How will they move on
if they know we meant it?

764
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:38,393
Maybe it's OK to
let them pretend then.

765
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:40,645
Look, you know the truth now,

766
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,563
so you get to decide
the rest of your story.

767
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,982
That's it.
That's what matters.

768
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:54,200
Besides, some fairy tales
aren't so bad.

769
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,955
I've been telling myself one
all summer.

770
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:04,210
You mean the one

771
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,546
where you and I become

772
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:09,841
king and queen
of Beechwood Island?

773
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,803
No.

774
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,975
The one where you and I pack up
and leave the mythical land

775
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:22,019
where it's always summer.

776
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,897
Out in the real world,

777
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,817
it gets cold.

778
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,445
The-the radiator in our
shitty college apartment

779
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:33,072
makes so much noise all night.

780
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:35,491
You write for the lit magazine.

781
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:38,745
I get a tattoo
you pretend to hate.

782
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:42,874
My mom comes to visit us and
teaches us how to make poha.

783
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:48,963
We fight over who forgot
to get rid of the,

784
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,591
uh, the dryer lint.

785
00:50:56,179 --> 00:51:00,516
One semester we have
to do long distance, and...

786
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:03,144
we write each other letters,

787
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:05,021
real ones, in the mail.

788
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:14,447
When we're back in
our shitty apartment,

789
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:17,784
I start to save up to buy you a
ring even though you tell me...

790
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:20,787
- I don't need one.
- You don't need one.

791
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:29,337
Happily ever after.

792
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,966
In a better world.

793
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,180
In a better world.

794
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:47,730
Gat.

795
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:16,467
Come on, one last time.

796
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,495
Cannonball!

797
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:27,288
No, it was really...
it was all about...

798
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:29,624
all about celebrating family.

799
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:31,626
- That's it.
- I think I look great.

800
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:32,960
Mm.

801
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,963
Oh, there she is,
Cadence the first.

802
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,323
Ed.

803
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,955
Hey.

804
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,501
I'm so glad you're here.

805
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,087
I'm glad you are, too.

806
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,433
Cadence.

807
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:36,649
I would like to introduce you
to this young lady.

808
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:40,403
She's going to ask you
a few questions.

809
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:41,737
What kind of questions?

810
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:44,991
Oh, well, it's a piece
about your grandfather

811
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,077
as the patriarch,
but really about

812
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:51,372
your family's
strength of character.

813
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:03,009
I don't think I can
help you with that.

814
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:05,261
Cadence.

815
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:18,482

fairy tales anymore.
