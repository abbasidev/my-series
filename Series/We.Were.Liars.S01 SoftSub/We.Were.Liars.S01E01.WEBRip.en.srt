2
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,820
 <i>and I have no memory of what</i>
 <i>or who hurt me.</i>

3
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:34,160
 <i>No one in my family</i>
 <i>will tell me...</i>

4
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:39,165
 <i>...if they even speak to me</i>
 <i>at all.</i>

5
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:42,251
 <i>Maybe they're afraid</i>
 <i>the truth will destroy me,</i>

6
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,379
 <i>or maybe</i>
 <i>it will destroy them first.</i>

7
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,969
 <i>When you're left for dead,</i>
 <i>you want answers.</i>

8
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,096
 <i>I'm determined to get mine.</i>

 <i>Cadence Sinclair Eastman.</i>

10

 <i>and promise and spun gold.</i>

11

12

Thanks.

14
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,364
Your grandmother
wants us to wear...

15
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,908
Ocean hues and neutrals.
I already know.

16
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,993
I saw the Ralph Lauren bag
on my bed.

17
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:22,333
Oh, uh, Aunt Carrie's wondering
if you know where Johnny is?

18
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,841
<i>My cousin Johnny.</i>

19
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,928
 <i>Salt, swagger,</i>
 <i>and reckless abandon.</i>

20
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,513
Police escort.

21
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,598
It's definitely a vibe.

22
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,433
It was actually awesome.

23
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,101
These two vineyard bros,
they bet me

24
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,103
that I couldn't corner
a golf cart at top speed.

25
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,856
And...well, they were right,
obviously.

26
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,776
But when I tell you
I literally took flight...

27
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,361
Yeah, right through
the pro shop window?

28
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,072
- Yeah, and not a scratch on me.
- I got that phone call. Ugh.

29
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:56,075
What did the cops say about
your aeronautical adventure?

30
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,368
I don't know.
They were cool.

31
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,620
Also, they got me here
just in time, yeah?

32
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,705
Can't have Gran and Grandad
mad at me for being late, hey?

33
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,917
What, mad at the eldest boy?
Come on.

34
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,170

00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,779
Just an inch.
That's not an inch, Liberty.

64
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:19,617

00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,447
There's also this great store
right on the corner

174
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,450
that I've almost convinced
to carry my jewelry line.

175
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,785
Oh, Carrie, that's fantastic.

176
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,870
- What is that?
- Yeah.

177
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,205
That, right there.
What is that?

178
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,414
What?

179
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,796
Party boat? Sick!

180
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,130
It's obstructing the view.

181
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,007
That looks awesome.

182
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,385
It's gauche.

183
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,904
<i>Cady,</i>
 <i>sorry about the divorce.</i>

184
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,616
 <i>The universe sucks sometimes,</i>
 <i>but I'm glad you're in it.</i>

185
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,826
 <i>From Gat.</i>

186
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,537
 <i>PS, found a lucky penny</i>
 <i>on the ferry.</i>

187
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:46,461
 <i>♪ I pretend</i>
 <i>that you don't understand ♪</i>

188
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,549
 <i>♪ I sure as hell</i>
 <i>don't know you well... ♪</i>

189
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,677
Gat got...

190
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,345
- taller.
- Yeah.

191
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,972
And he joined
the swim team too.

192
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,809
Decided I'm getting us on that
party boat this weekend.

193
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,227
Why?
It's just a bunch

194
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,480
of drunk, trashy tourists
looking to hook up.

195
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,274
Exactly.

196
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,860
Come on, dude.

197
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,278
OK.

198
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,406
Two truths and a lie
about your off-island time.

199
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,451
Uh...Mirren.

200
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,953
Fine. Um...

201
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,873
I've been sexting
with an older guy...

202
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,710
I got a flower tattoo
on my bum,

203
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,337
and I met Taylor Swift.

204
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,339
No way sweet little Mirren
is sexting.

205
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,592
- That's the lie.
- What kind of flower?

206
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,219
- A daisy.
- OK, that's the lie.

207
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,929
Who's the sexter?

208
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,515
He's a senior I met
in the debate semis,

209
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,767
and he's incredible.

210
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,310
It's a disaster.

211
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,853
Does he use the splash emoji?

212
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,855
Ew, no, he just...

213
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,691
his family's coming out
in August to the Vineyard

214
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,444
and he's gonna want
to actually have sex,

215
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,196
which is impossible, so...

216
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,697
You don't want to?

217
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,200
I have been texting
like I'm an OnlyFans girl.

218
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,162
I have no idea how to do
any of that stuff, and...

219
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,706
I don't do anything
that I'm not excellent at.

220
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:08,502
So I need to make sure
that the time is right,

221
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,254
the place is right,
the vibes are good,

222
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,007
and that there's, you know,
nothing awkward or weird

223
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,302
or, like, sticky.

224
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,930
Yeah, good luck with that.

225
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,933
Cadence, your turn.

226
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,935
OK, fine.

227
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:29,272
I crashed the Beemer
that my mom got me,

228
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:34,027
I got a short story published
in <i>Write City Magazine,</i>

229
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:39,241
and I kissed
three unimportant boys.

230
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,992
Yeah, you didn't wreck the car.

231
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,285
You just know her too well.

232
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,703
We can't play this game
with the two of you.

233
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,247
She has tells.

234
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,165
Plus I, uh...

235
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,459
I read that short story.

236
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,545
I liked it.

237
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,630
- Thanks.
- Your turn, Gat.

238
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,425
Let's see.
Uh, OK.

239
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,386
I got busted for stealing
a six-pack from the bodega,

240
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,680
I got my junior
motorcycle license,

241
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,098
and...

242
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,142
I pulled a fire alarm
and ended up

243
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,394
in Saturday detention with
a bunch of other delinquents

244
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,729
who actually, I don't know,
turned out to be pretty cool.

245
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,356
Lie.

246
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,649
I've seen that movie.

247
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,025
You have a motorcycle?

248
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,320
OK, it's just a written test
in New York.

249
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,530
Anybody want an ice pop?

250
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,073
Ooh, ice pop.
I'm coming with.

251
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,034
Wait, wait, Johnny.
You skipped your turn.

252
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,953
What?
You couldn't handle my truths.

253
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:31,126
I can't believe
you read that story.

254
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,961
It was kind of weird.

255
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,337
No, it wasn't.

256
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,547
It was beautiful.

257
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,757
I mean, when the narrator
turned out to be

258
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,968
inside the mind
of the princess?

259
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:43,054
Such a good plot twist.

260
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,432
It was kind of sad too.

261
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,227
Genuinely.
I mean, I was torn apart after.

262
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,188
What?

263
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,814
No, it's, uh, nothing.

264
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,442
It's just...

265
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,402
my other friends didn't get it.

266
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,073
So robbing a bodega.

267
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,284
That's a level up for you.

268
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,537
Yeah,
I don't know why I did that.

269
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,582
You know, I knew the owner,
like, my whole life.

270
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,876
They used to give me free M&Ms.

271
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,421
Didn't call the cops, though.
Just my mom.

272
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,964
That's why she sent me
to India over the break.

273
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,424
She thought time
with my grandparents

274
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:23,303
would somehow teach me
how to respect my elders.

275
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,475
Tell me more about your trip.

276
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,811
It was...

277
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,731
it was honestly amazing.
And hard too.

278
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,151
So I hadn't been there
since I was a baby,

279
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,986
so it was all pretty new.

280
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:44,866
Cady, there is so much art,
so much culture there.

281
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,368
It did change me.

282
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,246
My nana, she took me out
to the rural area and...

283
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,665
<i>Something changed that day.</i>

284
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,417
 <i>I looked at him</i>
 <i>and he wasn't just Gat.</i>

285
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,587
 <i>He was contemplation,</i>
 <i>enthusiasm,</i>

286
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,465
 <i>ambition, and strong coffee.</i>

287
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,468
 <i>He seemed like he was mine.</i>

288
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,346
 <i>I don't believe in soulmates</i>
 <i>or the supernatural,</i>

289
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,642
 <i>but in that moment,</i>
 <i>the world felt magical.</i>

290
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,411
That's what you need.
A distraction.

291
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,955
No, I don't need a distraction.
I need a decorator.

292
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,623
Well, I'm not sure
what's harder,

293
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,500
wrangling three girls
for a five-minute FaceTime

294
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,544
with their father,
or keeping him on the line

295
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,462
long enough to talk
to his wife.

296
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,798
I mean, at a certain point,
are you even really married?

297
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,633
My marriage is just fine.

298
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,428
So was mine, until it wasn't.

299
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:50,181
To be fair, Penny, you are
emotionally unavailable.

300
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,182
And, Bess, you are...

301
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,227
She is a Beacon Hill tradwife.

302
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,770
I don't know what that is.

303
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,023
It's rude is what it is.

304
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,859
Brody is able
to build his empire

305
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,404
because I run our household
like a Fortune 500 CEO,

306
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,239
keep three gremlins
out of trouble,

307
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,450
and still manage
to make it to Sunday dinners

308
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,327
at Mom and Dad's every week,

309
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:14,456
whereas you breed dogs
and sit back at an arm's length

310
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,625
while your brilliant daughter
overachieves.

311
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,752
Did I miss anything?

312
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,629
No.

313
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,130
Nailed it.

314
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,967
Bess, tell Penny it's all right
to get naked with Salty Dan.

315
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,637
- With who?
- Salty Dan, the...

316
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,889
- hello?
- The harbor service guy?

317
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,391
He's a cowboy.

318
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,728
A cowboy of the sea.

319
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,564
Gotta get back on that horse.

320
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,982
Gimme.

321
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,995
Harris?

322
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,372
Sorry. Have you got a minute?

323
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,082
I wanted to ask you...

324
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:59,000
It's there again.

325
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,419
You're...

326
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,420
talking about the boat.

327
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,005
The whole sound
at his disposal,

328
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,216
parks his ass in my view.

329
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,346
You're an industrious
young man.

330
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,098
See what you can do about it.

331
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,478
Show us what you're made of,
Sinclairs.

332
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,855
Winner gets my eternal respect.

333
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,734
Winner gets a pound of fudge
from Murdick's.

334
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,945
Whoo!

335
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,613
And who is the judge?

336
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,740
Who do you think?

337
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:36,538
Excellent foundational
structure, Littles.

338
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,665
You need more decoration.

339
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,126
Unfair, Liars.

340
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,002
You're stacking the deck
with a professional.

341
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,879
As reigning champion,

342
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,632
I'm allowed to sprinkle
my magic anywhere I want.

343
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,426
How about right here?

344
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,469
Yes. Mm.

345
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,513
Carrie, this needs more water.

346
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,973
No. Water will make it drip.

347
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,683
Yeah, that's the point.
I need the drips, all right?

348
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,059
Otherwise,
it's just a block of dirt.

349
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,145
I'm going for, like,
carpenter's gothic.

350
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,604
All right? Like, icing trim.

351
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,022
OK. Yes.
I see the vision.

352
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,941
You know, I'm not sure
you're gonna be able

353
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,485
to top last year's
architectural spectacle.

354
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,654
The tide charts
were misleading.

355
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,323
I love how stressed out
you get about this every year.

356
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,867
I curate art collections
for a living.

357
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:14,951
I can't attach my name

358
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,453
to anything less
than a masterpiece.

359
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,496
All right, so...

360
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,497
party boat.

361
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,707
Ugh.

362
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,625
- Just let it go, bruh.
- Let the party boat go.

363
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,252
- So annoying.
- What?

364
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,796
Look, we have everything
that we need right here.

365
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,797
That's the problem.

366
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,048
Our sexual prime
is passing us by

367
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,342
while we build
fucking sandcastles.

368
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,178
- What is that?
- It's for the fudge, man.

369
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,637
- I need it.
- No, fine.

370
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,389
- It's the best fudge.
- The best fudge.

371
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,266
You need the fudge.
Cool.

372
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,726
Johnny, come on.

373
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,524
Your dad is burning
a party-boat-sized hole

374
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,651
in the back of my head.

375
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,737
Just ignore it.

376
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,115
It's 'cause he's used to bossing
around entire corporations.

377
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,659
He's not gonna fire you.
I won't let him.

378
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,245
- Oh.
- I promise.

379
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,665

00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,103
You're finally ready
to drive the boat?

402
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,063
No, no, no, no.

403
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,231
Why?

404
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,108
You know why.
It's a Sinclair boat.

405
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,695
Well,
you're an honorary Sinclair.

406
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:59,032
Doesn't give me the freedom
to drive it, does it?

407
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,663

What were we thinking,
jumping in the water?

424
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,351
I mean, everyone knows
there's practically

425
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,186
a shark infestation
off the coast.

426
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,646
Suck it up, swim team.

427
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,065
Fine, fine, but when I get
murdered by a shark,

428
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,150
I expect you to write
a really excellent eulogy.

429
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,444
It's not murder. You're prey.

430
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,321
Come on.
Come on.

431
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,240
OK, fine.

432
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,411
- Better?
- Better.

433
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,170
Why are you looking at me
like that?

434
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,673
I'm not.

435
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:39,882
OK.

436
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,348
You...

437
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,851
Why are you looking at me?

438
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,311
I don't know.

439
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,690
You just...

440
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,984
you seem different.

441
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,861
In a good way?

442
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,198
In a new way.

443
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,288
You have this,
like, confidence.

444
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,004
Do you sometimes feel like
everything is changing?

445
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,506
In the real world, yeah.

446
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,134
But not on Beechwood.

447
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,594
That's what I love about it.

448
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:27,555
It feels different
without your dad, though.

449
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,308
I guess.

450
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,518
But I'm not supposed
to talk about him, so...

451
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,187
That's weird.

452
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,065
- That's my mother.
- Oh.

453
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:40,193
You OK with everything?

454
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,364
We got a new couch.

455
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,075
That is a very Penny
response.

456
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,451
It's a really nice couch.

457
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,577
Right.

458
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,912
- Right.
- Right.

459
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,207
Did you take me out here

460
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,291
'cause you think
I need therapy?

461
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,335
Because Sinclairs
do not do therapy.

462
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,461
Right, right.

463
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,088
Sinclairs believe
in outdoor exercise,

464
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,173
stiff upper lips
and, what, cocktail hour?

465
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,383
- Yeah.
- Right, right.

466
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:07,845

467
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,889

doubles partner this year.

The Eastern
Connecticut Championship

511
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,846
will never be the same.

512
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,683
Yeah, well, things got messy
when we started losing.

513
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,643
Messy how?

514
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:04,981
Well, we had
all these travel matches.

515
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,399
You know how it goes.

516
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,986
Hotel rooms and chaperones
who don't actually chaperone.

517
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,237
Wait.

518
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,322
We're talking about Jackson,
right?

519
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,074
Not your mixed doubles partner.

520
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,618
Wait, is this a big
coming out moment?

521
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,453
- Dude, congrats.
- Whatever.

522
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,455
Don't throw a parade
or anything.

523
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:22,581
Still figuring it out.

524
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,959
Look, the point is, one night,

525
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,378
we just sort of went for it.

526
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,672
And it got weird.

527
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,965
Everything changed.

528
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:35,136
Like, ruined our vibe.

529
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,179
No rhythm on the court.

530
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:41,183
We're not even, like,
friends anymore.

531
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,311
It blows.

532
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:45,396
I'm sure it kind of messed up
the whole team too.

533
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:48,399
Mm. 100%.

534
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,486
Well, we should
watch a movie.

535
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:55,573
 <i>Back to the Future 2</i>
or <i>Romeo and Juliet?</i>

536
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,867
Uh, I think I'm gonna
finish my book tonight.

537
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,202
Yeah, same.

538
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,937
Did you borrow
Johnny's cologne?

539
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,147
No.

540
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,357
That is potent.

541
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,361
What are you doing?

542
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:36,197
Reading up on
Vineyard maritime ordinances.

543
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,907
Harris and I are
in a chess match.

544
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:41,202
Unfortunately,
even if I win, I lose.

545
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,704
- House rules.
- Why do you play at all?

546
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,666
When you fall in love
with a Sinclair girl,

547
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:53,422
you agree to participate in
the family mindfuck Olympics.

548
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:57,676
Yeah, greater men have crumbled
under pressure, but I remain.

549
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:03,849
Ooh, by the way,
you got a letter in the mail.

550
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:09,021
I thought your generation
only communicated via texts

551
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,731
with no punctuation.

552
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:14,193
Gat, bro, I've done it.

553
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,945
I've bested
even my greatest achievements.

554
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,488
OK.
Do I want to know?

555
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,031
Do I?

556
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,199
You do not.

557
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,575
You, my friend,
you're coming with me.

558
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,244
What?

559
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,829
Yeah, and you're not
wearing that.

560
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,622
- Wait, why?
- See ya, Ed!

561
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,665
Cady.

562
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,916
It's on.

563
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,251
The party boat.
My guy came through.

564
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,669
We're in.

565
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,590
Not driving.

566
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,259
What are you doing up here?

567
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,886
I thought you were
reading tonight.

568
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:24,763
Meteor shower.

569
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,931
OK.

570
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,935
Party boat!

571
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,437
Whoo-hoo!

Dude, what's your deal?

584
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:09,934
What?

585
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:11,435
You're staring at Cadence.

586
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,145
I'm not staring at her.

587
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,022
- What do you mean?
- So what are you looking at?

588
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,857
N-nothing.
I'm not looking at anything.

589
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,901
Cadence does look
extra pretty tonight.

590
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,236
Can I borrow
some of that lipstick?

591
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,905
Since when do you wear
lipstick on Beechwood?

592
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,615
Enough about the lipstick,
please.

593
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,325
Did you notice
the lipstick, Gat?

594
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,493
Is that why
you were looking at her?

595
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,577
'Cause she looks
extra pretty tonight?

596
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,330
I wasn't...

597
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,290
look, she looks the same
as always, OK?

598
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,960
What are you guys doing?

599
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,294
Fine, Gat.

600
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,630
OK.
Let's find a bar, yeah?

601
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,677
Mirren, shot.
We're gonna do a shot.

602
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,971
- Come on, Gat.
- No. Come on.

603
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,847
All right!

604
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,266
Come on,
we're at a party.

605
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,860
Mwah!

606
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,863
Well, I have to go
and get ready.

607
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:47,615
Brody is coming in
on the last flight.

608
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,283
Oh, honey, that's lovely.

609
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,368
How did you manage
to convince him?

610
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,579
I simply reminded him

611
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,831
that marriage is about
more than just providing.

612
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,584
Ah.
You bartered in blowjobs, eh?

613
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,711
Girls, show some class.

614
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,046
At least we still have sex.

615
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,672
Oh, if I was
offended by that,

616
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,007
I would still be married.

617
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:07,134
The divorce jokes. Pen.

618
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,969
I know, I know.

619
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:12,723
The Sinclair way is
to never mention it at all.

620
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,600
That's not fair.

621
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,605
Obviously, I am here for you
if you want to share.

622
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,566
You don't have
to worry about me.

623
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,234
I'm fine.

624
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,611
Honestly.

625
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,780
I don't miss Sam. I...

626
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,368
18 years of marriage, and I
don't even think about him.

627
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,662
What does that say about me?

628
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,538
Well, Sinclairs face forward.

629
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:42,086
I imagine the divorce
must be draining, though.

630
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,840
Mostly on my bank account.

631
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,801
He's coming after me
for everything.

632
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,388
The Burlington house
and what's left of the trust.

633
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,806
He leaves you
for another woman,

634
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,432
and he thinks he deserves that?

635
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,934
The nerve.

636
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,228
It's not...
it's not that simple.

637
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:05,067
He's hired
a private investigator.

638
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,286
- I'll just...
- No.

639
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,497
Hey, where are the other Liars?

640
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,751
They're just, uh,
doing their own thing.

641
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,586
Surprisingly off-brand.

642
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,838
- Where?
- What?

643
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:28,674
The booze cruise, obviously.

644
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,926
No, we weren't there.

645
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,847
Oh, you kids.
You think I have no idea?

646
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,934
As if I didn't get my fake ID
from the exact same

647
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,479
shitty backdoor bar in Edgartown
when I was your age.

648
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,314
Then why didn't you tell him
he couldn't go?

649
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,066
Because then he would
want to go even more.

650
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,528
I mean, people always want
what they can't have.

651
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,530
Wait.

652
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,741
Were any of you served alcohol?

653
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:55,993
We're underage.

654
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,411
Yeah.

655
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,246
Yeah, you guys are.

656
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,707
Perfect. Thank you.

657
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,084
I'm off to threaten
a small business owner.

658
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,377
Hey.

659
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,462
What?

660
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:08,255
We can't all stay
trapped in amber

661
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,216
on Beechwood forever,
as much as we would like to.

662
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,303
Why don't you come
watch the meteors

663
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:15,429
with me and the kids?

664
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,638
We're having s'mores.

665
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,598
OK?

666
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,790
Once upon a time,

667
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,335
long, long ago...

668
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:49,421
there was an enchanted island

669
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,800
with four beautiful castles.

670
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,843
And it was on that island

671
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:58,931
that a young maiden met
a gallant prince.

672
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,685
But...

673
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:07,815
she had no need
for such trivial things.

674
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,858
For that smart
young maiden knew

675
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,735
that princes would come and go.

676
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,362
Whoa.

677
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,613
Hmm?

678
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:15,739
A meteor, William?

679
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,116
Nope. Shark.

680
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,868
There are no sharks here.

681
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,787
It's probably a whale.

682
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,000
- Night vision.
- Cady?

683
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,336
- Wait, I wanna see the shark.
- Where is everybody going?

684
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:47,104
Why are you in the water?

685
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,522
I was swimming.

686
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,774
But you're wearing clothes.

687
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:51,984
I know.

688
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,823
I just really wanted
to be here with you guys.

689
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,412
Instead of where I was.

690
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,353
Tag.
You're it.

691
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,928
OK.

692
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:04,097
Why'd you run?

693
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,517
To see if you'd still chase me.

694
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,901
I've been chasing you
my whole life.

695
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,449
I'll always chase you.

696
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:28,246
You made me feel
so stupid tonight.

697
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,458
I know.

698
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,543
I'm sorry.

699
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,629
Johnny was so intent
on us all going,

700
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:39,633
and I got scared.

701
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,885
Of what?

702
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:45,847
Cannonball!

703
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,354
Get your asses in here
right now, you ditchers!

704
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:56,024
Get in!

705
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,776
Cannonball!

706
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,763
Where's the taxi?

707
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,307
My husband was due in
on the last flight.

708
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,726
Well, whoever's on that flight

709
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,811
got to where they needed to be
already.

710
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,022
I'm the one who's running late.

711
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,317
Hey, tell your mom
I'll load her up

712
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,028
on those clams she likes.

713
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,995
Can you tell me
what's wrong with me?

714
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:59,296
I've had three kids, sure,
but...

715
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,798
I maintain myself.

716
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,051
I write thank-you notes
on time.

717
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,385
I don't lose my temper.

718
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,845
I am sexually generous.

719
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,431
I am prettier
than both of my sisters.

720
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,891
Yes, Carrie's got
the stronger chin,

721
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:12,809
but that's only because
my father bought it for her.

722
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,645
All told, I can't see
a single thing wrong with me,

723
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,273
except for the fact
that I married a man

724
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,524
who can't seem to make it

725
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,985
on the last fucking flight
of the day.

726
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,950
Do you have any cigarettes?

727
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,754
- You need a light?
- Yes.

728
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,560
These things will kill you,
you know.

729
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:04,444
Well, since you asked,

730
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,948
the answer is,

731
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:10,867
there's not a thing
wrong with you.

732
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,953
Not from where I'm standing.

733
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,755
Look, there's another one.

734
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,136
You guys could have
just told us

735
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:32,222
you wanted to be somewhere else
tonight, you know?

736
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,725
Instead of ditching us.

737
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,435
I'm sorry.

738
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,146
Yeah. I'm sorry too.

739
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:46,319
OK.
All is forgiven.

740
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,320
And I'm freezing.

741
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:52,117
You guys want to play a round
of Code Names at Red Gate?

742
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,785
Ooh, yes.

743
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,662
Yeah.
Right behind you.

744
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,622
Be right there.

745
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,666
I'll grab my stuff.

746
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:31,281
Am I forgiven too?

747
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,909
'Cause I wanted to hang out
with you, just us.

748
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:36,870
I did, but I...

749
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,997
I got nervous.

750
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,707
And Johnny was
so set on the party,

751
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:44,461
and I didn't know
how to explain.

752
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:48,632
I'm just really, really sorry.

753
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:56,973
Well...

754
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,684
you might be forgiven.

755
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,603
But...

756
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:05,857
you're gonna have to learn
how to drive the boat first.

757
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,108
I think that has to wait

758
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:10,111
until I can afford to fix it
if I break it.

759
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:16,493
And you're gonna have to stop
looking at me like that.

760
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,957
I'm not looking at you.

761
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,387
That was a lie.

762
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:41,601
And back on the boat,
I lied then too.

763
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,646
That's why I swam back.

764
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,898
To tell you I was...

765
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,276
I was looking.

766
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:50,735
