1
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,509
Cadence was
entirely out of line today.

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,052
She was just trying
to impress Gat.

3
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,721
Maybe you've been
too distracted

4
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:13,889
to notice them getting
all cozy this summer, Pen.

5
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,353
My mom made me go
to Clairmont this morning

6
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,272
dressed all respectably.

7
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:24,942
Mom says she needs to get
back on his good side.

8
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,652
<i>Bess saw you two on the beach.</i>

9
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:27,862
<i>Wow, OK.</i>

10
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,780
Well, she's one to talk
about discretion.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,283
<i>Your daughter saw you</i>
 <i>with Salty Dan.</i>

12
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,743
Cady fucking told.

13
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:36,203
You think you're gonna go
off to art school

14
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,915
when we are tens of millions
of dollars in debt?

15
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,251
No!

16
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,420
If you want to help,
you can prove to Harris

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,256
that you can be an asset
to the family.

18
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,717
He's the one keeping the roof
over our heads right now.

19
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,552
I came back here
because I needed to know

20
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,137
 <i>why you didn't care about me.</i>

21
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:54,346
You know how I feel.

22
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,682
I don't! I don't remember.

23
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,685
I love you.

24
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,271
I love you too.

25
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:17,703
<i>Tell me a story.</i>

26
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,122
<i>You're the writer.</i>

27
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,833
<i>I want to hear</i>
 <i>what you come up with.</i>

28
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,752
OK.

29
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:33,552
Once upon a time,
there was an island kingdom,

30
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,095
 <i>a mythical land...</i>

31
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,807
...where it was always summer.

32
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,434
Mm, that's the one.

33
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:46,941
One day, a boy arrived
from a realm of noise and color

34
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:51,028
and buildings
that scraped the sky.

35
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:56,700
 <i>In his world, he was a knight.</i>

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,038
 <i>But on the island,</i>
 <i>he learned for the first time</i>

37
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,748
 <i>that he was a mouse.</i>

38
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,125
We brought Ed's nephew, Gat.

39
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,086
The poor kid stowed away
behind the captain's chair

40
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,295
the whole time.

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,762
<i>And he felt</i>
 <i>very small indeed,</i>

42
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:20,182
 <i>until he met a princess.</i>

43
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,396
Are you real?

44
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,736
I think so.

45
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:33,571
You're it!

46
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,163
<i>And along with the princess</i>

47
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,499
 <i>came more royalty.</i>

48
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,210
 <i>And soon,</i>
 <i>the mouse called them friends.</i>

49
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,422
Liars forever!

50
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:57,386
<i>The mouse thought</i>
 <i>the princess was perfect.</i>

51
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,471
 <i>He wanted to follow her</i>
 <i>everywhere.</i>

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,225
 <i>But she was royalty.</i>

53
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,436
 <i>The mouse didn't belong</i>
 <i>in her palace.</i>

54
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,607
The annual Sinclair
family lemon hunt

55
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,984
will commence momentarily.

56
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,360
- OK.
- Come on!

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,112
Oh, you were gonna tell him
about the dress code.

58
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,113
I know. I'm sorry.

59
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,781
I completely forgot.

60
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,534
All right, all right.

61
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:24,038
There are 200 lemons
and one lime

62
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,332
hidden across the island.

63
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:29,293
The hunt begins at the bell.

64
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,711
And do you want to hear
about the prizes?

65
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,296
Yeah!

66
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,381
OK.

67
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,800
For the lemons,
a gift certificate

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,178
to the Edgartown Bookstore.

69
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:44,308
And for the lime,
it's a top-secret surprise.

70
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,309
It's fudge.

71
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,102
It's always fudge.

72
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,730
Now, there are none that
will endanger you to retrieve.

73
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,648
All right?

74
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,608
None on rooftops,
none in brambles.

75
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,027
And no child may
go swimming alone,

76
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,695
or your prize
will be forfeited.

77
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,781
But the losers are fed
to the sharks.

78
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,203
Yeah, no failures allowed
on Beechwood.

79
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,042
 <i>♪ The wild wind</i>

80
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,211

84
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,681
 <i>"He's only a mouse,"</i>
 <i>the king said in disdain.</i>

85
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,975
Watch yourself, young man.

86
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,436
Or you could get hurt.

87
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,480
<i>The entire kingdom whispered,</i>

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,483
 <i>"An animal masquerading</i>
 <i>as a human...</i>

89
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,985
 <i>it's unnatural."</i>

90
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,279
But luckily, Orientals care
far more about money

91
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,823
than they do legalities.

92
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,534
<i>That's the thing about</i>
 <i>mythical island palaces.</i>

93
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,745
 <i>Even the most important rulers</i>

94
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,914

 <i>♪ Underneath... ♪</i>

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,668

 <i>♪ We can follow the stars ♪</i>

112
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,798
He tried to drown out

113
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,552
 <i>♪ Feel it all with you ♪</i>

114

 <i>♪ Feel it all with you ♪♪</i>

116
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,685
So Harris found out about us,

117
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,062
and he scared you away,

118
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,898
and that's why
you didn't call all year.

119
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,274
No.

120
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,902
No, I was ready
to explain it to him,

121
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,029
to tell him I loved you.

122
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,364
But...

123
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,075
...he never mentioned it.

124
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,577
For a while,
I thought I got it wrong.

125
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,828
Cadence Sinclair Eastman!

126
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,205
Oh, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

127
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,414
Oh, God. OK, wait.

128
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,749
Uh, shit, my mom...

129
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,792
she can't see this place
like this.

130
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,460
She'd freak out.

131
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,920
- I gotta go.
- Cadence!

132
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,837
Cady, listen.

133
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,880
I'm coming!

134
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,714
Bye!

135
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:26,178
<i>He stayed so long,</i>
 <i>the mouse began to forget</i>

136
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:30,766
 <i>he had been a knight once</i>
 <i>somewhere else.</i>

137
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,825
You can't keep hanging
around Cuddledown.

138
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,410
With Bess and the girls
staying with Harris,

139
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,494
it ought to be condemned.

140
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,204
It has, like,
one creaky floorboard.

141
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,873
Your granddad wants you
at breakfast.

142
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,416
You need to connect
with the family,

143
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,250
put on a smile.

144
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,251
I'm not hungry.

145
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,836
I don't care.

146
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,588
Hey! Hey! Hey!

147
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,047
My friend Alice just called.

148
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,799
She was on a charter
to Nantucket yesterday

149
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,260
and saw you literally
jump off a cliff.

150
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,223
You will have breakfast
with your family,

151
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,059
and then you are going
to go to your room and think,

152
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,186
because you are grounded.

153
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,520
Oh, so now this whole place

154
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,897
is like a prison or something?

155
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,732
Yeah, correct,
with five beaches,

156
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,483
unlimited crab cakes,
and an on-call tennis pro.

157
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,861
And I am the warden
who won't let her child

158
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,196
indulge a death wish.

159
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,488
What a tyrant.

160
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,575
I should call Dr. Moriarty,

161
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:12,993
have him put you
on some kind of hold.

162
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:13,994
You are not OK.

163
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,829
Cadence, leaping to your death?

164
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,123
What did Grandad do when
he found out about me and Gat?

165
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:24,213
I made that jump because I was
trying to trigger memories.

166
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,380
Oh, my God.

167
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,506
Who knows what
I'll have to try next

168
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,549
if you don't just tell me?

169
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,717
Cadence.

170
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,843
I mean,
could someone have hit me?

171
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,386
Was I the victim of a crime?

172
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,888
Crime? On Beechwood?

173
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:33,847
Come on, Cady.

174
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,973
Did Harris freak out?

175
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,642
Did he find me and Gat together

176
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:39,561
and then push me head-first
into the sea, half-dressed?

177
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,439
I mean, what happened
the night of my accident, Mom?

178
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,440
Just tell me!

179
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,608
I have told you!

180
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,987
I have told you
everything that I know

181
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,324
over and over again,
every day in the hospital,

182
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,993
every time you asked!

183
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,541
And every time,
you had an episode,

184
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,545
you got so sick,
and then you slept,

185
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,882
and then you woke up,
and you asked again!

186
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,344
I am your mother, Cady.

187
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,137
You can't...

188
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,432
you cannot ask me
to cause you pain.

189
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,602
You are doing this
to yourself, Cady.

190
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,313
It is your own broken brain

191
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,191
that is the enemy
you are raging against, not me.

192
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,360
You're lying.

193
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,780
I don't believe you.

194
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,412
Just go to your room.

195
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,969
Making an escape?

196
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,513
You wanna drive?

197
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,514
Still no.

198
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,390
Always no.

199
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,683
All right.

200
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:00,809
Whoa.

201
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,643
Where are you headed?

202
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,894
I need to get online.

203
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,314
At least Google
can't gaslight me.

204
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,273
New Clairmont has Wi-Fi.

205
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,649
New Clairmont has my mother.

206
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,068
You can't look at screens
without having a whole episode.

207
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:10,944
OK.

208
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,279
Then I'll have an episode, Gat,

209
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,948
a level 11 meltdown
in front of all of Edgartown.

210
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,408
I will puke
and foam at the mouth

211
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,201
and give them even more
to gossip about.

212
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,497

221
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,893
Yeah, I know,

222
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,728
because of your straight-up
scary competitive streak.

223
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,063
You love it.

224
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,272
All right, all right, hold on.

225
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,817
I got you something.

226
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,451
"Cady, I thought nothing
was better than chocolate.

227
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,078

228
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,329
"Love, Gat."

229
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,249
Hey, Gat.

230
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,418
Harris wants to talk to you.

231
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,170
He's in his study.

232
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,296
What?

233
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,130
Why?

234
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,760
The silent treatment? Still?

235
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,928
Yeah, if I'm silent,

236
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,638
it's so that you don't go
blabbing my business

237
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,598
to the whole fucking
universe, Cady.

238
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,312
It's fine.

239
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,522
I'll go talk to Harris.

240
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,111
Yeah.

241
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,781
Hello, young man.

242
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,241
Close the door.

243
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,206
What do you think?

244
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,624
I'm not really a gun guy.

245
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,875
No, me neither.

246
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,421
I had Senator Carlisle
barred from poker night

247
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,631
when he took that NRA money.

248
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,967
Yeah, but this...

249
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,343
this isn't just a gun.

250
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,804
This is history.

251
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,850
Philip Schuyler gave this
to Hamilton.

252
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,393
Recently came up at auction.

253
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,646
Listen, Mr. Sinclair,
I'm sorry if...

254
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,897
Sit.

255
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:24,494
So, young man,

256
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,204
what are your intentions?

257
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,289
My what?

258
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,249
In life.

259
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,251
Your value on this planet.

260
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:37,048
Mm, I'd like to be
a journalist.

261
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,258
- A foreign correspondent...
- Oh.

262
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,092
...actually.

263
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,385
Is that right?

264
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,347
It's important work.

265
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,515
Grueling.

266
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,184
At times, dangerous.

267
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,311
Not for the faint of heart.

268
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,439
I know that, sir,

269
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:57,360
but I want to tell
the untold stories,

270
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,654
stories that don't make it
across oceans.

271
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,866
I want to give people a voice.

272
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,410
Ambitious.

273
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,912
Dad?

274
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,750
Oh, we have a visitor.

275
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,627
Oh, indeed.

276
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:14,794
Come in.

277
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,463
Hello. It's me.

278
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,297
I'm the visitor.

279
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,299
Uh...

280
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,009
Nice sweater, kiddo.

281
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,012
Mom.

282
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,222
Well, don't I get a hug?

283
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,848
- Hi.
- Honey.

284
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,433
Hello.

285
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,859
God, I really hoped this
tradition would die with Mom.

286
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,698
The silent treatment?

287
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:44,866
Still?

288
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,077
You threatened to expose me.

289
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,120
Oh, Bess.

290
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,373
I mean, technically, you...

291
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,083
...exposed yourself.

292
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,793
Come on, it was friendly fire.

293
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,753
Yeah, friendly now,

294
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,005
because with
my husband's implosion

295
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,259
and Carrie nearly letting
the two male heirs drown,

296
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,635
you're Dad's favorite again.

297
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,595
Eh. That was short-lived.

298
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,806
Last night, he informed me
that I have failed to protect

299
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,058
his precious first grandchild.

300
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,476
Protect her from what?

301
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,814
I'm not complaining.

302
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,899
They dropped me off
at the service dock,

303
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,401
so I haven't seen any...

304
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,237

00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,677
You said you don't know
what happened to me

332
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,137
alone in the water that night.

333
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:29,971

334
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,681

00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,372
people are staring.

00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,504
Maybe we should save this

346
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,757
We can come back

as long as it takes.

364
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,529
Mm, the knight mouse will be
missed by his family

365
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,531
if he never leaves
the princess's side.

366
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:57,327
My mom is highly adaptable,
so we're good.

367
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,162
She visited last summer.

368
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,455
Do you remember any of that?

369
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,626
Kind of.

370
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,586
Mm, the lemon hunt.

371
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,088
Mm, yeah.

372
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,925
I suddenly saw Beechwood
and the whole Sinclair thing

373
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,093
through her eyes.

374
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,887
It was a lot.

375
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,517
All right.

376
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,684
Gather round, everyone.

377
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,685
All right. Excited?

378
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,979
The time has come.

379
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,273
All right now.

380
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:31,611
As usual, there are
200 lemons hidden and one lime.

381
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,655
None on rooftops
or in brambles.

382
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,365
Mm, those are the old rules.

383
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,826
This time, all's fair.

384
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,577
No rules.

385
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,205
It's like an Easter egg hunt.

386
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,667
Thank you.

387
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,085
- Sounds incredibly...
- Now...

388
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,086
...wholesome.

389
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,587
...for the prizes.

390
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,714
The one who finds
the most lemons

391
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,217
will win the Boston house.

392
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,930
Are you OK?

393
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,266
Sorry, just choked
on my edible orchid.

394
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,017
And should you find the lime,

395
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:07,397
I will name you
the sole recipient

396
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,899
of Beechwood upon my death.

397
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,359
- Dad.
- No.

398
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,485
What? Is he joking?

399
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,030
We'll begin on my signal...

400
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,032
...and you'll know it
when you hear it.

401
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,117
And for now...

402
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,535
Is he serious?

403
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,745
...enjoy the food.

404
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,997
You'll need your strength.

405
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:24,956
Dad.

406
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,084
Come on.

407
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,419
So like an Easter egg hunt.

408
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,503
That's not usually
what happens.

409
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,716
Cadence. Cadence.

410
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:35,800
Come here. Excuse me.

411
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,176
- Cadence.
- Mom.

412
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,219
It's OK. Come here, come here.

413
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,846
Listen to me. Listen to me.

414
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,014
We are at a disadvantage

415
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:41,848
because there are
only two of us.

416
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,725
Let go of my arm.

417
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,393
Look, we don't need
an entire island.

418
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,186
We have Windermere.

419
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,188
Oh, babe, did you know

420
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,773
your grandfather has
two brothers?

421
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:51,858
No.

422
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,443
Because Harris inherited
the island,

423
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,944
and he exiled his brothers.

424
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,405
I mean, do you think that
when Johnny is 60

425
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,198
and he has his own grandkids
filling up the place,

426
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,409
he's going to want
to invite you and yours?

427
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,952
Will Mirren?

428
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,454
Mom, that's, like,
a million years away.

429
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,830
Yeah, well, time flies.

430
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,248
Come on, you think
I haven't noticed

431
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,374
you've been avoiding
your cousins?

432
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,668
What, is there tension
in Liar Land?

433
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,004
Childhood friendship
only lasts so long.

434
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,340
Then you remember
that you're a family.

435
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,966
Some part of you must
want to see their faces

436
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:17,842
when you beat them.

437
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,639
Mom, what is Maya doing here?

438
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,223
I don't know.

439
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,975
She always turned down
our invitations.

440
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,977
Then today,
she texts from the marina

441
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,313
she's here, so I sent a boat.

442
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,356
It's very awkward.

443
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,482
Well, yeah.

444
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,525
You did dump
her dead husband's brother.

445
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,278
Listen.

446
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,529
The lemons...

447
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:43,451
A win for you or me or Will,

448
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,621
it could actually set us free.

449
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:47,789
It could.

450
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,667
Just try.

451
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,168
OK.

452
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,628
And island for a lime?

453
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,506
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

454
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:57,757
And I hear a lot of shit.

455
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,050
I know.

456
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,094
Psychological warfare.

457
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,428
And I don't wanna play.

458
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,763
Yeah, yeah.

459
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,932
On one hand, I get that.

460
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,100
On the other hand,

461
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,060
you could go to sleep tonight
owning all this.

462
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,145
No, not me.

463
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,939
I don't think
I've ever won ever.

464
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,858
I'm always out-strategized.

465
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,027
And plus, when I fail today,

466
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,738
it'll just give my mom
another reason to hate me.

467
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:26,035
You know, what your mother did
was fucked up.

468
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,370
But in my experience,

469
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,871
everyone's fucked up
in one way or another.

470
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,166
And hurt people hurt people.

471
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,085
And if someone doesn't break
that cycle of hurt,

472
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,796
then it just goes on forever.

473
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,549
At least, it did in my family.

474
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,885
So, you know, you could...

475
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,345
you could reason
with your mother.

476
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,140
Just saying you could.

477
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,850
Or you can say fuck it.

478
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,268
I'll call out of work later.

479
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,936
You come over
to the seasonal worker bunks,

480
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,813
use me as a sex object.

481
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,814
Mm.

482
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,695
Yeah, abandoning the lemon hunt

483
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,698
would definitely be
the ultimate act of rebellion.

484
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,034
Before this summer, I never
actually wanted to rebel.

485
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,870
I wanted to be
the perfect Sinclair,

486
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,122
like my mom,

487
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,498
like Cady.

488
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,835
I try so hard, but...

489
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,546
they seem to only notice
when I mess up.

490
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,427
I could kill anyone who made
you feel like that, Mirren.

491
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:27,680
Yeah, you probably could.

492
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,765
You're really muscly.

493
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,183
OK.

494
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,517
All right, all right.

495
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,145
Look, so here it is.

496
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,813
You talk to your mother,

497
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,232
you run away
with the water taxi driver,

498
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,026
or there is a third option.

499
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,070
I fling myself into the sea.

500
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,863
Show your mom
she's wrong about you.

501
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,616
You find all the motherfucking
citrus on this island.

502
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,411
Can we still do that
other thing tomorrow?

503
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,704
Yes.

504
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,299
Yep, that's his new bell.

505
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,801
God.

506
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,386
Right. Right.

507
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,305
Well, yeah.
Tomorrow's great.

508
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,932
Good. Yeah, great.

509
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,558
Go on.

510
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,434
I'll find these fucking lemons.

511
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,603

What will you even do
with a dusty old house, hmm?

533
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,030
But if you give me your lemons,

534
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,574
I'll give you
whatever you want.

535
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:10,449
William.

536
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,368
William, William, William.

537
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,287
That mega sprayer Nerf gun?

538
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,039
Mom says it perpetuates
American violence worship.

539
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,791
But I'm not Mom.

540
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,626
I'm your desperate
delinquent brother.

541
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,005
Pleasure doing
business with you.

542
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,006
Good boy.

543
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:26,215
Lemons, basket.

544
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,594
Liberty,
I know that Bess took away

545
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:32,805
your limited edition
Hailey Bieber peptide lip tint.

546
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,724
I'll get you five.

547
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,267
Throw in a pound of fudge.

548
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,518
Money in the bank.
Put it right there.

549
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,436
Thank you.

550
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,687
Lemons, basket.

551
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:40,605
Bonnie.

552
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,814
Bonnie, Bonnie, Bonnie.

553
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:42,815
Let's do this.

554
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,358
What do you need?

555
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:47,403
I want a sacrificial
altar knife for my spells.

556
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,113
 <i>♪ I did, I did ♪</i>

557
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,865
OK, deal. Great.

558
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,074
Let's do this.

559
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,327
 <i>♪ I did ♪♪</i>

560
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,829
Should we?

561
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,000
Sinclairs are
really competitive,

562
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,127
so I usually sit it out.

563
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,462
Have you ever won?

564
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:07,173
The first year,
I found the lime.

565
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,258
Johnny cried, though.

566
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:12,053
So Harris decided
to split the fudge

567
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,138
on account
of suspected cheating.

568
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,640
- Oh, Gat.
- Oh, whatever.

569
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,682
It's fine.

570
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,975
It's just candy.

571
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:21,437
Gat, can we acknowledge

572
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,522
how absolutely batshit
these people are?

573
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,025
Trading mansions as if
they're Monopoly properties?

574
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,944
Mom, they're not
always like this.

575
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:28,986
And they're not all like this.

576
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,446
I swear.

577
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,697
This isn't normal.

578
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:41,165
When Ed first brought you here,
I was in a bad place.

579
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:44,377
Still figuring out how to exist
without your father.

580
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:50,299
I thought it would be good
if you got away from me.

581
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,762
Look, I'll admit,

582
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:57,515
having you here, away
from our sticky, tiny apartment

583
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,850
in the summer months,
it helped.

584
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,602
And you looked so happy
in those pictures.

585
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:02,603
But this?

586
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,689
This is like some <i>Knives Out</i>

587
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,524
meets <i>Get Out</i> shit.

588
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,902
Look at you.

589
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,071
You're wearing pastels.

590
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,572
You're talking different.

591
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,324
You're not wearing
the earring I hate.

592
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,329
You're code switching

593
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,206
because you don't belong
with these people.

594
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,416
Mom, I know that.

595
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,960
What, you think
I don't know that?

596
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,169
I just don't care.

597
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,254
I'm sorry.

598
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,883
I want to be where Cady is.

599
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,901
No, no. Don't you dare!

600
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:51,861
Don't you...

601
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,279
Oh, my God!

602
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,323
There's no hitting
in the lemon hunt.

603
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,283
Well, technically,
that was Mom's rule.

604
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,785
Dad apparently has
chosen violence.

605
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,537
Still, have some decorum,
Penny.

606
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,913
Oh, unclench, Bess.

607
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,207
Clearly, your fishmonger
is doing a terrible job

608
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,752
of clearing out your cobwebs.

609
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:12,548
Salty Dan?

610
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,549
You didn't.

611
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,925
Mirren saw.

612
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,177
- She didn't.
- Mm.

613
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:17,762
I'm not the one who spent
the early aughts

614
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,013
sucking dealer dick for coke.

615
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,806
Stop.

616
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,267
Yes, Bess, stop.

617
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,144
Carrie scored the classy way,

618
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,313
doctor hopping
and raiding medicine cabinets

619
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,647
at dinner parties.

620
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,442
Would you just shut up,
both of you?

621
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,070
I'm so sick of you
belittling my sobriety.

622
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,448
The addiction was not my fault.

623
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,116
They teach you that
at Silver Hill

624
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,369
or at the Newport Institute
for Change?

625
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:44,663
Actually,
I learned that from Ed

626
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,750
when I learned that I was
capable of being happy.

627
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,252
But that's a foreign concept
for the two of you.

628
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,171
I'm perfectly happy,
thank you very much.

629
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,257
You can't stand yourself.

630
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,426
Neither can you.

631
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,762
I'm perfectly confident
in who I am.

632
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,138
Yeah?

633
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,057
Because from here,
it seems like you spend

634
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,684
half of your time
trying to be our mom

635
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,063
and the other half trying to be
a dead 11-year-old girl.

636
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:13,067
So who are you?

637
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,737
Oh, I'm sorry.

638
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,781
Do you want me to have
a panic attack?

639
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,200
Is that gonna make you feel
less alone in your unraveling?

640
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,038
Oh, this used to be fun.

641
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,340
Oh, my God.

642
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,509
Help...help me!

643
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:39,510
Hey!

644
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,553
Ha-ha.

645
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:41,804
Bess, stop it!

646
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:42,721
Mine.

647
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,265
Decorum, Bess.

648
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,933
Mine.
Mine.

649
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,101
Oh, my God.

650
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,644
Stop.

651
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,146
Put them in my...Bess.

652
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,105
Yeah?

653
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,194
Carrie?

654
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,404
What's happening?

655
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,363
What is she doing?

656
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,990
Carrie. Carrie.

657
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,616
Carrie, stop.

658
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,415
- Move along!
- Nothing to see here.

659
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,083
- Just move along.
- Go on.

660
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,418

Poor strategy.

679
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,365
- My fruit, fuck face!
- Ah!

680
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,908
Ah! Get off me.

681
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,243
- Give it!
- Get off me!

682
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:28,285
Don't even fuck...

683
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,203
Get off me, you rabid...

684
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,955
Give me that fucking fruit!

685
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,501
Thanks for the assist.

686
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,710
- No!
- That's mine!

687
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,795
I saw it first!

688
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:38,837
Follow-through is everything.

689
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,880
I worked for that!

690
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:42,841
I'm so sick of everything
coming to you so easy

691
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,968
all the time!

692
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,844
All of us can't all be
such try-hards.

693
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,845
Oh!

694
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,138
- Stop!
- Ha-ha-ha!

695
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,265
Johnny!

696
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:50,516
Give that to me.

697
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,517
Get off me!

698
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,893
Come on, give it!
Give me the lemon!

699
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:53,894
No, don't!

700
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,020
This actually
matters to me, OK?

701
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,105
Why?

702
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,565
So you can turn
the Boston house into

703
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,191
- your fucking stoner cave?
- Yeah? Oh, yeah?

704
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,151
You're worried that he's not
going to pay for your rent

705
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,653
whenever you don't make it
as a starving artist?

706
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,238
- Oh, no, fuck you!
- So immature.

707
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:06,699
What are you doing?

708
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,995
You sound like your moms.

709
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,967
Fuck.

710
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,261
Gat.

711
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:28,804
You just won Beechwood.

712
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:29,972
No, I didn't.

713
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,099
You did.

714
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:32,933
I can't win.

715
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,476
You all know I can't win.

716
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,731
Look...look at yourselves.
Look at us.

717
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:39,940
We used to be best friends.

718
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,317
And now you're...
now you're hurling

719
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,693
the worst insults you can,
and why?

720
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,987
Why, because of an old man's
power trip?

721
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,533
Where was it?

722
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,910
Harris had it the whole time.

723
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,246
He was never gonna
surrender Beechwood.

724
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,456
He thinks he's a king.

725
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:56,582
He needs his kingdom.

726
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,125
And he doesn't...
he doesn't care

727
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,460
if people are miserable in it.

728
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,628
He doesn't care
as long as people

729
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:03,797
are miserable under his power.

730
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,175
And everybody seems
pretty miserable.

731
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,971
You guys are playing
right into it.

732
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,892
Right.

733
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,938
I'm really sorry about
everything that I said.

734
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,357
I really didn't mean any of it.

735
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:22,816
No, no, no. You were right.

736
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:27,029
Because I was
so wrapped up in myself, I...

737
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,656
I'm so sorry.

738
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,116
Come here.

739
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,035
I love you.

740
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,662
I accept both your apologies.

741
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,166
No, seriously, though, um,

742
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,543
I've been shit to all of you.

743
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,338
I'm sorry.

744
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,547
Deeply, deeply sorry.

745
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,715
I'm sorry.

746
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,643
Forgive me, Gatwick.

747
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,146
We all...

748
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:11,615
Well, Liars,
life's given us lemons.

749
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,458
Your dad is counting lemons
in the living room...

750
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,043
one of the living rooms.

751
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,796
Your living room has
living rooms.

752
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,756
It's called the Great Room.

753
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,093
I know.

754
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,303
I heard it as I said it.

755
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,099
Do you want some of this?

756
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,769
Ice cream is always the cure.

757
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,026
Is he eating?

758
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,488
If you count Takis Fuego

759
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,366
from the hotel
vending machine, sure.

760
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,035
I didn't mean to hurt him.

761
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,579
Mm, and yet...

762
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,039
Sorry.

763
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,249
No.

764
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,001
Sorry.

765
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,837
My husband is no longer here
to defend his kid brother,

766
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:10,132
so it falls to me.

767
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:15,262
I had to choose between

768
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:19,933
being the kind of parent
that my kids needed me to be

769
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:23,061
and being the partner
that Ed deserved.

770
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,899
And it wasn't a choice.

771
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:33,530
He's better off without me,
without all of this.

772
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,911
Sometimes I wonder
if I would have had kids

773
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:43,332
if I knew
what it would be like.

774
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:46,084
Who would volunteer
to love something so fiercely

775
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,171
that you just let it
consume you whole?

776
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,923
And then I hate myself
for thinking that way,

777
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:55,636
because who thinks like that
about their own kids?

778
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,811
When Jay died,

779
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:07,481
oh, I fell apart.

780
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,608
Some days, I would just
stare at this little boy

781
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:13,111
who looked so much like him

782
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:17,115
and love him so hard, it hurt.

783
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,201
So hard I thought
it was gonna kill me.

784
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,455
That's the thing.

785
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,834
Motherhood is filled with hurt.

786
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:30,671
It's like your heart outside
your body while you bleed.

787
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,884
Mom, it's your turn
for the count.

788
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,014
I'm so tired.

789
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,484
Seven.

790
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,655
Where are the Liars?

791
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:57,698
Right here.

792
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,285
Couldn't find any lemons.

793
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,578
Yeah, me neither.

794
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:03,537
No lemons.

795
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,791
Oh.

796
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,959
I found a few.

797
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,336
Oh, my God.

798
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,117
You Liars.

799
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:46,204
I suppose it's my own fault
that you are so clever.

800
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,750
Sinclair genes.

801
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,335
Mm.

802
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:56,214
Well, then, clearly,
rules have been violated,

803
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,801
so the prizes are void.

804
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,933
But I do have something
valuable to offer Gat.

805
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:12,022
You, um...
you have such ambition.

806
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:15,400
But you can't change the world
without opportunity.

807
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,695
Now, Tipper's
scholarship program

808
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:22,115
was her pet project,
a chance for high-achievers

809
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:25,869
to travel the world,
pursue an immersive education

810
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:30,666
while making a positive impact
on refugee communities.

811
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,584
She'd already chosen
this year's recipients,

812
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,837
of course,
but there's an opening.

813
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,340
Now, there are several
candidates vying for it,

814
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,634
so this isn't a handout.

815
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,678
I don't do handouts.

816
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:46,932
But I do make recommendations.

817
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:51,436
Now, you have an interview
the morning after next

818
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:55,565
back in New York,
if you're interested.

819
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,589

821
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,140
Oh.

822
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,099
Hi.

823
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,267
Were you crying?

824
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,309
No, no, no.

825
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,896
I was just washing my face.

826
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:37,941
You know, you should wear
the, uh...

827
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,818
the jacket you wore
to the funeral

828
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:40,902
for your interview.

829
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:41,778
You looked so...

830
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,990
I'm not doing the interview.

831
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,658
Don't want to owe Harris
anything.

832
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,036
It's not his program.

833
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,704
It's Tipper's.

834
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:52,414
And she would want you
to be a part of it.

835
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,082
You wouldn't owe him anything.

836
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,126
I would.

837
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,920
Look, he said there were
other candidates, right?

838
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,923
So you'll earn it
for yourself at that interview.

839
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,217
Hey.

840
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,470
You have to try again.

841
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,722
Come on.

842
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,141
Hasn't being around the
Sinclairs taught you anything?

843
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:14,311
Where's your
competitive spirit?

844
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:16,021
You're being incredibly
selfless right now.

845
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,105
I don't like it.

846
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:24,196
Yeah, well, I used to be
pretty selfish.

847
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:28,200
And then this guy
that I'm kind of into

848
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,036
showed me how important
it was to consider

849
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,456
other people's needs
before my wants.

850
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:35,540
Sounds like a dick.

851
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,627
Yeah, well,
he's pretty cute, so.

854
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,136
Oh.

855
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,180
Yeah.

856
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,224

865
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,895
I don't want to hear
the lecture about

00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,523
how it's my fault that
we lost the Boston house.

Cancer?

868
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,203
Mind your business?

869
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,337
You know, I used to think that

870
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:07,591
I knew everything about my mom

871
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:14,014
and that everything she did
was just so flawless

872
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:17,350
in this way that
I could never duplicate.

873
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:22,522
Yeah, I tried, God knows,
but why it came so easy to her

874
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,691
and not me...

875
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:34,993
I used to wonder if
she ever just fucking cried.

876
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,622
I wish I could ask her.

877
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:42,626
Did you ever just lock yourself
in the bathroom and cry, Mom?

878
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:45,462
God, did it ever feel
like this for you?

879
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,552
I never asked.

880
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,346
Now I can't.

881
00:41:56,306 --> 00:42:02,229
And I'm just...

882
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:04,522
so fucking empty.

883
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,406
You made a choice today,
Mirren.

884
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,243
That's fine.

885
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:19,246
It's a big old "fuck you"
to the family.

886
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,791
I really hope your convictions

887
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:28,088
keep you and your sisters warm
this winter,

888
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,423
'cause I don't have
any moves left.

889
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:36,179
The lemons were fucking it.

890
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:01,746
You know, I thought
you might just reinstate

891
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,915
the "no boyfriends
on Beechwood" rule.

892
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,835
But this was impressive.

893
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:09,671
Why make yourself a bad guy
when you can just

894
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,339
show his mother that
he doesn't belong here,

895
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,757
make her drag him away?

896
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,010
I didn't make anyone
do anything.

897
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,388
No, you just dangled
two semesters abroad,

898
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,932
followed by a summer
teaching refugees English,

899
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:24,311
which takes care
of next summer too.

900
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:26,396
It's very elegant, Dad.

901
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,942
Kids are gonna miss him.

902
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,448
Cadence will be just fine.

903
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:39,326
I won't let her make
the same mistakes that you did.

904
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:40,160
Well, that's...

905
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,500
That's for the best.

906
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,090
Love you, Dad.

907
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,300
Mm.

908
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,393
You know,
it might not seem like it,

909
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,897
but I'm glad that you came.

910
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,357
Yeah.

911
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:15,820
Well, when Harris Sinclair
invites you

912
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,280
on a private jet
to the vineyard...

913
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,490
Harris sent for you?

914
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,949
He called.

915
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,495
He thought with Ed gone,
I might wanna check in.

916
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:25,914
I figured you were
homesick or lonely,

917
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:29,501
but apparently, the alien
that's taken over my son's body

918
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,127
is quite happy here.

919
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:38,676
So I don't know
why he invited me.

920
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,761
I do.

921
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,890
I was too happy here.

922
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:56,277
Do you remember the book
Harris told me to read?

923
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,779
 <i>Wuthering Heights?</i>

924
00:44:57,779 --> 00:44:59,906
Yeah.

925
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,908
It's about
a poor brown-skinned boy,

926
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,743
gets taken in by a rich family.

927
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,870
He falls in love
with the daughter

928
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,790
and becomes a gentleman.

929
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:13,253
But everyone somehow still
sees him as an animal.

930
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:18,258
So eventually, he becomes one.

931
00:45:18,258 --> 00:45:23,430
Heathcliff had evil in him,

932
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,014
and you don't.

933
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,061
You're my Gat.

934
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:43,241
What?

935
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,743
I've done fucked up things.

936
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,745
I'm doing something
fucked up now.

937
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:51,666
Will you please not
speak at me like

938
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,878
I'm some error
in your judgment?

939
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,045
Hey.

940
00:45:58,298 --> 00:45:59,424
I love you.

941
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:00,258
I do. I love you.

942
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,134
And I know...

943
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:02,552
I know we don't make any sense.

944
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:04,095
To who?

945
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,014
You might be right
about Harris,

946
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:08,975
but I am the eldest grandchild.

947
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,895
So let's go back to Beechwood,
and I'll fix this.

948
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:13,021
I'll make it better.

949
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,397
At Beechwood?

950
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,899
Where are the boat keys?

951
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:17,400
Boat keys?

952
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,402
Cady, do you know
where you are right now?

953
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,653
Oh...

954
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:23,698
Cady?

955
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,117
Hey, Cadence!

956
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,869
Cadence. Cadence.

957
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:36,920
What happened?

958
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,672
You aren't really making sense.

959
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:42,967
Did I get sick
down by the water?

960
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,761
By the water? No, you...

961
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:46,763
you...you had an episode,

962
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:48,014
but at the bookstore.

963
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,015
The bookstore?

964
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,600
I didn't know how to help you.

965
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,103
So they had to call your mom
to bring you home.

966
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:58,274
What about the ice cream
and the sunset?

967
00:46:58,274 --> 00:46:59,317
Our first date?

968
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,735
There wasn't a date.

969
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,737
We never went for ice cream.

970
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,030
You're...you're scaring me.

971
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:08,034
We've...we've been here talking
since we got back.

972
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,041
Is my mom right?

973
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:17,502
Maybe you should go.

974
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:18,628
I'm not leaving you.

975
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:19,879
I barely know
where I am right now.

976
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,047
Look, I don't care
where you are, right?

977
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,382
I'll follow you there,
and that's it.

978
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,805
Why are you here?

979
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,181
What do you mean,
why am I here?

980
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,975
I'm here for you.

981
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:35,895
No, the scholarship.

982
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,897
You should be gone by now.

983
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,274
You didn't get it?

984
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:45,947
I never made it
to the interview.

985
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,617
We were supposed to leave
the next night,

986
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,494
 <i>but something happened.</i>

987
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:54,706
I called the cab
to the airport.

988
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:55,748
Your mom on her way?

989
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,750
Yeah, as soon as
she gets her eyeliner

990
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,960
even on both sides.

991
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,253
Oh, you might miss
your interview.

992
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,339
Can I ask you something?

993
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:04,382
Yeah.

994
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:07,719
Now that it's over,

995
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,137
do you regret Carrie?

996
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,765
Fuck. Um...

997
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,813
...I regret things.

998
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:21,190
I regret not marrying her
years ago.

999
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:27,196
I regret that when
she was ready to have a baby,

1000
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,365
I said we should wait
until we could afford

1001
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:30,950
to send our kid
to the same schools

1002
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,869
as Will and Johnny went to...

1003
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:40,168
...you know,
without help from Harris.

1004
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:46,507
I thought that I needed
to raise another Sinclair.

1005
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,759
I was too proud.

1006
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:52,972
You think it's, uh...

1007
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:54,390
you think it's too late
for the Liars

1008
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,477
to grow up different
from the rest?

1009
00:48:57,477 --> 00:49:02,065
Mate, I know it feels like
you've lived your entire life,

1010
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:04,567
but you're only 16.

1011
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:08,196
The four of you are
gonna do great things,

1012
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:12,325
and stupid things,
and then greater things.

1013
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,160
You aren't even
an ounce of the person

1014
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,120
you're gonna grow into,

1015
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,039
any of you.

1016
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:22,669
Gat, you have all the time
in the world.

1017
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:27,757
I've got to go.

1018
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,300
Yeah.

1019
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,259
Oh.

1020
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:33,012
