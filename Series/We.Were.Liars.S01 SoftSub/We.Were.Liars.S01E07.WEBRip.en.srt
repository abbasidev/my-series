1
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:10,428
<i>What happened</i>
 <i>the night of my accident, Mom?</i>

2
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:11,637
 <i>Just tell me!</i>

3
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,056
I have told you!
Over and over again!

4
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,934
And every time,
you had an episode.

5
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,103
 <i>You cannot ask me</i>
 <i>to cause you pain.</i>

6
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,396
Is that ivory?

7
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,106
You will want to include them

8
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,566
in an asset inventory, though.

9
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,526
You're changing your will?

10
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,403
To account for
new circumstances.

11
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:28,779
What did you do, Johnny?

12
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,489
<i>This kid, Delgado,</i>
 <i>I kicked his ass.</i>

13
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,866
 <i>I found out he was</i>
 <i>in the hospital.</i>

14
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,702
I called my mom,
and she fixed it.

15
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,620
- She paid him off?
- Yeah.

16
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,957
 <i>But Beaumont has a video, and</i>
 <i>it'll go viral if I don't pay.</i>

17
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,418
I do have something valuable
to offer Gat...

18
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,336
Tipper's scholarship program.

19
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:47,131
You have an interview
back in New York.

20
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,842
Hey, you have to try again.

21
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,013
Cadence will be just fine.

22
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,724
I won't let her make
the same mistakes that you did.

23
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,439
Is someone hurt?
On the island, is someone hurt?

24
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:14,784
I'm scared, Mirren.

25
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:18,037
I don't think my memory
can be trusted.

26
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,790
I think I might be crazy.

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,793
You know, not just
head-injury crazy,

28
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:27,004
but hallucination,
psycho, actual crazy.

29
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,300
I think my mom might be right,
that I'm lying to myself.

30
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,303
I just...I don't
know what's real.

31
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,680
God, reality is overrated.

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,809
I was hoping that you could
confirm or deny some memories.

33
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,560
Sure.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,354
I have these flashes
from Summer 16

35
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,189
that I still can't place.

36
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,899
You filling up
the boat with gas.

37
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,318
 <i>Granddad at the end of summer</i>
 <i>beach bonfire.</i>

38
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,780
 <i>And the four of us</i>
 <i>Liars together.</i>

39
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,493
The four of us.

40
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:01,205
I thought that when Gat left,
I might never see him again,

41
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,415
but he came back, didn't he?

42
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,710
Gat will always come
back for you, Cady.

43
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,839
I heard the two of you at
Cuddledown the other night.

44
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,424
Stop.

45
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,927
Cady, I think you
should leave him alone.

46
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,392
That's just...
making things harder.

47
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:22,476
How?

48
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:25,896
I love him.

49
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:26,897
I don't want...

50
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,982
You know I've always loved him.

51
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,441
No, I just don't
want either of you guys

52
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,860
to get hurt, that's all.

53
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,695
Look, Gat is
worth the risk, okay?

54
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:38,117
My whole life is pills
and headaches and my mom and...

55
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,285
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,744
...he is the only thing that...

57
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,997
I can't...I can't
feel sorry for you.

58
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:46,458
You're the first
Sinclair grandchild.

59
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,586
You have money.
You have a doctor.

60
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,421
You have education.

61
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,591
It's not like you're dying
of cancer or anything, so.

62
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,760
Everything's possible for you.

63
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,940
Bonnie.

64
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,442
The sun. You're blocking it.

65
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,860
You're turning red.

66
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,028
Hi, Bonnie.

67
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,660
Cady, tell me a ghost story.

68
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,371
I'm fresh out. Ask Mirren.

69
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,831
Hilarious.

70
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,333
I tried to tell
her one last night.

71
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,335
I messed up the narratives.

72
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:30,669
I was too tired.

73
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,338
Cadence, you also
know that you're

74
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,256
the only source of
entertainment on this island.

75
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,760
Come on.

76
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,844
Fine.

77
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:45,184
There was once a king with
three beautiful princesses.

78
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,061
Not a fairy tale...

79
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,354
a horror story.

80
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:52,441
I promise, this one gets scary.

81
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,069
Cadence, I'm heading to town.

82
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,029
Join me.

83
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:00,115
Um...just me?

84
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,367
Come on, let's go.

85
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,246
See you guys later.

86
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,300
Hi.

87
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:26,100
"Proceeds to Martha's
Vineyard Migrants."

88
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,561
I know you can't resist
a charitable cause.

89
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:33,190
Licorice, that's your
favorite, isn't it?

90
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,817
It's lemon cream.

91
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,568
Then lemon cream it is.

92
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,114
Yep, lemon cream it is.

93
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,157
- Here we go.
- All right.

94
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,283
Thank you.

95
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,159
Thank you.

96
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,958
- Oh.
- What?

97
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,961
So that's what this is about.

98
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,921
You brought me
to go see a doctor?

99
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,882
You've seen every doctor
in New England.

100
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,385
No, I'm gonna go in
and say hello to Moriarty.

101
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,303
He's an old friend.

102
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,263
I'll just...

103
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,224
I'll meet you, uh...

104
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,726
here.
Here.

105
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,979
I'll meet you at the bookstore.

106
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,607
My mom says
I shouldn't be left alone

107
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,735
since I had that episode.

108
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,448
Look.

109
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:32,124
I made a mistake with your
mother and her sisters.

110
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,877
I let them squander
their opportunity,

111
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:38,255
choose unworthy partners,

112
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,883
dig themselves into deep holes
with their silver spoons.

113
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:41,884
But not you.

114
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,220
You're the first grandchild.

115
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,264
You are a fresh chance.

116
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,391
And you are of sound mind.

117
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,271
And I expect you
to act accordingly.

118
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,189
Understood?

119
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,486
Can't just outclass PTSD.

120
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:03,238
Combat veterans have PTSD.

121
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,867
You have a lack
of guff and gall.

122
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,789
Lemon cream.

123
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,791
Your favorite.

124
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,292
Have one.

125
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,020
<i>There was once a king</i>

126
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,232
 <i>whose island was under siege.</i>

127
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,693
 <i>A fire-breathing dragon</i>
 <i>was burning his villages.</i>

128
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,656
 <i>And every brave warrior</i>
 <i>he sent to slay the beast</i>

129
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,075
 <i>was slaughtered.</i>

130
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,368
 <i>The king reasoned</i>

131
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,954
 <i>that while all</i>
 <i>the armored knights failed,</i>

132
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,915
 <i>a beautiful maiden might</i>
 <i>melt the dragon's heart.</i>

133
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,461
 <i>Luckily, he had</i>
 <i>three daughters.</i>

134
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,424
 <i>First, he sent his strongest</i>
 <i>daughter to face the dragon.</i>

135
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,052
 <i>She went gladly</i>
 <i>to save the kingdom.</i>

136
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,806
 <i>Its claws shredded her</i>
 <i>to pieces.</i>

137
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,391
 <i>So he sent his</i>
 <i>sweetest daughter,</i>

138
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,186
 <i>who was glad to earn his love,</i>
 <i>to beg the dragon for mercy.</i>

139
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,981
 <i>It swallowed her in one bite.</i>

140
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,692
 <i>The king turned</i>
 <i>to his eldest daughter.</i>

141
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:25,279
 <i>She saw his grief</i>
 <i>and was eager to please him,</i>

142
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,489
 <i>to save his crops</i>
 <i>and strongholds.</i>

143
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,868
 <i>The dragon turned her</i>
 <i>to ashes.</i>

144
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,536
<i>♪ He will not</i>
 <i>weather it ♪</i>

145
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,038
 <i>♪ Like that man ♪</i>

146
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,790
Oh, good, you found
the new dress I got you.

147
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,666
Do you like it?

148
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,127
I don't need more dresses.

149
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,963
I was trying to make you smile.

150
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,090
You don't despair
over boys, Cadence.

151
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,967
It's pitiful.
Sinclairs are not pitied.

152
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,928
Gat is gone.

153
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,181
Can I have two minutes
of despair

154
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,682
before I have to
put my chin up?

155
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,309
Or you could be happy for him.

156
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,977
Grateful to your granddad
for giving him

157
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,562
such an amazing opportunity,

158
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,314
even after you all
disrespected Tipper's

159
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,732
favorite summer tradition.

160
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,692
Granddad is the one
who ruined the lemon hunt

161
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,402
with all those crazy prizes.

162
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,570
He is a capitalist.

163
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,655
He just believes that
competition makes

164
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,073
the best people rise
to the top.

165
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,327
That's why I need you
to be at your best tonight.

166
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,913
Look, he's been
revising his will.

167
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,706
Given the way he
tested us at the hunt,

168
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,708
I think he plans
to leave all of it

169
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,170
to one favored daughter
or grandchild.

170
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,174
Don't you ever get sick
of being a Sinclair?

171
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,303
You say that like
we have a choice.

172
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,099
We will always be Sinclairs.

173
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,727
The only choice that you have

174
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,230
is if you will be a Sinclair
fallen from grace,

175
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,108
a pitied, poor little rich girl
whose newfound misfortune

176
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,487
thrills the teeming masses,
or if you will be

177
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,614
a Sinclair with potential.

178
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,451
You wanna make a difference
in the world, Cadence?

179
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,786
Great.

180
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,079
Build orphanages.

181
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,789
Fund social justice movements.

182
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,249
Topple evil empires.

183
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,334
But honey, you are gonna need
a lot of money

184
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,002
to get that done.

185
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:10,175
I am only asking you to be your
polite, lovely,

186
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:15,305
intelligent self to ease your
grandfather's heartache...

187
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,600
and to remind him how much
you miss Tipper.

188
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,270
I do miss her.

189
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,565
Lemons always make me
think of her.

190
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,319
Hmm.

191
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,782
You know, you're making
feelings I actually have

192
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,826
feel very cheap.

193
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,458
Nothing on Beechwood is cheap.

194
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,965
<i>The question,</i>
 <i>of course, is this.</i>

195
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,301
 <i>Who really killed</i>
 <i>the princesses?</i>

196
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,220
 <i>The dragon or the king?</i>

197
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,306
<i>♪ Every time ♪</i>

198
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,891
 <i>♪ I burn through the world</i>
 <i>I'd see ♪</i>

199
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,852
 <i>♪ That the world ♪</i>

200
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:05,230
 <i>♪ It burns through me ♪♪</i>

201
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,274
Don't. Don't do that.

202
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,692
What?

203
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,193
Don't be gentle with me.

204
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,532
I'm going into battle today.

205
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,161
I don't need to be coddled.

206
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,207
I need to be provoked.

207
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,404
Mom, you're bleeding.

208
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,618
Wear a jacket
to dinner tonight, okay?

209
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:45,205
You rattled Harris
with that lemon hunt stunt.

210
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,749
Now the summer is ending,
and with it, any opportunity

211
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,209
to win back favors.

212
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,419
And if we can't win him over?

213
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:55,465
If it's...if it's gone
too far already, what?

214
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,092
Then what?

215
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,303
When you were born, he called
you his bright young heir.

216
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,306
Said that you were made
in his image or...

217
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,891
some bullshit like that.

218
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,351
I'm not, though.

219
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,312
I'm not like him.

220
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,608
I'm different from Harris, Mom.

221
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,280
I don't think I'm the type of
Sinclair boy that he wants.

222
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,239
I'm saying...

223
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,075
I wanna
tell you something, Mom.

224
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,160
And it's...

225
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,453
Stop, stop.

226
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:34,421
Johnny, we can have
this conversation tomorrow.

227
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,173
I promise.

228
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:39,759
Right now, I have
to get Will packed.

229
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,927
I...it's just...

230
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,738
You can talk to me about it.

231
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,789
I think you're
a good Sinclair boy.

232
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,917
Just so you know.

233
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,883
Thanks, buddy. Thanks a lot.

234
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,970
It's okay. Everything's cool.

235
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,971
I love you.

236
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,389
Love you too.

237
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,278
I know.
I'm gonna get ready for dinner.

238
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,656
No, the twins are
looking for you.

239
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,658
Your dad's taking them
to camp for the weekend.

240
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,537
What happened? Did you fall?

241
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,291
Oh, um, no. I'm okay.

242
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,336
The staff hasn't been tending
to the tennis courts properly.

243
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,296
I swear they're getting lazier.

244
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,130
Here.

245
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,300
Take these to the family dock.

246
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,468
You can probably
still catch them.

247
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,554
I'm good.

248
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,806
Your sisters wanna say
goodbye to you, Mirren.

249
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,058
Yeah, well,
I don't wanna see Dad.

250
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,024
Your hair looks nice today.

251
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,163
Hey, light.

252
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,375
- There you go.
- Yeah.

253
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,752
I know he had to go, but...

254
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,504
I keep looking
out at the water,

255
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,340
thinking maybe he'll change
his mind and come back.

256
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,219
Blame fairy tales.

257
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,143
Well, it's time for dinner.

258
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,396
With a side of
extreme scrutiny.

259
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,733
I feel like we're
walking into a tribunal.

260
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,026
I feel like summer ending

261
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,736
is the end of days
for our mothers.

262
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,697
Well, at least Gat
is spared this one.

263
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,201
There were summers before Gat.

264
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,870
And there will
be summers after.

265
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,147
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

266
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,402
Thank you.

267
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,404
Oh, thank you. Sherry.

268
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,327
Well, you all look lovely.

269
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,996
All right, sit.

270
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:26,361
What a relief to finally
have the island to ourselves.

271
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,654
It's better this way.

272
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,364
I'm sure you agree.

273
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,702
Just us.

274
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,170
We're missing
the smallest Sinclairs.

275
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,717
I assume they didn't cast out,
unsupervised, to the sea.

276
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,636
The twins have their horse camp
in Boston, remember?

277
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,596
Uh, Will wanted to go,
too, so we signed him up,

278
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,724
and Brody took them
earlier today.

279
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,436
And why didn't one of you
escort the kids to camp?

280
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,520
We thought that
you wouldn't want us

281
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,564
to miss this family dinner.

282
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,650
Well, is this particular dinner
important for some reason

283
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,318
that I am unaware of?

284
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:11,239
So important that you would
entrust your children to him?

285
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,367
Well, they're his children.

286
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,493
Will's not.

287
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,619
Dad made a mistake.

288
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,413
It's not like he's gonna
traffic the twins

289
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,748
to make good with the IRS.

290
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,957
Come on.

291
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,459
Okay, look.

292
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,962
I hold members of this family
to a high standard.

293
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,965
Mirren, your father,
he didn't accidentally

294
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,926
steal from his clients
and from the trust fund

295
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,054
that I worked hard to provide
to you and your mother.

296
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,016
Brody schemed and lied.

297
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,685
A mistake is made one time...
when made repeatedly,

298
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,103
it becomes a pattern.

299
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,856
And patterns of behavior
define character.

300
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,483
Thus, he is a criminal.

301
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,611
Isn't that right, Bess?

302
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,452
You don't have to worry
about Mirren, Dad.

303
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,829
She knows right from wrong.

304
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,624
I'm a very hands-on parent.

305
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,084
I really learned from
watching Carrie's struggles.

306
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,712
Excuse me?

307
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,297
Oh, that's not
a criticism, Care.

308
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:14,010
I'm saying that
I admire your progress.

309
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,553
You could barely
hold it together

310
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,638
when Johnny was little,

311
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,307
and now he's a fine young man.

312
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,768
Honestly, when you consider
all of the obstacles

313
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,645
that he's had to overcome
at home,

314
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,231
what's a little vandalism
and assault, hmm?

315
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,777
Bitsy Beaumont called me.

316
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,530
She said she found something
on her son's phone?

317
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,156
It will be handled.

318
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,369
We will not talk about
that incident again.

319
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,787
Understood?

320
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,248
Yeah, I figured you'd call
Thatcher in to fix it, Dad.

321
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:47,502
He is such a pro at making
ugly secrets just disappear,

322
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,504
which is why I really do think
he's an excellent addition

323
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:50,672
to your divorce team, Pen.

324
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,094
I...

325
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,055
Sorry, I picked up
the landline.

326
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,640
It was an innocent mistake.

327
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,684
Are the goldens fed?

328
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,353
I'll get them.

329
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,397
How'd you get
those scratches, Bess?

330
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,983
Excuse me?

331
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,359
Well, I wasn't
gonna say anything,

332
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,820
but it seems like
we are saying things.

333
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,031
So, um, you have a chain-link
fence on your back.

334
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,950
You might not wanna show
so much skin

335
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,326
the next time you
and the lobster hunter

336
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,495
wanna defile the tennis court.

337
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,789
But if you wanna go ahead
and keep talking to me

338
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,040
about parenting...

339
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,500
I'd love to talk
to you about parenting.

340
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,048
The second course, sir.

341
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,384
Indeed.

342
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,388
And the Glengoyne single malt
from the study, please, Lydia.

343
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,890
Yes, sir.

344
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,099
Penny...

345
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,601
I'm on it!

346
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,648
It's coming, it's coming.

347
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,860
Why is everyone so tense today?

348
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,488
What are you doing?

349
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,115
I'm giving the dogs
their thunder pills.

350
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,451
They get agitated
when we're agitated.

351
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,328
You're just sitting there
while they destroy each other.

352
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,621
That is the plan.

353
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,165
Let Bess bring both guns
blazing to the battle of wits

354
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,959
and let Carrie's
ticking time bomb go off

355
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,338
while you and I,
we just sit there, impeccable.

356
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,508
But you didn't expect them
to bring up your ugly secrets.

357
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,056
Cadence...

358
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,516
I know it doesn't
seem like it right now,

359
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,770
but you and I, we are winning.

360
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,024
All we have to do is
stay the course and deflect.

361
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,984
Beechwood is not
supposed to be like this!

362
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,694
Summers here
are supposed to be perfect!

363
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,573
Aw, kid, life is never perfect.

364
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,742
I know when you are little,
you are protected from that.

365
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,036
You are sent off
to horse camp at the first sign

366
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,663
that things are messy
so that later,

367
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:50,083
yes, you can have these
watercolor, idyllic memories

368
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,460
to wax nostalgic about.

369
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,797
You are not little anymore.

370
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,049
Welcome to the real
family tradition.

371
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,009
Mom.

372
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,932
Pro tip...dog benzos
and human benzos?

373
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,684
Same fucking benzos.

374
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,060
Come on, guys.

375
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,979
Close the door when you leave.
They feel safe in here.

376
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,599
Well, try a tartlet.

377
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,934
Lydia's outdone herself.

378
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,769
Oh, that's all right,
I'm gonna save room for salad.

379
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,022
Just have...one.

380
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,235
Absolutely.

381
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,287
Mmm.

382
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,621
Mmm.

383
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,166
Oh, that reminds me, Cady,
tell your grandad

384
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,501
what you were saying to me
earlier about the lemons,

385
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,836
what they always remind you of.

386
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:31,768
Did you know lemons are kind
of a symbol of colonization?

387
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,272
It's true, Granddad.

388
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,983
Yeah, Columbus brought
citrus seeds from the Americas.

389
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,779
So technically,
our yearly lemon fest tradition

390
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,365
only exists because
of a genocidal slave trader.

391
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,285
Whoa, fascinating.

392
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,662
Well, that is
her AP history talking,

393
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,372
because she is determined
to get into Harvard

394
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,832
on her own merit, Dad.

395
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,125
Well, I've been thinking a lot

396
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,543
about Harvard lately.

397
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,545
I think it might be nice
to leave a good portion

398
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,963
of my estate to my alma mater.

399
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,841
Actually, you know,
I didn't learn the thing

400
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,469
about Columbus and the lemons
from history class, Mom.

401
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:09,305
Gat read about it.

402
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,141
He's the smartest Liar, right?

403
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,309
You know what?

404
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,852
Maybe next year we should
have an apple hunt.

405
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,312
Or drop the hunt entirely.

406
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,271
Um...

407
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,439
He's being sarcastic.

408
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,149
Well, the lemon hunt is, uh...

409
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,193
it's Tipper's
favorite tradition.

410
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,363
My mom says that
traditions lack

411
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,615
originality and imagination.

412
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,575
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

413
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,701
No, I didn't.

414
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,120
When you and Ed froze embryos,

415
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,371
I remember you
had an argument about

416
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,081
whether you were gonna get
married first.

417
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,624
Actually,
it wasn't an argument.

418
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:40,086
I know it was...
more love between you guys.

419
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,630
But I remember you said,
"Fuck tradition, baby."

420
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,006
I remember.

421
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,466
That's what you said.

422
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:49,303
Well, I don't know why you had
to bring embryos into it.

423
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:50,555
And God, you knew you would

424
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:51,931
never go through with that,
Carrie.

425
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,683
I wanted a baby with Ed.

426
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,561
- Until you didn't.
- Yes, I d...

427
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,478
I still do.

428
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:04,569
Well, then you must have
wanted something else more.

429
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,165
- Did you trade your partner?
- That is enough, Penny.

430
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,458
W...what does...
what does that mean?

431
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,585
Eat your tartlet.

432
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,006
Cadence, tell me...

433
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,426
...how is Windemere?

434
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,511
Bess was, uh, worried
that you two

435
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,264
might be lonely
with five bedrooms.

436
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,557
We are not lonely.

437
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,519
Cadence loves Windemere because
you built it for me, Dad.

438
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,313
She wants to raise
her children there.

439
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,814
Tell him, Cady.

440
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,191
It's too big.

441
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,985
Well, next summer, perhaps
you two will take Cuddledown.

442
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,071
And Bess and the girls
can take Windemere.

443
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,656
No, no, no, no.

444
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,325
I won't be here next summer.

445
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,452
Not if it's like this.

446
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,411
I'm gonna go travel.

447
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,122
With Gat.

448
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,625
Oh, Jesus Christ,
I don't understand your need

449
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,377
to constantly bring up
that boy at my table.

450
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:06,464
Why do you always
call him that?

451
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,049
You never say his name.

452
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,550
It's always
"that boy" or "kid."

453
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,593
Or "young man."

454
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,136
You always called Ed
"young man."

455
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,179
Stop talking about Ed.

456
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,931
- He has gray hair.
- Stop!

457
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,724
Then tell me what she meant
just then,

458
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,892
when she said that
you traded him?

459
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:18,726
For what?

460
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,311
An inheritance, Mom?

461
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,814
You made her choose?

462
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,441
- More wine, Miss?
- Just...just leave the bottle.

463
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,692
Penny, relax.

464
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,110
God, it's
kind of hard to relax when

465
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,612
you make us all fucking crazy.

466
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,030
We don't mumble.

467
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,323
She said that you're
making them crazy, Granddad.

468
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,741
Mirren!

469
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,201
All right, listen!

470
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,370
All of you,
pull yourselves together.

471
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,831
If you are going crazy,
it's your own damn choice.

472
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,043
All right.

473
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,002
The inheritance...

474
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,465
...is no longer a factor.

475
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,050
Hmm? The plans have been made.

476
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,554
Thatcher will
collect the papers

477
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,307
and file them in the morning.

478
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,893
And you will each get
exactly what you've earned,

479
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:05,481
exactly...what you deserve.

480
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,235
After all, I can't
leave my estate

481
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,112
to a bunch of crazy people.

482
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,128
Hey.

483
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:32,425
What did they mean about Gat
and Ed and the inheritance?

484
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,135
Franklin? Eleanor?

485
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,594
- Granddad.
- Where are the dogs?

486
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,305
Asleep in the laundry.

487
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,015
Did you tell Carrie
you would cut her off

488
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,016
because she was with Ed?

489
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,767
Carrie's a grown woman.

490
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,602
She had a choice to make.

491
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,104
You never liked them, did you?

492
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,564
Gat and Ed.

493
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,316
You could barely stomach them.

494
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,900
That's why you never
use their names.

495
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,194
On the contrary,
they never liked us.

496
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,613
No.
I have high standards, Cadence.

497
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,158
I will not apologize for them.

498
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,451
White standards?

499
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,705
Are you saying I'm racist?

500
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,082
I think you don't
like Gat with me,

501
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,917
and you don't like Carrie
with Ed.

502
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,462
I think you tolerated them
for a long time

503
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,671
because you wanted to believe

504
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,173
certain things about
who you are.

505
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:16,427
No, I believe in who we are,
who we have been for centuries.

506
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,220
It's my duty
to protect this family.

507
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,641
You tolerated Gat and Ed.

508
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,770
But when Carrie talked about
babies, it made you sick.

509
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,064
You couldn't let them
mess up the family.

510
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:31,359
Sinclairs are blonde
and square-chinned.

511
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,027
We freckle in the sun.

512
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,531
That's what this is, isn't it?

513
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,661
You don't want
Indian grandchildren.

514
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,081
You don't wanna
ruin the pictures.

515
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:48,459
Oh, for Christ's sake,
Cadence, I'm a Democrat!

516
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,877
No!

517
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,128
Grandad!

518
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:56,467
Granddad! Granddad!

519
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,595
Help!

520
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,764
Help!

521
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:02,807
Cadence?

522
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:09,021
Oh.

523
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,148
I'm right...here.

524
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,026
Oh.

525
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,444
Oh, no...oh, no...

526
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,323
The hair.
I almost didn't recognize you.

527
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,868
Are you all right?

528
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,746
Uh, grandfathers,

529
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,123
they never like hair dye.

530
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,295
What did
Dr. Moriarty have to say?

531
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,841
Oh, um, he, um...

532
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:42,012
he said that, oh, um,
that the oysters are, uh,

533
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,098
at the First Street market...
they're...

534
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:47,893
they are particularly
good...today.

535
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,979
Uh, we'll pick some up
on the way home.

536
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,293
A 68-year-old male
with head trauma.

537
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:13,627
ETA 12 minutes.

538
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,504
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- It's okay. It's okay.

539
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,798
Search his office
for the draft of his will.

540
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:18,799
Search everywhere.

541
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,051
If it doesn't favor us,
burn it.

542
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,386
Bess, pack his bag!

543
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,013
Carrie, call Harbor Services.

544
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,222
You need a water taxi
to the mainland.

545
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,849
No, I'll just come
with you right now.

546
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:28,184
There is only room for one.

547
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:33,731
Oh, God.
She is good in a crisis.

548
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,658
That for Penny or Dad?

549
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,410
The whole fucking universe.

550
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,419
You were so mean to Carrie.

551
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,087
We're sisters.

552
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,756
We don't have to be
kind all the time.

553
00:29:58,756 --> 00:29:59,965
Yeah, well, you could be.

554
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,300
And you weren't
sisterly bitchy.

555
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,093
You were just mean.

556
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,888
You know, just once
I'd like to be the one

557
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,223
you take a stand to defend.

558
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:10,726
Harris was poking at me,
and I needed to pivot.

559
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:11,894
Can you grab his slippers?

560
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,145
Yeah, which ones?

561
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,189
Uh, either. Both.

562
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,233
I don't care.

563
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,610
None of this should be
happening right now.

564
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,904
- Except your father...
- Oh, my God!

565
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:24,198
We know Dad screwed up, Mom.

566
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:25,366
But when did you know it?

567
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,034
Was it before or after
you decided

568
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,536
to fuck Salty Dan
all over this island?

569
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,329
Don't you dare
throw that in my face!

570
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,789
Which part? The boathouse?

571
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,123
- Stop.
- The tennis court?

572
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,708
- Stop.
- Is that a mistake?

573
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,210
Or is that a pattern?

574
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,046
And which one defines
character again, Mom?

575
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:39,880
Stop it!

576
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,260
I was the good daughter.

577
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,719
Carrie's a crisis.

578
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,555
Penny's a brick wall.

579
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,765
And now he thinks
that I'm the weak one.

580
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,183
But I was the good one.

581
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,310
When Rosemary died,
I was the baby,

582
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,938
and everyone was supposed
to love me the most.

583
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,064
Oh, God.

584
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,941
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

585
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,276
I stayed close to home.

586
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,944
And I hate Boston!

587
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,279
I hate it!

588
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,493
I wanted sunshine
and sand and desert roses.

589
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:14,081
I wanted desert roses.

590
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:17,167
I didn't get to go
because my sisters left,

591
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,004
and I had to stay in case
my mom or dad needed me.

592
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,506
I didn't starve myself.

593
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,882
Or take pills.

594
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,593
I didn't make messes.

595
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:28,053
I sure as hell had to get my
hands dirty cleaning them up,

596
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,764
but I didn't complain because
I am the good daughter.

597
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:34,018
And I am the good wife.
And I'm the good mother!

598
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,811
And I'm the good one!

599
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,026
What the hell happened to me?

600
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,883
What are you looking for?

601
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,176
Oh.

602
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,010
Nothing.

603
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,097
Well, don't stop looking
on my account.

604
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,355
Do you think he'll be okay?

605
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,025
Yeah.

606
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:24,818
He'll be fine.

607
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:25,653
Do you want him to be?

608
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,781
What kind of question is that?

609
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,741
One that deserves
an actual answer.

610
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,534
Yes.

611
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:36,914
Johnny, I don't, um,
hate my father.

612
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,082
I think I might a little.

613
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,418
Ran off Gat.

614
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,628
Made you break up with Ed.

615
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,546
That's what that
all was, right?

616
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:48,384
He paid off the debt that I
caused on one condition, right?

617
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,468
You couldn't marry Ed.

618
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,805
Yes.

619
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,434
That doesn't make you furious?

620
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,145
'Cause I'd be angry
if I were you, Mom.

621
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,730
But you're so calm.

622
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,109
I am focused.

623
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:07,778
I have to go to the hospital.

624
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,072
And I might need to spend
the night on the Vineyard,

625
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:12,199
so I need to make sure
that I have everything.

626
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,952
And...that's it.

627
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,204
Yeah, okay, well,
then let me help you find

628
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,081
what you're looking for, Mom.

629
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:27,464
Bottom shelf, behind the
cast iron that no one uses.

630
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,716
Right?

631
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,759
I always knew
your hiding spots.

632
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,386
Just haven't had to look
for a long time.

633
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,013
But I know this you, Mom.

634
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,391
Nothing gets under your skin.
You're zen.

635
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:40,018
I remember this you
from when I was little,

636
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,103
when Dad was around.

637
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,774
And he'd see red.

638
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:52,114
And you were always just...
very still.

639
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,449
And then you got sober.

640
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:56,910
And Will's only ever known
you as this...

641
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,039
beautiful blur of motion.

642
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,416
But then Ed left,

643
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:05,794
and now I see this you,
this old you, every f...

644
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,212
every night.

645
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,257
Those are Gran's pain pills
for her knees, Mom,

646
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,426
and she never left them
where you could see them,

647
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,219
because she was trying
to protect you from yourself.

648
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,304
But now she's gone.

649
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:18,849
And you never talk about it.

650
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,562
You never talk to me.

651
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:31,153
You're so...calm.

652
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,865
So still.

653
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:44,583
We will talk about this...
tomorrow.

654
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,308
Well, that was...

655
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:10,025
God, I hope we're
not like them.

656
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,861
I think it's
genetically unavoidable.

657
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:13,987
Cady!

658
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,450
Cady!

659
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:21,829
Gat.

660
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,848
Wait, are you all okay?

661
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:42,224
I saw a helicopter.

662
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,768
What...what happened?

663
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,564
Total Last Supper vibes.

664
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,649
I don't think I've ever
seen this place dirty.

665
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,902
Lydia was literally scrubbing
blood off the patio steps.

666
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,863
So you know, I couldn't watch,

667
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,531
and I sent
the whole staff home.

668
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,242
They went through enough today.

669
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,997
So we have the whole island
to ourselves?

670
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,498
For the first time ever, yeah.

671
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,251
We could do anything we want.

672
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,294
Huh.

673
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:17,926
- I'll stack.
- I'll scrub.

674
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,303
- I'll load.
- I'll dry.

675
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:20,596
Let's do it.

699
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:29,933
Ah.

700
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,060
I found them.

701
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,604
Not the good scissors.

702
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,024
Gran never let us use them.

703
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:40,819
We're completely unsupervised,
and you wanna collage?

704
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,070
It's on brand.

705
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,948
No, my brand is
people-pleasing bullshit.

706
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,324
And you know what?

707
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,577
If I want desert roses,
I'm gonna chase desert roses.

708
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:52,414
I don't wanna be some old lady
crying about desert roses!

709
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,084
Well, you're pretty much
my favorite person

710
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,420
on this whole stupid planet.

711
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,257
So I am all for
whatever happens next.

712
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,856
What are you doing up here?

713
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,067
It's not obvious?

714
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,235
Pretending I'm king
of Beechwood Island.

715
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,905
What, did you
overthrow the last guy?

716
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:27,240
No, no, I...

717
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,743
married into
the line of succession.

718
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,995
Okay.

719
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,830
- Yeah.
- No, I like this fairy tale.

720
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,664
Tell me more.

721
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,293
Okay, okay.

722
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:42,422
Together, we slay the dragons

723
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,966
and return the land
where it's always summer

724
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,302
to its former glory.

725
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,638
Gates are always open.

726
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,848
All are welcome.

727
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,433
No one's ever banished.

728
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:58,897
Why'd you come back?

729
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,819
You were finally
free of this place.

730
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,862
I love this place.

731
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,322
It's where I found you.

732
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:14,037
Actually, I found you,
hiding in a boathouse.

733
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,083
Yeah, yeah.

734
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:21,169
I did that after my dad died.

735
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:25,423
I'd get overwhelmed
and try to find some tiny nook

736
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,883
to hide from real life.

737
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,264
And then you came in.

738
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,598
You bent down,
you looked at me,

739
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,476
and you went, are you real?

740
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,812
- Remember that?
- Yeah.

741
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:43,024
You asked me if I
was real, like as if...

742
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,652
I don't know, as if
I didn't have to be.

743
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,530
Like life could
just be cannonballs

744
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,367
and Scrabble tiles and...

745
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,077
and you and Johnny and Mirren.

746
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,747
Reality could wait.

747
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,211
Hands.

748
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,130
- Give me your hands.
- Okay.

749
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,131
Come on.

750
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:12,971
You know, I think Beechwood is

751
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,599
a tiny nook that
we're all hiding in.

752
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:23,231
But reality is
starting to seep in.

753
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,820
"Always do what
you're afraid to do."

754
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,363
It's a motto.

755
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,450
Or, you know, a reminder,

756
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,161
in case you ever find yourself

757
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:39,706
looking for a safe space
to hide.

758
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,293
Give me the pen.

759
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,462
- And your hands.
- Okay.

The moms are going to kill you.

782
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,101
It was an accident.

783
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,562

Come on.

789
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,870
It's not like we're gonna
sell that on the black market

790
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,413
and save a starving family.

791
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,999
We barely know how
to get on the dark web.

792
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:48,209
Your hair, Mirren.

793
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,753
- It looks awesome.
- I know!

794
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:50,962
I know, I said that.

795
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,630
Thank you.

796
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,382
It's symbolic.

797
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,801
Just like those
dumb elephants are.

798
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,887
We're gonna be grounded
until graduation.

799
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,600
Oh, my God, Granddad!

800
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,518
- Okay.
- Pants, Jonathan.

801
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,187
Yeah, I know.

802
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,565
Wait.

803
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,901
What if they're calling to say
that Granddad's dead?

804
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,327
Hello?

805
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:25,330
We say "Sinclair residence"
when we pick up the phone.

806
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,999
<i>Great, I'll add it</i>
 <i>to the list of things we do.</i>

807
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,501
Is Granddad okay?

808
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:30,877
<i>Is it loud on my end?</i>

809
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,170
I'm sure it is.

810
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,671
They refused to give us
a private waiting area.

811
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,965
We've been in this
petri dish for hours.

812
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,385
- Is he okay?
- <i>- Yeah, he's fine.</i>

813
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:40,845
 <i>He's had a...a concussion</i>
 <i>and a few stitches.</i>

814
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,972
There was a lot of blood.

815
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,682
Well, he's elderly
and had a drink.

816
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,017
It was a head wound.

817
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,519
 <i>It was the trifecta.</i>

818
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,397
His CTs came back
with some abnormalities,

819
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,148
uh, not from the fall.

820
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,567
 <i>Seems he's been</i>
 <i>skipping checkups.</i>

821
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,153
Wait, so there's something
wrong with his brain?

822
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,321
It would explain a lot.

823
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,781
We're transferring him
to Boston.

824
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,282
- He's a beloved benefactor...
- Hey, have you seen him?

825
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,575
He's not in his room.

826
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:03,910
<i>You lost him?</i>

827
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,745
You know he refuses
to see a doctor

828
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,247
outside of a putting green.

829
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:08,957
<i>Oh, my God, Christ.</i>
<i>He thinks he's invincible.</i>

830
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:10,083
 <i>I have to go.</i>

831
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:13,837
Okay, let's go find Dad.

832
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,258
Well, he's alive.

833
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,344
Yay.

834
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,140
- What is that?
- Oh! What?

835
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,182
Oh.

836
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,309
Foam party!

837
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,727
Like Ibiza.

838
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,148
Mirren, have you ever
loaded a dishwasher before?

839
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,483
I don't think
I'm gonna be very good

840
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,734
at being a poor person.

841
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,244
Question.

842
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,454
What?

843
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:51,624
Is it messed up to feel
this happy with you

844
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,419
when your grandfather just got
helicoptered to the hospital?

845
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,383
He thinks it's messed up
that you and I feel this way

846
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:02,635
about each other at all.

847
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:04,721
I didn't think you'd notice.

848
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:11,644
I'm sorry I didn't
notice sooner.

849
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,483
I'm sorry about so many things.

850
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:17,317
Hey.

851
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,820
You have nothing
to apologize for.

852
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:26,743
Oh! Sorry.

853
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:30,538
Wait, if you wanna be alone,
we...

854
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,999
Come on, losers, get in here.

855
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,545
That's good, yeah.

856
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:47,138
You guys remember Summer 9,

857
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,765
when we had our sleepover
in here?

858
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:50,683
Yeah, and we wanted
to sleep outside,

859
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:51,809
but the moms were riled up

860
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,811
about hypothermia
and sand crabs.

861
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,898
Yeah, so Granddad
brought us in here,

862
00:46:56,898 --> 00:47:00,735
made us some s'mores,
told us stories,

863
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,530
like how his dad
started the newspaper,

864
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,866
or how he wooed Gran away
from that other guy.

865
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:12,455
How can Harris be that person,

866
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:16,626
our Granddad, and then...

867
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,711
who he was tonight?

868
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,422
Maybe our granddad
who taught us

869
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,132
water safety and checkers

870
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:27,845
is just locked up in his mind
and needs to be rescued.

871
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,099
Maybe if we just
talk to him or you...

872
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,433
Talk to him?

873
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,229
I'm sorry, guys.

874
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:38,064
I mean, I...

875
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:40,191
I wanna believe that people
are capable of change

876
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,776
because, I mean,
if they're not,

877
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,611
what is the point in trying?

878
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,572
But...

879
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:49,701
look, it's...it's one thing
to see a racist politician

880
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:53,830
on the TV or hear shitty
comments on the subway,

881
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,582
I mean, from someone
I don't even know.

882
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,125
I mean, I've dealt with that
my entire life.

883
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,334
But this?

884
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,754
This is different.

885
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,510
I mean, Harris...

886
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,764
Harris has known me
since I was a little boy.

887
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:15,518
He's seen me chase fireflies
and dig up seashells.

888
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,312
And...and he still hates me.

889
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,859
And I didn't even
do anything, you know?

890
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:24,110
I mean, what have I done?

891
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,862
I haven't done anything
apart from just being me.

892
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,659
The point is...

893
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,661
talking, Mirren...

894
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:36,706
no offense, but talking
is not gonna do shit.

895
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,629
As a matter of fact,
nothing will ever

896
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:45,214
fucking make a difference.

897
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,049
I'm sorry.

898
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,302
I'm sorry.
He's your grandfather.

899
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:51,179
I didn't...I didn't mean...

900
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:53,848
No, he's our granddad.

901
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:58,436
And he's a racist piece of shit

902
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,021
who doesn't like Gat or Ed

903
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:01,814
because of the color
of their skin.

904
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:07,028
There is no use in
trying to talk to him.

905
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,071
I think we all know that.

906
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,991
He's too far gone.

907
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,326
It's way too late.

908
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:17,413
If he was always like this,
no wonder all the moms'

909
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,540
priorities became so skewed.

910
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,292
Maybe he's been torturing them

911
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,878
with these inheritance games
for a long time now,

912
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,755
and we just...

913
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:27,799
we were just too young
to notice it.

914
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,180
Well, game over,
because he's pouring it all

915
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,516
into a new student hall
for Harvard.

916
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:37,892
Not all of it.

917
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:43,564
What is that?

918
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:48,611
The last will and testament
of Harris Sinclair.

919
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:54,867
Your mom gets
the Boston house when he dies.

920
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:57,537
My mom hates Boston.

921
00:49:57,537 --> 00:49:59,997
- And he probably knew that.
- Hmm.

922
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,668
And Carrie gets
a quarterly stipend.

923
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,128
It's a lot of money.

924
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:06,754
What's the catch?

925
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,841
She only gets it
if she stays unmarried.

926
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:11,342
- Same with my mom.
- Mm.

927
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,677
What?

928
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:15,388
Your mom has a secret
Black boyfriend or something?

929
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:18,307
No, but she definitely
has some secrets.

930
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,226
I mean, you saw Bess, right?

931
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,979
You heard her
at dinner tonight.

932
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:26,107
You know, tomorrow...

933
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,987
...we're gonna leave
this island,

934
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:34,490
and the moms
will yell about the...

935
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,534
the elephants
and the Persian rugs

936
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:40,830
and Mirren's hair because
that's what Sinclairs do.

937
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:46,002
Yeah, we spiral over things
that mean nothing.

938
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,296
Cady.

939
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:49,756
He'll be so mad.

940
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:54,177
We refuse to talk
about anything real.

941
00:50:56,095 --> 00:51:00,433
And then we cover things up
and go back to normal.

942
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,645
We should trash the house
and crash his boat,

943
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,522
run naked through Edgartown.

944
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,024
Give him something
real to yell about.

945
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:10,860
Oh, the Sinclair angels

946
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,988
would never do something
so uncouth.

947
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,115
No, no, but you guys
were under the influence

948
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,492
of the brown boy.

949
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:20,745
He could be
a cult leader, right?

950
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:23,289
I mean, he's so
charismatic and cunning.

951
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,249
Oh, my God.

952
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,126
Can you imagine the headlines?

953
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,337
No, there wouldn't be any.

954
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,422
I'm serious.

955
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,926
He would cover it up,
make it disappear.

956
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:41,516
God.

957
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:44,227
What if we made...

958
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:45,978
a mess so big...

959
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:50,608
...only a Sinclair
could clean it up?

960
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:57,657
What if all the petty
material things

961
00:51:57,657 --> 00:52:00,076
that tore our family apart
were just gone?

962
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:02,286
Just like that.

963
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,372
Okay, I think Cady's
the cult leader.

964
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,376
I'm serious.

965
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:12,505
I mean, Clairmont is built
on a foundation of hate.

966
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:17,093
Ooh.

967
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,723
We could tear it down.

968
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:25,268
Teach Harris and the moms
the ultimate lesson.

969
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,397
What did you have in mind?

970
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:55,131
Hey, you're back.

971
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:00,845
You okay?

972
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,389
There was a fire.

973
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:07,310
I remember it now.

974
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,814
We burnt this place
to the ground.
