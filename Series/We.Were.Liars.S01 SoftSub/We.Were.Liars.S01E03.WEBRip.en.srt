00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:08,217
<i>Post-traumatic amnesia</i>

2
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:10,177
 <i>is caused</i>
 <i>by a disturbing event.</i>

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,012
 <i>Did someone hurt me?</i>

4
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,018
She's hoping that being here
will jog her memory.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,856
My doctor said that being in
a familiar setting might help.

6
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:25,276
But that isn't familiar at all.

7
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:26,819
Cadence.

8
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,654
- Hi.
- Cady.

9
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,031
Why did you forbid everyone
from talking to me

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,450
about my own fucking life?

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,746
The doctors said it was best
if you remember on your own.

12
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:39,915
<i>Do you think that</i>
 <i>you aren't wrecking</i>

13
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,083
 <i>a perfectly good ecosystem?</i>

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,127
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

15
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:44,295
Stop!

16
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,379
Who's Raquel?

17
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,756
Gat's girlfriend.

18
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,299
I thought I knew you.

19
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,634
Forgive me for not wanting
to blow up my fucking life

20
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,011
just 'cause you were
in the mood to hook up.

21
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,055
I've been sexting
with an older guy.

22
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,017
I have no idea
how to do any of that stuff.

23
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:00,394
My marriage is just fine.

24
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,563
<i>So was mine until it wasn't.</i>

25
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,859
 <i>You're selling the Thornton?</i>

26
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,069
I don't intend to discuss
the sale with your father.

27
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,739
I am selling my favorite piece

28
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,866
to alleviate
your cash flow issues.

29
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,993
I'm gonna wake this one up.

30
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:16,994
Mom.

31
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,162
Mom?

32
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,122
Help!

33
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,773
<i>I got my love</i>
 <i>of storytelling from Gran.</i>

34
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,444
 <i>Sometimes she didn't have</i>
 <i>time or patience</i>

35
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,447
 <i>when we begged her to make up</i>
 <i>a fairy tale on the spot.</i>

36
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,990
Tell us a story.

37
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,410
<i>But on good days,</i>
 <i>she'd give in.</i>

38
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,831
 <i>And she always began</i>
 <i>the same way.</i>

39
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,123
A story? OK.

40
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,793
All right.
All right. hush.

41
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,505
Once upon a time,

42
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:13,008
there was a mythical land,

43
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:16,011
where it was always summer.

44
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:23,143
<i>Lately, I have to</i>
 <i>make up my own stories.</i>

45
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,604
 <i>So here's a fairy tale</i>

46
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,982
 <i>in honor of my gran.</i>

47
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,530
 <i>This mythical land</i>
 <i>where it's always summer,</i>

48
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,701
 <i>it was ruled by a brave</i>
 <i>king and his fairy queen.</i>

49
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:42,246
 <i>The royal subjects</i>
 <i>love their fairy queen.</i>

50
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,957
 <i>Her magic kept the sun</i>
 <i>shining...</i>

51
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,336
 <i>The seas warm,</i>

52
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,964
 <i>the rose gardens flourishing.</i>

53
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,633
 <i>Legend has it,</i>
 <i>her magical heart</i>

54
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,012
 <i>was made of pure yellow gold.</i>

55
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:02,099
 <i>It would never slow</i>
 <i>or fall or break.</i>

56
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,729
 <i>She gave the king three</i>
 <i>fairy princess daughters,</i>

57
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,315
 <i>and they had more tiny heirs.</i>

58
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,110
 <i>Then one day,</i>

59
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,821
 <i>the queen's golden heart</i>

60
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,573
 <i>stopped.</i>

61
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,870
If you insist on being here,
don't disturb me when I'm...

62
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,165
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.

63
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,292
I thought you were
someone else.

64
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,543
I can come back another time.

65
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,837
No, no, no, no, no, sit.

66
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,464
I'm happy to see you.

67
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,633
Bess is driving me crazy

68
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,593
insisting on moving up here
with the girls

69
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,012
to take care of me
like I'm some old man

70
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,182
when everyone knows that
she can't stand Cuddledown.

71
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,810
How are you feeling?

72
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,024
Clairmont is so...different.

73
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,944
Yeah, it's gonna be
spectacular

74
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,320
when the work is finished.

75
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,404
I've always had a fondness

76
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,031
for modern architecture, but...

77
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,743
But Gran liked
the classic style.

78
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,707
Let me guess,

79
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,125
my mom has you under orders

80
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,543
not to talk to me about her.

81
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,463
I don't take orders
from Penny.

82
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,969
But...

83
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:23,222
no, to dwell on the past
is a dull man's pursuit.

84
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,433
I've known that Gran passed.

85
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,602
But knowing is different
from remembering.

86
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,312
And I remember now.

87
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,065
OK. Great.

88
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,068
Do you have a...
a program from her funeral?

89
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:39,363
Because I can remember
the night she died now,

90
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,448
but I can't remember
anything about the memorial.

91
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,159
Look, I said no!

92
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,120
I don't want to
discuss that day.

93
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,204
You know, it was terrible.

94
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,789
Mirren, you know that.

95
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,001
Cadence.

96
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,587
Oh, right.

97
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,884
What happened to the
little blonde girls

98
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,679
running around this place?

99
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,264
They grew up.

100
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,560
You OK, Cady?

101
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,061
You look pale.

102
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,398
I just don't understand.

103
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,567
This place feels
nothing like Gran.

104
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,568
I hate it.

105
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:23,282
And you didn't even let us
say goodbye to old Clairmont.

106
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,993
You just...erased her
like she didn't exist!

107
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,828
Oh! How dare you!

108
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,747
Dad, Dad, Dad,
she didn't mean it, OK.

109
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,957
She is not well, remember?

110
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,211
Sorry.

111
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,214
Sorry, you know what he says
about dwelling in the past.

112
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,637
Hey, hey, hey.

113
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,139
Wait, Cady,

114
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,141
I like to go to her rose garden

115
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,810
when I miss her.

116
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,604
I feel her there.

117
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:57,024
She always said it was
the closest thing to heaven.

118
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,699
<i>The fairy queen's sudden fall</i>

119
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,701
 <i>revealed her secret</i>
 <i>to the realm.</i>

120
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:15,167
 <i>She had lied to the king,</i>

121
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,127
 <i>to the princesses,</i>

122
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,130
 <i>to all the tiny heirs</i>
 <i>to the throne.</i>

123
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,312
 <i>The queen was not</i>
 <i>a fairy at all,</i>

124
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,106
 <i>but a mere mortal.</i>

125
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,826
 <i>And mortals die.</i>

126
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,217
That's not champagne.

127
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,302
That's rose gold.

128
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,429
She would never wear rose gold.

129
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,597
Cadence, come here.

130
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,223
I don't...
I don't know.

131
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,601
- Come here, Cady.
- Mom.

132
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,524
This is champagne. Hmm?

133
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,276
It's dignified.

134
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,861
My mistake, Ms. Sinclair.

135
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,279
I'll see what we have.

136
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,865
And in the meantime,
your mother's effects.

137
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:27,424
What's gonna happen
with Gran's black pearls now?

138
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,051
Are you all gonna share them?

139
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,510
Uh...

140
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,764
your grandfather wants her
to wear them in the ground.

141
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,765
Oh.

142
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,479
I think she would
have worn a tennis necklace

143
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,606
with this dress,
don't you think?

144
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:48,570
She doesn't really
look like herself.

145
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:54,201
Honestly, I thought
she'd look worse.

146
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,078
I can't see the incision
from the autopsy.

147
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,371
- Mom.
- Oh.

148
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,664
She was in perfect health.

149
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,707
We had to make sure the staff
didn't poison her.

150
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,919
I'm joking.

151
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,591
It was just her time.

152
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,051
Go on.

153
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,011
You can wait in the car
while I finish up here.

154
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,125
I realize that was the first
dead body that you've seen.

155
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,086
Yep.

156
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,838
Hopefully the last.

157
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,173
It won't be.

158
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,217
But you'll be better
prepared next time.

159
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,344
That's why I brought you.

160
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,930
Oh, uh, your dad gets in
on the late ferry.

161
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,390
- Well, you should call him.
- Wait.

162
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,976
There's a box of his junk
in the attic.

163
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,477
Dad's coming?

164
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,895
Now?

165
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,606
Wha--how could he do that
to you?

166
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,692
He's not doing
anything to me.

167
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,320
Plus, it would look weird
if he didn't show.

168
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,613
How are you so good at this?

169
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,491
The guy who broke your heart is
coming to your mom's funeral,

170
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,453
and you're just...fine.

171
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:25,000
You never fall apart.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,501
I wish I was like you.

173
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,296
Falling apart
is for other people.

174
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,214
We are Sinclairs.

175
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,301
And we manage with our
backs straight.

176
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,303
Like my mother always said.

177
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,680
Once I fix my posture?

178
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,225
You know,
I was younger than you are now

179
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,144
when we lost Rosemary.

180
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,605
And my mom had
excellent advice then.

181
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,275
She said,
go back to your routine,

182
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,152
and you look to the future.

183
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,321
You erase the person you lost
from conversation.

184
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,198
And if you must speak
about them,

185
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,659
do not show
that you feel the loss.

186
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,953
If you follow the rules,
eventually,

187
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,622
nothing can hurt you.

188
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:07,000
You just make your heart
a small target.

189
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,420
After all,

190
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,048
look where Gran's
enlarged heart got her.

200
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,663
- Cady.
- Hello.

201
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,666
So I, uh, have a migraine,
and you throw a party?

202
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,377
You said you missed music,
so...

203
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,920
Do you like what we've done
with the place?

204
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,007
Yeah, I think that Bess is
gonna go mental, but...

205
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,802
Oh, no, my mother's
not stepping foot

206
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,262
in Cuddledown this summer.

207
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,681
She thinks it's outdated,
and that our whole family

208
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,058
can fit into one wing
in the new Clairmont.

209
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,145
So Liars get squatter's rights.

210
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,147
Would you like
the twins' bedroom?

211
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,149
Yeah, my mom
won't go for that.

212
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,235
She, uh, checks on me
like three times a night.

213
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,114
I mean, you did pass out
in a rose bush

214
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,657
on a painkiller bender.

215
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,369
The gardener had to put you
on a golf cart

216
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,996
to get you back to Windemere.

217
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,456
Paulo did?

218
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,540
Who?

219
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,667
The groundskeeper.

220
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,002
Did you remember something?

221
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,753
Something happened
that triggered you

222
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,505
and made you sick?

223
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,840
Guys, maybe let's not talk
about what sent

224
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,676
Cady into a batshit spiral.

225
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,470
I actually heard my mom
tell Penny

226
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,055
that, um, Harris yelled at you.

227
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,933
They think that it's his fault
that you freaked.

228
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,435
Maybe.

229
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,854
I asked him about Tipper.

230
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,814
I remember everything
up until the funeral,

231
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,232
and then it all goes blank.

232
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,735
So you do remember.

233
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,612
Gat, it's fine, OK?

234
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,113
I know you and I
got in a fight,

235
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,448
but it's in the past.

236
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,826
Bringing up the funeral
really did upset Granddad.

237
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,703
Yeah, I'm sure it wasn't
his favorite day ever.

238
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,914
You know we can't tell you.

239
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:12,292
'Cause we want you
to get better.

240
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,713
But the whole point
of a funeral is closure, right?

241
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,926
How am I supposed to move on
if I don't know what happened?

242
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,054
Come on, guys. Just tell me.

243
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,555
Did something bad happen?

244
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,974
Is that why Granddad
is so upset?

245
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,644
Did I do something?

246
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,023
I'm sorry. I don't feel well.

247
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,608
OK, OK.

248
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,568
Gat, we agreed.

249
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,280
Hey, she's not asking about
the night that she got hurt,

250
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,698
right?

251
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,116
Just the funeral.

252
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,495
We can talk about
just the funeral.

253
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,288
Fine. OK.
But then that's it, OK.

254
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,291
No more talk of
summer '16 ever.

255
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,876
Can we please just have
a fun, normal summer

256
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:59,047
with weed and pickleball
and Liars being Liars?

257
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,590
Thank you.

258
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,425
- So did I...
- No, no, no.

259
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,636
OK, if we are
gonna be depressing,

260
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,846
I require salt air
and a cold beverage.

261
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,559
Onwards, Liars.

262
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,732
I'm glad you got
some memories back,

263
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,110
but part of me hoped
you wouldn't remember her.

264
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,778
What, Raquel?

265
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,154
It's fine.

266
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,739
Come on, you don't have to
do that "it's fine"

267
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,074
Sinclair thing with me.

268
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,077
Look, for a long time,
I didn't know what happened

269
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,870
between the time
that we kissed

270
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,456
and the way things are
with us now.

271
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,000
I didn't understand
why you didn't seem

272
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,751
to like me like that anymore.

273
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,921
But...now I know.

274
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,841
So you're off the hook.

275
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,050
It's all good.

Johnny.

281
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,668
I'm good.

282
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,337
Aren't you scared
you're going to burn?

283
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,088
No.

284
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,091
I don't believe
in sunscreen anymore.

285
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,762
Scientists are corrupt, and
SPF is a moneymaking scheme.

286
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,306
Do you have any baby oil?

287
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,142
Oh, my God, your skin
will literally bubble.

288
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,603
I'm surprisingly resilient.

289
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,605
Hey, Gat,

290
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,982
we weren't talking
when Tipper died, were we?

291
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,985
Oh, yes,
let's rehash that now.

292
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,779
It sucked.

293
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,280
All I wanted to do was help.

294
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,532
But, well,

295
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,035
I didn't know what to do.

296
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,040
 <i>To be honest,</i>
 <i>I was kind of lost.</i>

297
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,718
Aw, you didn't have to send me
a thank you note.

298
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,929
I got this tailored,
but I'm sure it's not

299
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,764
what the cool kids
are wearing to church.

300
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:13,973
It's for Cadence.

301
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,016
What, the suit?

302
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,601
The...the note.

303
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,522
I'm not sure
if I want to go today.

304
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,024
So I thought a note.

305
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,653
No one wants to go
to a funeral.

306
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,321
No, no, what I mean is, uh,

307
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,031
I don't think I should go.

308
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,827
Cady and I had a fight.

309
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,328
Oh, no.

310
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,997
Did she post an unflattering
pic of you on the 'gram?

311
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,416
Immediately regret
this conversation.

312
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,293
OK, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

313
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,003
Was it bad?

314
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,588
Yeah.

315
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,883
Johnny and I
aren't talking either.

316
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,227
What do you remember
about your dad's funeral?

317
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,229
No, not a lot.

318
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,148
I remember I lost my jacket,

319
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,233
so you gave me yours.

320
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,738
It smelled like Dad.

321
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,574
You know, I was so

322
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,994
pissed at him when he died.

323
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,412
Did I tell you that?

324
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,748
We had this big
blow-up argument,

325
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,916
like stupid brother shit.

326
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,753
And the next day, he was gone.

327
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,005
And I was like,

328
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,882
this fucker died on purpose

329
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,801
just so I didn't
get the last word.

330
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,887
So I didn't want to go
to his funeral either.

331
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,638
But I did,

332
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,474
just in case you
or your mum needed me.

333
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,018
And I needed your jacket.

334
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:40,935
I get it.

335
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,229
I love being the hero.

336
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,064
It's my great character flaw.

337
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,279
Grief is ugly.

338
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,824
Other people's grief
is uncomfortable,

339
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,994
but we show up for the people
we love just in case,

340
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,289
so that their memory
of the day isn't just

341
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,209
cold, jacketless loneliness.

342
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,547
It used to feel like
I belonged here.

343
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,883
But this summer it's like...

344
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,304
I don't know.

345
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,097
Look, I get it. I get it.

346
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,099
But when two families merge,

347
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,018
someone always feels
like an intruder.

348
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,561
Hell, Carrie still gets
dirty looks

349
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,313
from some members
of our family.

350
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,689
That's not the same.

351
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,817
They're just so...
so privileged.

352
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,238
Yeah.

353
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,199
Yeah.

354
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,914
But they're not lucky
like we are.

355
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,374
Nobody hugged them enough.

356
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,476
You think I should
apologize to Gat?

357
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,729
I was kind of a dick.

358
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,731
Yeah, you were a total dick.

359
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,233
And Gat was a dick to Cady.

360
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,485
It was like a whole
circle of dicks.

361
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,654
It's fine.

362
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,905
I am fine.

363
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,868
You're giving serious
Aunt Penny vibes right now.

364
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,703
My mom is...

365
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,705
great in a crisis.

366
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,878
Mine's been crying
in the shower.

367
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:33,172
Mine's been using my dad as
an emotional support animal.

368
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,425
Look at them.

369
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:38,511
I was just about
to tell him

370
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,471
right when Tipper's heart
went...

371
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,640
The shuttle's here.

372
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,103

Wow, this tailor did
good work.

401
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,989
I'm surprised Penny didn't just
throw all my stuff in a bonfire

402
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,407
the second she arrived, though.

403
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,825
The groundskeeper said
she should wait

404
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,661
until after we get some rain,
so...

405
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,830
didn't think you'd be here.

406
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,581
Ah, I love a Sinclair party.

407
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:34,419
Canapés, the cocktails,
the condescension.

408
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,796
How's our girl doing?

409
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,803
I don't really know.

410
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,597
That's no good.

411
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,559
Hey, wish us both luck.

412
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,694
- Pen.
- Sam.

413
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,112

00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,118
Hey, Cady, sweetie.

415
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,038

00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,664

It's creepy.

421
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,661
Do you think heaven's real?

422
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,790
Uh, sure, I guess I do.

423
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,959
Seems fake to me.

424
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,795
Yeah, I mean,
if you're picturing

425
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,172
picnics on clouds
and togas and shit.

426
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,674
No, I think it's more like,

427
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,177
I don't know,
your favorite people,

428
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:09,472
your favorite food,
every pet you've ever had

429
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,349
licking your face
when you get home.

430
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,184
That's basically
our regular life.

431
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:17,772
But it's not everyone's life.

432
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,607
Heaven is for everyone, Will.

433
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,360
Not everyone.

434
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,197
If heaven's real, so is hell.

435
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:29,742
Um...I guess.

436
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,122
But Gran's not there.

437
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,541
I promise.

438
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,465
What is wrong
with your dress?

439
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,009
It's fine.

440
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:12,577
Heya, pal.
Sorry for your loss.

441
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,495
Why are you here, Beaumont?

442
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,414
My mom knew your grandmother.

443
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:19,292
Paul Revere chapter of the DAR.

444
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,544
She loved her like a mother.

445
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:24,380
That makes our situation
pretty fucked, huh?

446
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,591
Enjoy the service.

447
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,139
Thank you so much.

448
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,808
Now I'd like to ask
Tipper's husband,

449
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,435
Harris Sinclair,
to come forward

450
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:40,146
and say a few words.

451
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,037
<i>So what did he say?</i>

452
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,623
Harris?
A eulogy. It was good.

453
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:01,042
No, I mean Tipper
and our family.

454
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,627
What'd he say about them?

455
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:05,213
I'm not trying to avoid
telling you the truth.

456
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:09,300
I was so focused on my parents,
I really just don't remember.

457
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,968
Oh, oh.

458
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,137
Harris did that thing
that guys do in the movies,

459
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,556
you know, where he pulled out
his speech,

460
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,141
and then he put it
back in his pocket

461
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,226
and he spoke from the heart.

462
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,685
It was slick.

463
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,437
But, yeah, I...

464
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:25,024
I don't remember what he said.

465
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:29,278
Gat, you don't remember
any of it?

466
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,865
Honestly, Cady,
I just remember watching you.

467
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,124
Well, I hope
someone says something

468
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,793
memorable at my funeral.

469
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,045
I'll tell you
what I don't want.

470
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:49,423
A bunch of snobby
New York "art world" types

471
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,051
who don't even know me
standing around a room

472
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,136
talking about wine.

473
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,889
Yeah, and fake girls
being fake sad,

474
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,516
worrying about their lip gloss.

475
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,768
A bunch of people who just
show up so they can say

476
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,311
they went to a Sinclair party.

477
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:06,565
Religious people talking about
stuff I don't believe in.

478
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,402
But in my experiences,
all funerals suck.

479
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:16,284
No one's gonna notice if I go
back to Red Gate and read.

480
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:18,661
Uh, sure, yeah, you do you.

481
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,545
Thank you.

482
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,631
That is a parasol.

483
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,341
- Oh.
- For the sun.

484
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,636
UV rays and fillers don't mix,
you know.

485
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,221
She thought I was a butler.

486
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,682
Her third husband just married
her first husband,

487
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:43,227
so she's wrong about a lot.

488
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,730
- Your people are very strange.
- Yeah.

489
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,857
How did you end up so awesome?

490
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:52,194
Crystals and manifestation,

491
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,613
an adventurous lover all help.

492
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,823
Mm. Mm-hmm.

493
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:59,118
Yeah, I'm not awesome,

494
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:04,081
but I am OK because of you

495
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,375
swooping in like some big hero,

496
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,086
saving me all the time.

497
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,629
God, I have to go mingle.

498
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,967
Yeah, I can't rescue you
from that.

499
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,635
But you have my steel, milady.

500
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,623
Cady.

501
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,630
I'm really gonna miss Tipper.

502
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,883
Thank you so much, Judy.

503
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,426
So good of you to come.

504
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,058
Thank you.

505
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,354
- Are you hiding?
- Yeah, are you?

506
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,522
Yeah, kind of.

507
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,732
There's this guy
from a rival tennis team here

508
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,609
that I really
didn't want to see.

509
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,902
Our island's been invaded.

510
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,153
For real.

511
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,530
The sexter's here.

512
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,365
What? Where?
Is he hot?

513
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,699
Shh.

514
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,034
I feel like
he's gonna want to hook up,

515
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,036
and I still have no idea
what I'm doing.

516
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,871
No, he won't want to bone
at a funeral.

517
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,957
Ugh, there you are.

518
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:30,334
You left me out there
with the cheaters,

519
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,962
my dad and Gat.

520
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,547
And my mother.

521
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,465
It's officially
a quorum of cheaters.

522
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,092
Technically,
Gat didn't cheat on you.

523
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,261
He cheated with you.

524
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,390
What?
And we totally hate him for it.

525
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,808
Listen, change of subject.

526
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,436
Cadence, would you expect
sex at a funeral?

527
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:52,857
I guess people find solace
in unexpected places.

528
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:56,318
Like my vagina.

529
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,612
The sexter is here,
and I've had no time

530
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,406
- to work on my flexibility.
- Shit.

531
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,827
- That fucking guy.
- Oh, my God, it's happening.

532
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,662
Mirren, hi.

533
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,038
Hi.

534
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,957
I had no idea
that you were here.

535
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:10,958
Yeah.

536
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,334
This is Blake Beaumont.

537
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,920
These are my cousins,
Cadence and Johnny.

538
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,547
Yeah, we've met.

539
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,257
My condolences
to the both of you.

540
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,550
Mm.

541
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,010
Be gentle with her, Blake.

542
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:27,641
Hey, did you just
short-circuit?

543
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,477
No, I'm fine.

544
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:34,732
She really loved you both
so much.

545
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,400
Thank you.

546
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,614
No fucking clue who they are.

547
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,575
Well, you would if you watched
that Theranos documentary.

548
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,120
You handled that well, though.

549
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,622
Always perfect Penny.

550
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,957
Oh, perfection is unattainable.

551
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,542
At least that's what
I've been told

552
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,587
I'm supposed to pretend
to believe.

553
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,464
It's really annoying,
actually.

554
00:29:58,464 --> 00:29:59,924
You've been at it
since the crack of dawn.

555
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,927
You still don't have,
like, a hair out of place.

556
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,178
Oh, hardly.

557
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,180
I mean, the dress needed
tailoring, and I didn't...

558
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,599
What the fuck, Penny?

559
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,893
- Keep your voice down.
- What?

560
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:14,146
No, we agreed that she would
be buried in those...

561
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,356
We didn't agree on anything.

562
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:16,690
We just didn't have the nerve
to tell Dad

563
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,651
that it was very obviously
a bad idea

564
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:19,652
feeding them to the worms.

565
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,153
Come on.

566
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,280
Fine, you can wear them
today, OK,

567
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,032
'cause you have been great

568
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,575
with the logistics
and everything like that.

569
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,202
But I will come
and get them tomorrow.

570
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,453
To borrow them from me?

571
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,997
No, you know
that she promised them to me.

572
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,707
Do you have that in writing?

573
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,794
Dad gave them to her
when she was pregnant with me.

574
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,671
That is why
they are so special.

575
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:41,423
No, they are special
because she let us wear them

576
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,967
when she was proud of us,

577
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:46,095
a little token
so she didn't have to say

578
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:47,096
"I love you" out loud.

579
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,515
Don't talk about her
like that.

580
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,434
Give them back, please.

581
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,894
They don't even go
with your aesthetic,

582
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,604
your whole faux bohemian,

583
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,232
"I went to rehab
in Santa Fe" thing.

584
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:02,820
Penny, give them back.

585
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,947
Guys, guys, Yardley is here,

586
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,448
and she is still wearing
those Doc Martens.

587
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,533
Ugh.

588
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,784
You're not gonna believe
what she did.

589
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,661
Bess is feeling a little
ignored by her husband,

590
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,622
so she killed a whole bottle
of the Chablis before 3:00.

591
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,832
Don't drag her into this.

592
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:15,833
Look.

593
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,127
She took the pearls.

594
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,129
I will fight you.

595
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:31,307
Oh, is this a Goldschere?

596
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:34,226
Tipper was
an early supporter,

597
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,978
and he never forgot it.

598
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,856
Still sends us
a Christmas card every year.

599
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:42,151
- I assumed he was Jewish.
- Well, he is.

600
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,446
But he knows that she isn't.

601
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:48,324
That she...that she wasn't.

602
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:51,493
She had exquisite taste.

603
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,454
She did, indeed.

604
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:56,999
Oh, while we're on the subject,

605
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,376
the deal for the Thornton
fell through.

606
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,919
Saudi oil money, my ass.

607
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:06,300
But the broker said
he could find another buyer.

608
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,218
I'm sorry, the broker?

609
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,888
For Tipper's father's painting.

610
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,557
Oh. Yeah.

611
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,394
I assumed you knew
she was selling it.

612
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,979
We went back and forth.

613
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,524
You know, sell it,
archive it, donate it.

614
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,902
I lost track
of where we landed.

615
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,029
Do you mind
refreshing me on the...

616
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:29,281
Gatwick?

617
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,824
Hi.

618
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,284
Are you coming,
or are you going?

619
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:36,580
Uh, both, I guess.

620
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,874
I just...I just wanted to say

621
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,918
how great your eulogy was, sir.

622
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,170
Moving, really.

623
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,840
Everyone hung on every word.

624
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,051
Thank you.

625
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,844
You're the first person
to say so.

626
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,765
Is there anything at all
that I can do?

627
00:32:56,392 --> 00:33:01,271
Well, since you asked,
we put Franklin and Eleanor

628
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,065
in the laundry so they wouldn't
disturb things.

629
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,942
They'll need to be
let out by now.

630
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,985
Don't forget
to pick up after them.

631
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,656
People are wearing
Italian leather.

632
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,865
Sure.

633
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,912
It's quieter here.

634
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,872
Not that I'm, like,
trying to get you alone

635
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,959
or anything because that
would be super weird.

636
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:28,632
I recognize this view from
one of your paintings, right?

637
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:35,264
Yeah, sorry, I was stalking
your Instagram all summer.

638
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:37,433
What, were you hoping
for more thirst traps

639
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:40,310
than oil landscapes?

640
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,439
You know what?
I think you're really talented.

641
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:48,485
But I was hunting
for one bikini pic.

642
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,613
But that's because I was
on a yacht with my brothers,

643
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,449
and I was lonely.

644
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,412
The thing is,

645
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:02,332
I might be a little bit more
vanilla than my texts imply.

646
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,585
What, do you think
I came to the funeral

647
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:07,004
to hook up with you?

648
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,134
Is that why you swerved me
and hid in the curtains?

649
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:18,932
I came here today
because I wanted to see you.

650
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,813
That's it, OK?

651
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,648
No agenda.

652
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,941
Really?

653
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:34,615
Maybe it's OK if there's
a little bit of an agenda.

654
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,703
No, absofuckinglutely not!

655
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,371
Oh, my God.

656
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,915
- It is mine.
- What?

657
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,958
You cannot call dibs
on a catamaran.

658
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,794
Its name is the <i>Elizabeth.</i>

659
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,712
Yes, after Eliza Hamilton.

660
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,048
Then I get this statue.

661
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:52,966
- Mom said.
- No, she didn't.

662
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,802
You don't even have a lawn.
Why do you care?

663
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,678
The Goldschere is promised
to the Whitney.

664
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,138
Well, who the fuck is Whitney?

665
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,723
Keep you voice down.

666
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:00,891
We have guests.

667
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,602
We can pick the bones tomorrow.

668
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,313
Oh, says the literal
grave robber.

669
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,314
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah.

670
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,941
You clutch those pearls, Pen.

671
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,488
Bess, where are you going?

672
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,740
To the jewelry box
before it's looted.

673
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,911
Is that your mom?

674
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,454
Oh, my God,
this is so embarrassing.

675
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,455
I'm so sorry. I...

676
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,874
Hey, hey, no, it's OK.
It's OK.

677
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,001
I get it.
Funerals are hard.

678
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,712
Families are weird.

679
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,173
It's cool.

680
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,466
You're cool.

681
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,804
Wait here really quick, OK?

682
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,138
I'll send for you.

683
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,224
Yeah, I wasn't
gonna go anywhere.

684
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,811
Cadence, I need a favor.

685
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,021
I need you to distract Blake
for 12 minutes

686
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,690
and then send him
to Cuddledown.

687
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,066
Do I want to ask why?

688
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,568
Because that gives me
enough time to make sure

689
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:53,819
that I smell of bergamot.

690
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,696
And then I can put
my matching lingerie set on

691
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,156
and hide all of those
self-help books.

692
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,951
Actually, make that 17.
I should shave, right?

693
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,327
Is that good? You got it?
Yeah?

694
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,579
- Mm-hmm.
- Please, please, please.

695
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,872
I love you.
Thank you.

696
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,123
You're an angel.
You're an angel.

697
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:08,000
You're the best!
Thank you!

698
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,296
You did not bang the sexter
at Gran's memorial.

699
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:13,964
Don't judge me.

700
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,674
And no, I didn't.

701
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,343
I waited in my room forever,

702
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,388
shaved until I was as hairless
as a Thanksgiving turkey,

703
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:25,350
and the sexter
never showed, so...

704
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,562
oh, dude, come on.

705
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,814
- Go away.
- That is so annoying.

706
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,274
OK, let's go in.

707
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,859
I think we should paint
the Cuddledown walls.

708
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,068
It's looking weirdly patriotic.

709
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,155
Wait, wait, the sexter
bailing on Mirren,

710
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,406
was it my fault?

711
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:42,075
Did I get distracted
and forget to tell him?

712
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,036
It's not your fault. OK?

713
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,747
You're not always the bad guy.

714
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,999
This whole sad martyr thing
is not the vibe.

715
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,334
Blake Beaumont is a dick,
and Mirren found out

716
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,793
the hard way.
End of story.

717
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,755
Can we please just stop talking
about all this funeral shit?

718
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:55,839
Jesus!

719
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,466
You're just making me
more curious.

720
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:03,221
Yeah, Johnny,
this one's on you.

721
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,143
All right, fine.

722
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,938
You want to know everything,
fine.

723
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,148
Blake was preoccupied.

724
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,608
It's bullshit, OK?

725
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,068
You're using Mirren
to get at me

726
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,653
at my grandmother's funeral.

727
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:19,696
- Is that how it feels?
- How does that feel?

728
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,531
- Familiar.
- Stop.

729
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,283
- Stop coming at me.
- And if I don't?

730
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,969
Johnny.

731
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,261
I'm out.

732
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,019
You're bleeding.

733
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,942
I'm still sorry
about that whole thing, Mir.

734
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,612
It's fine.

735
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,197
It's not your fault
that he was using me

736
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,324
to get under your skin.

737
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,910
So I should have known
something was up.

738
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,831
He was way too perfect.

739
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,666
 <i>Nobody's that perfect.</i>

740
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:21,842
You good?

741
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:24,094
Do you know
if a tall, handsome guy

742
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,054
in a dark blue blazer
left already?

743
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,597
I'm gonna need a name.

744
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,890
Blake Beaumont.

745
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,642
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I took the Beaumonts

746
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,352
back to Tisbury,
like, an hour ago.

747
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:37,899
Any chance his mom dragged him
kicking and screaming

748
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,485
while he begged
to say goodbye to me?

749
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,696
Don't worry.
You're better off.

750
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:45,407
The kid is not worth
all the perfume you got on.

751
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,242
For what it's worth,

752
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,537
definitely isn't worth
sending your nudes to.

753
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,164
What?

754
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,457
How the hell do you know?

755
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:55,625
Oh, no, look, I just drive
the water taxi.

756
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,502
People talk like I'm not even
there most of the time.

757
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:02,299
That kid was not subtle
about bagging a Sinclair.

758
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:03,675
He didn't bag me.

759
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,137
And you really shouldn't be
spying on people

760
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,638
that are paying you
for your services.

761
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:11,391
It's called discretion, Ebon.

762
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:12,809
- Ah.
- What?

763
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,811
No, it's just very special
you know my name.

764
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,104
You people usually don't.

765
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,273
You've been driving the boat
around for three summers.

766
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,858
Of course I know your name.

767
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,943
And now I also know
you're a creepy eavesdropper

768
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:25,155
who sniffs girls in distress.

769
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,449
And we won't be needing
your services any longer.

770
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,118
We'll call the Falmouth shuttle
from now on.

771
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,461
Ready? All right.

772
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,213
Good boy. Good boy. Good boy.

773
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,964
Ready? Ready?

774
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,132
Come on, come on, come on.

775
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,884
Here. Right there.

776
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,803
Go on.
Go fetch. Yeah.

777
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:55,060

780
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,317
I was trying to cheer them up.

782
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:08,031

<i>♪ We kept each other</i>
 <i>dreaming ♪</i>

784
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,621
Well, you can give my dad
his box of junk from the attic

785
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:17,165
and tell him to go back
to his hotel.

786
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,709
He hates Beechwood
just as much as you do.

787
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,420
- I don't hate it here, Cadence.
- Why?

788
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,298
We're so cold and cruel
and casually racist.

789
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,508
You know you're shockingly good

790
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,426
at this whole
icy-cold Sinclair thing?

791
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,678
Yeah, you sound like my dad.

792
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,888
Great. Perfect.
Why don't you just box me up

793
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:36,143
and pretend I was never here
just like you're doing to him?

794
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:39,688
Look, that's why I didn't
tell you about Raquel.

795
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,731
I didn't want to get exiled.

796
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,860
You might think
I'm a terrible person,

797
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,112
but integrity matters to me.

798
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,197
And I hate cheaters.

799
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,491
And you made me one of them.

800
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,076
You made me the other woman

801
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,828
in your love story
with someone else.

802
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,997
And then you tried
to tell me it was my fault

803
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:58,874
because sometimes I forget
to thank the chef

804
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:00,208
for my orange juice, Gat.

805
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,377
I feel really bad
about the way that I said that.

806
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,378
The timing was...

807
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,088
I'm not mad at you
for saying it.

808
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,801
You were right.

809
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,595
Of course you were right.

810
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:15,140
I'm mad because...

811
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,602
when I saw you
writing that letter to Raquel,

812
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:21,563
I thought you were
writing it for me.

813
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:27,110
And it was like
something changed.

814
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:33,491
It was...

815
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,912
and now I feel so stupid.

816
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:39,915
I know. I know.
I know I fucked up.

817
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,459
And I don't blame you
if you don't forgive me.

818
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:44,169
Look, I want to be
a good person.

819
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,337
It's just...

820
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:53,428
...it's not easy
when I'm around you.

821
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,390
Oh, no.

822
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,622
Oh, come on.

823
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,123
What are you doing?

824
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,541
Grieving.

825
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,960
And the lip?

826
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,254
Uh, grieving with flair.

827
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:28,755
Hmm.

828
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,131
Hey, come on.

829
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,761
Mmm.

830
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,429
Don't give me that look.

831
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,015
On really shitty days,
we all have an excuse

832
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,433
to revert back
to our 16-year-old selves

833
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,685
for a bit.

834
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:43,603
You don't have
enough tits to fill it!

835
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,732
Case in point.

836
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:53,321
You started this
with that necklace.

837
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,741
Dad, will you talk
some sense into them?

838
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,410
What is this about?

839
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,619
The Grande Baroque sets.

840
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:00,870
And the Goldschere.

841
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,499
The Whitney has four of them.
I looked it up.

842
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,085
Well, your timing is perfect.

843
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:14,718
Thatcher and I, we were going
through your mother's records.

844
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,430
You remember her?

845
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,725
The blonde
that we laid to rest today?

846
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:26,396
Or perhaps she's just cash flow
and a coffin to you,

847
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:28,732
because her ledger is telling
quite the story.

848
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,820
Ah, there, peace and quiet.

849
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,905
All she ever really asked for.

850
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:42,412
You know, I always thought
that I'd be the first to go.

851
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:45,206
Shipwreck during
the Transatlantic race.

852
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,417
Learjet crash.

853
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,337
I pictured Tipper
getting a call.

854
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:51,880
I knew she'd be all right
eventually.

855
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,090
She'd have the three of you

856
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,426
rallying around her
with love and support.

857
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:59,846
But all the while,
her right ventricle

858
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,931
was making other plans.

859
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:07,395
And just as unexpectedly,
I find myself utterly relieved

860
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,732
that she went first
because it breaks my heart

861
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:14,569
to think that I would have left
Tipper alone

862
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,988
to be as deeply

863
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:22,410
and utterly ashamed

864
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,538
of you all

865
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:29,959
as I am now.

866
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:52,732
Her checkbook is closed now,

867
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:54,484
but I am still here.

868
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:58,071
And I will decide what to do
with the fortune that I built.

869
00:44:58,071 --> 00:45:00,281
There'll be no more handouts,

870
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,826
not until I see
people worth my investment.

871
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:06,329
I sent you all out in the world
with generous trusts,

872
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,040
resources you were expected
to implement

873
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,668
to become a credit
to the family.

874
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:14,421
Do any of you believe
that you've added value

875
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:16,172
to the Sinclair name?

876
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,056
Daddy, for the record,
I've never personally

877
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,724
touched my trust fund.

878
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:03,511
So good of you all to come.

879
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,029
So s'mores?

880
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:23,490
Ugh, no.
I have a stomachache.

881
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,366
I'm glad we talked.

882
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:29,662
Hey, look, I know I didn't say
any of the right things

883
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,789
back then.

884
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,918
I wanted to make things better.

885
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:36,252
I wanted to see you
happy again.

886
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,296
I didn't need to be happy.

887
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,631
Not on that day.

888
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:47,931
And I heard
what I needed to hear,

889
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,807
 <i>just not from you.</i>

890
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,768
You miss her.

891
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:54,062
I miss her too.

892
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,855
It's OK to cry.

893
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:58,191
Hmm? You cry it all out. Yeah.

894
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,820
She's always with you,
I promise.

895
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,325
Eleanor, Franklin,
let's go get a treat.

896
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,369
Come on.
Come on.

897
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:15,041
She's sweet with them.

898
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,471
She told me to make my heart
a small target.

899
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,645
Well, those Sinclair rules
work for her.

900
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,647
I think she really believes
they help.

901
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,779
You know, Cady,
you're only half Sinclair.

902
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:50,326
And us Eastmans, we...

903
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:53,705
we get pretty sad.

904
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:55,873
We get pretty fucking angry
sometimes.

905
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:01,963
You can be angry with me
if you want.

906
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:04,424
You can yell at me.
You can scream at me.

907
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:05,967
I am angry.

908
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:14,058
But mostly,

909
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,686
I'm just sad.

910
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:19,606
Yeah.

911
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:24,694
Cady, I'm so sorry
that I let you down,

912
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:26,237
'cause I swear
I wanted the whole world

913
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:29,157
to be perfect for you.

914
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:31,159
I just hope maybe someday,
the good moments

915
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,619
that you and I have
will outweigh

916
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:33,995
the bad thing that I did.

917
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:38,166
And then...

918
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:39,709
you'll forgive me maybe.

919
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,630
Maybe.

920
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:52,764
Let it out.

921
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,643
That's a good dog.

922
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,150
Ay, ay, ay. Thank you.

923
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,653
Thank you.

924
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:23,920
Cady?

925
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,213
Do we forgive Gat?

926
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,180
Yeah.

927
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,390
We forgive him.

928
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:38,893
Bro.

929
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,353
Bro.

930
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,313
Ahh.

931
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:47,110
OK, so...

932
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:50,571
is heaven a thing
in your religion?

933
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,031
Kinda.

934
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,784
Depends on your karma, I guess.

935
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,703
I'd explain,
but it's complicated.

936
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:58,871
And you generally hate
learning, right, so...

937
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,081
That's fair.

938
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,374
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

939
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:02,750
I appreciate you.
Thank you.

940
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,710
Mm.

941
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:10,383
If heaven is a thing, though,
Gran's there, right?

942
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:12,844
She's watching over us, waiting
for Granddad to join her?

943
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:19,809
I don't know, I hope heaven
isn't just a waiting room

944
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:22,937
full of people
spying on their grandkids.

945
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,481
Yeah.

946
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,400
Maybe she's young again.

947
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:32,155
Maybe she's partying
with dead rock stars.

948
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,119
Maybe she's just being
impolite and improper

949
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:40,496
just because she can.

950
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:43,624
Maybe...

951
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:47,503
maybe heaven is different
for everyone, you know?

952
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:51,424
I think my heaven is like this.

953
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:56,429
No adults, no Littles, no drama.

954
00:50:56,429 --> 00:51:02,059
Just the four of us

955
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,646
here by the ocean,
kind of tipsy...

956
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:13,362
...in a mythical land
where it's always summer.

957
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:22,663

Wait, you remembered us
from the rocks?

960
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:32,465
Cadence, I thought
you didn't remember

961
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:33,758
anything about that day.

962
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,760
The memories came back to me
in the rose garden.

963
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,261
I don't understand.

964
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:40,306
Why did you make us tell you
about things you already knew?

965
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:43,768
I had to find out who was
lying to me about last summer.

966
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,523
And now I know.

967
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:51,150
Blake Beaumont
wasn't hooking up with Johnny

968
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,028
when I found him.

969
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,739
That's not why he bailed
on Mirren.

970
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,366
No, it's bullshit.

971
00:51:58,366 --> 00:52:01,828
You're using Mirren to get at me
at my grandmother's funeral.

972
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:02,995
Is that what it feels like?

973
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,455
Don't fucking touch me!

974
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,873
What are you gonna do,
killer, huh?

975
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,960
What, are you gonna ruin my life
like you did that poor kid?

976
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,002
That wasn't my fault.

977
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,420
There's video.

978
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,631
You almost murdered him,
you psychopath.

979
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:16,342
Leave my fucking family alone,
or I'll almost murder you.

980
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,011
Stop.

981
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,057
Stop!

982
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:24,141
Chill.

983
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:28,604

You're bleeding.

987
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,701
Johnny was violent again.

988
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:43,661
It was prep school
rivalry shit.

989
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,413
It has nothing to do
with your accident.

990
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,790
Then why did he lie to me?

991
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,835
And why did Mirren
cover for him?

992
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:54,422
I mean, you're the only one
who told me the truth today.

993
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,885
So today was all a test.

994
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:01,470
This morning when you said
that you weren't feeling well,

995
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,471
you were playing me.

996
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:03,890
You remembered all along.

997
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,017
I need answers.

998
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:09,186
I need to see if all the lies
lead to me

999
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,523
on that beach alone.

1000
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:15,610
I think Johnny and Mirren
know something.

1001
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:20,656
Please, Gat, will you help me
figure this out?

1002
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,411
Please.

1003
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:32,126
You know, sometimes I feel like
I would do anything for you.

my whole reason for...

1005

I thought you were in pain.

1006
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:40,718
That's why I agreed
to talk about the funeral.

1007
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,679
And now I just...
I feel like an idiot.

1008
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:46,057
Johnny and Mirren aren't
the only ones who lied.

1009
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:49,435
