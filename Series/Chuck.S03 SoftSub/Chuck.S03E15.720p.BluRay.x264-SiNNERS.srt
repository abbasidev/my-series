1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,963
This is my boss,
Charles Bartowski...

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:10,551
...a computer repairman with all
the government's secrets in his head.

3
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,808
This is his girl, Sarah Walker...

4
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,186
...a CIA agent with more
than just killer looks.

5
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,275
And when these two spies first met...

6
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,861
...it was love at first fight.

7
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,790
That's where I come in. I'm Morgan.

8
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,293
It's my job to keep an eye
on the both of them...

9
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,546
...which isn't always easy.

10
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,358
Oh, hey, dude.
I had the most incredible dream, man.

11
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,486
- I was--
- Hey.

12
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,738
Uh... Do you want some?

13
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,031
Hello? Morgan?

14
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,077
Hi.
Do you want some orange juice?

15
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,955
Orange juice? Orange juice.
Absolutely. Man, that sounds good.

16
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,458
Vitamin D's are very important--
Vitamin C's.

17
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,835
- Vitamin C, singular.
- Great. Ahem.

18
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,588
Sorry. Yeah, no, I just--
The jug's so big.

19
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,341
Jug-- I'm sorry, I...

20
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,802
I hate you, Chuck. I hate you.

21
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,476
- Good morning, buddy.
- Okay, I get it.

22
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,437
You're having tons of sex.
Congratulations, Warren Beatty.

23
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,398
- Who said anything about--?
- Big, goofy grin said it.

24
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:52,361
And it's an insult for us living in the
apartment who aren't having sex.

25
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,739
- Which is me.
- Sorry. Sorry about that.

26
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,241
I'm just really happy.

27
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,868
Well, duh.
You're dating a leggy Valkyrie.

28
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,039
Says the guy who likes to sleep
in the nude, au buffo?

29
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,918
Oh, well, I've actually made the very
painful concession of wearing pajamas.

30
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,004
You never know when she's gonna
be stopping by now and--

31
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,132
Count on Sarah being here
every night...

32
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,968
...because I'm about to ask her
if she wants to move in.

33
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,638
Okay. Well, you two
probably have a lot to talk about.

34
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,645
Hi. I was gonna surprise you...

35
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,190
...take you out to a nice dinner
and give you your own key.

36
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,944
But how would you like to move in?

37
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,488
Why would we do that?

38
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,408
Why?

39
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,245
Well, because I figured since you're
sleeping here most nights anyway--

40
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,082
We're not a normal couple, so why
pretend like we have a normal life?

41
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,501
- Who's pretending?
- I didn't mean it like that.

42
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,629
I love working with you
and I love being with you...

43
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,923
...so why mess with a good thing,
right?

44
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,385
- We can talk more after work.
- Right, yeah.

45
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:03,265
Yeah, we'll talk more after work,
because I know how good a thing this is.

46
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,560
- What are you doing?
- Well, I left my gun in my hotel room.

47
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,813
No, what are you doing
storing your guns in my couch?

48
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,356
Morgan could find those.

49
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,984
What, you've not heard
of the 30-foot rule?

50
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,360
As a matter of fact, no.

51
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,696
A good agent should never be
without a weapon.

52
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,033
Ever heard of the Bartowski rule?
No firearms in my apartment.

53
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,452
Well, not if you want to live
with a spy.

54
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,082
Hey, Chuck. Got your message.
Everything's fine.

55
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,335
We can't talk.
We're moving to a new clinic.

56
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,836
We're here, babe. Hang up.

57
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,005
Love you. Bye.

58
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:44,056
Excuse me. Doctors Without Borders.
Any idea where the field clinic is?

59
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,307
Nothing?

60
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,270
Babe, I think this is the clinic.

61
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,397
I have seen more patients
in two weeks...

62
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,275
...than I've seen
in my first few years as a doctor.

63
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,486
Any idea who the men
with the guns are?

64
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,073
The UN wear blue berets
and the FDLR wear black berets.

65
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,659
But Devon, these guys
aren't wearing any berets.

66
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,410
Hey. Hey.

67
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,580
- Whoever they are, they're in charge.
- Keep it moving.

68
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,791
Honey, what have we gotten
ourselves into?

69
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,294
Remember what they said about this
being the toughest job you'll love?

70
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,546
- We're making a difference.
- I know, I know.

71
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,424
I know. What's getting to me
is the not showering...

72
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,971
...and the not sleeping, and the not
knowing who the men with the guns are.

73
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,810
Well, how about a date night?
I'll cook dinner for you tonight.

74
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,938
- Just you and me under the stars.
- Okay.

75
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,733
I'm sure it'll clear up any minute.

76
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,443
You lead the way.

77
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,861
- Over here.
- Follow me.

78
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,238
You're in charge.

79
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,240
What do you mean
we're not in charge?

80
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,701
- Are you demoting us, general?
- No.

81
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,245
You will be acting
in an observational capacity...

82
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,454
...on this mission.

83
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,958
The primary agents are named
Craig and Laura Turner.

84
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,167
Never heard of them.

85
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,503
AKA George and Bitsy Witherspoon?

86
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,715
The CIA team who stopped
the Air France hijacking in '86?

87
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,758
AKA John and Suzie Smythe.

88
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,803
The ones who broke up
the Uranium smuggling ring in '91.

89
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:09,182
I could go on and on listing the Turners'
aliases and accomplishments.

90
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,185
So they've been around the CIA block.
That's good for them.

91
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:16,064
They have also been married
for the last 30 years, more or less.

92
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,276
And this is relevant to us how?

93
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,278
As long as you and Agent Bartowski...

94
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,822
...insist on keeping
a personal relationship...

95
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,658
...I insist you learn
how to go about it properly.

96
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,079
Your mission is to watch and learn from
the best couple the CIA has produced.

97
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,499
And you, Colonel Casey--

98
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,502
I'll head down to Pendleton,
recertify my weapons training.

99
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,047
It's not your training
that concerns me.

100
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,132
I'm talking about Morgan Grimes.

101
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,593
It was your idea
to make him a part of the team.

102
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,387
It's your job to make him field-ready.

103
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,557
- You can't be serious.
- He's a diamond in the rough.

104
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,144
Very, very rough,
but I'm sure you'll make him...

105
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,521
...sparkle.

106
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,776
Diamond.

107
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,694
Diamond in the rough.

108
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,242
Would you please sit down?
You're making me nervous.

109
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,536
The Turners are gonna be here
any minute.

110
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,998
- You've never met a CIA agent before?
- You--? What--? Come on.

111
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,833
You heard. These guys are the best.

112
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:21,338
They're a super spy couple. I don't want
them thinking we're a couple of rubes.

113
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,006
What a dump.

114
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,092
Can you imagine being
stationed here?

115
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,886
Remember when the CIA
held rooms for us...

116
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,638
...at the Grand Ambassador?

117
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,308
Ah. Ha-ha. The salad days.

118
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,268
What'd you say their names were
again?

119
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,896
I believe their names
are Bertruski or Bertrowski.

120
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,439
Something ethnic.

121
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,358
Two young agency hotshots.

122
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,818
They're here.

123
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,620
Dear God, it's us 30 years ago.

124
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,290
Look, Sarah, that's us in 30 years.

125
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,211
So there you have it:
Operation Mongoose.

126
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,298
Made it out of Berlin
with half the KGB on my tail.

127
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,510
If it hadn't been for that woman
in the fur coat with the AK-47--

128
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,513
Enough with the Cold War stories,
darling.

129
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,807
- You're boring our hosts.
- No, no, no.

130
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,352
This is fascinating to me at least.

131
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,981
A toast, Charles, to old spy stories.

132
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,983
Oh, Mrs. Turner,
can I get you a drink?

133
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,987
No, thank you.
I'm fine with my water.

134
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,697
The wife does not partake...

135
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,325
...so I guess I'll just have to toast
for both of us.

136
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,831
A serviceable Manhattan,
Charles.

137
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,921
- Something wrong with your cherry?
- Actually, a true Manhattan is made...

138
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,924
...with a rare and delicate
marasca cherry.

139
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,094
The only place you can find those
here in L.A. would be--

140
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,263
- The Grand Ambassador.
- Grand Ambassador.

141
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,140
Don't be a booze snob, darling.

142
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,976
Getting back to your story.
The woman in the fur coat...

143
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,145
...I'm assuming, was you,
Mrs. Turner?

144
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,315
- Mm. That's how you met?
- How we got divorced.

145
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,568
The hussy in the fur
was a Russian double agent.

146
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:52,030
- I thought the two of you were married.
- Remarried. Three times.

147
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,825
Some women are too special
to marry just once.

148
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,163
My, look at the time.

149
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,750
- Goodness, we'd better get going.
- Oh, so soon?

150
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,629
This has been just great. Sarah and I
cannot wait to work with you.

151
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,840
- Oh, you won't have to.
- The mission is tonight, Charles.

152
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,134
The target is Otto Von Vogel.

153
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,971
Otto has created
a decryption program...

154
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,765
...that could render
CIA security useless.

155
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,477
Tonight's party is a smoke screen
for him to meet potential buyers.

156
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,980
Our job is to access
Otto's master suite...

157
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,690
...where he stores the software.

158
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,359
- Okay. What do you want us to do?
- MRS.

159
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,486
Watch and learn.

160
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,532
I can't wait to watch
these two in action.

161
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,411
It is gonna be great. What?

162
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,246
So, what are Chuck and Sarah
up to?

163
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,832
- Some sort of sexy spy dinner party?
- Shh.

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,792
Oh, right. Sorry, sorry.

165
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,087
I don't know. This whole G-man gig
is starting to become a snore.

166
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,757
- When am I gonna hurt some terrorists?
- Hey.

167
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,845
Whatever it is you think you know
about being a spy, you're wrong.

168
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,390
Okay.

169
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,184
You're a child.
You're a liability to the team.

170
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,396
You're not doing anything until
you've been properly trained.

171
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,689
Does that mean--?

172
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,567
- Can't believe I'm gonna say this.
- I'm going to Langley.

173
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,611
You're not going anywhere, jackass.

174
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,489
I can teach you everything you need to
know right here in the store. Come on.

175
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,825
Start with the neck thing.

176
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,376
So that's Otto, I take it.

177
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,337
Avoid him and his guards.

178
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,715
If anyone asks who you are,
tell them you're our nephew, Bernard.

179
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,967
Actually, tell them she's our niece.

180
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,887
- No offense, Charles.
- No, none taken.

181
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,308
- Shall we work the room first?
- After you, my love.

182
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,102
Here we go.

183
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,522
How's the tennis elbow, Monty?

184
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,067
Can I give you a word of advice?
Eat and rest.

185
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,693
See, consummate professionals.

186
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,780
I mean, what do you think makes
them such a great spy team?

187
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,324
- A lifetime of training.
- Very funny.

188
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,953
I'm talking about them being a couple.
I can't believe the CIA doesn't hire more.

189
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,331
- They're not that great.
- Oh. Don't be jealous.

190
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,167
I'm not jealous. I'm just saying
they're not that great.

191
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,463
Sarah, we, ahem,
may have a slight problem.

192
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,471
- There you are Otto, old boy.
- We heard you were in town...

193
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,473
...and assumed
you were having a party.

194
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,935
I don't recall putting you two
on the guest list.

195
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,148
I'm just kidding. Look at your faces.

196
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,527
Oh, Otto, you are terrible.

197
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:41,908
As they say in my country,
mein haus ist ihr haus.

198
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,911
Textbook subversion. Not bad.

199
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,624
You know, we could take a page
out of the Turners' playbook.

200
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,504
- You're not gonna ask me to move in.
- No.

201
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,215
Well, not now. Maybe later.

202
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,551
At ease.

203
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,263
There are three qualities that make
an effective agent.

204
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,140
- Subversion. Stealth.
- Me. Me.

205
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,809
- Strength.
- Eh.

206
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,312
First things first.
See that customer over there?

207
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,232
Oh, my goodness. Super hottie?

208
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,278
- Yeah, I clocked her when she came in.
- I want you to get her phone number.

209
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,572
Ha-ha. Right. No, seriously,
what's the first step?

210
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,159
A spy must be able to manipulate
any target at any time.

211
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,412
In the field, it can make the difference
between life and death.

212
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,539
Copy that. Yes, sir. Okay. Ooh.

213
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,584
What about her, though?
Silver-tops really eat me up. Oof!

214
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,253
You have your target. Engage.

215
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,681
How you doing?

216
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,727
- You're okay?
- Get on with it.

217
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,358
Hmm.

218
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,948
Target has been neutralized.

219
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,578
I thought Bartowski was hopeless.

220
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,511
I'm not sure where the Turners went.

221
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,930
Maybe they already made their move.

222
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,768
I thought she said she didn't drink.

223
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,437
Yeah.

224
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,231
Hit me.

225
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,818
Hi. Hi, Mrs. Turner. Uh...

226
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,780
Sarah and I were wondering
if the mission is going according to plan.

227
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,949
Is something wrong?

228
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,117
Her.

229
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,702
It's disgusting.

230
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,996
Man's old enough to be her father.

231
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,625
Perhaps he's just giving her
some fatherly advice?

232
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,836
Bastard left his mike on.

233
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,963
You are a very naughty girl.

234
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,131
It's too bad my wife is here.

235
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,385
Perhaps we can hook up
later at my hotel.

236
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,596
The man's nothing
but a CIA-sanctioned gigolo.

237
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,181
Oh...

238
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,391
You don't mean that.

239
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:17,063
- Oh. Wait, where are you going?
- Upstairs to steal the software.

240
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,941
At least one of us
is still a professional.

241
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,283
- I'll handle this. Here, let me.
- Get your hands off me.

242
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,076
- You're fighting me.
- Don't touch.

243
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,120
- You're making a scene.
- Don't touch me!

244
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,664
Dear Lord, my back.

245
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,625
- Oh, this is not good.
- It's an old service injury.

246
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,253
Oh, you threw your back out
with a Havana hooker.

247
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,589
- All in the line of duty.
- Right.

248
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,341
- Give us a moment. It'll fix itself.
- Don't start with me.

249
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,634
The back, not her.

250
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:51,055
We should get out of here
before they blow all of our covers.

251
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,808
Don't touch me!

252
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,312
- What about the software?
- Let's show the Turners how it's done.

253
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,900
Is there a nurse here?
Someone in a short skirt?

254
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,740
Master suite. Master suite.

255
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,576
- Master suite.
- Yeah.

256
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,751
Otto's safe has to be around here
somewhere.

257
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,838
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

258
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,258
There's gotta be a cat around here.
My allergies are going crazy.

259
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,762
Whoa. Hey. Look at this.

260
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,973
Our buddy Otto's
into some kinky stuff...

261
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,808
...even by German standards.

262
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,482
- Chuck?
- Yeah.

263
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,068
Put the whip down.

264
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,153
Why?

265
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,673
Not a fan of the whip, are you,
big fella?

266
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,223
I'll just put this away
and let you get back to your catnap. Aah!

267
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,906
- Chuck?
- Mm-hm?

268
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,200
- Run.
- Yeah, go, go, go!

269
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,285
Go.

270
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,997
The software.
The software is on the tiger's collar.

271
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,046
If I just had my tranq gun.
No. No, that's not a tranq gun.

272
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,757
I am not letting you shoot.
They are majestic.

273
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,719
- Do you have better ideas?
- What we need to be asking...

274
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,429
...is what would the Turners do?

275
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,265
To survive in the field,
an agent has to employ stealth.

276
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,559
Good. Are you kidding me?
I move like a cat.

277
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,561
I want you to steal something for me.

278
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,813
Look at these hands. Nimble.
Steal anything.

279
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,357
- Look at this. Boom. Done.
- No.

280
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,443
I have something a little
more difficult in mind.

281
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,406
- Oh, come on, really?
- Suck it up.

282
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,575
Target acquired.

283
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,078
Okay, the Turners aren't perfect.
I'm willing to modify my opinion.

284
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,081
She's a drunk and he's a philanderer.
They're a total mess.

285
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,875
They're not without their charms.

286
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,335
There could be worse people
we could turn into.

287
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,463
I would rather be eaten alive
by a tiger.

288
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,548
I am done waiting for Otto
to find us.

289
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,216
Let's get the software
and get out of here.

290
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,971
I've heard that noise before.

291
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,515
That sounds like...

292
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,987
Your mission, moron,
is to steal Big Mike's key card.

293
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,456
See? What did I tell you?

294
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,877
Sleeping just like Big Mike
after eating a baker's dozen.

295
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,088
- Okay. Shh.
- Shh.

296
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,429
- Give me the gun. I'll cover you.
- No, I'll cover you.

297
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,515
- You get the collar.
- No, trust me.

298
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,350
You have that feline instinct.

299
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,685
I know how to use a gun
better than you do.

300
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,479
Don't think that's a great idea.

301
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,648
- Just do it.
- Okay, fine.

302
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,585
Oh, my God! Aah!

303
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,716
Why didn't you shoot it?
It was about to eat me.

304
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,760
- You said he was majestic.
- He is a little majestic.

305
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,651
Grimes? I told you I don't like
people looking at me when I'm asleep.

306
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,405
Mm-hm. I know,
it's just you had me so worried.

307
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,157
I thought you were dead.

308
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,242
- What's in your hand?
- Your key card.

309
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,871
Yeah, and I thought it was cutting off
your air supply, your air pipe.

310
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,874
Your esophagi.
Then I'm looking at it and there's jelly.

311
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,752
- Give me that.
- Yeah. Take it. I was going to wash it--

312
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,378
- I'm a grown man.
- You are.

313
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,965
- I can clean up after myself.
- Naturally.

314
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,219
But you can get me another one
of those doughnuts.

315
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,643
Thank you for going to all this trouble.

316
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,353
Babe, I'm your husband.

317
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,689
- It's my job to take care of you, honey.
- Still, I feel silly.

318
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,775
There's people here
with real problems.

319
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,237
You get to feel how you feel.
It's a lot to adjust to.

320
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:43,282
I guess I'm having a hard time
shaking the whole city-girl thing.

321
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,870
I'm sort of out of my element.
I'm not really an outdoorsy type.

322
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,541
Don't move, babe.

323
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,587
- Devon, what are you looking at?
- Don't breathe. Do not move.

324
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,173
Devon.

325
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:08,349
It's okay. It's okay.
You're the new guys, right?

326
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,227
The husband-and-wife team?
Yeah, I'm Justin.

327
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,354
Camp security coordinator.

328
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,525
Might wanna set up camp
a little further away from the perimeter.

329
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,944
The animals get a little curious
at night.

330
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,281
- You okay, honey?
- Oh, gosh. We're making a difference.

331
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,491
Sorry I wasn't around
when you arrived.

332
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,536
Outside of your snake,
we're very grateful to have you here.

333
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,539
- We need all the doctors we can find.
- Thanks.

334
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,960
Yeah, anytime.
And welcome to Africa.

335
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,045
- Yeah.
- Ha-ha.

336
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,880
We're okay.

337
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,465
You all right?

338
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,469
We're all right.

339
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:52,852
Okay, here's the deal.
We'll call the Turners from the road.

340
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,731
Impressive. You know,
I didn't think they had it in them.

341
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,400
Ha. What are you guys doing?

342
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,569
We're teaching you
something about spying.

343
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,696
Lesson one, trust no one.

344
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,073
Except your partner, of course.

345
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,785
- We'll take Otto's software.
- What? No, no.

346
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,497
You're the Turners.
You can't be doing this to us.

347
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,459
Don't feel bad, Charles.
We're the best at this.

348
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,216
What do you mean,
they went rogue?

349
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,510
General, Mrs. Turner
pulled a gun on me.

350
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,514
And might I add, I think she may have
a bit of a problem with the sauce.

351
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,975
The Turners stole Otto's software.

352
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,771
The Turners are two
of the most decorated spies in the CIA.

353
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,815
There must be some explanation
for their behavior.

354
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,150
I suggest you find it.

355
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,778
I'd track them down
if you wanna ask them yourself.

356
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,113
Colonel, you have your mission.

357
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,075
Oh, yeah, how is that field training
with Morgan going?

358
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,827
He makes you look
like a natural-born operative.

359
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,705
If you can't make Morgan Grimes
field-ready...

360
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,666
...I'm sending you both
to boot camp in Pendleton.

361
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,543
That is all.

362
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,881
Great. This is just great.
This is perfect.

363
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:08,177
Not only did the Turners sell us out,
but they make us look like amateurs.

364
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,098
- Chuck, why are you doing dishes?
- Please. I'm a Bartowski.

365
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,266
This is what we do to deal with stress.

366
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,644
Okay, I can see that you're upset.

367
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,271
The Turners were
supposed to be our role models.

368
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,858
Instead, they turn out to be
coldhearted double-crossing traitors.

369
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,487
- Now you're never gonna move in.
- Chuck, we're not the Turners.

370
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,490
I know. But I liked the idea
that we could become them.

371
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,201
Right now, we really need
to focus on finding them.

372
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,704
Sarah, how? The Turners
have been spying for 30 years.

373
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:40,000
They've got dozens of aliases and
a million places they could disappear to.

374
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:44,505
Whatever beach they're on now, I hope
Mr. Turner's enjoying his Manhattan.

375
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,465
- The Grand Ambassador.
- What?

376
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,968
He said that was the only place
in Los Angeles...

377
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,096
...that had the right kind of cherries.

378
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,098
Hold on a second. Hold on.

379
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,308
You don't think they're still here,
do you?

380
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,728
Well, they might if they already
had a buyer for the software.

381
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,231
They picked the wrong couple
to stab in the back.

382
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,401
This is how I deal with stress.

383
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,697
Here we go.

384
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,621
Yes, she's gonna help you. Can you
take care of this lady? Thank you.

385
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,754
Hey, it's Chuck. Leave a message.

386
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:30,468
Hi. I don't know if you got
any of my other messages, Chuck.

387
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,346
I don't know. It's just kind of helping
me to talk them out over the machine.

388
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:38,434
I can't really talk to Devon about
anything. He's, like, born to be here.

389
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,853
Villagers love him,
have this nickname for him.

390
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,731
I can't pronounce it in Bantu,
but it translates...

391
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,984
...to
"Dr. Super Fantastic White Person."

392
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,695
I'm just tired.

393
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:54,325
I'm just tired, and I'll feel better
when I get some sleep.

394
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,495
Okay, I love you and I miss you.

395
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,954
I'll talk to you soon.

396
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,791
- Ellie.
- Yeah?

397
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,502
- How are you?
- Great.

398
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,754
If you ever need to talk, come to me.

399
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:11,675
- It's just one of my jobs.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

400
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,177
Good.

401
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,472
I'm not fine.

402
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,435
I have a little brother and we used
to camp out in our backyard.

403
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,438
I would pitch a tent
and make s'mores, the whole thing.

404
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,441
He'd fall asleep and I'd sneak inside
and set the alarm...

405
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,195
...and get in there
before he could wake up. I just...

406
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,991
- Justin, I'm not built for this.
- That's not true.

407
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,785
I've seen you with your patients.

408
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,954
You are built
for being a doctor here.

409
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:44,208
Now, it might take some time
to get used to the other stuff...

410
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,876
...but it's worth it.

411
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,463
The ears look clear.

412
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,215
This is my daughter.

413
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,803
- Thank you, Justin.
- You're welcome.

414
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,264
Mm.

415
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,516
I can get used to this.

416
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,603
You will, darling,
as soon as we make the sale.

417
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,523
Thirty years,
we always did what's right.

418
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,150
I keep thinking
of those poor, young agents.

419
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,696
- What a pair of saps.
- They reminded me of us.

420
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,614
I hope we didn't hurt their career.

421
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,742
They never had a career,
not with the CIA.

422
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,203
You saw how they looked
at each other.

423
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,581
They're obviously in love.

424
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,918
- And we're not?
- Oh, no, no, we're still in love.

425
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,421
A different sort of love.

426
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,382
It's just more like an old bourbon.

427
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,385
- So now I'm old?
- Aged to perfection, my dear.

428
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,512
What about that jailbait at the party?

429
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,598
You trying
to cork a younger vintage?

430
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,057
I see where you're going.

431
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,226
No, she was just part of the mission.

432
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,687
- A diversion.
- How many times have I heard that?

433
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,232
She was planning on having breast
surgery, and she asked my advice.

434
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,861
- You'd like to give her an operation.
- She was in awe of me. If not in love.

435
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,197
Room service.

436
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,033
Go ahead and leave it.

437
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,333
All clear.

438
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,299
"Compliments of the Bartowskis."

439
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,219
Darling, do you know any Bartowski?

440
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,641
How did you ever find us?

441
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,894
You're the only room
that ordered 12 Manhattans.

442
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,146
We learned from the best.

443
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,567
What? Are you kidding me?

444
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,154
Sig 229, nine millimeter,
13-round magazine.

445
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,157
Laser grip, full-metal jacket, sir.

446
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,993
- Impressive.
- I play a lot of first-person shooters.

447
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,913
Well, this isn't a video game. Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

448
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:53,045
Thank you. Okay, all right.
Here we go. No problem.

449
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,339
Morgan, you got this.
Like "Call of Duty."

450
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,758
Squeeze the trigger.

451
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,971
Oh! Holy cow! I think your gun
just exploded in my hand!

452
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,557
Sit down.
There's nothing wrong with the gun.

453
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,184
- Sit down.
- I think I should--

454
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,270
- Sit.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,067
You're firing me, aren't you?

456
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:19,571
Oh, my God. This is even worse than
when I got canned from Underpants, Etc.

457
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,198
It's not the end of the world.

458
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,535
Oh, come on. That's what
you all say when you fire me.

459
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,080
I blew it. I blew my one chance
to be a spy and the thing is, Casey...

460
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,833
...all I wanted to do
was be a part of this team.

461
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,210
Know how you feel.

462
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,922
You were there for me when
I was out on my ass with the agency.

463
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,217
I just want you to know
I'm here for you now.

464
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,220
Really?

465
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,682
Not just like spy or work or Buy More.
You mean like a friend.

466
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,020
Let's just keep that
on the down low, huh?

467
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,691
Done. But know something.
I've been canned from a lot of places...

468
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,236
...by a lot of people
and you were the best, sir.

469
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,906
Whew!

470
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,618
Let's not let ourselves
get carried away here, Charles.

471
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,913
I'm sorry, is that what you think?
That I'm getting carried away?

472
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,999
How did you think we would react?

473
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,960
What have we really done
at this point, Sarah?

474
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,881
We didn't sell Otto's software,
so technically, we're not yet traitors.

475
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,550
- Am I correct?
- It was his idea to steal it.

476
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,094
He forced me to act like a drunk
at the party.

477
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,930
I only wish his lecherous
Lothario routine was an act.

478
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,558
She's lying. I wanted
to bring the software back.

479
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,561
It was her idea to sell it
on the black market.

480
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,855
You can't lie to them.
You can lie to me.

481
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,108
- Your duplicity amazes me.
- Quiet!

482
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,736
Enough, okay?

483
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,782
It is one thing to betray your agency,
it is another to betray your partner.

484
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,619
You were supposed
to come here and teach us.

485
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,746
Teach us
how to be a great spy couple.

486
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,461
You really think we're that bad?

487
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,546
Only because you were once great,
yeah.

488
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:05,052
We were great, remember?

489
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,888
Check back with me in 30 years,
Charles.

490
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,141
The CIA has a way
of breaking young idealists.

491
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,519
Especially if they're in love.

492
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,610
Good, the marshals are here.

493
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,699
It's Otto.

494
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,834
And his pussycat.

495
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,013
How did your good friend Otto find us?

496
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,723
Did you two sell us out again?

497
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,519
The collar has a tracking device.

498
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,521
Where do you keep your backup guns?

499
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,774
Surely, you've heard
of the 30-foot rule, Charles.

500
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,734
Yeah.

501
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,654
Time to flash, time to flash.

502
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,202
No guns, no flash.
Honey, would you mind telling me...

503
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,162
...what you've done
with our weapons?

504
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,497
I got rid of them.

505
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,624
- You listened to me?
- I can't believe it.

506
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,127
- What have you done with the gun?
- I left them.

507
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,296
- Why would you?
- Because you told me to.

508
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,840
- Rookies.
- Take care of them.

509
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,342
I'll take care of Otto.

510
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,888
You're making a big mistake.

511
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,308
Hi, how you doing? Good Lord.

512
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,146
Sorry to drop in on you like this.

513
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,817
Sasha always feels at home
wherever she goes.

514
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,861
You don't mind
if she looks around?

515
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,991
- What...? What's going on?
- Who are you people?

516
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,826
You know exactly who I am.

517
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,661
The question is, who are you?

518
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,914
Wait a minute. You're the guy.

519
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,584
Baby, this is the guy
with the mansion up in the hills.

520
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,502
Oh, I told you this would happen.

521
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,714
I'm so sorry. My boyfriend
thinks that it's really funny...

522
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,549
...to crash rich people's parties.

523
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:11,219
- Where are the two agents you're hiding?
- I'm sorry, what?

524
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,181
I believe you know them
as Mr. and Mrs. Turner.

525
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,934
I'm a little confused here.

526
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,227
Why would CIA agents
be in our apartment?

527
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,229
Because this isn't a real apartment.

528
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,523
This is a CIA safe house.

529
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,027
And you two are not a real couple.

530
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,612
You are spies.

531
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,531
Ah...

532
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,534
I'm on to you.
This is a practical joke, isn't it?

533
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:38,413
I bet this is from your brother.
Okay, you're a spy, honey. We're spies.

534
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,374
- Scary spies.
- I've always felt...

535
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,709
- ...I've got a James Bondy thing.
- You do.

536
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,712
- You could be Octopussy or something.
- Oh, yeah.

537
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,589
Now you're being really insulting.

538
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,466
Listen, whoever you are...

539
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,887
...all I ask
is that you hand over the Turners.

540
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,766
You have until the count of drei.

541
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,604
Stop.
Please stop with the countdown.

542
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,942
If I could just have a brief sidebar
with my girlfriend, that would be great.

543
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,444
Good. Thanks.

544
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,115
These guys really take it seriously.
Ha-ha.

545
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,909
This is very good. Very real.
I say we hand them over.

546
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,786
- We can't do that.
- They sold us out.

547
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,621
We'd be no better than the Turners.

548
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,000
Maybe we're gonna end up
just like them, a couple of traitors.

549
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,252
Do you really believe that?

550
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,008
No.

551
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,598
I'm sorry, sir. But I really--
I don't think we can help you.

552
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,267
I'm sorry to hear that.

553
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,647
- Guard them.
- Yeah, I don't think...

554
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,025
...that kitty litter box is big enough.

555
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,320
Good girl, Sasha. Take her outside.

556
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,290
- Sure you're all right?
- Yeah.

557
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,002
Espionage wasn't my aspiration.
I can join the competitive eating circuit.

558
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,171
Well, dare to dream.

559
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,139
The Turners are very clever.

560
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,476
- It appears the guests left in a hurry.
- This is unbelievable.

561
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,895
The Turners have left us
holding the bag again?

562
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,981
I can assure you
this will be the last time.

563
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,485
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Otto.
The Turners have betrayed us both.

564
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,653
That means that we're all
on the same side.

565
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:37,324
Put your guns down, and let us
help you hunt down those bastards.

566
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,743
They're the lowest of the low, okay?
CIA scum.

567
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,829
Let them go, Otto.

568
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,957
But they're not
without their moments.

569
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,502
What the hell is this?

570
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,758
What is it, Casey? What?

571
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,513
Bengal tiger. Female.

572
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,473
Fully grown.

573
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,602
Avoid eye contact. If she charges...

574
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,854
...make yourself as big as possible.

575
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,356
Easy for you to say.

576
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,192
It's us you want.
We've got the software.

577
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,111
What are you two doing?

578
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,196
Showing you we're not traitors,
Charles.

579
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,075
- What should we do?
- Shh. You're gonna get us killed.

580
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,493
No.

581
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,457
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Just hear me out.

582
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,418
This country needs men like you, Casey.
Okay?

583
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,213
What do I do? I sell refrigerators.
You know, I mean...

584
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,049
...if I die, what, they'll shop
at Large Mart. Big deal.

585
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,802
But there is a way
I can serve my country.

586
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,721
- What are you doing?
- I'm luring the tiger.

587
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,223
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

588
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,724
No matter what you hear in there...

589
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,186
...promise me you will not go in after me.
Semper Fidizzle!

590
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,900
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty.

591
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,074
Sasha.

592
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,142
Okay.

593
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,437
- Told you I was good for something.
- Yeah. Move.

594
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,359
We have to bring you in.
You know I can't let you go.

595
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,777
That's funny.

596
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,113
I would have said
the same thing 30 years ago.

597
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,532
After what we did,
you would have shot us dead.

598
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,076
Which would be perfectly
justifiable.

599
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,959
And yet unnecessary.
Wouldn't you agree, Sarah?

600
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,588
After all, they did save us.

601
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,469
Sorry, darling.

602
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,305
It's over.

603
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,644
It's okay.

604
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,152
Good work, team.

605
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,490
Our cryptographers are analyzing
Otto's software as we speak.

606
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,493
Thanks to you, our nation's
communications network...

607
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,828
- ...remains secure.
- Thank you, general.

608
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:33,250
And now, on to the subject
of the Turners and their actions.

609
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,419
Actually, if I might say
something on behalf of the Turners--

610
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,338
- General.
- No, Sarah. I think I--

611
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,173
No, Chuck. It's okay. I got it.

612
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,926
The Turner's double-cross
was actually a triple-cross.

613
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,763
By stealing the software from us,
they were able to lure Otto into a trap.

614
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,141
And we were able to capture him.
It was a daring bit of spy craft.

615
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,103
I would expect nothing less
from the Turners.

616
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,356
I hope you and Agent Bartowski
were able to learn something...

617
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,109
...from these two
exemplary operatives.

618
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,528
As a matter of fact, general,
yes, working...

619
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:06,950
- ...with the Turners was quite humbling.
- You must be ready to move on...

620
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,328
- ...to your next assignment.
- Thanks, but no thanks, general.

621
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:13,623
- Excuse me?
- No more assignments.

622
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,627
What my husband means to say is,
we're retiring.

623
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,879
But you can't just walk away.

624
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,881
You are the best of the best.

625
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,509
Who will possibly take your place?

626
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,056
You...? Are you sure? Really?

627
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,267
I mean, thank you.

628
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,480
Watch each other's backs, you two.

629
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,025
And I wish you many happy marriages.

630
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,356
Tell me Chuck is joking
about sending me to boot camp.

631
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,733
Because they're gonna
make me shave my beard.

632
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,943
Relax. You passed.

633
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,280
- I failed every test.
- Yeah, with flying colors.

634
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,699
You have got to be hands down,
bar none...

635
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,202
...the worst candidate
I've ever trained.

636
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,704
But you've got one thing
going for you.

637
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,414
You got balls.

638
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,459
- I do?
- How many Marines you know...

639
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,212
- ...would go up against a tiger unarmed?
- Yeah.

640
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,047
You'd have to be
a complete idiot.

641
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,966
Well, that's the thing.
You know, that's me in a nutshell.

642
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,261
Lesser men, yeah, they'd run away
from danger, and I'm...

643
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,641
Casey?

644
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,441
Dude.

645
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:07,278
You turned my sister's apartment
into a kitty litter box.

646
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,738
I know. I'm sorry, man.

647
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,574
How was I supposed to know
the tiger wasn't housebroken?

648
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,328
Oh, my God.

649
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:19,082
You're here. We gotta get this fixed up
before Devon and Ellie get back.

650
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,252
Well, actually, I was gonna start
with our place.

651
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,172
Our place?

652
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,510
That is, if your offer
for me to move in still stands?

653
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,012
Yeah.

654
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:38,017
I'm sorry that I freaked out when
you asked me to move in with you.

655
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,936
It's just, you know how I grew up.

656
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,814
I spent my life
living in hotel rooms under fake names.

657
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,650
I've been trained
to survive a thousand situations...

658
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,945
...but nobody ever taught me
how to have a normal life.

659
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:54,784
I hate to break it to you, but I don't
think we're ever gonna live a normal life.

660
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,955
Well, I'd like to have something
to fall back on when our spy life is over.

661
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,923
Devon, sweetie, where are you?

662
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,552
Devon?

663
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,304
Baby?

664
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,640
Baby, you're burning up.

665
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,893
I'll be right back. Help!

666
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,984
Sorry, El. I Thought
we could do some good work here.

667
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:32,071
You do not apologize. Now it's my job
to take care of you, okay?

668
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,534
- Thank you.
- I alerted the airport.

669
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,163
There's an ambulance waiting.
You can drive straight onto the tarmac.

670
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,414
Thank you.

671
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,459
- Your husband's gonna be fine.
- I know, I know.

672
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,754
I just can't believe we're leaving.

673
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,215
There are plenty of ways
you can help back home.

674
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,675
- Take care.
- All right. Feel better.

675
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,109
They just left.

676
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:14,030
I took care of the husband.
Made it look like malaria.

677
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,573
She doesn't suspect a thing.
